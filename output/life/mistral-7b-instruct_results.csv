Determine how much house you can afford: Before starting to save for a house, it's important to figure out how much house you can afford. You can do this by calculating your debt-to-income ratio and your income after taxes.

3. Save for a down payment: A down payment is the amount of money you pay upfront when buying a house. Typically, a down payment is 20% of the purchase price.
4. Consider private mortgage insurance: If you don't have a 20% down payment, you may need to consider private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI protects the lender in case you default on your mortgage.

6. Research first-time homebuyer programs: There are various programs available to first-time homebuyers that can help with down payments, closing costs, and other expenses.
7. Get pre-approved for a mortgage: A pre-approval letter shows that you have been pre-approved by a lender for a mortgage of a certain amount. This can help you when making an offer on a house.
8. Work with a real estate agent: A real estate agent can help you find the right house, negotiate the price, and navigate the home-buying process."," Based on your background and query, it seems like you are a young and recently married woman on disability with a low income and high stress levels.

Additionally, it may be a good idea to focus on building a strong support network and taking time for self-care activities to help manage your stress levels.

In terms of saving for a house and building credit, there are a few key steps you can take:

1. Create a budget: Determine how much money you can realistically save each month and create a budget that includes all necessary expenses, such as rent or mortgage payments, utilities, and groceries.

2. Build an emergency fund: It's important to have an emergency fund in case of unexpected expenses or job loss. Aim to save at least three to six months' worth of living expenses.

3. Pay off high-interest debt: If you have any high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, it's important to pay it off as quickly as possible. This will free up more money for savings and help you build credit more effectively.

4. Build credit by making on-time payments: Paying your bills on time, even if it's just a small amount, can help build your credit history and improve your credit score.

5. Look into special home-buying costs: There are many special costs associated with buying a home, such as closing costs, down payment, and home inspection fees. It's important to research these costs and factor them into your budget to ensure that you are prepared for the financial commitment of homeownership.
