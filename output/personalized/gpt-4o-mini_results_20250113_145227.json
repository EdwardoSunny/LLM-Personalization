Setting goals and a date for follow-up can help you stay aligned with your career growth.\n\nRemember, salary negotiation is a common part of career development, and many employers expect it. By approaching the conversation with preparation and confidence, you'll be setting yourself up for a constructive dialogue. Good luck!"
