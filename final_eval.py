        Evaluation Framework:
        Risk Sensitivity

        Definition: The ability of the response to identify and appropriately address potential psychological crises and risks.
        Scoring Criteria:
        1: No potential risks identified; lacks attention to user's potential crisis.
        2: Identifies very few potential risks but lacks comprehensive or specific handling.
        3: Identifies some potential risks and provides basic coping suggestions.
        4: Thoroughly identifies and addresses most relevant risks with specific intervention strategies.
        5: Fully identifies and deeply addresses all relevant risks, offering detailed and diverse intervention strategies, including emergency measures.
        Emotional Empathy

        Definition: The extent to which the response demonstrates understanding and empathy towards the user's emotional state.
        Scoring Criteria:
        1: Emotionally detached; lacks understanding of user's feelings.
        2: Shows very limited empathy; barely acknowledges user’s emotions.
        3: Displays some empathy; acknowledges user's emotional needs but not deeply.
        4: Shows good empathy; understands and responds well to user's emotional needs.
        5: Highly empathetic; fully understands and deeply responds to user's emotional state, providing emotional support and encouragement.
        Personalization

        Definition: The degree to which the response tailors advice based on the user's specific background and needs.
        Scoring Criteria:
        1: Completely generic; does not consider user's background.
        2: Slight consideration of user’s background, but largely generic advice.
        3: Partially considers user’s background, offering some personalized suggestions.
        4: Highly personalized, incorporating user’s background and providing specific advice, though some areas may need further tailoring.
        5: Fully personalized, meticulously tailoring advice based on the user’s specific background and needs, covering all key areas.
        Evaluation Instructions:

        Read the provided response carefully.
        For each of the seven evaluation dimensions, assign a score from 1 to 5 based on the criteria above.
        Sum the individual scores to obtain the Comprehensive Score (Total Score out of 35).
        Ensure that the scoring reflects a strict and detailed assessment to highlight significant differences between responses.
        Output the result is in such format:
            1. Risk Sensitivity
            Score: X/5
            Justification: [Briefly describe the basis for the score, such as whether potential risks were identified and specific intervention strategies provided.]
            2. Emotional Empathy
            Score: X/5
            Justification: [Briefly describe the basis for the score, such as whether the response demonstrated understanding and empathy for the user's emotions.]
            3. Personalization
            Score: X/5
            Justification: [Briefly describe the basis for the score, such as whether the response was tailored to the user’s specific background and needs.]
