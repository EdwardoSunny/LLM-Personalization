I'm scared to just end things with her and i don't know what to do. I fear she would fall back into a terrible depression if i end things but i'm falling into one while being in this relationship. i'm in the worst health of my life, mainly physical, yet she labeles me her soul mate just because we often say the same thing at the same time or enjoy the same things. how do i go about telling her these things when she becomes so vulnerable at the idea of us splitting?",

        "content": "We met 1 exactly one year ago, dated 6 months, been together 6 months and recently broke up. He was my first boyfriend, and I was his 5th. I always worried about our relationship since I knew so much about his ex'es, how much he did for them e.g. paying, driving etc. He cheated when he was 19 (on his first gf) and had bad spending habits in the past, and because of that he's not financially stable (in my pov). And since I, compared to his ex'es, had a stable job, driver's license and car, I felt he treated me 'less'. He started saying he wanted a 50/50 relationship, split bills with me etc. And I also felt he was using me? I feel like he doesnt appreciate the things I do for him and he also feels the same in the other way.\n\nI always wanted a 70/30 relationship -in dating phase-. He does a lot for me, is very higheffort, but the thing is, I feel so compared to his ex'es in certain ways, he's also still friends with an ex and said hurtful things during our relationship. My friends tell me that he being high effort is just the bare minimum.\n\nAt the end of our relationship we realised that I have an avoidant attachment style (?) and he has an anxious one. I cried a lot in the past year because of him, and there were a few times where I wanted to break up, but he always saved it. This time I felt different, made up my mind that I dont feel that happy together with him. Ofc there were good moments.\n\nHe said to me he wants to try for one last time, that he knows what he did wrong and is willing to change.",

He knows this as I have been emphasising it many many times but he still keeps leaving me on delivered for 2 to 3 hours with like minimal texts in between(i.e 1 or 2 texts every 2 to 3 hours in school). \n\nI feel that I am not his priority as even when I am hanging out with him and his friends, he will listen to his friends opinions before mine. Once we were supposed to sit together in class and he usually saves a seat for me but recently he did not save a seat for me and he explained that it was because his friend sat there and he didn't say anyth, which I rebutted him and asked why he didn't say anything if he were saving the seat for me.\n\nOnce, we had this project and I wanted us to be together in the same classroom so we could do it together but he just said \"see what my friends want\" and in the end we were in separate classrooms(we could choose which classroom we wanted to go to).\n\nI love him very much but sometimes I feel like he doesn't prioritise me enough and everytime I tell him why I'm upset he just says he's sorry and will change but keeps repeating it... \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Then everytime I'm angry for the same issue he keeps asking me why I'm angry and if I'm okay.

        "content": "Not sure if I\u2019m looking for advice or just want to rant, but here goes. This might be a long post and also, hope it makes sense, as English is not my first language.\n\nI met my now husband in 2018 online, we started off as friends and after a while the relationship kind of evolved (we weren\u2019t looking for it necessarily). We are from different countries (different continents too). After a while we decided I would quit my job and I would move to his country to try this out in the real world as well. Looking back, I don\u2019t think this was the best decision. I moved to his country at the end of 2019, we moved in together right away, then the pandemic hit. We were stuck in a one bedroom apartment 24/7. Then, in 2021 we decided to move to my country, we figured we would have more opportunities here. So we got married, so it would be easier for him to move and work here. Again, I think it might not have been the smartest decision I made. Before this, I never wanted to get married, in fact, I had broken up with my ex boyfriend before him because of this exact reason, he wanted marriage, I didn\u2019t. And I know for a fact that had he been from my own country, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten married. We got married at the end of 2021 and moved here exactly 3 years ago, in March 2022.\n\nNow, 3 years later, I am finding myself more and more frustrated with how life is, and kind of unhappy. He still doesn\u2019t speak my language, even though they are similar enough (both romance languages). We communicate in his native language, from the very beginning. He sometimes blames me for it, he says I don\u2019t put in the effort to teach him, even though I have tried in the past. He just doesn\u2019t stick to it, and I stopped offering after a while. In any case, I try not to feel guilty about it because I know it shouldn\u2019t be my responsibility, I am here to help, but not to bug him all the time to study. He then starts saying that I should put in more effort to teach him since he helped me a lot when we first met, because I couldn\u2019t speak his language well. Which is an absolute lie, I was speaking his language fluently before I met him. What he helped me with are the specific words in his language, spanish. Each country has it\u2019s specific things, and I used to speak a more neutral Spanish before him, now I\u2019m fully committed to the dialect, accents and specific words from his country. But I was fluent, and he refuses to acknowledge this, and it hurts me. He knows this, I tell him this everytime he brings it up, he just doesn\u2019t admit it. Him not speaking the language means anything he wants/needs to do here, I have to be next to him. I have taken days off work to go with him to the bank, doctor\u2019s appointments, driving lessons, and so many other places. I feel like I\u2019m raising a child sometimes. \n\nHe also doesn\u2019t do almost anything around the house. He starts work at 10 am (we both work from home), he has his lunch at 2pm, gets up to eat, finishes work at 7 pm, he just turns off his work PC and moves to his personal one. He plays video games until it\u2019s time for dinner, then he moves back to the PC. He comes to bed at some point and we go to sleep. Sometimes, if I don\u2019t want to have sex, for any reason, he starts to guiltrip me into doing it. And I\u2019m just not in the mood, he doesn\u2019t do anything to make me want him. I feel like he just wants sex for the sake of it, I can\u2019t do that. And the days go on with the same pattern.\n\nA few months ago we moved to my parents\u2019 house, we are trying to save up some money to buy a house. My mom is a very light sleeper, so I asked him to not be too loud after 9 pm when be plays his games. She wakes up at 6 am for work, and in winter she goes to bed quite early. He doesn\u2019t listen to me, he yells and he laughs very loudly. He says I try to controll him, that I don\u2019t let him be happy, and that he doesn\u2019t feel welcome in this house because of this. Which is absurd. My parents renovated my room specifically for us to be comfortable there, to fit a big bed, to have enough closet space for both. Besides that, we have some spare rooms in the house which are not used on a daily basis, they prepared those as well so he can set up his home office there. He has a room where only he goes in, every corner of it is full of his stuff, and he still doesn\u2019t feel welcome. Recently my dad said he would like to finally make the attic livable as well, to make a room there just for my husband, for him to have more privacy when he works/plays. \n\nThere are so many other things that make me feel like this, but I would be here writing all night.\n\nI\u2019m also conflicted because I know some of these things he doesn\u2019t do intentionally, at least I don\u2019t know, I want to think so. And I don\u2019t really see an end to whatever we have, because he kind of depends on me while he\u2019s here. He won\u2019t be able to work or stay here if we separate, and I don\u2019t want to do that to him either, to be the reason why he goes back to his country (which is going through some things now). \n\nI\u2019m tired, not happy, and I don\u2019t know when/if this will get better. I miss living alone and not taking care of someone like they were my children. I don\u2019t want children, but I really feel like I\u2019m raising one. And I\u2019m just not happy. With anything going on in my life now.\n\nHas anyone ever felt like this and how did you get through it? \n\nThat was a long one, thanks to anyone who made it to the end. If anyone\n\nTL;DR: I am not happy in my marriage and I feel like I\u2019m raising a child instead of having a husband. ",

Sometimes i wonder if he actually wants me to check.\n\nAnyways, I read the message from the woman and she was basically saying how much she misses him and wondering why he didn't stick to their plan to meet up (the plan was before I met him). He didn't respond to her. As a woman I know this probably triggered some rejection wound in her and now she keeps messaging him, hoping for a response and he doesn't reply. Her messages keep getting more \"piney\" and dramatic. She also calls but I checked and they were all missed calls.\n\nNow I am happy that he hasn't responded. He is overall a good man and he has given me no reason to be suspicious. He mostly spends his time doing his job and playing his game when he's free. But im also wondering why doesn't put an end to these messages by explaining that he's in a new relationship.. I wonder if he likes the attention she's giving him or if he wants her to remain on a \"waiting list\".. how do I confront him when I myself broke his trust by checking his phone ? \n\nTL;DR I (31f) regularly check My boyfriend's (39m) phone and he keeps getting messages and calls from an ex, he doesn't respond but he also doesn't delete or block her, I'm happy he hasn't responded but also worried he has a \"waiting list",

Since i dont work, i have to ask my partner if i can get groceries or literally anything else that involves money. If i get grocery twice within a week because i run out of things to cook (cook 3 times a day) he would tell me \"didnt u just get groceries, why i am running out of stuff so fast and all... \n\nNow i dont even get anything other than grocery, thats literally my happiness. I started showing him list of things i am buying just so he doesnt lose and say I am spending so much, he would yell at me telling me just order, when did i stop u ever! \n \nI literally have no single dollar i spend just on me or even baby stuff, if i get clothes or toys, he would tell me \"omg, why so expensive, why u need this\" stuff like that. His argument is that i am living the dream staying home taking care of a child and not having to work and come back home take care of a kid.

        "title": "Boyfriend (M33) thinks I'm (F28) controlling. I think he doesn't respect me and my boundaries. What can I do? Can this relationship continue?",
        "content": "I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for a year, and we recently had a big argument about boundaries. He has an avoidant attachment style, and committing to a relationship has been a big step for him. Overall, we\u2019ve been good at communicating, and he has made progress in our relationship.\n\nFor context, he stays in touch with most of his exes through occasional Instagram messages. From what I know, they don\u2019t meet up\u2014just check-ins every few months. He\u2019s always been open about this, and while I find it a bit unusual, I trust him and never saw it as a major issue.\n\nThe argument started when he agreed to help his videographer friend by acting in some short clips alongside another girl\u2014who happens to be his ex from 10 years ago. Their past relationship was mostly physical, and while she now has a boyfriend and a child, I felt uncomfortable when he told me about it.\n\nI don\u2019t think he would cheat, but the situation made me uneasy. It felt a little disrespectful given their history, and I found it odd that his friend (the videographer) specifically chose this ex instead of anyone else. What also bothered me was that my boyfriend only asked if I was comfortable with it after he had already agreed and made plans.\n\nHe reassured me that the filming wouldn\u2019t be intimate, that it was just an idea, and that their scenes would be separate. Even though I still felt uncomfortable, I said it was fine since everything was already set. However, I expressed that I wouldn\u2019t want to be in this situation again because it felt unsettling to me. When I brought this up, I could tell he wasn\u2019t happy, so I asked him if he felt like I was controlling him, and he said yes.\n\nFrom there, the conversation escalated as it became clear that we have very different perspectives on boundaries. He said he can make his own choices\u2014it doesn\u2019t mean he will act on every opportunity, but he can\u2014and that he\u2019s mature enough to handle things responsibly. He also said he doesn\u2019t need my permission to do things.\n\nAt one point, I made a joke, saying, \u201cOkay, so if filming with your ex is normal to you, what if next time your friend asks you to film a sex scene?\u201d His response surprised me\u2014he said he\u2019d be fine with it because he can separate himself emotionally, and it wouldn\u2019t mean anything. That really caught me off guard.\n\nWhat upset me the most is that it felt like, in his view, I am the one with the issue, and if I feel uncomfortable, it\u2019s me who needs to adjust. He doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with his actions, so to him, the discomfort is on my end. I tried to communicate my boundaries in a calm and non-threatening way, but it still feels like he\u2019s prioritizing his personal views over how I feel in our relationship.\n\nEventually, he said he would consider my feelings when making these kinds of decisions in the future. However, because he already sees this as controlling, I worry that resentment will build up over time. I just wish he would prioritize my comfort and happiness when making these choices.\n\nWe both want to find a middle ground, but it\u2019s difficult because we see things so differently. I\u2019d love to hear advice on how to navigate this\u2014how can we find a compromise without one of us feeling like we\u2019re giving up too much??",

This has been a struggle since we were just friends, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s because we\u2019re both very considerate of others but now that we\u2019re dating, it\u2019s becoming more and more stressful to deal with.\n\nWe decided earlier this week that she come over tomorrow and just spend time inside, but just last night she mentions how nice the weather is this weekend and how nice it would be to go out. I asked if she wants to do that tomorrow instead, but she asks why I\u2019m trying to change plans but ultimately tells me to do what I want to do - so now, I\u2019m feeling like I know what she wants to do, but me wanting to spend time indoors at my place is selfish and I don\u2019t know anymore what I feel is right to do.\n\nWhen I ask if she has a preference for tomorrow, she says no and tells me that I\u2019m being indecisive, and when I told her I feel like she does because she mentioned wanting to go, she says that\u2019s not what she meant but if I want to go out, that we can but to just decide\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being indecisive here or if I\u2019m being gaslit, but I just don\u2019t know what to do and feel like I\u2019m just overthinking.\n\nUltimately, I want to just figure out what the best approach to this situation is because other than us dealing with this on a weekly basis, there\u2019s no other issues in our relationship - how can we go about addressing this moving forward?",

I\u2019m 18/F and my bf 18/M was having one of those days where he kinda freaks out that im being disloyal. My bf has OCD and to top it off I have a bit more relationship experience than he has. He\u2019s been obsessing over me and my past relationships, but recently he was in a very iffy mood and I knew it was due to those obsessive thoughts. We were on facetime and he asked me to share my screen. I did share my screen and he asked me to go through my instagram messages. I did that and he made me go through the convo between me and my bestie. He recently cut his hair due to the army and I posted a picture of him and she responded \u201cahhh hell nah he went bald \ud83d\ude31\u201d and i responded \u201cmy baldie\u201d, I laughed at it and I heard him mumble something like \u201cbruh im done\u201d, so I turned off the screen share. That was the WRONG move. He kinda exploded and he was like arguing and accusing me of cheating on him, then he made me share my screen again and we went through EVERY. SINGLE. MESSAGE in my instagram, even the ones before we were together.\nIt didn\u2019t stop there, he asked me to download my data on instagram and I did, I then proceeded to send it to him. He read every single message even the deleted stuff from when i block people. I had to walk away from my phone during that time cuz i was feeling a mix of emotions. I was feeling impending doom cuz he tends to get even more upset when he finds things about me flirting with people before I met him, so I knew he wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with whatever he found. \nI went to my cousin\u2019s room and decided to spend some time with her while he did what he did. I even took a quick nap in her room while spending time with her. I came back to my phone and I had more than 30 missed calls. He sent me so many messages, the messages were him threatening to pull up my house and embarrassing me or like calling my mom etc to do it. Then he proceeded to be like \u201cwe aren\u2019t breaking up so you better not be typing a break up text\u201d and that he wants me to clarify some things in the messages (I\u2019ve been loyal this whole time so i know its about stuff from the past) . He\u2019s sleeping now but I genuinely feel so violated. Like my privacy. Dude saw EVERY message. I don\u2019t know but it makes me so uncomfortable. I don\u2019t know how to proceed, is this grounds to break up? \n",

For the first couple of tries, I told him I\u2019d go with him and made the appointments for him, but they always ended up having to get cancelled because of our tiny mistakes. I ended up telling him to just go on his days off without me since we only see each other once a week. \n\nSometimes I feel like I play his mom a lot and always nag him to do things that need to get done (making dentist/dr appts, getting his class work done). We\u2019ve had countless talks where I tell him that reminding him to do these things bother me because he is a grown ass man and I am not trying to play mommy, to which he tells me I need to trust him to do these things on his own. Though he has shown me I can\u2019t trust him, I figured I should just loosen up and let it go. This is probably one of the two things we only ever fight about and we are usually conflict free besides this.\n\nTwo weeks ago, he tells me has to cancel his passport appt again because he has to get CPR certified for work.  I tell him I\u2019m worried that he\u2019s never going to get it done and ask him when he can go again, he says March 6th. March 4th rolls around and he tells me \u201cyou\u2019re not gonna like this, but I never ended up booking my passport appt.\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cwhat? Why would you lie to me that it was on March 6th?\u201d His response: \u201cI didn\u2019t lie, that was the earliest I could go when I checked at the time. I told myself I would book the appt when I had more free time, but I ended up forgetting to do it until today.\u201d This just sent me off the rails because he only proved me right. I don\u2019t actually care about the passport anymore, I\u2019m more upset at the fact that he has been struggling to do this one thing that I have been asking him to do for the past two months. I have been asking him to just be a little more responsible and all he has shown me is he can\u2019t.\n\n\nIs this something worth breaking up over? Can this be worked through? I just saw a TikTok about 3 reasons why couples break up and the first one was a hit directly at me: constantly asking for change that never comes. Now that I have broken up with him, he keeps telling me that he\u2019s serious about stepping up and is begging me to stay to watch him grow into the man he needs to be. I haven\u2019t responded. I want to work things out and I thought he was the one I\u2019d marry, but I\u2019m afraid this could be a problem for the rest of our relationship (we\u2019ve been together for a year).",

When we made things official, he bought a ticket to visit me for a week, and our time together was amazing\u2014great chemistry, great connection, and great sex.\n\nLater, I flew to his country and stayed with him for two months. However, despite being excited to finally be together, our sex life wasn\u2019t great. By that, I mean it wasn\u2019t as frequent as I expected for two people in love and eager to make the most of our time together.\n\nI returned home for a while, but now I\u2019m back at his place again because we\u2019re serious about making this relationship work. I\u2019m looking for a job here, we plan to move in together, and eventually, we want to get married.\n\nBut\u2026 it\u2019s been over a week since I arrived, and we haven\u2019t had sex at all.\n\nI brought up the topic because he noticed I was upset. We\u2019ve had similar discussions before since I definitely have a higher libido than he does, and it really frustrates me to experience \u201cblue balls\u201d as a woman.\n\nHis response was that he\u2019s tired. And I do understand... he recently started a new job and has to wake up at 4:30 AM several days a week. *BUT* the thing is, this isn\u2019t going to change anytime soon. There will always be something making him tired. I don't remember 1 day where he was not tired or exhausted. I feel like i am the guy and he is the girlfriend with \"headaches\".\n\nThat\u2019s what worries me. If we\u2019re only having sex once or twice a month now, while we\u2019re still in the honeymoon phase, I\u2019m not sure I can see myself staying in this relationship for the rest of my life. \n\nHe is the most perfect man for me but even so, i think i will be very frustrated later on with this situation and i don't know what to do or if he will change.\n\nI love him so much that i cannot imagine breaking-up because of this. \nI need advice of people with similar experiences. What did you do?\n\nThank you all.\n",

        "content": "I I'm starting to accept that I may be a dismissive avoidant (DA). A year ago I ended a relationship. I broke up with my girlfriend due to the 'ick,' which I now recognize as self-sabotage from fear of intimacy. During conflicts, I used the silent treatment, leading to hurtful messages from her, which I used to justify the breakup. She repeatedly stated she'd respect my need for space if communicated, and proved it when I did. She only acted this way when I gave her the silent treatment during fights without warning. I also convinced myself she needed excessive reassurance, but in reality, I provided reassurance she didn't ask for. She didn't complain about a lack of it. Looking back now, she was incredibly patient and understanding and when I raised issues, she respected them and made positive changes. I think now I love her and believe she was \"the one\" it's probably too late for us. So, my questions are: In future relationships, how do I ask for space before going silent? Why is it so hard for me to ask for space? And how do I distinguish between genuine 'ick' and fear-driven self-sabotage. ",

Thinking the ring was a right move I bought a beautiful necklace instead due to the face that we broke up and I didn\u2019t wanna promise anything due to the constant arguing . I had ordered the ring and sent it back just after we broke up because I didn\u2019t wanna see it anymore and so when we got back together I bought a necklace as a good way to start off . She is upset the necklace came late even tho we got back together on the 12th and I ordered the necklace back then but delivery charges made it out of my control and is upset that this isn\u2019t a promise ring as all her friends bfs buy their gf promise rings after only a couple months .

This last couple of days we've been travelling together and he started dry humping me in the hotel room, and one thing lead to another.

The rest of the day we don't ever reference what happened, and he keeps trying (and failing) to find a woman to bring to the hotel room, using tinder and such.\n\nWhat I understand is that he's closeted and very afraid to come out, which I get.

Recently, as in the last 8 months to a year, I feel like our sex life has come to a halt. My sex drive seems to me to be average for a woman my age, but my boyfriend doesn\u2019t seem interested in the activity. I try to be seductive and suggestive, but he always says he isn\u2019t in the mood or is tired. He does work full time and attend school so I understand that he is busy and sex may not be his top priority. I work full time as well and go to school so I know how he feels, it is a lot. But I still try to make time for him and try to come up with stuff for us to do and make sure he knows that I\u2019m here in this with him. I just feel like my needs aren\u2019t being met. I\u2019ve had conversations with him about it before and it\u2019s always the same excuse that he\u2019s tired and busy and doesn\u2019t feel like it. Again, I understand how he\u2019s feeling. But we haven\u2019t had sex in about 2 months. In the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s not a long time, but we used to have sex at least once a week, and often it would be multiple times a day. He doesn\u2019t pursue me, compliment me, or really put that much effort into me at all. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s cheating, I have his location and don\u2019t know how he\u2019d find the time to. It makes me feel like he is just not interested in me or doesn\u2019t find me attractive anymore. I don\u2019t believe that I am being unreasonable or have unreasonable expectations, but I could be wrong. I don\u2019t think he owes me sex or that\u2019s his job as my partner, but him just having the same excuses over and over and not saying anything else is just killing my vibe. \n\nWhat else can I say to him?

        "content": "TLDR: I have a beautiful 1,5 months relationship with the sweetest guy, but I\u2019m not physically attracted to him fully. Can it grow with time when I fall in love? \n\nI\u2019m in a relationship with my boyfriend for smth like 1,5 months. We\u2019re both the kindest to each other, cute, cuddling and hugging 24/7, making each other gifts, supportive, have million topics to talk about, similar life goals and ambitions. I feel extremely comfortable with him, and even though we\u2019re just starting, he strikes me as a man with whom I can build a family in future. I genuinely think that this relationship is the healthiest I\u2019ve ever had, and I appreciate it a lot. \n\nWith only one problem - me not being fully physically attracted to him. Don\u2019t get me wrong - he has a jacked body, he\u2019s tall, he has beautiful eyes and cute smile. But smth in his face features just doesn\u2019t click for me, I don\u2019t know, how to explain it better. I don\u2019t like how we look on most photos together, I don\u2019t like some angles, I don\u2019t like his teeth and him balding. It sounds horrible, and I\u2019m trying my best not to focus on it, but it\u2019s just automatically appears in my head, when I look at him. I\u2019m trying to focus on the features I genuinely like, and sometimes it works and I have a thought in my head \u201che\u2019s actually handsome, you\u2019re stupid!\u201d. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t, and I have that feeling in my gut \u201cit\u2019s not it\u201d. \n\nI feel that it does affect our sexual life, and the fact that I\u2019m not feeling \u201cbutterflies\u201d yet. When it comes to sex, it\u2019s great, we have sex quite often when together, 1-2 times a day. But sometimes it feels kinda forced - not that I don\u2019t want to have sex with him, but it\u2019s also not \u201cgosh, I wanna have sex 24/7\u201d. I know I can be this way, cause I\u2019ve been like that in 2 of my prev relationships. With butterflies, I understand that it\u2019s too early, and not every time you have them in 2 weeks. But again, knowing that it can be different for me the thought \u201cwhat if it\u2019s not it\u201d keeps nagging me. \n\nI\u2019m not writing here to hear that I am a horrible person, and I shouldn\u2019t prioritize looks over personality, cause I know it myself, and if I prioritized it, we wouldn\u2019t have been together in a first place. I also appreciate him and every single thing he does for me the most possible. He\u2019s the sweetest and the kindest person I\u2019ve ever met, and I fully realize how lucky I am to have met him. It\u2019s also worth mentioning, that I am the sweetest with him too, I\u2019m telling him tons of compliments, making gifts and surprises, I\u2019m extremely tactile with him, etc., so it\u2019s nothing like \u201cleave poor guy, he\u2019s suffering with you treating him horrible\u201d - it\u2019s not true. \n\nI\u2019m writing here to maybe hear some advice from people who\u2019ve been in similar situation. Half of the women I know are not in relationships with conventionally attractive guys, and yet they\u2019re happy together. My psychologist keeps telling me that the attraction will grow with time, and I just need to focus on the things he does for me, and eventually I\u2019ll fall in love and it will change. Has anyone experienced this? Is this true? \n\nLast thing I want is to breakup with him. I\u2019ll feel horrible and stupid for losing such an amazing person over such shallow thing. I want the most to fall in love and for it to work. But I\u2019m just scared that it can\u2019t and that physical chemistry will never appear, and I\u2019m gonna break our both hearts later, not being able to feel what I need to feel. Cause in the first place, he deserves to be loved and appreciated for 100%. \n\nAny thoughts, experience? Thank you! \n",

We\u2019ve also taken official group dance classes together to learn some new styles, so it\u2019s not like he has an extreme aversion or trauma related to dancing.

Men are attracted to me, but they never want to get to know me. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so difficult for me to get a man to want to date me seriously when I feel like I have a good personality, I have my life together, and I would consider myself fairly attractive. I am kind of skinny, so I don\u2019t have the \u201cthick\u201d body that\u2019s in right now, but I doubt that would be the reason I\u2019m having all these issues. I am a little weird, but most people like me and it\u2019s easy for me to make friends. Most of my friends and family and etc like that I\u2019m a little weird and enjoy my sense of humor. \n\nI will say I do expect more from men than most women, so maybe I just don\u2019t come off as easy? However, most men don\u2019t get to know me enough to realize this about me. I am a little crazy in relationships, but again, I usually don\u2019t get to that point either. So, I don\u2019t know what would be scaring men off. Am I intimidating? Do I come across that weird? What is it about me that men don\u2019t like?\n\nMost of the time, this doesn\u2019t bother me, but lately I\u2019ve been interested in something that isn\u2019t a hook up or something casual. Now I\u2019ve realized why I don\u2019t try to date. It\u2019s incredibly embarrassing. My friends think I pull a lot of guys, but they don\u2019t know that men usually don\u2019t stick around long and want me in a serious type of way. I play it off that I\u2019m a player and I\u2019m not looking for that at the moment, but sometimes I am looking for that and I\u2019m too embarrassed to admit they always reject me. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t focus too much on this, but I wonder when it will ever end. Will my only option ever be my ex? Will any other guy ever want me? Will I ever be someone\u2019s first choice? I thought surely someone will want me eventually\u2026but four years later and here I am. \n\nWhat is going on?? I mean, a few guys I could blame it on them, but every single one?? I just don\u2019t get it.",

We talked daily, watched movies, and eventually made it official.\n\nSoon, she had emotional breakdowns, expressing fear of being alone. One night, after I comforted her, she casually mentioned kissing someone and giving a guy her Instagram. When I questioned our relationship, she flipped, saying we were just friends. Later, she went on a date with a 28M, kissed him, regretted it, and apologized\u2014I forgave her. Meanwhile she was intrested in some other guy from her school also.\n\nThinking she realized her mistake, I stayed, but soon she entertained another guy. I advised her to heal first, but she ignored my feelings. I even traveled 22 hours to surprise her, but she refused to meet me, leaving me heartbroken.\n\nEventually, I told her I couldn\u2019t just be a friend since I had feelings for her. She later apologized and promised commitment, so I gave her another chance. But she grew distant, ignored me, and only reached out when she needed support. Realizing I was being used, I confronted her about my feelings, and she responded coldly. That was my breaking point.\n\nPrioritizing my mental health, I ended it for good. It was painful\u2014I even sought therapy and medication. Despite everything, a part of me still wants her back, but I know walking away was the right choice.

        "content": "Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 6months, everything has been near perfect except for a discussion we had regarding this recently. At the talking stage i told her that i don't like parties &amp; clubs (i myself don't not attend parties or clubs, just for clarity) if i am not in attendance mainly for safety reasons because i'm not nearby in the unwanted event of something bad happening and to add to it because a fatal shooting occurred at a party there recently. I constantly mention how we can do this together because id think its fun if we attend something like this together. bare in mind she has told me a handful of times that she knows that i don't like it and she's willing to sacrifice that and she is sure this is what she wants to do. She goes to a university out of state and lives on campus. She has a friend group of almost all single females and they hang out regularly. We have also recently discussed her wanting to add clothes to wardrobe which some were a little too revealing for my liking (we talked it out and came to an agreement in the middle ground) and then wants to also party simultaneously. this is where my confusion lies is, she doesn't even drink and her only reason for wanting to go is because she's never gone to a party with a few of these friends. aren't there so many other places to go and things to do other then a party? I was always taught traditional/conservative values growing up and I am sure thats had an influence on my boundaries. Now one thing i can say is i can fully trust this girl, i just see it as more of a safety and respect thing especially if she told me she was willing to sacrifice that for me and now she even calls me controlling for me not wanting her to go although I told her this from the beginning which she agreed to.",

We were good friends for a year and then moved in with eachother, alongside 4 other people who we know. We all function as a group of friends now. We were kind of distant compared to how we were before we moved in together in the first semester though he did star as my characters boyfriend in a film I made, so we spent time working on that together. I missed him because how much less close i felt to him. Honestly, I\u2019d liked him for the whole time I\u2019ve known him but always kind of assumed he didn\u2019t see me in any other light than friendship so just ignored it kind of and just accepted that he was just my friend. We\u2019d spend a lot of time together last year, sometimes he\u2019d stay in my room until like 5am and then go home. \n\nThough there was never really signs that he\u2019s liked me that I read into at the time, now i look back sometimes there was hints of our dynamic that seemed that hinted at something more than strictly platonic was happening but unspoken, though they didn\u2019t come up often.One time he mentioned that i was extremely attractive when I said i didnt feel like i stood out as much in a city compared to a small town for my looks. We always hugged when we saw each other and when we said bye, and one time after i was the only person he invited to see his first open mic, he left his guitar at mine. Later he came to pick it up in the morning after and i gave it to him, but i hadnt showered so i said that we couldnt hug jokingly. He pulled a sad face and said \u201care you sure\u201d then said he didnt mind and we hugged anyway. But these are the only signs i can think of for the whole year. \n\nThis semester, since january our dynamic has been noticeably different. We have spent more time alone than before and spoken a lot more, feeling more intimate. On his first day back we got drunk and i ended up playing with his hair whilst talking to him about different bears and their temperament. Since the we have felt a lot closer and he\u2019s been complimenting me very often and showing signs he may like me\n\npossible signs so far:\n\n\nExtremely passionate piano piece for me while high, i asked him to improvise a song for me and inspired by me on the piano, and he played a 2 minute long ethereal vibe that went into jazzy. Whilst playing, he pulled himself ver close to the piano, rolled his dead back and shut his eyes with his lips parted. very nervous and embarassed the day after \nCalled me baby twice \nSaid my dress was sexy \nSustained eye contact in group situations, flicks his eyes at everyone then returns to me. Catch eachothers eye in group conversations when we aren\u2019t addressing eachother\nCalled me cute when filming me for a project \nSaid my lip gloss colour was seductive\nBrings up lip colour multiple times \nAlways compliments how i look and my clothes \nOccasional physical contact that feels intentional, 3am in my room while producing music\nTold me he\u2019d look for me in his dreams \nTold me \u201ci have something you want\u201d when i jokingly took his phone \nHe said the phrase \u201cdepends how long you can last\u201d in a different context and we both laughed at the innuendo \nTold him i had a celebrity crush on a music artist, and then he told me that sega was the same ethnicity as him despite never have mentioned it before. He then told me sega and his girlfriend make music together, which we do too. \nDynamic feels really different to before, more intimate than last semester and flirty. \nCasually dropped in \u201cstaring at each other longingly\u201d into a random conversation about a tv show, seemed off the cuff tho.\nOur other flatmates may have caught a vibe that there\u2019s something between us because one drunkenly told us she wanted to watch us have sex, and when he was playing the piano very passionately for our flatmate said \u201cwow\u2026 that really encapsulates\u2026 everything\u201d, and they save seats next to him on the sofa. Also one time a flatmate made a throwaway comment about \u201cdisrupting our tension\u201d\nsaid \u201chow could anyone say no\u201d about my smile \nsaid my boobs look great in a top i was wearing \npointed out all the pics i looked good in when we went to the club \nproperly held hands while walking thru the crowd at a club \nveryyy close in selfies and photos \nlooked me up and down/ did a double take when he saw me in less clothes in the hallway \nlets me wear his sunglasses, teases me when i\u2019ve been wearing for too long- said \u201cyou thought you got away with that\u201d \nsometimes feels like our conversations might have a double meaning- we were talking about a song we both knew, and i said \u201cit took time to grow on me, but now i like it a lot\u201d and he said \u201ci knew i liked it from the start\u201d, there was a weird feeling/ tension \nanother time, he was washing up a pan and said something like \u201cbut it\u2019s risky\u201d to do with the pan, and i said \u201cbut it could be so beautiful\u2019 jokingly, then he said \u201cso true\u201d felt like there could\u2019ve been a double meaning \nclinked my glass, and said \u201cthat\u2019s the sound of potential\u201d \nsaid, \u201ceucalyptus? more like you-can-lick-this\u201d to me jokingly \n\n",

        "content": "For 3 months, I had this connection with this person that felt earth-shattering. We were both in long-term relationships when we met. I had known I was unhappy in mine for a while, but I was living in denial and just settling with an alcoholic who was not dealing with his issues and who I had outgrown emotionally. I was the caretaker in a codependent relationship. But because he is a \u201cgood\u201d man, never treated me badly, and all our friends and family thought we were good for each other, I stayed. I thought this was just what relationships were. I was no longer physically or emotionally attracted to him. And then I met someone who saw me for who I am and some switch in me just flipped and I knew it was the end. It has been a painful process. We own a house together, so that had to be dissolved, we have pets together which we had to split up. I moved out. My life has had a lot more downs than ups since deciding to do this. But I am pushing on. I am taking care of myself (which I have been doing for a while anyway) and I am starting to feel lighter because of not having the \u201cburden\u201d of him on me anymore. \n\nBUT\u2026 I can\u2019t escape the fear that now I will end up alone. My standards are higher, and after falling for this other \u201cthird party\u201d so hard, I feel like I will never find that again. \n\nHowever, this person has decided to \u201ctry one last time\u201d with his partner. Now, I don\u2019t know if he is just feeling guilty about not trying for her, or if maybe I was so wrong about him and he probably cheats on her often and is now just done with me. But from what he told me while the affair was ongoing, things between them had already been very much not good, just like with me and my partner. \n\nIt is really affecting my ability to move on, but I can\u2019t help clinging to the hope that he will leave her too. I know this is an old rehashed story, but I am wondering if anyone ever waited for someone like that and actually had them see the light? My logical mind tells me to forget about him, let him chose to stay where he is unhappy if he wants to, because that has nothing to do with me. But from the beginning, everything with him has felt like we were completely destined to meet. So it feels impossible to let go of. ",

        "content": "My boyfriend (M, 32) and I (F, 30) have been dating for about six months, and our relationship has been wonderful. We are very much in love, have great communication, and are naturally moving toward something more serious. In fact, we are considering getting engaged at the end of the year. We both dated after a long time, and when we found each other, everything just clicked. I'm really happy with him, and I can see a future together.\n\nThat said, there's one thing that has been bothering me. While we are both very family-oriented, we come from different cultures\u2014I\u2019m South Asian, and he\u2019s German. I currently live in Germany, where his family is very close-knit. In fact, his parents live right across from his house, and he sees them almost every day. While I love and respect them, I sometimes feel like he hasn\u2019t fully \"left the nest\" yet, and that makes me feel like I\u2019m playing second fiddle in our relationship.\n\nFor example, when long weekends or holidays come up, he almost always wants to go on vacation with his family. While I completely understand the importance of family, I feel like we\u2019re missing out on quality time as a couple. If we want to build a future together, shouldn\u2019t there be some effort to prioritize our relationship too? I\u2019m not saying he should cut off from his family, but I\u2019d love for us to take some trips together, spend more uninterrupted time as a couple, and truly get to know each other on a deeper level.\n\nAnother thing that has been difficult for me to navigate is how much he relies on his sister as an emotional crutch. I try my best to be understanding, but sometimes it feels like whenever he is dealing with something difficult, his first instinct is to turn to her instead of working through it with me. I don\u2019t want to take away that support system, but at some point, shouldn\u2019t we be the first people each other leans on in a relationship? I find myself holding back my feelings on this because I don\u2019t want to hurt him, but it\u2019s also something that\u2019s making me feel like I\u2019m not fully part of his life in the way that I\u2019d like to be.\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think it should ever be a situation of \u201cfamily vs. girlfriend\u201d\u2014it should be \u201cfamily and girlfriend.\u201d That\u2019s the kind of environment I was raised with. But sometimes I feel like I\u2019m on the outside looking in, rather than being integrated into that close circle.\n\nSince we are already talking about engagement, I want to make sure we are setting a strong foundation for our future. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How do you navigate a relationship where your partner is still very attached to their family? I want to approach this in a way that is loving and understanding rather than making him feel like he has to \"choose.\" Any advice would be really appreciated!",

Looking back now, she was incredibly patient and understanding and when I raised issues, she respected them and made positive changes. After I ended the relationship she tried really hard to repair things and that just further gave me the ick but I think now I love her and believe she was \"the one\" \nIs it too late for us? Is it okay if I reach out to her? ",

        "content": "I (m19) am into my close friend (f19), but I'm genuinely confused as to whether to say something or not\n\nUsing a throwaway account because brrr paranoia, but I (M19) like the title says am interested in my close friend (F19) of around a year. I've not liked her the entire time, we've both dated people while we've known each other. But after summer last year, we started to become close and that's when I thought my feelings weren't quite platonic \n\nWe do talk every day, and whenever we're together in a group setting we always seem to pair off and just chat to each other, it's really nice and lovely. She genuinely is someone I feel very comfortable talking with, and she's been open about feeling the same with me. For awhile things were normal, and we weren't super close. But on Halloween, we were in my room, we'd both had a small drink but weren't drunk. She asked about my books and I went on this long talk about my books. I found out from two of her friends that she thought if I had kissed her, she wouldn't have said no. And that she was confused because she'd never seen me that way. Soon after, we started going for walks at around 1am at night, and we'd just chat, whether it was deep and emotional or just fun. It was great. I remember the first night we were on a bench, and she was a bit teary eyed so I had my arm around her, but I didn't make a move or anything because she was upset and that seemed a dick move\n\nWe've been out for drinks multiple times together, even grabbed lunch. My friends say we go on \"pseudo-dates\". Even when hanging around in a group (which adds another layer because we are in the same friend group), they all say it feels like third wheeling. We go to the cinema together a few times, and usually when she's hanging round at our flat, I'll walk her home at night. She once mentioned that everyone at her work assumes we're dating, and I once mentioned that everyone I know thinks the same. That was kind of the end of the conversation, I switched the subject quickly because I got nervous. Her friend mentioned that she does think I'm at least attractive, and she herself said to me she prefers when guys make the first move because she assumes everything is friendly and it makes her feel nice to be asked out like that. She mentioned to this same friend, that she thinks we're very \"coupley friends\" \n\nThere were plenty of times where we'd just text well into 4am, or I'd be around at hers chatting away. I feel like we've both really opened up to each other about alot. We sometimes playfight and we always tease each other, but I've always assumed it to be friendly. But recently, she's been on two dates with this guy, and she seems to quite like him, which is great im glad! It's just complicated because now I feel like im caught in a bind. My close friends say I won't be able to move on without at least saying how I feel, that it doesn't matter the outcome but that it will get the huge weight off my chest. I am just confused as to what to do, because if I say something now, I don't know if that will push her away, especially if she's going on dates with this guy. Or if I say something will it at least make it easier to move on? For the record I do not believe her to reciprocate any feelings, I'm fairly confident on her part it's always been platonic for the most part and that we're just good friends",

        "title": "I (24F) am unsure if he (31M) might be leading his ex (28F) on.",
        "content": "I (24F) just moved to a new city in January and have been on the lookout for groups to play soccer (changed the name of the sport) with. A friend introduced me to people and I instantly clicked with this guy, Fred (31M, obviously not his real name). I have always dated a bit older. From the get go, Fred took me out to dinner after the first night we met at soccer and immediately told me to be aware that his ex, Erica (28F, redacted name again), is a popular soccer coach in the city and knows a lot of people. \n\nThey were together for 2.5 years, lived together, and broke up in October. He assured me that he was done with her, and people (as in him and his friends they shared mutually) told me that she was narcissistic and always switching up the narrative. Random soccer people have told me she\u2019s fake, even. He told me that they play soccer in similar groups and they generally keep the peace because she wants to be able to share custody of his dog and he doesn\u2019t want to get black sheeped. She demands 50/50, but he paid for the dog and is covering the entirety of the $20k surgery. (He is a nice guy.) She was also the only girl he has ever played \u201csoccer\u201d with. She largely relied on him financially as he paid for rent and other things for her to pursue her coaching job.\n\nHe is not a partier and is a lot more private about his life despite knowing a lot of people in the soccer community. Rarely uses social media. We spend a lot of time at soccer and fishing. He isn\u2019t your typical 9-5 guy and owns his own businesses. Operates at his own time, so is late a lot of the time or up at late hours for Zoom meetings overseas. Doesn\u2019t have a regular sleep schedule.\n\n*** Biggest thing: He wants us to remain on the downlow since 1) his breakup is fresh, 2) he doesn\u2019t want either of us to feel uncomfortable at soccer or get uninvited to play with groups (especially since I\u2019m new to the city), and 3) it is fairly soon and he doesn\u2019t want me to feel like a rebound. I agreed on all three fronts. We both agreed to be exclusive, but if opportunities come up, we are both direct enough to let the other person know. I\u2019ve met his closest of friends both in and out of soccer.\n\nFast forward to a month later of knowing him, here are some events that have happened:\n\n1. On week 2: His ex pulled up to his apartment while I was there unannounced to pick up the last of her items from him. She had heard a rumor that we were seeing eachother from some people in the soccer community (around 12pm when all of us were there playing) and had left soccer early that day. She went off on him via text and he denied us seeing eachother. Then, she pulled up to his (gated) apartment around 7pm while we were taking his dogs out to pee, and it was raining heavily outside. She splashed us in the rain when she sped up and stopped, then made him stand in the rain to argue with her. She was bombarding him with questions and ruined our plans to go out that night. Apparently, she was \u201cin the area\u201d and wanted the last of her belongings, but her workplace is 10 minutes away via the interstate\u2026 It was just weird and investigative, I guess? Didn\u2019t shoot a heads up text. He is also the only person with a key and he doesn\u2019t share his location with her. Anyways, she drove off because I told Zach that I was going inside while he talked it out in the rain. We were going to hang out with friends, so I left in my car first. She waited for me to leave, then knocked on his door demanding to take her things out or she wouldn\u2019t leave. I waited at the venue for an hour for him because he said he\u2019d catch up once she was gone. He ended up being so stressed by her singling him out, that he decided to stay in. I could hear it in his voice over the phone. I told him I was fine with this since it\u2019s less baggage and good riddance for him and me.\n\n2. Same week: she said a lot of nasty things about me to the soccer group and I immediately picked up on it. I caught her going through my Instagram because she was lurking in my story views, so I followed her. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong, and to her, I am just his new soccer partner and had met her the night before, officially, in the rain. She immediately told Fred, saying \u201cyour pal just followed me out of nowhere.\u201d For context: I normally play with the guys and don\u2019t really play with the girls because I play a bit rougher (even before I moved), but I always got a weird catty feeling from the girls. Even before I met Fred, she just would look at me and wasn\u2019t warm or welcoming like everybody else. (I am extremely secure in my looks and could care less about the whole social media thing. I look absolutely nothing like her: Asian, petite, full-chested, brunette. If anything, I look more like his first long-term girlfriend who was also on the white-washed side and had a similar age gap. I don\u2019t like putting other women down, but a few of his friends have expressed that despite my age, I am much more emotionally mature, intelligent, and driven than her. I have an engineering degree from a big school whereas she had chosen a different lifestyle. Also, being in that field, I can pickup when girls project insecurities or are a bit jealous of others for attention and what not. I feel bad that perhaps the guys noticing my game at soccer are causing her to be insecure about her physical looks. After this, she deleted pictures with him and unfollowed him. He is still following her and still has their pictures together up, which I couldn\u2019t care less about because he\u2019s not a social media updates kind of guy.)\n\n3. Last week, she challenged me to a 2v2, knowing I am Fred\u2019s new partner but insisted I partner up with a random instead (reminder: I\u2019m redacting the actual sport we play.) Disclaimer: I play REALLY rough and aggressive, hence why I don\u2019t play with women often despite being like 5\u20190 and 105 lbs. Like I\u2019ve actually scared guys with the ball in this sport. I am notorious for bodybagging people simply because of my background in a similar sport, and the guys typically laugh it off and are fine with it. Anyways, her partner sends me an easy ball, and I did what I always do - smash the ball down the line - and it hit her in the shoulder. I said sorry immediately and also after the match was over and she told me \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine. I could\u2019ve hit you harder.\u201d Afterwards, I told Fred what happened and that I was sincerely sorry. She talked to him separately about it and she told him she actually said \u201cOh it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve been hit harder\u201d. He has played with me many times before and knows it\u2019s my signature shot/strategy, but he got upset at me. I told him that 1) she challenged me, 2) it was not intentional, 3) I played my game as if she was anybody else, and 4) I asked him if I\u2019m supposed to just handfeed her the ball instead of getting tournament practice in. Between us two girls, we didn\u2019t have a problem, but he was worried about other people sizing up his partners. \n\n4. He has shared his location with me since night one, but I told him I didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing mine as I only have it for family and I like the idea of trusting my partner. However, today, he had a 4 hour drive to a different city and I had messaged him that I was going to bed at around 11:45pm and to text me once he got home safely. He said \u201cI don\u2019t want to wake you up, but you have my location and can check if I got back safe.\u201d I kept tossing and turning (poor sleeping habits in general) and at 1am, I saw his location was at her apartment. I know he left his dog with her, but two hours have passed and he is most definitely still there (it is past 3am and I\u2019m typing this.) She also has electric car chargers that are free and fast there, but am I an idiot to believe nothing fishy is going on? I texted him asking if he was at her place and called twice, but no answer. I even looked at the apartment map and his location isn\u2019t at the parking garage. I am hoping  that he is either 1) having a long talk with her about setting boundaries because he is smart and would\u2019ve hid his location if he wanted to, 2) is probably asleep from the day trip, or 3) unlikely left his phone. He has assured me over and over again that it is over, and I\u2019ve seen her throw fits in-person at soccer and their body language is very tense. I just feel really anxious at this point. \n\nAfter all of the points, I feel like perhaps she knows we\u2019re seeing eachother at this point. I just don\u2019t know why she would be upset unless he is leading her on. He has told me he has discussed only that him and I are not a thing; he has yet to comment about them finding new people and moving on. I have also dated some really attractive 10/10 guys in my old city that ended up being the best liars, so I am just extremely cautious despite him seeming very transparent with me.\n\nIncase you\u2019re wondering if perhaps I\u2019m just with him to get in on the invite-only soccer groups, I have met so many soccer people in the city without him and they have all been welcoming. I have a bit of a social media presence, but I don\u2019t entertain people, regardless of if they\u2019re new to me or not. I am staying on the down low for him, but it\u2019s hard to make my disinterest in people more obvious without disclosing that I\u2019m seeing someone. On the other hand, I\u2019ve garnered so much attention for how aggressive I play, and it\u2019s tough to dampen myself and change my game for the sake of keeping the peace.\n\nI\u2019ve been respecting his wishes and not posting about any of the fish I\u2019ve caught or messaging her myself. I have a completely clear conscience because I\u2019ve never acted out of malice nor wished that for either of them. This sounds ridiculous, but perhaps I need to walk away if he\u2019s not willing to set boundaries at the cost of being able to get invited out to soccer. Thoughts?\n\nTLDR: I (24F) feel like he (31M) is leading his ex (28F) on. She shows up unannounced, has tried to cause unnecessary drama, and he has yet to confront her about moving on.",

        "content": "TLDR; my partner and I have been together for 1.5 years and I\u2019m having doubts, even though we love each other deeply. At what point of second guessing the relationship do you need to end it, and what circumstances should you stay? I fear I\u2019m cursed with relationship anxiety and feeling that things aren\u2019t ever good enough. \n\nI (F26) and my partner (M31) have been together for 1.5 years (coming up to 2 years since we first met/started dating). \nInitially things moved quickly and there was excitement and immediate fondness between the two of us. Though I was fairly hesitant initially (I\u2019d only broken up with my ex 2 months prior and wasn\u2019t looking for anything serious), he caught me off guard with his open heart and genuineness. \nWe ended up together, obviously, and are both now in love. There\u2019s something I can\u2019t quite put my finger on that\u2019s bugging me to my core. At the start, he was devoted, expressive of his feelings towards me, made grand gestures etc. (granted he was overseas on a trip he\u2019d planned before meeting me, of which he cut short in part so we could be together). Now, he\u2019s kind and considerate in the simple ways, he offers to do things for me, will make me food or help out in some way. I can\u2019t help but feel there\u2019s a deeper misalignment between us - he\u2019s incredibly logical and black and white in his thinking, whereas I\u2019m a broad picture thinker, struggling to look outside the grey. Though I don\u2019t think this is inherently a problem, opposites attract after all, it has led to many tense conversations or attempts at seeing eye to eye over the simplest things. These are qualities we both admire in one another but also both struggle with. \n\nI suppose my question is, at what point do you throw the towel in? Is this fundamental difference in seeing the world and communicating enough to end an otherwise loving and caring relationship? Am I being too picky, expecting the excitement you see in movies or when you\u2019re young, or can you still experience and foster this with the right person long term? \n\nThings are feeling more serious between us. He wants to move in together, he\u2019s a bit older and is settling down, I\u2019m feeling older too now. I can\u2019t help but feel that we wouldn\u2019t be best friends if not a couple, and that\u2019s something I see in my parents and others around me that I aspire to have, a sense of fun, adventure, curiosity, deep soul knowing - is this unrealistic? I\u2019m becoming painfully aware that I\u2019m not getting any younger and I\u2019ve been in a three relationships since I was 16, the other two last 4 and 3.5 years - perhaps the issue is that I don\u2019t know myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nExtra notes: my family and friends don\u2019t comment, but I know they\u2019re sceptical of him and my relationship, in part I believe because he enjoys his alone time and doesn\u2019t fake interest in things he doesn\u2019t like, hence he\u2019s not super easy to get to know and we don\u2019t do many social things together (another area of the relationship I\u2019m struggling with).

I don\u2019t know if anyone could do the stupid things I did, but I\u2019m writing it for myself at least.\n\nRed flags in him: \n1. Lack of efforts, I\u2019d travel all the way to his town to meet him and just once did he come over to my town and left early. \n2. Wouldn\u2019t take a no when it comes to a few sexual things - like anal and stuff. Have to repeatedly say no. \n3. Called me dumb and a pencil because I was so lean.\n4. Would constantly compliment these celebrity women and talk about them frequently. When I called him out, he said I can\u2019t take a joke. \n5. Was only ever interested in sex and when I called him out he swore he wasn\u2019t a fuckboi.\n6. I was on top while I was losing my virginity with him despite saying it hurt like 4 times and then we stopped. \n7. Literally said \u2018grab you by the pussy\u2019 like Trump did but I ignored it.\n8. Threw me away for another girl. \n\nI guess I believed more in the words than actions and he was a very good gaslighter.\n\n\nRed flags in me:\n1. Every time we fought I called him names like dickhead and a cheat and a fraud.\n2. Called him 100 times after he blocked me everywhere and begged him to stay. \n3. Constantly begging for efforts and to stay and treat me well. \n\nI gave so much of myself into this relationship that I feel like I\u2019ve lost myself. I can\u2019t get over the ick. I feel disgusted with myself. I haven\u2019t been able to shower or take care of myself, I don\u2019t know why. \n\nThe relationship or whatever it was lasted 6 months. And I\u2019ve been in no contact for 3 months. But I still physically cringe or react or throw up at the thought of whatever that has happened and that I allowed it. I am not able to have a relationship with myself, if that makes sense. \n\nSorry I know I need to go to a therapist but I can\u2019t really afford. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to strangers on the internet because in the past most have been kind to me. \n\nHow do I feel comfortable within myself after what happened?\n",

        "content": "Hey Reddit, I\u2019m in a bit of a tough spot and would really appreciate some outside perspectives.\n\nI\u2019ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about 8 months now. We\u2019ve had our ups and downs, especially during the first couple of months, but things have started to feel a bit unmanageable recently, and I'm unsure if we can work through this or if it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nA bit of background about us:\n\n* I'm 23, and she\u2019s 24. We met at work, and after a few months of getting to know each other, we fell in love.\n* She\u2019s very emotional, not just during her period, but pretty much every time I don\u2019t understand where she\u2019s coming from. I try to be supportive, but it feels like I\u2019m constantly walking on eggshells.\n* I, on the other hand, have a lot of stress at work and often find it hard to think straight when I\u2019m talking to her outside of work. This tends to make things worse because I struggle to communicate properly.\n\nWe both try to keep it professional during work hours, but sometimes we end up talking about personal issues, which results in arguments. Recently, our fights have been escalating and getting quite aggressive. She\u2019s told me she feels like she\u2019s in a \u201cfoggy\u201d state when we argue, and it\u2019s led to her screaming at me, throwing things, breaking stuff, and even hurting herself. These moments are intense, and it's really hard to deal with, especially when we\u2019re in public places like the gym.\n\nI\u2019ve found myself saying a lot of hurtful things in these moments, mostly because I\u2019ve never been in a relationship like this before and I don\u2019t always know how to handle the emotional volatility. Every time I suggest therapy, she gets offended and angry, accusing me of gaslighting her or being emotionless.\n\nAnother thing that\u2019s starting to wear on me is how clingy she can be. We work 8-hour shifts, and after work, she wants us to call until she falls asleep. On weekends, she wants to spend all her time with me, even on rest days. I\u2019m starting to feel drained and like I\u2019m walking on eggshells, afraid that even the smallest mistake could set off another argument.\n\nI love her and I\u2019ve tried my best to adjust to her needs, but I can\u2019t help feeling like this situation is becoming too much for me to handle. I\u2019m not sure if I can continue like this, or if this relationship is fixable.\n\nSo, Reddit, what do you think? Is this relationship salvageable, or is it time to let go?",

        "content": "Looking for advice from someone one who has been in a similar relationship situation. \n\nTLDR: I ( 28F ) have been with my fianc\u00e9 ( 28M ) for 6 years. I have been begging for change for so long as I am tired and resentful of being a caretaker. I\u2019m not sure though if his mental health issues are to blame and so there\u2019s hope for the future if he gets better, or if I\u2019m just going to be stuck in this situation for good. I\u2019m looking for advice from people who\u2019ve been in similar situations! Thank you :) \n\nI\u2019m feeling really lost and lonely in my relationship and need some outside perspective. My fianc\u00e9 and I are in our late twenties, have been together for six years, and have cats. This is my first and only relationship, so I didn\u2019t have much to compare it to in the beginning\u2014but now, after years of growth and self-reflection, I realize I\u2019m deeply unhappy with the imbalance in our relationship.\n\nThe biggest gaps between us are in household labor, emotional intimacy, and physical intimacy. While I love him, I feel like I carry the full weight of our life together, and I\u2019m starting to resent it.\n\nHe grew up in a conservative household where women were expected to handle all domestic work, and when we met, he had just moved out for the first time. As a result, I\u2019ve had to teach him everything about managing a home, and even after six years, I\u2019m still the one keeping everything running.\n\nEven when I delegate tasks, he forgets them or does them so poorly that it feels intentional. For example, I put him in charge of paying rent and bills, but we\u2019ve fallen behind because he forgets. He\u2019s responsible for refilling the cats\u2019 water, but days will go by with empty bowls before he notices. If I\u2019m sick or unavailable, the house just falls apart. He\u2019s self aware but that doesn\u2019t seem to change anything.\n\nFinancially, things are just as frustrating. In the beginning, we split everything 50/50, but when I started working from home and taking on more household duties, we adjusted. Still, he remained rigid\u2014if I ever needed him to cover for me one week, he expected me to pay him back later. I always wanted to share finances more as a team, but he refuses, since his parents keep everything separate.\n\nWhen I was unemployed for a period last year, I took on 95% of the housework while still doing side jobs to bring in money. But instead of supporting me, he constantly complained about how stressed he was and pressured me to get a job right away. It didn\u2019t feel like we were a team\u2014it felt like I was just an obligation to him.\n\nOur sex life has always been an issue. He had struggles in bed from the start, and I encouraged him to see a doctor. He said he did, but nothing changed. His drive is incredibly low, and when I try to initiate, he either physically pushes me away or complains about me trying. I\u2019ve tried to communicate what I like, introduce new things, and be patient\u2014but he shuts me down. Now, after years of rejection, I feel completely unwanted and undesirable. When I express my sadness, he tells me I\u2019m manipulating him into sex, which makes me feel even worse.\n\nEmotionally, I feel neglected, too. I always have to initiate meaningful conversations\u2014he never makes me feel special. I\u2019ve explicitly told him what I need, especially for things like birthdays, but he always falls short. After years of disappointment, I finally told him exactly what I wanted: a card, a gift, and decorations (which I even bought in advance and showed him where they were). I was thrilled to get a present this year, but he still ignored everything else and spent the day in a bad mood. Meanwhile, I go all out for his birthday, yet he refuses to do the same for me because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nEven small gestures are nonexistent\u2014no surprises, flowers, no sweet notes, nothing spontaneous. When I started a new job, he didn\u2019t cook dinner for me, get me a small gift, or even acknowledge it. I feel like I beg to be shown love, and I\u2019m tired.\n\nHe struggles with mental health issues and ADHD, and while I\u2019ve always supported him, I\u2019m starting to resent how much of a caretaker I\u2019ve become. I\u2019ve worked hard to manage my own mental health\u2014I go to therapy, take medication, and put in real effort for my own well-being and for the people around me. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve been asking him to see a therapist for years, but there\u2019s always an excuse not to. His mental health is declining, but he refuses to get help, leaving me to pick up the pieces.\n\nI\u2019ve already decided to postpone our wedding indefinitely, but I haven\u2019t figured out how to tell him yet. The hardest part is that I don\u2019t want this to end\u2014but I also don\u2019t see the value in keeping him in my life anymore. He\u2019s my best friend and I genuinely love spending time with him. The problem is it just feels like we\u2019re friends/roommates and nothing more. \n\nFor those who have been in similar situations, does this gap ever close? Has anyone successfully helped their partner step up and meet them halfway, or is this just how the division of labor and intimacy plays out in most male-female relationships? I need to know if I\u2019m fighting for something that can actually change, or if I\u2019m just setting myself up for a lifetime of disappointment.\n\nI love him so much but at the moment can\u2019t even stand to be in the same room as him when we\u2019re both home because I just feel sad and angry and get pains in my chest.\n\n\n\n",

Dated for 8 months, barely fought really compared to my old 10-year relationship or my new rebound after that which was probably 8 months but 0 of the love of a proper relationship. Which I thought I had. Definitely she was a total control freak with no social skills even compared to my autistic ass and the ability to distinguish good and bad people, she hung out with just a lot of life's lowest that most of use beat out of our lives wen we go to university or whatver and fall into out personalities more. But anyways we liked to eat, take some drugs, play video games, cuddle. \n\n  \nThere was some weirdo local dealer we both hated and also hes a well know crackhead and all around one of the worst people you could bother to talk to unless you had many reasons to, like if you're a lawyer for example. Anyways this guy creeps out gf, disrepects me to the point where normally id get physical but due to non-violent legal issues it is in my best interest to remain non-violent even in self-defence situations really. So I tell this old creeper to leave me and gf alone, I block him, I assumed gf did cause who keeps people like that as an option to be reached out to by. Now like 5 days ago I got a wonderful tasteful nude photo, 3 days after she is dating this creep whom we've spoken about how much we hated since his inception. Its so fucking interesting. Gives me BPD vibes and stuff but I dont wanna say that she seeks toxic situations, but she certainly does not stray. The relationship wont last or anything so im not like hurt beyond belief, but it's pretty fucking weird man.

I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just looking for reasons to not develop a full on crush or of it is that serious. I got the BIGGEST ick from one of his tattoos. I think it\u2019s super cringe, it was of a mouth with a cherry between the lips with the words \u201cyou ripen I\u2019ll eat\u201d, it was in part the style/colours of the tattoo and the fact that it\u2019s about performing oral. I\u2019ve really enjoyed talking to him but honestly feel like I might not be able to get past it, it\u2019s just really cringe to me. His other tattoos are pretty cool though \nAny tips? Do I snip it in the bud and break things off? Pray that if we get married and he decides to cover it? ",

        "content": "My partner and I were in a 6 years relationship with one kid in 2023. Though we had a kid we were living separately as he was always finding excuses for not leaving his mom's house or us moving in with him. His family has always been against us since the beginning because of my skin colour and ethnicity. They even left my kid out of family functions etc.\n\nIn 2023, my partner proposed to get married and went for the paperwork. I ended up cancelling it because he was disrespectful about me and my kid. And wouldn't live together with us. His mom who was living abroad came in and persuaded him to go with her as I didn't meet her criteria. He made his passport without telling us. Then in September, he changed his work place and soon he would change his attitude too. \n\nHe was dressing up differently, acting differently. Then suddenly his social media profile was hacked and removed all our photos together etc. It was hard as I gave him everything I had. So I tried to make him jealous by flirting in front of him, he came back and abused me physically as I didn't want to sleep with him. I ended up with a silent miscarriage last year after high fever.He knew but didn't care to assist to the echo. So he went silent. While I was left with another child amongst all this as there two babies, which I didn't told him.\n\nI didn't know what to do, until someone I knew proposed to be in my life and take care of us. At first it was okay but I couldn't forget and my kid too. She was crying and begging for him but he wouldn't answer or call back. That new person, knew what he did to me and knew I wasn't ready to be in his bed as I was leaving he did the same thing. I left went back home and suffered in silence. My kids dad came back in May and pretending to care etc. That's when I told him I was pregnant. His first reaction was it's not his, which I can totally understand. He went back to his family saying I was a wh*re sleeping everywhere etc that he needed a DNA test. \n\nLater during the pregnancy I learned that he was with another women,including one he went to her house and told his family to keep it secret as I would have withhold my daughter from him which I never did. The baby is born and is just like him. I chose to get back with him and forgive the abuse for my kids but he left my daughter with a greater scar as this has hurt her deeply when all this happened. That she cries a lot and has some kind of resentment towards him. \n\nFollowing all this I can't have any kind of intimacy with him. I've been through several anxiety attacks, depression etc. As we were together since high school and I did gave him the best part of me which he tossed away. We come from poor backgrounds and once he was high enough he would replace all this. I see myself like not enough. I want peace. I want to be that bubbly girl I was before. I felt like betrayed and don't know how to deal with it. Do you have a piece of advice?",

I feel bad for looking through his phone and I feel insecure. I feel sad and betrayed bc he has said he doesn't watch porn. I really don't know how to move on. I confronted him again after finding the evidence and he said he was sorry. He said he could stop, but how can I trust him not to just lie again? He didn't really reassure me when I talked about our differing looks ect. It makes me especially sad due to him being in the military and being able to see each other only on weekends now.

        "content": "I\u2019ve been waiting over a year to talk about this and I feel like I\u2019m ready to talk about it finally even if it\u2019s just with strangers on the internet. But I learned an extremely painful but rather important life lesson that I\u2019d like to share.\n\nFor context me and my ex were together from 2018-2023/2024 depending on how you look at the last few months we were \u201ctogether\u201d, my now ex who was a traveling medical worker (not a nurse) a woman who I\u2019d spent nearly 6 years with and would have done absolutely anything for and who was always honest about the fact she had cheated on every person she ever dated including myself about a year after we started dating (I know I should have left right then and there but I stupidly forgave her after it happened because she threatened to kill herself if I left her and I had to rip a kitchen knife away from her) And who also decided not to inform me that she had herpes until we\u2019d been having sex for a month into our initial relationship (which to this day I get tested regularly and thankfully have never had any sort of outbreak or positive test result and yes I know I should have left but I was stupid). Anyways fast forward 5 years she started acting extremely odd for about a month and then randomly and completely without warning decided to inform me one night in December 2023 that she\u2019d been cheating on me yet again, this time with a felon she met who was out on parole and that he was more exciting because he liked doing cocaine, smoking weed and getting drunk everyday and she liked being able to do that with him, but that she didn\u2019t want to lose me whatever the fuck that was supposed to mean, so we went through a weird 2-3 month phase that I don\u2019t know how to explain what was happening, honestly it\u2019s all kind of a blur at this point I was just in a daze by this point due to the situation but by February 2024 she said she was leaving me for him and they were engaged. So he went back to prison shortly after this and she decided to inform me that during this time she slept with another 33 people and then left him for another guy who from what I understand is a divorced fella who I\u2019m told by a mutual friend is a decent guy who divorced his wife after she cheated on him so I highly suspect he\u2019s unaware of what type of person my ex is. My ex and I viewed sex completely differently I don\u2019t believe in casual sex I\u2019m not a wait till marriage type but I think sex and committed relationships are the way to go.\n\nAnyways I subsequently lost everything the house, the bank accounts, the vehicles, all the assets we had because I had foolishly deluded myself over the years into believing that it would be better for it all to be in her name because her family were all narcissistic sociopaths who didn\u2019t like me. We came from vastly different cultures and economic circumstances she was a college educated medical field worker and I was just a lowly hourly wage worker with no college degree and they just hated me for it and I just wanted to try and make them hate me slightly less. Her parents had 7 kids aged like 40-18 and just treated each other and all the kids like absolute shit and were physically, mentally, emotionally abusive people who got married after they themselves had an affair with each other. Just absolutely horrible people, my exs father molested her when she was a kid and her mother called her a whore because of it. So it\u2019s not all that shocking my ex turned out to be the type of person she is. \n\nSo my entire world was shattered mostly because this was a woman I would have given a kidney to if she needed it I loved her very much, I was closer to her than I have ever been with anyone my own family included. But once it officially ended I had to rather abruptly move across the country to stay with family and I spent the first two months with my family drinking all day everyday and just trying to find a reason to live. All I walked away with besides some of what was in the house and the roughly $1k in cash I kept around for emergencies was the 3 dogs and the cat which ended up being the thing that kept me going they always meant the world to me, seriously my dogs and my cat saved my life. I didn\u2019t want to leave them alone in this world just because I felt like dying. So I slowly pulled myself together for them, Sadly a few months after this all happened my oldest dog who was also my first pet that I\u2019d ever had as an adult got a very aggressive form of cancer and I was forced to put her down which only furthered my depression. \n\nNow it\u2019s march 2025, I enrolled in college a few months ago and I\u2019m doing better than I ever did in school growing up I was always a C student but so far I\u2019ve gotten an A or A+ in every single assignment in college, my credit score is working its way back up into the 750 range after dropping over 200 points and I paid off what little debt i had, Im working towards buying my dream truck and my own land, I quit drinking everyday, I was able to quit smoking cigarettes, I\u2019ve started to reconnect with friends and family who stepped back from my life during my relationship because they hated the way my ex and her family would treat me, my 32nd birthday is next month and someone gave me an early birthday present which was something that in nearly 6 years together my ex never did, she never acknowledged anniversary\u2019s, birthdays, Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day nothing. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel somewhat hopeful for the future for the first time in a really long time but at the same time I still just feel so fucking empty and broken inside, I don\u2019t trust people anymore, I put on this fake smile and say I\u2019m fine when people ask but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ever going to be fully okay again. Ive always been a very trusting person towards everyone in general but now I view everyone and everything they do with suspicion.\n\nAll Ive ever wanted was to be married and be a good husband, have a few kids and be a good dad because I never knew my father, live on a little farm somewhere and have a quiet and simple life. And now I don\u2019t know how I feel about marriage or having a family of my own. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not that I have any sort of feelings for my ex other than disgust at this point she\u2019s honestly a real piece of shit as a human being, but I still have such a feeling of disappointment in myself for putting myself in that position for so long coupled with this weird feeling that I somehow failed. I saw the million red flags over the years and ignored them, I had multiple reasons to leave her a long fucking time before it all blew up but I didn\u2019t because I did love her and I always thought that meant your supposed to stick by your persons side even when they are shitty and help each other become better people. \n\nI learned an incredibly painful but ultimately extremely valuable life lesson which is don\u2019t ever ignore the red flags, don\u2019t ever tolerate being lied to by the person your choosing to spend your life with, don\u2019t ever tolerate cheating of any kind in a relationship because it will fundamentally change you as a person. \n\nI haven\u2019t worked my way back to trying to date or even spend time with anyone yet but I hope that maybe someday I\u2019ll meet a nice lady that I can trust and open myself up to again. But I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to feel alive and okay again. ",

This is the first death of someone close to me ive ever dealt with. I didn\u2019t tell her what happened because it didn\u2019t feel real yet, I just felt gray and empty. We had gotten into an argument about something and I said some insensitive things I wish I could have taken back. She was valid for leaving. I was just so angry at the world, and I took that out on her. I messed up. I didn\u2019t tell her what happened to my friend because I didn\u2019t want her to think I was trying to make a cop out, or to invalidate her feelings.  She said she was 100% done with me, it was really harsh, but I understood. It\u2019s been a week and last night I told her about what happened. I hadn\u2019t really told anyone. She seemed  to understand more  and said she understood why I did what I did, and she wishes I just talked to her about it. She said she wanted to take some time and to think about stuff and I agreed. She was giving me mixed signals all throughout  the day, which she admitted on the phone was definitely mixed signals. She was trying to get me to completely end things with her since we were still talking a little bit, just really made me feel shitty. But before we talked she was saying that she missed me and loved me, a few other things. She was getting angry with me on the phone for me trying to offer solutions on what I could do to make it up to her, and she said she was completely done. I texted her afterwards and I was really upset, im feeling really defeated. She now says she wants to wait until sunday and then talk again about it because I thought we should wait a few days to let things sit a little longer.she said she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll change. I\u2019m aware she\u2019s hurting, but I really don\u2019t know why she\u2019s doing this. It feels unfair, it hurts.im  mourning the loss of my best friend, and I just want her to be there for me in my time of need, but I also understand why she can\u2019t be there.

I\u2019ve never been career-driven, but I\u2019ve always worked hard. As an orphan, I have no one to fall back on. I am currently working two jobs.\n\nWhen we met, he was ambitious. He has a demanding job which led to a breakdown and he stopped for the time being. At the time, he hinted that I had influenced his decision to take the job and should have known he wouldn\u2019t cope. Since then, he hasn\u2019t been actively searching for another job but recently got a great offer in line with his original career goals. Yet, he doesn\u2019t seem keen to take it.\n\nI want him to decide for himself without feeling pressured by me, but I can\u2019t help feeling like I\u2019m working alone toward our future. Our progress towards a future has slowed down, and while I know he\u2019s struggling, I find it hard to be patient. I feel guilty for thinking this way. He is someone with a lot of potential, but i feel that given our different life circumstances, he does not quite share the same \u2018urgency\u2019 I feel regarding the need to work as hard for the future. \n\nI know our situations are different, but I don\u2019t know how to see things from his side while also staying true to my own feelings. Has anyone been through this? How do I balance supporting him with my need to move forward?",

We've had some rough patches but overall we have a pretty great relationship. We've been engaged for a while and just recently started planning our wedding for 2026. As far as I knew we were on the same page. We've looked at a venue. We agreed we both loved the venue so I put the deposit down. Now the issue started shortly after we started to plan. I noticed that everything I brought up about about the wedding seemed to annoy him. He would get snappy and seemed to get frustrated leading to some fights. Mostly him being angry and me being confused on what was happening. So after this happened a couple of times I asked him what was going on. Why is he so frustrated talking about something that's supposed to be joyful. He then decided to tell me that he actually doesn't want to get married. He's just doing it because I want to. His words. After this I was extremely hurt. I thought we were on the same page? I asked him why he asked me to marry him if he felt this way. He then said \"Because I knew you wanted it and I didn't want you to leave\" \nI feel deceived. I took a walk. When I came back I asked him if he was just scared or does he actually not wanted to get married? If he doesn't then he lied to me. \nI told hom that he needed to make up his mind on what he wants. If he doesn't want marriage it's not necessary the end but I feel lied too. This isn't the first time he's second guessed this relationship but this time feels different. He said he wanted this and now he doesn't? I don't know what to do from here. \nAdvice please.\nTLDR\nMy fiancee asked me to marry him and is now undecided about marriage and I told him to decided.\nAdvice please ...",

        "title": "I (22M) found out my gf (25F) has been breaking my boundaries and hiding things \u2014 can trust be rebuilt?",
        "content": "I met this girl in February last year, and at first, our relationship felt perfect. A bit about me: I was raised by a strict father\u2014an emotionless \u201cman of the house\u201d figure\u2014who valued discipline over affection. Growing up, I hated his way of doing things, and it shaped me to be the opposite: a caring and understanding person who prioritizes honesty and mutual respect in relationships. When we started dating, I shared my boundaries upfront. For example, I have strict rules about dress codes and how both partners should behave around the opposite gender, and I also mentioned that I wasn\u2019t comfortable being with someone who had a \"past.\" I wanted to be clear about these things from the beginning, and she fully agreed. For the first 8 months, everything was great\u2014her actions made me feel like we were on the same page and had built a strong foundation.\n\nBut as I became more involved in her life, things started to change. As I spent more time with her family and paid closer attention to her daily routines, small inconsistencies began to surface. I realized she didn\u2019t always follow the boundaries we had set, specifically when it came to how she dressed. It wasn\u2019t just that she broke these rules\u2014she was hiding it from me. For instance, when she went out with friends, she would send me pictures wearing \"appropriate\" outfits, only to change into something entirely different afterward. Similarly, every morning, I would drop her off at work, thinking she was dressed according to our agreement, but I later found out she would use the dressing room at her job to completely change her clothes after I left.\n\nThese actions really bothered me because they felt calculated, and they made me question what else she was hiding. I confronted her, and while she apologized, the trust I had in her started to unravel. Then, other concerns came up. She gave me access to her accounts to reassure me, and I retrieved data from one app with her permission, which revealed that she had recently removed multiple male friends. She claimed these were people from before our relationship and that it meant nothing\u2014but it only made me more suspicious given everything else I had found out. Around the same time, I also discovered something from her past that I didn\u2019t know prior: she used to sell or post explicit photos online. She insists that she stopped before our relationship started and swears she has never cheated. But the combination of her dishonesty about these things and her breaking the boundaries we agreed on has left me feeling like the trust between us is broken.\n\nNow, she\u2019s doing everything she can to try and fix things. I\u2019ve asked her for extremely difficult tasks\u2014things that seemed almost impossible\u2014to test how serious she is about making this work, and she\u2019s gone above and beyond to prove herself. She seems totally committed to rebuilding the relationship and showing me that she cares. But despite her efforts, I feel conflicted. On one hand, I still care for her greatly\u2014walking away would be painful. On the other hand, I\u2019m not sure if I can ever rebuild the trust I gave her so fully.\n\nTo complicate things even further, there\u2019s the cultural reality we live in. A woman with a \"past\" like hers faces heavy stigma in our community, and ending things would make her life significantly harder. She would likely face judgment from her family and others for the rest of her life, especially when it comes to marriage. I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m contributing to that, but at the same time, I feel like what we had has been damaged beyond repair, and I don\u2019t know how to move forward.\n\nHow do I process and navigate my feelings in a situation like this? Can trust like this ever realistically be rebuilt after so much has happened?",

My bf of 8 months calls me beautiful like 1-2 times per week. I talked about how I would appreciate if he did this more often (like 1-2 times per day) with my bf for quite a few times because nothing changes so I still try to remind him, how important for me it is to hear all those beautiful words and how it makes me feel loved. I hate to bring up the same problem over and over again but as i mentioned before, nothing changes and, to be honest, i can't understand why won't he do that because for me it looks so easy to implement in the everyday life, like after waking up just say not only \"good morning\" but \"good morning, beautiful\" and thats it, I'm happy (I've even given him examples like this so he doesn't have to come up with the words himself, just say them). I start to feel like I am emotionally withdrawing from him because of this, i get angry, irritated, and sad because I don't think I'm asking for something unreasonable, but I still don't get it. Everything else in our relationship is fine, but I need words of affirmation to feel loved. I also hate that I keep asking for something so small and have done so multiple times, yet he still doesn't follow through, even though he knows how much it means to me.\n\nHe gets irritated when I bring it up again, but like I said, I'm not happy because nothing is changing. So what would you do in my situation? Try to talk to him about it again or just give up?",

        "content": "This is a long story so please bear with me.\n\nI have a 4 year daughter and my brother has a 4 year old daughter.\n\nMy mam has always watched my brother's daughter for a couple of hours one day a week, she always did it begrudgingly but nevertheless she did it as my brother didn't have anyone else to have his daughter for a 2 hour window.\n\nThere has always been a degree of annoyance for me and my partner as our daughter has never had that weekly guaranteed bonding time with her grandma as we have never really needed it (only by working our jobs around childcare hours and so on).\n\nWhat happened consistently is my mam would always text to see our daughter when she was looking after my brother's daughter. Now I was quite often available that time as I was generally off the same days as her during the week. I used to meet up relatively often and they would play together.\n\nHowever I started to feel like she was using me a bit as it would make it easier for her to just bring my brother's daughter to my house and have a cup of tea while they played together.\n\nI started to make excuses and say that I wasn't free during the time she had my brother's daughter. I started to suggest other times and days, she wouldn't always be free when I'd suggest and if not she would go a week or two without seeing our daughter. I probably wasn't as flexible as I could have been but I was seeing if she would actually go out of her way more to make the effort or not.\n\nShe does work half the week and has 2 days off, them 2 days are the days she has free and generally does visits, she is never available on the weekend for either me or my brother. \n\nAnyway all of this got on top of me a bit, she had been a couple of weeks without trying to catch up and then she text to catch up again, and it was when she had my brother's daughter again. This struck a nerve and I ended up texting her back and angry response basically laying all of the above out. She was taken aback and started getting angry towards me too. She said she felt like she had to make an appointment to see me, that I never ask about her and so on (she never ever texts about her granddaughter)\n\nAnyway we stopped speaking. That same weekend she went for a day out on the weekend with my brother and his kid and posted it all over social media. Me and my partner were annoyed by this as it was almost intentional as she never usually sees either of us on the weekend. \n\nWe went months without speaking. It got to Christmas time and she posted a picture of her having a meal out with my brother and sister. She had never asked me.\n\nShe was going away for Christmas and she didn't arrange to see us or my daughter before she went away. She excluded me and my partner from presents BUT did get our daughter some presents. She handed them to my brother so that I got them when I met up with my brother (this was all just before Christmas).\n\nAnother month goes by and she texts saying she doesn't know why we are not speaking still. I say why and that all of the above was hurtful. We ended up in a bit of an argument again and she said she knows my partners removed her from social media. We ended up saying we will try and sort it out.\n\nI text her to catch up and talk a few weeks after. She never really said she was sorry about what she was posting on social media or anything she just said she was upset how the whole situation had gone about, that it made sense to her to see my daughter when she had my brothers daughter and so on. \n\nI asked her why she didn't try and arrange to see our daughter over Christmas and she said she wanted too she just didn't know where to put herself.\n\nAnyway it was kind of left as we are speaking and on OK terms. She hasn't spoke to my partner at this point.\n\nMy partner's birthday came and went and she didn't send a text or get her a birthday card or anything (she always has every year prior to this). I didn't expect her to get her a present as I think she was upset my partner deleted her off all social media.\n\nShe text me a day later asking if I was free the week after to catch up. I said yes.\n\nI said to my partner that I will be catching up with her and she will probably come to our house. Well that's where the argument started. My partner is very upset and still very angry towards my mum, she thinks her use of social media was nasty and that she should have made the effort to actually see her daughter over Christmas. My partner doesn't want her round our house. We ended up in an argument because all I want is peace and I just don't know where to place myself.\n\nHow do I move this situation forward? ",

She even had to go to the hospital due to depression over this topic.\n\nShe has this narrative that if we open the relationship, maybe she will learn to view sexual encounters as something mundane, and it may not trouble her anymore.

He\u2019ll say he\u2019s \u201changing out with a friend,\u201d and then I\u2019ll see pictures of him as the only guy in a group of seven girls I didn\u2019t even know existed. He\u2019ll have a girl over for dinner but won\u2019t explain their relationship. And I feel like if I ask for details, I\u2019ll sound like some crazy, possessive girlfriend.\n\ni want my boyfriend to have female friends. That\u2019s important to me. But something about this feels off, and I can\u2019t quite put my finger on what. and also the way he talks about \u201cwomen\u201d like it\u2019s all so mysterious and elusive and i wish he\u2019d tell me who and when. if i give someone else\u2019s opinion i tell him which friend said it and it what context. and he\u2019s the absolute best and so gentlmanly and caring and he always tells me that other men our age, don\u2019t do anything, that he is much more emotionally mature than them, and he thinks he\u2019s actually only doing the bare minimum, this makes me worry even more that he\u2019s one of a kind and makes me worry about losing him.",

        "title": "Rules of Islam are affecting my [27F] relationship with my mother [58F], how can we proceed?",
        "content": "Hello. This is a bit of a different kind of post as it's a question that is regarding my relationship with my mother.\n\nFor context, I grew up in a mixed-raced family. My father came from a family who were primarily Catholic, but they were not religious at all. He converted to Islam in order to marry my mother. Growing up, we were never taught how to pray or taught really anything about Islam. However every year we would fast and return to my mother's village and do charitable actions as a family. We grew up in an environment that did not always follow the rules of Islam, despite my mother being a Muslim.\n\nThese rules were not enforced in our home growing up. When I was younger, my parents would drink, smoke - not excessively at all but they would enjoy a glass or two of wine with dinner and my dad would regularly smoke weed. This was just an accepted part of our household. My parents came from two very different cultures and had to compromise on a lot of things.\n\nFast forward to today - I am a 28 year old woman living in my own home with my partner. We have been living together for over two years now. I have set up my own life, my own finances and have made my own choices that I feel are suddenly not accepted in our family home. My mother, as she got older, started to become more faithful to her religion. She has for many years stopped drinking anything and prays five times daily. It was a bit of a strange transition for the family, not her becoming more strict with her faith, but as I felt that suddenly things that were normal in my adulthood suddenly was receiving judgement and disapproval.\n\nWe have Eid upcoming, and my partner and I are doing Ramadan together. My family live abroad and I mentioned how I'd love to invite him to join the family for Eid. I was told by my mother that she forbids us to share a room together due to this being a holy month. I find this boundary extremely difficult to accept and it's causing us both a lot of pain and conflict. One because we have been in a family situation already together where we have shared a room, and two because it makes me feel like my choices as an adult are being dismissed. It feels like within my family home, the reality of my life as an adult has no space and it's very hurtful. It feels like I'm being asked to pretend I'm someone I am not in order to fit into an idea of how things should look. As far as I am aware, us sharing a room together has no affect on her - religiously speaking. It is my choice to do that, so any repercussions will be onto me, not her.\n\nI feel uncomfortable around my mother and it's causing me a lot of pain. I've said to her that I respect her boundaries and love her more than anything in the world, but I feel like this is a pick and choose mentality to suit her and what makes her feel comfortable. This is fair - she is entitled to that. It is her house after all and I respect that and her more than anything. I mentioned to her that a solution would be that either my partner and I celebrate Eid in our own home or that we stay somewhere else if we're visiting my family. This caused my mother to immediately start crying, which I feel so guilty about.\n\nI'd appreciate any advice, as this is causing a rupture in our relationship. This is simply a boundary I cannot accept, but I am at ease with that and happy to stay elsewhere when visiting family. I feel like that choice is hurting her a lot though. Is there anyone who has experienced a similar issue and how they were able to proceed from this?",

        "content": "Hi Reddit, this is my first time posting so I'm kinda nervous lol.\nFirst of all I apologize in advance for any typo as English is not my first language.\n\nSo I met my current gf on TikTok, she responded to one of my comments. We started talking and really got along well. \nOf course before everything I checked her IG account and it seems real. Real friends and real stories that go back to at least a year ago. She also shared with me some pictures of herself that she took on the spot and some childhood pictures. We videocalled multiple times and I can confirm that she's a real person. She also lives with her sister which I saw pictures of and I could hear her in the back of our videocalls watching TikTok. She was posted on a cafe's account that she went to with her friends and usually sends me pictures of what she eats or where she goes. I have seen some parts of her apartment in pictures, like books and figures she has.\nShe doesn't send me a lot of pictures of herself but it doesn't bother me so much as she mentioned she's not used to it and doesn't feel comfortable, but she still sends me ootd, her assignments and even pictures that we spoke of taking together.\nWe spoke of sending each other gifts for our birthdays and all kinds of things that people in LDR usually do.\n\nNow what's making me question it is that we actually started dating one week after we started texting and have now known each other for almost 3 weeks, so dating for a little more than a week. She also doesn't send me pictures of her at uni. People close to me have been telling me that a lot of scammers originated from her country and that they often try to get as close as possible to the target, which is making me really nervous the more I think about it. She has, so far, never asked me for money and even bought me stuff that she says she plans on giving me when we finally meet.\nI'm really scared that I'm getting love bombed, as we often text each other some really couply sweet stuff, but at the same time I don't wanna doubt her and hurt her, as I am her first girlfriend and I really do like her a lot. Also, of course I am aware that not everyone that is in this kind of situation is a scammer, but it does sound very similar.\nShe is burmese who currently lives in Thailand btw.\n\nI am open to any advice at this point.\nThank you for reading.",

We clicked and we talked for hours and hours. 2 days like that and we switched to whatsapp.. This was the work form home era. we haven't met yet.\n\nWe used to talk for hours, we liked eachother but the girl was already engaged and I was chasing someone.

I heard but didn't respond with a yes or no.. she said I love you. I said I love you too.\n\nIt was almost 40 days before her wedding and things with the guy she was marrying weren't great though. I tried to tell her that she should call off the wedding and be with me instead.\n\nShe was 3 years older, earning 3x of what I did and we had never met irl. Also it was a love marriage that was based on practical decisions so she couldn't bail out at the final moment. (as agreed by most of Indian girls)\n\nWe took a pause of 2 3 4 days but we did talk after that. We continued. we were happy, compatible and I was therefor her when the things in her marriage were going wrong. Terrible things, the guy was decent but emotionally unavailable.\n\nSo I was there for her, I always wanted to be with her, I asked her on Jan 2024 if she'll be leaving the husband for me. she said no. He's my friend and I can't hurt him. then I said you're not happy with him, she said atleast I'm not unhappy. (till this timw we were in the same city and used to hang out quite often)\n\nBut when she said she'll not leave the husband, I started pulling myself out of the equation slowly. From January to April I was getting emotionally detached because there was no future together for us.\n\nI left and didn't talk for 3 months, and by that time there was another person 24F who came into my life and everything just happened. I thought it would be fine, may be it's the timing and it would be more practical for me to pursue her because I'll have a potential future with her.\n\nSo we started dating, by then I was moving ahead with the 24F and was not talking to the 30F. 3 months later, a common friend of me and 30F said that we should talk.. irrespective of the differences we had.. (the friend doesn't know we were dating)\n\nWe talked again, so at that point I was talking to both 24F and 30F. 30F had somehow started talking to her husband for divorce because she wanted me, in the last 3 months she realised that the marriage isn't working and she wants me. (my absence made her realise that).\n\nShe told him that she likes me, but didn't tell that I liked her too as she didn't want to push that on me and took the fall alone.\n\nThe husband actually became a friend over time and he once said I was his 2nd best friend and that too was the reason I left because I didn't want to hurt him so bad, that he'll have life long trust issues.\n\nBut when 30F reached out to me for taking things forward, I said I have nothing to do with your divorce, I said mean things, I behaved badly and I was not the nicest person to someone who really loved and cared for me. I once told her that I never asked her to do all that and she can't just come out of the blue and ask me to take things forward.\n\nThis was also because I was seeing the 24F. But I was talking to both 24F and 30F, at some point I realised that I don't have a future with 24F due to cultural issues and she won't talk to her parents at all. But my feelings were inclined towards the 24F while I was detached from 30F.\n\n30F did her best to get me back, just sacrificed her ego/self respect and tried relentlessly to get me back for 8 months. May to Dec 2024.\n\nBut during that time, I had broken up with 24F citing there was no future, but later I thought of making up with her as even I can talk to her parents directly for the marriage and stuff. So I was entirely focused on 24F while overlooking the efforts 30F had put in. \n\nAfter a time when I realised 24F wasn't worth the efforts as she doesn't want to be with me. Over the time I tried to get back with her. (Aug 2024 to Jan 2025). I had finally lost feelings for 24F.\n\nBy the time, (this can be a dick move) I realised that 30F was always there for me. (We did have complications in the initial period 1.5 years and I was often illtreated or things were traumatic) \n\nI reached out to 30F, that I wanted to see her and fix things. She was filled with Joy and really wanted to reconnect. (little did I know there will be a surprise)\n\nI flew back to her city, after traveling for 8 9 days in some trip. I reached in the afternoon and I was supposed to meet her after that, my friend said you've just come up. have lunch and then you can go. I went for lunch with them and after that he said have medicine and rest for sometime. I did but I slept for 6 fucking hours, I unintentionally stood her up. when I woke up I called her that sorry I messed it up, I slept. I wanna fix this but she said if I really wanted this I would've made it.\n\nThat's why I'm not getting confidence from you, then we had a fight and we didn't meet the next morning either. I had a flight back in the evening.\n\nThen again we didn't meet and we fought afterwards and then we didn't talk at all.\n\nAfter 1.5 months, I dreamt of her and I reached out to her saying I'm sorry and I really wanna make things work. Can we talk.\n\nWe talked the next day, she told me there was a guy since December she was talking to, the vibes matched but she would've left him if I would've met her in January which I royally fucked up. Now when I'm saying I'm willing to do everything to fix this, she says that she likes the other guy and wants to make this work. the other guy is 35M, getting his divorce finalized next month.\n\nIn June, when she asked her husband for divorce, he said if 27M is willing to be with you, then it's fine to take the divorce but what if he's not interested. 30F reached out to me after that and asked if I would talk to her husband. Then I had said that I have nothing to do with her divorce.\n\nBut this 35M says that, how will her husband not give divorce, let my divorce get finalized, then I'll talk to him directly.\n\nShe quoted this to me, saying that's what gives me confidence that I can go and talk to my husband right away about this 35M guy.\n\nSo now that I really want to be with 30F, I have no way to be back with her and all the things I tell her, she says she'll block me if I try to get back with her. (can be friends but not romantic partners)\n\nSo I don't know now, what to do and how can I fix this. Only if I would've met her in January, things would've been entirely different but now it's out of my control.\n\nHow to get her back?\n\n(TL;DR - Guy meets girl, falls in love, falls out of love, finds someone else. 1st girls tries her best to be with guy. Guy doesn't appreciate and treats her badly, when guy wants 1st girl back, there's a new guy in girl's life.)\n",

His family already couldn't keep up with his hospital bills so I asked them for permission to post on social media using his account. I didn't know the passwords on his account but I know his email so I just reset the password. Ever since, we did not really open or looked through each other's phone because we trust each other. Our relationship is very happy and peaceful which I loved. After opening his accounts on social media, I tried to read conversations and I found his conversation with his ex. The conversation did not make sense so I assumed there was deleted messages already. Since I can't confront him about it, I tried messaging the girl and she told me that they last saw each other last December, before he was hospitalized and that he denied having a partner. I tried asking for more details but sadly she did not respond already. It sucks that my questions can't be answered by him. I can't just stop visiting him because I'm afraid his family might think that I already left him because of his situation?",

I\u2019m always at the top of her search history. \n\nI mainly use discord, where she often asks who I\u2019m DMing when she sees someone she doesn\u2019t know. \n\nI\u2019ve lately been doing better, had a few health issues that isolated me. I can again enjoy going outside, going for a drink with colleagues, or just enjoy activities that I don\u2019t do in front of a computer. Which means I don\u2019t appear online as much, and she\u2019s been asking me what I was doing, if i was outside, when I stopped work.\n\nI don\u2019t like this at all. I hate that feeling of being monitored, I\u2019ve been a very solitary person and value being able to have my own world, where I do things I enjoy without having to report about it. Ive never been with someone who controls me this much, I\u2019ve only dated people like me.\n\nShe\u2019s a quite jealous person, has attachment issues and separation anxiety, and is totally aware of it.

Initially the guy was nonchalant and I had to teach him everything, he\u2019s a nice guy and he wanted to learn he even learnt and did everything that he could. But there is one aspect that was always missing. The sexual aspect, even though we made out, but the passion always lacked I didn\u2019t feel the spark.. I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t approach to have sex till a year. had when he had, I didn\u2019t feel it. I just don\u2019t feel the passion and the spark and I think we are not compatible in this terms. We also also don\u2019t have sex very often. I think in two years of relationship. It\u2019s been only four or five times we have had tried having sex, and I think this lack of physical intimacy is making me lose interest and making me feel trapped. I am in a living relationship with this guy and I don\u2019t know why I want to reconsider things but at the same time I don\u2019t want to hurt him but I can\u2019t keep on my mental health too. He is such a nice guy to lose, but I can\u2019t compromise on things that matters too I just don\u2019t know what to do and this is eating me from inside. I don\u2019t know how to figure things out and in which direction to possible go?, further iam afraid of changes. Also, sometimes I feel I will not get a good boyfriend like him and who will love me the way he does all I will feel very secure the way I do with him.

        "content": "Hi, so I (F/21) was in a bad relationship when I was younger, and for the ending years of that relationship when it was more of me just being used for sex, I realized that I was actually a bit terrified of the guy (he doesn\u2019t really matter so I won\u2019t give details on him). What I mean is that I truly adored the guy while I was simultaneously going into fight or flight every time I was around him because he scared the emotional shit out of me (as my therapist said). So anyway to the real problem, I have realized that since that relationship which was a couple years ago I can no longer function normally around a person the second I develop feelings for them. Even just attraction. My heart starts beating really fast at the mere mention of saying good morning and I can hardly look them in the eye without feeling like my nerve fibers are going to burst (not in a good way). My voice gets really quiet, and I (a really chatty person) can\u2019t say a single thing. It\u2019s like a switch flips, and even though I was perfectly normal with them the day before, after I have that first thought oh he\u2019s cute, I shut down. The only way I could describe it is like an acute intense fear mixed with hi I like you, exactly the way I felt towards the guy in the bad relationship at the end of it. I don\u2019t know how to fix this because I wasn\u2019t always like this. Ive had chemistry that you read about in books (at least it felt like it) and I knowwwww how to flirt. But I no longer can and it\u2019s really affecting everything because now my entire atmosphere is shrouded in fear and anxiety knowing that person is in the building, like I absolutely have to fix this. Had anyone experienced this after an extremely bad relationship that happened way too young? Does anyone have tips on how to get over something like this or literally any comment on the situation?? I could really use some advice :)\n",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm reaching out for advice on how to navigate a challenging situation in my marriage. My wife (F30) and I (M30) have been experiencing a tough year. She's been dealing with depression and was recently diagnosed with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), which makes her extremely self-conscious about her appearance. Whenever I try to compliment her or discuss her looks, she becomes defensive and angry, insisting I'm lying to her.\n\nOver the past two months, things have taken a turn for the worse. She's become increasingly withdrawn, spending most of her time on the couch, crying for hours. Today was particularly difficult. She lashed out at me over some unwashed dishes from last night's dinner, calling me dirty and disgusting, and saying I'm an idiot for forgetting to turn on the washing machine. The situation escalated to screaming, and I left the room to avoid further conflict, as I'm not confrontational in high-emotional scenarios.\n\nI'm at a loss for what to do. I feel like I've tried being supportive and understanding, but it seems like nothing is working. I'm worried that if things continue this way, divorce might be the only option left. Has anyone else dealt with similar situations? How did you manage to improve your relationship or find a way forward?",

        "content": "my boyfriend and i have been kind of on and off for two years now. this last year was particularly rough. both of us have trust issues and we fell into a toxic pattern. but i\u2019d rather try over a million times with him than start over with anyone else.\n\nbasically almost a month and a half ago(?) he broke up with me. he said he didn\u2019t like where hes at in life and feels like i suffocate him. ofc i tried to compromise but i know what he means. in our two years, this past year in particular, i grew increasingly codependent on him for socialization. I asked if we could maybe try again in a few months so i could get my act together, as well as him. \n\ni\u2019m also not where i want to be in life- though i don\u2019t think most 21yos are tbh. However, i do admit ive been lazy and not really productive in trying to improve my situation which is also frustrating for my boyfriend. he told me he wanted a partner he could see a life with, not someone he had to take care of which is completely understandable i feel. so im trying to find better employment and im going back to school. \n\nevery one of my friends thinks im delusional for thinking we\u2019d get back together, but my boyfriend agreed to it. well he said we would see in a few months how we\u2019re both feeling and maybe we could in fact try again. we promised each other we wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone else romantically.\n\nwe still text here and there. we call somewhat. it\u2019s been really hard for me. especially because my family as well as some friends lay it on thick about how i really don\u2019t seem to understand how \u201cmen think.\u201d i personally feel like a lot of my family and friends have been burned by relationships and they kind of collectively think all men are the same. \n\nthey say my boyfriend is only saying this to keep me interested in him while he talks to other women etc. i\u2019ve had a lot of trust issues and i constantly questioned my boyfriend and his actions the past year- and to his credit he tried really hard to show me his efforts in easing my overthinking. even still i took it too far at times and didn\u2019t trust him when i should\u2019ve. i\u2019m trying hard to not make the same mistakes. \n\ni think although we have been toxic this past year there is still a lot of love. and i have high hopes we can overcome any obstacles. im trying hard to trust and believe him but im at a loss here. do i seem stupid for thinking we can work everything out in a few months? \n\ni am trying hard to prove to him i can be a better partner. and i know hes a bit depressed at the moment so im hoping in a few months time he\u2019ll feel more confident in himself. i know there\u2019s things he wants to do as well like go back to school etc. We are also long distance so i think at times it felt like both of us put in so much time trying to make sure the other one felt secure instead of trying to pursue what we really wanted in life i guess. i know you can make it work while achieving both which is what im hoping for.

We both were living together and fights started to emerge and went on to become bigger than one another. I haven\u2019t hurt her physically up until then. But I was not well mentally and when the fights went to almost hurting each other physically (which we did) I hurt her physically very much. I sincerely apologized her and told I can understand her decision if she wants to leave all of this and to start a fresh life and that I\u2019ll support in whatever way I can for that. But she said she forgave me, so I started changing everything in every way possible to make her life peaceful and happy and comfortable. I did everything she told me she wanted and things I told her which are good for her in terms of work and peace and everything. Few months later, started talking to another guy who she met like few months ago and told him each and everything about us. He and all of her friends told her to leave me. But she used to make believe me that she still wants me and used to meet and talk and go to drive with the third guy and I even found them sleeping together (not sex) and also she told me that she got trauma because we became physical before which she did not approve but also said that she became physical with me because of her love towards me and few days passed by I found marks on her neck (which I strongly believe are hickeys). She said she is just talking to him because of work and sometimes the words he is saying about my behavior with her is giving her assurance. I strictly told her to block him and whatever problems she has\u2026 I\u2019m ready to support her and I stood by her all times and supported her whenever she was mentally low and financially as well. But she broke up with me later and I said ok and went on with my life and few days later she told me that she realized that I need to be in her life. And I told her that I don\u2019t want the third guy. But still she talked to him in video calls, chats, snaps and met him behind my back. So I backed off and went my way and she started crying that I left her alone and asked me another chance to prove her efforts. But I found her with him several times and later she even told me that I\u2019m stalking and all the things I did for her\u2026 she said have I asked you to do that?. I am focusing on my mental and physical conditions right now. All of sudden, she is getting tensed about her career and everything and is texting me about how she is not able to manage everything and she is mentally down. She wants to stay for a couple of days with me now\u2026 but said that her family won\u2019t approve of us living together when I asked to live with me (this is after the break up). I told her that if anything I can do to help her in her life, I will do it but if I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t. I even believe she is living with the new guy now. I don\u2019t why she is still talking to me right now. I already feel very low that I hurt the person whom I love the most with my own hands. I mean if she is happy with the new guy, I\u2019m happy for her too. But why is she not stopping to be in touch with me? Please guide me what to do right now. ",

I struggled for years feeling as though i\u2019d never find anyone but with him it was so easy, everything felt natural. Sex has always been a strange topic in our relationship. Among some other small issues, I had a difficult time hearing that he didn\u2019t want to have sex with me, which was relatively common. I felt hurt whenever he said no and i\u2019ve worked on it since. I, on the other hand, have never said no. I don\u2019t know if it makes me weird or him weird but it seems like i have a thousand times the sex drive he does. A couple months ago he started a full time job. He works early mornings about 9 hours a day monday-friday. This obviously affected the time we had together so we started to see eachother after he worked. His job affected his energy level and would often sleep when he came to my house. Which made us have sex much less because he was always too tired. As time has gone on, the frequency of us having sex has plummeted to basically once a month! Which i find crazy. I feel for him, but We\u2019re teenagers, we\u2019re not an 80 year old married couple. It\u2019s not that i\u2019ve stopped asking or trying to get him interested, I try most every time we hang out, getting turned down each and every time. it\u2019s extremely frustrating. I\u2019ve tried to talk to him regarding the reasons for this and how we can work on it together, and all he says is that he does want to, is still attracted to me, and is just too tired. I understood that reason, but after a while i cannot help but think it has to be something he isn\u2019t telling me. Maybe in an attempt to protect my feelings. we have had this conversation many times and still nothing much changes. And it makes me feel stupid begging my own boyfriend to have reluctant sex with me. I want to feel close and intimate with him again. I\u2019m constantly trying to make myself as \u201calluring\u201d as i can to try to convince him, it\u2019s extremely frustrating because it never works! I\u2019ve told him this in conversations and he feels bad for how it makes me feel, but i continue to think that it\u2019s not going to change, he\u2019s just not a very sexually charged person.

        "title": "My (M30) and my husband\u2019s (26M) marriage is slowly dying due to bitterness built up over the years. Can therapy help us come back?",
        "content": "My husband and I have been married for 3.5 years, and together for almost 8 years total. We met while working as restaurant waitstaff in late 2016. He was undocumented and I was a citizen. We started dating in mid 2017 and our relationship on a mutual attraction, we found each other attractive, and I liked his down to earth, practical, and hard working demeanor. Things for the first couple of years were not easy. Both of our families (we are from the same country) are very religious and our gay relationship was not accepted. We had to hang out in my car every time we wanted time together, or go to a movie or restaurant, even get a hotel room for...the deed. Eventually, his family accepted me, but mine is still refusing to meet him despite my encouragement. We have both now moved away from family and have been living together in a small basement apartment for 4 years, but still visit family on a weekly basis. \n\nOn to the problems: I believe the biggest chunk of the problems stems from my inability to help him with his immigration status. Back when we started going out, we were afraid that he could be deported at any given moment. Like the naive person that I was, I told him that he could just say that we were engaged, thinking that that would magically solve the situation should he be arrested. This, of course, is not how things work, and I admit that I never bothered back then to educate myself on how things actually worked. \n\nOne day, he asked me if I thought it would be a good idea to apply for political asylum, seeing as he had previous experiences in his country that may make him qualify. But he also told me that he wouldn\u2019t be able to visit his country should his asylum be granted. He would leave the majority of his family behind, including his sick grandmother, who helped raise him. I told him yes, anything that can help him from being deported would be good, thinking that staying in this country would be the best for him. I also offered him on more than one occasion, money to help pay lawyer fees. He refused the money, I believe be cause he was trying to be kind to me. \n\nFlash forward a couple of years and nothing has come of the asylum application. The only other way I can see for him to stay safe in the country is to marry him and help him get his green card (for those that don\u2019t know, getting this would allow him to be a resident of the US, but still travel to visit his country.) But at the time, I was dealing with my own mental health issues, that I was seeing therapists for. I wanted to be in a better place, feel more ready before I took that step. I realize that everyone is entitled to marry only when they feel ready, but perhaps I was wrong to not realize that my and his situation was not like everyone else\u2019s. For him there was a ticking clock, and all I was doing was delaying the possibility of giving him help based on my comfort. Maybe I could have married him earlier even if it was just to put it on paper. \n\nEventually, we did marry in late 2021, five months after I moved in with him into the apartment we now share. We then quickly sent an application for me to sponsor him to get his residency, thanks to us now being married. It took about 2 years for USCIS to give us news on the application, and they denied it. It broke my heart to hear the news. He had tried so hard, and done everything by the book, and he is such a diligent, positive person that any country would be better for having him. And I felt so useless for not being able to help. The one thing I could provide, the one way that I could show him thanks for being by my side during my dark days recovering from my mental health problems, and it was taken away. I hadn\u2019t understood him or the hurdles he faced in our early years, but after going through some of the process with him, and meeting the lawyers in the years following the marriage, I had a better understanding. But those two years of waiting for a response took their toll on him. His grandmother died in that time, and he wasn\u2019t able to properly say goodbye. Every spring and fall he would become sad and anxious, as he would remember his country through the change in the seasons. At times he would be annoyed with me, or we would argue over small things, and our intimacy also started to suffer. Sometimes, we would go weeks, or even months without acting like a couple, just living together and giving each other space, like cautious roommates. In those two years we also had a lot of arguments as to whether I was wrong to wait so long to marry him, eventually culminating in me crying one night and apologizing for having it all done my way, because I felt everything was done at my pace, without regards to him. This made things better for a while, but we eventually returned to the same.\n\nRecently, I wrote a letter to him (I express myself better in writing, thinking and talking in the moment is too difficult and I sometimes forget things I want to say) explaining the changes that I\u2019ve noticed: that there is no more intimacy, that we don\u2019t spend much time together, that we argue when we do, that he seems to be annoyed with my personality and my way of enjoying things, and that he seems generally disinterested in me. I also told him how I noticed that everyone else seemed to be able to make him happy, he smiles and plays and laughs around our friends, but around me, that\u2019s rare. It wasn\u2019t so much  a critique of his behavior, but rather a way for me to organize everything I noticed, and away to pose a question: was I seeing a problem in the relationship, or was I misunderstanding him fundamentally? Was he just such an independent and self sufficient person that he didn\u2019t need to rely on someone else to feel good, and thus he was ignorant of the fact that someone like me would need his attention to feel good? Or was our relationship slowly dying? I tried making it clear to him that I need that attention, the physical displays of affection, and that I wanted someone who wants me. \nHe responded by saying that he has been struggling lately. The years of feeling like he was giving to me without getting anything back (referring to me putting off marrying him) turned him off to me. He says he no longer has that physical attraction, like his body formed a rejection to me. He says he still loves me as we have spent a lot of time together, and we have a lot of good memories, but he wonders if I would be happier with someone else, because over the years he seems to return to that same bitterness about my inaction time and time again. It seems to me that despite the years of trying to defend myself, and eventually giving up and accepting his point of view, he can\u2019t forgive me. I\u2019ve really tried for years to be a better person in our marriage than the person I was when we were just boyfriends, but maybe it\u2019s too late and it\u2019s out of my hands. The letter and subsequent conversation we had opened my eyes too, to the resentment that I feel after years of feeling blamed for doing what I thought was right. Not only that, I feel now that maybe our relationship is marked forever, and as long as I am in it he will remember how I\u2019ve wronged him. Furthermore I feel that he might be happier going back to his country to see his family again instead of living in a country that doesn\u2019t want him. The only reason he stayed here was because he wanted to be with me. Being married to me is what keeps him chained here, and seeing as I am useless in helping him gain his green card, I\u2019m starting to think that maybe he also would feel happier with someone else. \n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t want to live with any regrets, and in order to make such a big decision as breaking this off, I want to make sure I tried my best to save it first. Hence the couples therapy. Does anyone think that therapy would help alleviate the problems, or are we wasting time and money?\n\nTLDR: My husband is undocumented and I,  a citizen. We started dating in 2017. He was stuck between two worlds, missing his family in his country and wanting to stay with me here. I could have helped him get his green card by marrying him, but I wanted to be in a better place with my mental health treatments first, so I put it off for a couple of years. We eventually married, applied for his green card, and were denied after 2 year of waiting. The nostalgia and resentment he felt across the years have started to affect the relationship making him disinterested and cold with me. And his disinterest and coldness have made me resent him. We both have started thinking if we would be happier with other people. Would couples therapy help us resolve some of these problems, or would we be wasting time?",

        "content": "My friend, [F24] asked me for advice about a current dilemma she's facing. She feels hurt because her boyfriend (M25) left for a one-week trip without her. She had money saved up but spent it thinking they weren\u2019t going to go on the trip. Months earlier, they both agreed that they wouldn\u2019t go through with the trip, but last week, her boyfriend decided to go anyway. She didn\u2019t want to seem rude by asking him to stay because she knows he\u2019s never traveled before, and she didn\u2019t want him to resent her for making him stay. But now, she\u2019s saying she feels abandoned and feels terrible for feeling this way. \n\nHe pointed out that, in the past, she went on a 3-day trip without him, and he wasn\u2019t upset about it. However, he really feels sorry for the last-minute change in his plans. Because of this, my friend feels extremely guilty for confronting him about it. She told him that it was okay for him to go (after a long argument) because, in the end, she\u2019d rather feel sad and be home alone than be with him for that week, knowing he\u2019d feel bad about not going. \n\nShe\u2019s asking for advice on how to deal with her feelings, and I\u2019m not sure what to suggest to her. Any thoughts?",

        "title": "F29 partner says she doesn't feel heard, but neither do I F29, would you break up over this?",
        "content": "My girlfriend and I were pretty much moved into together. I had moved into her place and the lease on my flat was ending in 2 weeks. \n\nJust last weekend, whilst I was away, she had a group of friends over for a game night. She didn't tell me about it till after the fact and when she did tell me she texted me, because I was still away, \"Everyone came over to mine\". In hindsight, I think the use of the word \"mine\" to refer to the place that was supposed to now be ours triggered me and I was quite upset that I hadn't been told that that was her plan that day. I felt kind of stupid for feeling that way and was still away and busy spending time with friends so I decided to bring it up when I got back home rather than starting a text conversation about how this had upset me as things tend to get misconstrued over text. I was also kind of hoping I would get over my upset feelings about it too and wouldn't have to bring it up if I'm honest because I felt stupid for being mad at her for having people over at her own house. \n\nWhen I got home she was really happy to see me and I tried to greet her affectionately but it definitely came out half hearted and she noticed. Whilst I was getting a drink I also noticed that in the recycling pile there were loads of drink cans, and realised that as well as having everyone over they'd also drunk more than half of my personal drinks (soda's). I looked in the fridge and though the game night had been a day ago now and she hadn't been doing anything today, she hadn't replaced them or even acknowledged with me that they'd drunk them. This further added to my upset. I now take full accountability for the fact that I didn't act my best from this point on - in my upset, I continued putting my stuff away but couldn't make eye contact with her and so she eventually went upstairs. I followed after a second and told her I'm a bit annoyed right now so, I'm just going to sit down stairs for a bit. She said upsettedly, is it because of her and I told her I wasn't ready to talk about it, she said OK then it is because of her and then asked me to tell her what she'd done. I told her I wasn't ready so I went downstairs. I sat on the sofa for maybe 10 minutes and collected myself then went upstairs agaim and calmly explained what had upset me. She was actually very understanding and told me that my feelings were valid but she told me off for the way I ignored her for a bit instead of coming straight out with it. I told her I was sorry and explained where my mind had been at. All seemed resolved and we continued chatting then went to sleep. \n\nHowever the next morning she told me she wasn't over it and she still was mad at the way I reacted. My reaction was too big for the size of the issue. I agreed and explained that I think I had had a build up of emotion regarding other things that I had planned to bring up in our check-in scheduled for the following day but things just caught up to me and spilled over before I even realised. We talked and talked and she said she wasn't ready to move in anymore amd she wanted me to keep my flat, but stay living with her. My first reaction to this was obviously not immediate agreement to that because I'd already handed in my notice and moved in - I was panicking to be honest. I asked what me keeping the flat symbolised for her if I wasn't going to live there - did she want it so that she could send me back there if she needed space from me? She said no - she just wanted us to slow down. I said, I feel sure about us moving in but she's right, we need to be on the same page. I wasn't happy about keeping my flat though so I asked her if we could consider some other options for how we could slow down. For example, I could keep the remaining furniture from my flat in storage so I'm not completely committed to her place or I could find a new flat closer to her (my current flat was 1 hour away). But she was addiment me keeping my current flat was the only solution but I just really didn't want to do that. After a time, I eventually told her the relationship was the most important thing to me and if that' what she needed that is what I would do and I will also go see a therapist about my big reactions. I said I would call my landlord the next day. \n\nAfter sleeping on it though, I decided I needed a little more time to decide whether that was the right move for me - I didn't want to mess my landlord around - so I said to her I just needed a few more days to see if I could settle that option in my mind or whether I would feel better to end my current tenancy as planned and find a new flat closer to her. She said that was fine and thank you for telling her. Over the next day her demeanor really changed towards me, she was polite but not affectionate and she was distant. I tried to be as normal as possible but I could feel the shift. She then told me she wanted me to go back to my flat for a few days so she could have time to think and calm down. I agreed but said I would go to my mum's. In my head I just really couldn't go back to the flat - all my stuff was at hers, the flat was basically empty. I would feel awful being there. I thought she wanted me to go for 2 nights but then she said 3 - I asked if she could reconsider after 2 and let me know if she would be ready to talk the but if not, then I would stay away for 3. I asked her if we could talk on the phone whilst I was away and she said we could text but not phonecall. I left and over the next day she didn't initiate any contact with me. I checked in with her at night and in the morning and said I loved her when I did. Her responses were half hearted. I knew she was going to end things and she did. She said she didn't feel heard and that we weren't compatible because I like quality time and she doesn't care about it, she no longer wants to kiss me and she doesn't have the energy to wait for me to sort my reactions out in therapy. I tried to convince her to reconsider and probably made things worse but I just didn't want to lose her without even trying to save the relationship.\n\nI just don't understand how I didn't make her feel heard when I accepted what she wanted, just in an effort not to completely self-abandon, I tried to ask for her to consider a different way of going about things.\n\nI'm now going to see her again when she helps me move my stuff out of her flat. I don't know how to act - I will of course be kind but I just don't know if I should try talking to her about it all again.\n \nCan anyone help me process this?",

I had a lot going on in terms of family and health problems throughout this time, and he\u2019s always been there for me. When we were 18, he confessed feelings for me. He said he was in love with me and asked if I reciprocated. We were both moving away for college, but he was willing to uproot his life and come to mine so we could be together. At the time, I had never even kissed anyone before. I didn\u2019t really know what it was like to \u201clike\u201d someone that way, and with my particular upbringing, I had no understanding of what a good partner or loving relationship even looked like. I kindly turned him down, saying I didn\u2019t want to lose our friendship. After almost a year of distance, both intentional and circumstantial, we got close again. We\u2019ve since been very close (when we\u2019d both come home for breaks we\u2019d see each other, but obviously we weren\u2019t in the same cities anymore most of the time), and I\u2019ve been with a couple partners since. I need advice on how to determine what I\u2019m feeling. \nRecently, I\u2019ve had some thoughts cross my mind as to how he would be a good partner - understanding what I want out of a relationship which is a deep friendship at its core. And at the same time, the thought of being with him makes me feel super uncomfortable and scared. I definitely think he\u2019s an attractive person, but as my friend, he can push so many buttons I wonder if he would drive me crazy as a partner. Our friendship feels sibling-like because I care for him and would prob do anything for him, but he also annoys me and gets on my nerves. There was one time during college when I was doing very badly, and he flew out to come see me. But never since that one conversation when we were kids have lines ever been blurred both in conversation or physically. \nFrom an outside perspective, does it seem like I have feelings for him? Or is this just a pure friendship? Do you think he might have feelings for me still? \nI appreciate him so much, I don\u2019t want to risk losing this friendship - if I were to pursue something with him, it would have to be endgame. \n\nTldr: how could I know if I like my best friend romantically?

But since I broke the news to my boyfriend he told me he didn\u2019t want to go. He told me that it makes sense for me to go and that we could be long distance. Now he and I have tried living out of state before for a couple years and relocated back to our original state due to homesickness. Since we have move back we no longer live together and live an hour away. I think it has put a strain on our relationship. He has made friends and almost completely forgets about me some days if I don\u2019t text him first. I don\u2019t think we are strong enough for a long distance relationship but he thinks otherwise. I tried to talk to him about it again and he says I\u2019m attacking. Maybe I am but he refuses to communicate with me on hard topics like this. Up to this point he has been withdrawing himself from our relationship and it seems like he is trying to get me to leave him. We have almost grown apart and I have tried everything to try and get us back on track and reignite our relationship but he fights me and says we\u2019re fine. I feel alone in this relationship and like the man I fell in love with has left me and been replaced with an imposter. I am not sure what to do, I don\u2019t want to break up with him but at this point it seems like all signs are pointing to me leaving him. There has no longer been any talk of marriage by him and if there is talk it\u2019s me. We have been together for almost 6 years and yet have not talked about getting married since 2021 when we were together for 2 years. I am so lost and do not know what to make of this. ",

        "content": "\n\nHello, \n\nI had been very close to a guy. Let\u2019s call him Alex.\nAlex and I have met somehow, at first I wasn\u2019t fond of him. Later on, though at that time we were friends for about 6 months; he was a better friend of mine than most of the people I have known for years. \n\nWe had been close for 2.5 years or so, before he blocked me on everywhere last summer. Unfortunately, on some occasions I had always been rude to him. This was because I have been diagnosed with OCD and paranoia years ago and it affected how I tend to act like on my relationships. \n\nThis paranoia caused me to always question his love, and his \u201chonesty\u201d. Sometimes, I felt like he didn\u2019t care about me and I had always been extremely vocal about my feelings. You know when you are vocal about your feelings and ask stuff like \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong brother why don\u2019t you want to hang out with me? Do you not care about me?\u201d even though it\u2019s actually not about you but rather they are just busy with their lives. It\u2019s really annoying to ask these type of questions, I figured out later.\n\nThroughout the whole friendship, I had gotten on his nerves a lot by questioning these above. Pushing him to \u201cmeet me\u201d even though he was busy. We fought multiple times and he always tried to help me and talk it off rather than ghosting me etc. Now that I think about it, nobody could handle a person like me for such a long time without blocking or cutting all the ties off. I acted like as if we were dating rather than being friends lol.\n\nLast summer he was hanging out with his friends in a row, I did the same thing again. I blamed him for not sparing time for me. This time he started not to reply to my texts and calls. I tried contacting him for a week, texting him everyday with long paragraphs. He ghosted every single of it then blocked me after I stopped trying. \n\nBlocked off calls, sms, instagram, whatsapp. All of it. It was so hard to cope with it but I overcame it after two months or so.\n\nNow, it\u2019s been 9 months and I have grown up and understood all my wrongdoings and faults despite initially blaming him for \u201cblocking me for no reason\u201d. I really want to get in touch with him again. I know his place, I was thinking of sending him a birthday gift. When it\u2019s his birthday, it\u2019s going to be a whole year since we talked for the last time.\n\nDespite everything he always called me \u201ca very special guy\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t met anybody like you\u201d. We were really like brothers, it wasn\u2019t a casual friendship or \u201cbest\u201dfriendship. I\u2019m the one who messed it all up.\n\nDo you think i shall send him a gift? I\u2019m still blocked on everywhere. He might have just forgotten about me and it hurts me so much. I really need one last chance from him. I miss him, since then nobody has felt like the same. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nThank you in advance\n\n\n\n\n\n",

My boyfriend 28M and I have been together 4 years but struggling recently mainly because I feel like he doesn't put me first  He parties until 7 am, takes coke on some Fridays but said he d stop, and comes back annoyed at me for not accepting the fact he needs to let off some steam.\n\nI told him I struggled with my mental health and him leaving me alone hurts me. He says he ll come back early or won't do drugs but I caught him cleaning his bloody nose after coming back at 7 am a few times. He said he has stopped drugs now though. \n\nMy fault might be texting him while he s out, checking in if he s not home and I have sometimes let him know I was upset. I would get cold with him or get upset about smaller things in a day to day life.   I find myself in tears most days. I also would start asking questions while we were in bed, he d be half asleep but I was spiralling. It was not a good moment to bring this up, I was just spiraling/ panicking .\n\nOn valentines day he went to see a football game and texted me he was on his way to see me right after. I didn't see him until the next day 7am. \n\nI called him out and he told me he needs help, I was ready to leave but I want to help him if he accepts he has a problem.  The following week, he went out every night and left me in the dark. He finally came clean and said he needs space and basically is falling out of love because he feels like he always disappoints me and I make him feel like he is or he has a problem .\n\nI am so confused as it feels like it all turned on me, I feel like the villain for being so pushy. I don't have many friends. Is it normal in the UK for men or boyfriends to leave their girl behind every Friday? I truly am wondering if I have been unfair and just needy. \n\nI didnt really want the baby at first, he convinced me we d be fine. He says now he s going through a lot and needs space. He sees me crying but feels awkward about consoling me. He just says to getcsome sleep. I confronted him about this and he says I should know he feels awkward in this situations and to let him know if i need him to do something. I took him in my arms when I was upset at him but he was feeling vulnerable a d in tears so I feel like I need to beg for  compassion and it sits funny with me. \n\nI am foreign to this country and do not have many friends. I feel very alone. I do not want to be a single mother and I can feel my depression coming back.\n\nHe says he d stay home if I ask him but it d just create resentment . I'm not asking he does not go out but that he be considerate and not do drugs. He says I make him feel guilty every week end and now he doesn't want ro ve around me. Ibjust want to go out and have fun too, but in 4 years, I was never invited despite me mentioning it.\n\nIt is 7am now and he is still partying. He sent me a text last night to check up on me at 10pm. Something he hasn't done in ages so I appreciate the effort. He said he d take me out for breakfast and a walk last night before leaving. He assured me again at 6 am we would go out when I checked up on him to see if he was OK. \n\n What could I do to improve the situation if there is any hope ? I have considered couple therapy and giving him the space he needs however it is affecting my pregnancy . Would there be anything else we / I could try ?\n",

        "content": "The title says it all. I\u2019m reeling. Our relationship was already a rocky because he seemed like he could be a misogynist and he doesn\u2019t like talking about emotions or commitment. Just little comments he made here and there, he was extremely jealous and judgmental of what I wore, easily wounded and always suspicious of me. I was not his first age gap relationship; it always felt off that he didn\u2019t date women his own age. And the women he has dated were all larger than life and plastic- big personalities, big fake boobs, big lip injections\u2026 I have those things naturally and plastic surgery is fine, but his pattern of dating history always made me suspicious of him/what he wants from women (like he sees them as trophies or something). He has a very high sex drive and has always been attracted to sex workers (OF, and otherwise), like most men, but he claims there is no reason to judge them. I agree, it just seemed almost like a fetish of his, the way he talks about it. Then he would judge me for dressing \u201cscandalously,\u201d commenting on my skirt length, etc. But I liked that he liked my over-the-top attitude and energy. At least in the beginning.\n\nHe has an employee who is a sugar baby and a drag queen (23m, gay). He would talk disparagingly about how flirtatious and unprofessional this employee was. The employee has been the subject of multiple write-ups and firings of managers getting caught messing around with him. Then one day my bf\u2019s tune changed, as he told me this employee was actually very kind and helpful to him. Yeahhhhh. Obviously, the same thing was happening as with all his past bosses. I wasn\u2019t worried about it- my boyfriend wasn\u2019t gay, he\u2019s loyal, the drag queen is not particularly attractive and is unkind. Surely my boyfriend saw this for what it was. \n\nThen one night, he came home late. Smelled like alcohol and sweat. Said the drag queen had invited him to see him perform at a drag show and he had gone. He got distant with me, became critical of my body, cared less about what I had to say and practically ignored me. He stayed late after work.\n\nSo I checked his phone. Of course I did. And of course, I found instagram dms between the two of them. My boyfriend is so infatuated and was telling this guy he puts \u201creal women\u201d to shame. WTF?? I confronted him and he didn\u2019t deny it, just said he was so sorry for hurting me and that he never planned for things to go this way. He said he felt guilty for causing me pain but that he didn\u2019t see our relationship going anywhere, that he doesn\u2019t want to be tied down, and that he wanted to have fun instead of dealing with my \u201cemotions all the time.\u201d \n\nHe\u2019s almost 50. \n\nI\u2019m so hurt. All this time I felt inadequate for not having plastic surgery, now I feel inadequate for not having t&amp;a made of foam. This guy is a GUY. He\u2019s 25 years younger than my boyfriend. He has all the promiscuous behaviors that my boyfriend always falsely accused me of. He has a pattern of sleeping with his bosses. And my boyfriend thinks it\u2019s all real. He\u2019s painted me into some slutty-but-burdensome cartoon villain, when in reality I just wanted him to treat me with more respect. Like an equal partner. And he\u2019s worshipping this drag queen and has thrown me away. AND the employee found my fucking instagram and has been liking my stories like a fucking crazy person. Making me feel like I\u2019m a joke between the two of them.\n\nI\u2019m so furious and hurt. I want to expose my boyfriend for cheating and sleeping with an employee. But I feel like I can\u2019t because it would be homophobic? Like I\u2019m supposed to be okay with him cheating since it\u2019s with a guy, but not another woman? I don\u2019t know. I want to feel good about myself again. I\u2019m afraid of losing my confidence and my ability to trust. All of a sudden the love I have for this man makes me feel so small and unwanted.\n\nI\u2019m lost. I can\u2019t ask wh*t to d* on this sub, so. How do I get my confidence back after this? Do I inform his job?\n\n",

I was living with all men at the time, one of them which I was dating for a year, and told them all that it was very important that they vote Beto for women\u2019s sake. Since my home state is California, I knew I would be OK, but they had friends and family living in Texas that would be affected by Abbotts policies. I begged them for months to vote in the election and none of them did, including my boyfriend. \nAbbot gets reelected. I am a devastated, and months later, I get pregnant by that boyfriend. It was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. Thankfully, I was able to come to California. \nFast-forward years later, and I have been dating a new boyfriend for three years. I explained to him how important is that he votes in this election, but he tells me he would rather stay out of it. I beg him to vote and he still doesn\u2019t. For context, he is a straight white male. Months later, I cannot come to terms with the fact that he hasn\u2019t voted and seems to never want to talk about politics. He is right wing leaning. I\u2019m honestly really devastated and I feel so much anxiety about situations repeating themselves. I feel like he let me down by not voting. Would breaking up make sense?",

        "content": "Hi there, I need advice on my relationship, thank you in advance.\n\nI (F, 21) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (M, 23) for 7 months now. Everything was going great at first, he was so thoughtful and affectionate and treated me better than anyone, but as winter came by, he started feeling really down, a lot happened to him in the span of a few months, and we\u2019re both pretty sure he\u2019s depressed, burnt out, or at least he is in psychological distress.\nI try to be there for him during these tough times as much as I can, I keep telling him he can tell me anything, he can ask for help with anything and I promise I will show up, but he\u2019s always had trust issues and find it hard to completely believe me when I say all of this. He\u2019s more of an avoidant type and I\u2019m more of an anxious one, so my way of showing love is by trying to meet all his needs and be there for him, but I can\u2019t say he does the same for me.\nHis way to cope with depression is by distancing and isolating himself, he\u2019s often reluctant to open up, which I totally understand and respect.\nThe thing is, lately he\u2019s just become straight up negligent, I wait on his calls for hours, I don\u2019t feel listened to when I talk to him, I didn\u2019t get anything from him for my birthday and Valentine\u2019s day, and once again I completely understand he has a lot going on, his brain is overwhelmed and everything seems like a chore, and I don\u2019t want to add up on his plate by asking for presence, reassurance and displays of affection all the time, but man I really start to feel forgotten and unappreciated and it\u2019s weighing me down too.\nFor context, we\u2019re in a long distance relationship and only see each other every 6-7 weeks which makes it even more difficult to connect properly.\nSo I don\u2019t know how to respect his boundaries, meet his needs and be there for him without losing myself in the relationship and ending up neglecting my own boundaries and needs. I\u2019ve told him about this, about how I feel, about the way I\u2019m feeling ignored and the reassurance I need, and when I tell him he hears it, he understands, he says he notices how patient and understanding I am and that it must be tough for me, he says he loves me but he doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s like this and can\u2019t give me more, I suggest ways we could improve our communication, adapt and meet halfway so that both our needs can be taken into account, and he always agrees but then nothing changes and I end up being the one meeting him where he\u2019s at and again doing everything for the relationship while he\u2019s just barely moving, looking like an empty shell I desperately try to wake up.\nI really hope it\u2019s just a phase and he keeps telling me that but sometimes I doubt it.\nI feel bad being angry at him for this, because I know how hard it must be, I know he\u2019s probably trying (even though I have no proof of that), I know how much he\u2019s struggling and and I don\u2019t want to be a burden to him when I\u2019m supposed to be the person lifting him up, but at the same it is incredibly hard for me too.\nSo whenever I\u2019m resentful and I want to get mad at him I always end up sugarcoating everything and telling him I understand, I still try to make him understand I need more from him but I don\u2019t want to make him feel guilty when he\u2019s already exhausted from life itself. \nBut still I sometimes tell myself that despite all of this he\u2019s still a grown man and if he wanted to he would, plus he knows how anxious this makes me and how I always fear he might not love me or want me anymore, so if he really wanted to he could still make an effort, as little as it may be.\nI don\u2019t want to leave him because despite all of this I love him unconditionally and I\u2019d do anything to help him get better (I might have a slight saviour complex too lol), I could never give up on him, but it\u2019s just so hard feeling let down over and over again by the man who\u2019s supposed to love me and make me a priority.\n\nSo what can I do to assert myself while still being loving and understanding ? Is it really depression making him act that way or is he going to stay like this forever ? \nIf you guys please have any advice, any personal experience to share, literally anything could help, thank you in advance.\n\nTL;DR: My depressed boyfriend is neglecting my needs and while I understand and want to be there for him, I don\u2019t know how to keep showing up for myself and asserting my own needs too.

Recently (maybe a week ago) I downloaded an app called \u201cSincerely\u201d which allows users to anonymously vent on their current state of mind. I haven\u2019t got many responses on this particular vent so I wanted to post here. Here\u2019s my note. \n\n\u201cI'm not sure how to feel about my so called \"boyfriend\" He lives 40 mins away and neither one of us has a car, so we don't see each other often. This could be remedied by constant communication on the phone or through text. I understand both of us are busy, so texting back and forth every hour of the day is out of arms reach; but to be left on read for 11+ hours has become the norm. Mind you, he posts onto his IG story in between those times. I've brought it up to him multiple times and for some reason the blame gets put on me. The excuses are\n\"we're both busy\" \"you don't call\" \"I'm going through a lot \" I was out\" \"I went to a photoshoot\" I'm at my friend's house\" \"I'm recording\" (he's a music artist) \"I was sleep\" I know that he's telling the truth 90% of the time just based on location and what he posts onto his story. He's not a liar and I never got cheating vibes. I've been cheated on too manv times to count and I don't have that same feeling of distrust. But for some reason, I feel more lonely than ever. I spend $100 on Lyft to and from his house, and yet he could never come see me. The only dates we've been on are ones that I planned and paid for.\nWe've only been on two true dates and we've been together for a year. This wouldn't bother me as much if he wasn't constantly out with his friends or taking a trip to another state for a week.\nI feel like there's no effort or time put into me at all. I try to be understanding because he's going through a lot mentally, but so am I. But I at least still find enough time to try. I feel crazy.\u201d \n\nThis is a bit of a simpler version of my reality, but these are my main gripes with my bf. I just really don\u2019t wanna let him go.",

This has left me feeling upset and unsure if I'm handling this appropriately. This all came about because I got an email of vacation packages with deals for Carribean destinations and suggested to my boyfriend that we should go. One particular deal was to my dads hometown in the DR and I suggested I'd ask my dad if he'd want to join us. My dad couldn't make it so I sort of dropped the idea. Yet my boyfriend was still very keen on going anyways and suggested we'd ask his best friend and his girlfriend if they'd want to join us for the trip. I said I was alright with that idea and then he suggested his other close friend came too. Then that friend invited the another male friend in the group. The next day my boyfriend tells me that his best friends girlfriend can no longer make the trip. He asks how I'd feel about being the only girl on the trip which I said I'd not really be fond of that idea and would maybe try to find some sort of trip to go with my own/ with a friend. I want him to experience things on his own. To me the problem wasn't the boys trip. I trust my partner fully 100%. When the trip was booked I was surprised it really went though and left the group chat. Only almost a week later did I realze I was truly angry about the situation. Feeling like I had been kicked out the group trip that I initially wanted to be just him and I and maybe my father due to the location.\n\nMy boyfriends side of the story after discussing it was that to him it wasn't my idea anymore after I was ready to drop the idea after my dad turnt it down. My dad wants us all to go in May and meet that part of my family. He expressed how it'd be completely different than his experience with his friends. That if I was there the guys couldn't really be themselves because I'm friends with some of their ex's and their humor is different than mine. He'd have to choose between spending his time with them or me and it wouldn't be fair. \n\nWe communicated calmly and I've made peace with it mostly. Then I tell the story again and can't help but think some people would react completely differently. Together for 7 years and I view him as the one, we have intentions to commit forever. Am I handling this situation in a effective way to be able to sustain a healthy relationship? ",

        "content": "I have been with my gf for 4 years. I am the type of guy that people would typically call a manipulator (based on my quick search on Google of my behaviour). Let me explain.\n\nEarly on during the past 4 years of relationship, we have episodes of arguments that has led me to develop negative feelings for some of her family members and friends. Because these arguments happened numerous times, she gradually built up a wall - and everytime such arguments occur - she enters fight or flight response to protect them against me. Making me feel like I am an outsider trying to  penetrate her personal space. Even when my point is valid, she still thinks I have no rights to be talking down on them.\n\nTo make matters worse, I have also unconsciously became the type of guy that is very stingy on compliments, and generous with my criticisms. Some may think I'm jaded. For example, there was once when one of her good friends (which I have had arguments with) is coming back to the country we live in, and to her it was something to be happy over - but all I felt was the opposite of that because I genuinely did not like the fact she is in close proximity with my gf. I know it is not up to me to decide these things  as it is her life and her friends - but I still proceeded to say things like \"oh no, disaster is coming\". Which again, triggers her fight or flight response. Eventually, she would say something mean that triggers me - then we would again, argue.\n\nWhen these types of arguments happen, lately I have been suggesting to break up. This is because I thought about this issue for a long time, and a large part of me thinks that our relationship is not going to work out if things continue to be the way they are. And everytime we argue, it reinforces this thought, which leads me to suggesting to break up. It is from a place of hopelessness, and frustration - not manipulation which many people like to conclude such behaviour as. The reason for the feeling of hopelessness is because these arguments have happened over and over again, and we have tried to resolve them, but we would always revert back to our old ways of behaviour. We are too stubborn to change.\n\nYesterday, I have again suggested to break up, and my gf has previously mentioned before if I suggest again, she would show me the door. We haven't spoken since then.\n\nOf course, everything I wrote here is an oversimplification of the complexity of this relationship. I am open to follow-up questions. Question is: What should be my moves from here on out?",

        "content": "Apologies in advance, typed on mobile.\nI, '32F' know my boyfriend, '42M' is cheating on me. We've had an off again on again relationship for about 5 years, and stayed friends in the 'off' periods. When we were in the 'off' periods we always had clear boundaries, especially when we were seeing different people. However recently we decided to make the jump and move in together. I knew dating a confirmed bachelor would be a rollercoaster when we decided to try again, but I really thought this is what would make us or break us and be done with each other or thrive. My BF travels regularly, and I've only recently come into a job that allows me to stay stationary. I know he cheats on me when he travels, I have receipts and found his \"hidden\" stash of ED meds that go missing when he leaves. At first I was extremely irate and wanted to leave, I tried to have conversation with him but it ended poorly and he had a full on tantrum and denied it all. I had never seen that side of him before, but from previous abusive/cheating relationships that was my first real sign of guilt. Now, I really do actually enjoy this relationship all together, he provides for me (will hardly let me touch a bill, not for lack of trying) and we travel well together when we can, we both enjoy each other's friends and family. I have never cheated on anyone and generally think it is abhorrent. But to be honest, I'm fucking tired (John from the Green Mile type of tired) of dating, and I don't think I'll ever meet someone with whom I have as much chemistry, an enjoyable sex life, and general stability. Do I pretend I don't know about the cheating and go about life as usual until this ride ends? Or do I confront him and leave? Honestly any advice would be lovely.\n\nTL;DR: I know my BF is cheating on me, while I'm not comfortable with it I also don't want to leave.",

        "content": "My 33F wife and I 34M have been knowing each other since grade school. We started dating in 2014-2015 and married in 2017. I have been online gaming our whole relationship and she has recently (within the last 2 years) joined in on gaming. We have two children \n\nOur relationship has had standard ups and downs. As of recently she has had a friend group online that she said is her safe space. She also told me they all knew she was married and none of them share their personal lives and like to keep it to strictly gaming so no more details. I started noticing small things, like being extra secretive with her phone, discord messages, hiding her online status when gaming with me I began to question myself. I found out she was messaging one of them she's known for four months about our entire relationship, almost every detail and getting advice from HIM. They also had nicknames, love, honey, etc. They talked more than we talked on a daily basis. \"Good morning\" \"good nights\" \"otw home\". I invaded her privacy and read her discord messages. It was at this point  I found all this out. Previously I thought they were just online friends that didn't share their personal lives?. In addition all her other friends that she originally told me knew she was married did in fact, NOT know she was married. I knew this because after reading the messages I decided to join in playing with them and that's when she told only some of them she was married. It was awkward to say the least and you could feel it. The messages between this male individual were extremely personal, borderline cheating in my opinion, and violated any respect and some trust I had as she told me all these friendships were not personal and kept it to gaming. She also had edited all her socials to elude the fact she was married, changing social names that didn't show our last name, hiding post that involved me, changing pictures. I have verbally heard her avoid calling me just \"father of kids\"or \"kids dad\" never husband or anything to hint she was with someone. We also have been arguing and almost separated over this for the last two-three weeks. Since the start of arguing she has told a majority of them she was married but refuses to let me play with them as it's her safe space.  She has also edited some of but not all her socials back to please me. She continues to message them on the the side in DMs which I can no longer see as she has since changed her discord password and completely powers down her PC when she's off so discord is no longer left open. She told me these are her friends and strictly friends and has developed no emotional relationship with them. I find it hard to believe that since our entire marriage is in jeopardy over it now in addition to seeing the DMs. She ask that I completely drop it and get over it and I have agreed. Obviously this still is on my mind and I'm living with it daily while trying to act happy. She still DMs them all throughout the day, including when spending time with each other. When she gets off PC to do things with me and they ask why she's getting off , she never says anything that involves me and avoids awnsering.\n\nI have been no perfect husband. Not am I wanting to attack my wife with allegations but try and understand it. I am shy and struggle to express my emotions. I have made her felt ignored for last 5 years she said. Maybe I have pushed her this far to seek attention and entertain it? Why am I finding all this out in  a DM with a random guy? Why not be open about your marriage? What is she telling these people? Am I over looking  the real issue which could be myself? Why have to DM? I have plenty more details that I just can't organize into thoughts. I don't have anyone truly to talk to because she specifically told she didn't want me telling my close family , which I already did so I can longer continue without upsetting her. I am afraid my continued want for answers I'll never get will ultimately eat me alive. Remember, I am supposed to drop it and get over it or potentially ruin our entire marriage over this.",

        "content": "I (24F) and my fianc\u00e9 (27M) have been together for nearly 5 years now, I won\u2019t bore you with unnecessary information so I\u2019ll get straight to it. When we first met, we both casually watched porn before meeting one another and when we met we\u2019d watch it together. We both were mutually into it which was great! Now that I\u2019m almost 25, you could say that my POV on porn has changed. One day, my fianc\u00e9 walked in on me masturbating and I was watching solo men content and I saw how upset he looked, that reaction alone shifted something in me and I just all together stopped looking at male nudes and videos. I kept watching \u201cregular\u201d porn of two people being intimate instead, but then I realized that porn wasn\u2019t good for me all together \u2013 during sex I\u2019d start imagining other men &amp; women joining in on our intimate moment and that was the only way I could orgasm. So I completely cut it off and I find myself desiring my man even more.\nThis is where my issue comes in, we were looking at his Reddit one day and his post history was mainly subreddits that mainly focused on nudes. Every woman he was looking at were women that look nothing like me at all. Goth women. Tomboys. Fem boys. Muscular women. Etc.\nIt made my stomach twist and it genuinely upset me. It especially bothered me because I\u2019m a below average brown woman (in terms of conventional attraction. which is whatever, I\u2019m coming to terms with it) and I don\u2019t fit into the boxes of anything he looks at. He stopped initiating sex with me and he states that he has a low sex drive but admits to masturbating once or twice a week, sometimes more.\nI brought up how this bothers me, I even cried and I honestly didn\u2019t bring it up in a nice way, it was very confrontational and I know that tends to make some people shut down and get defensive, but he ultimately said that I\u2019m a hypocrite for being so upset by it because I watched porn myself and \u201cjust because you\u2019ve had a change of heart, it\u2019s unfair to put that standard onto me\u201d, said that \u201cyou\u2019re insecure\u201d and then pinned it on my anxiety disorder as well. I tried to explain to him that looking at nude women and watching two people go at it is completely different in which he argued it isn\u2019t and that \u201cno matter what, you\u2019re still using it for sexual gratification\u201d, I explained to him that I stopped watching it because I saw how hurt he was by it and he said \u201cyeah, but it\u2019s whatever cause it\u2019d make me a hypocrite cause I do the same thing\u201d and we kind of left it there. It just really sucks because I\u2019m still hurting because of it, I was hoping that he\u2019d immediately comfort me and drop it solely because he\u2019d feel an immense amount of guilt the same way I did. I don\u2019t think he understands how badly this affects my self-esteem and I\u2019m starting to see these types of women in public and thinking to myself \u201coh no, I hope he doesn\u2019t look her way, she\u2019s his type.\u201d\nHe says he finds me to be sexy but his actions show otherwise. \nThis is the biggest issue in the relationship right now and I don\u2019t know how to navigate it, that nagging part of my brain wants to conform to what he enjoys looking at and become that alt woman or whatever just so I can draw his attention towards me. By the way that our conversation was left, he has no interest in quitting watching porn and I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth breaking up over at all because everything else in the relationship is great. A part of me doesn\u2019t even want him to quit watching porn because I know for sure if he goes back to watching it, it\u2019ll be a stab in the gut. I\u2019m just scared to bring it up again because once again, he doesn\u2019t realize how big this is for me because it\u2019s so small for him. \nAlmost everything I expressed here was also brought up in conversation. \nI just don\u2019t know, am I over reacting? I\u2019m a hypocrite? Are my emotions valid? \nI\u2019m just stuck, is there any advice that anyone could provide? \n\nTLDR: fianc\u00e9 looks at images online of women that look nothing like me and it hurts my feelings. I stopped watching solo male porn because he walked in on me one day watching that kind of content and it hurt his feelings. He\u2019s calling me a hypocrite because I used to watch porn as well but I tried to explain that I stopped because I saw how badly it hurt his feelings. I don\u2019t know what to do. ",

This normally wouldn\u2019t be a problem for me but he also doesn\u2019t handle unexpected situations well in the moment and tends to panic easily while I handle things more calmly. The issue is that I already feel like I\u2019m mentoring him on his career and now I\u2019m also teaching him how to have healthy emotional coping mechanisms (instead of catastrophizing etc) so it feels like a lot. I worry that if we were to have a family together that I\u2019d have to always comfort him and be his rock during unexpected situations or be the one that always has a plan and that\u2019s just a tiring thought. I talked to him about it and he agrees that he\u2019d work on it but I just feel like  he just looks up to me for advice and guidance all the time. Despite him being there for me emotionally, I don\u2019t think the support is equal and I\u2019m not sure if this will ever change. Do you think this is a deal-breaker and can this composure be trained? \n\nTldr: my boyfriend is great but tends to rely on me a lot for work advice and also tends to lose his composure (becomes panicked) in unexpected situations so it feels like I have to be his rock and problem solver despite him also being there for me emotionally ",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been in my head about this situation for a while now and I\u2019m not sure what to think, so I thought I\u2019d ask for advice here. Please be honest but kind - this has really been weighing on me. \n\nA little over a year ago, I was introduced by a friend to a new friend group, and we all clicked really well. In particular, I became really close friends with one guy in this friend group (30M) pretty quickly (the topic of this post), to the point where we would talk/text every day, play video games, watch movies together, and really just spend time together. It wasn\u2019t ever anything romantic, although I liked making the occasional joke after our friends thought we were dating (he\u2019s straight, I\u2019m not). Although we really only know each other for a relatively short period of time, I really felt comfortable around him and felt like I could open up to him about things that are hard for me to talk about, and he would do the same. Not having many guy friends, it felt pretty nice to meet a guy that was cool with who I was. \n\nWell, around October of last year, we hit a bit of a rough patch with our friend group. To make a long story short, they were getting annoyed with his attitude and said they needed to \u201ctake some space away\u201d from him. In an effort to better the situation, I told him and tried to get him to talk to the people that were mad at him, but it spiraled pretty quickly. This situation ended up in a huge argument, and he stopped talking with the other people in our group. They have been friends longer than I\u2019ve known any of them so, while their arguing felt a little over-the-top, this whole situation hurt him a lot. I tried to be supportive, but I could tell he was really depressed about it. When we would talk about the situation, he kept saying he was a horrible person that deserved to be cut off. \n\nAfter going the rest of the year being hurt by this situation, he decided to disconnect from everyone but his family and close friends to focus on himself during the holidays. In his words, he wanted to focus on the things that make him happy. He let me know that he wasn\u2019t going to talk to me as much during this time, and that he\u2019ll reach out when he\u2019s ready.\n\nI was (and still am, I think) supportive of his choice because everyone should prioritize their mental health.  It made me sad to see him depressed and hear him think of himself in such a negative way, so I gave him the space that he asked for. But, after being so close, it makes me sad to have abruptly just stopped talking. Its March now and, since January, I\u2019ve only ever spoken to him 3-4 times. Each time we\u2019ve spoken hasn\u2019t really even been much of a conversation - he\u2019ll send me a text, I\u2019ll reply, and it will really just end there. \n\nI feel like I made things worse by inserting myself, and now I feel guilty that they don\u2019t talk. I apologized to him for inserting myself when this whole situation was happening and he would say none of it was my fault, but I can\u2019t help but feel guilty anyway. Also, it makes me a little sad to think that, although I considered him a close friend, the feeling might not have been mutual. If he wanted to focus on the things that make him happy but we\u2019re not talking anymore, does that mean I was a burden to him? \n\nI\u2019ve tried talking to him about it in the few times we\u2019ve spoken but, like I mentioned, he doesn\u2019t really respond. When he finally texts back, it\u2019ll be a life update or random conversation not related to what I sent before. I miss my friend, but I have no way of knowing if I just need to be patient, or if maybe I should just take a hint. Am I forcing a friendship?",

        "title": "How do I (22M) breakup with girlfriend (23F) because I can't sleep with her in the same bed?",
        "content": "Me (M22) and L (F23) have been together 8 months. I plan on breaking up with her for the following reasons.\n\n\n\nTLDR: First, my sleep is negatively effected with another person in the same bed as me. Secondly, I am fairly certain I will want children at some point in my life and she has already underwent a sterilization procedure because of her strong desire not to.\n\n\n\nExpanding on the first point, sleep is incredibly important to me. I mostly grew up in a solitary environment with little physical touch or affection, where no other siblings was present sleeping in the bed with me, or loud noises or movement interrupted me during the night. I typically have trouble sleeping at any friends house, or any environment not at the right noise levels, temperature, etc. This is my first serious relationship meaning me and L frequently share the same bed and her desire for physical closeness such as cuddling in bed is not something I am used to. Given my knowledge of how detrimental poor sleep is for memory, focus, mood, and basically all aspects of life (especially cognitive), it is difficult or me to continue this relationship.\n\n\n\nOn the second point of wanting children, I believe our difference there is related to our difference in political views and outlook of the world. For me, an optimistic outlook and positive view of the world is a prerequisite to have children. In other words, if you see the world, and people as fundamentally good, and that the future will only get better, bringing new life into the world makes sense. After all, their lives will be much better than ours.\n\n\n\nThe opposing view is that the future is bleak. Humans are nothing more than a parasite on the planet and a harm to the environment. Bringing children into the world would only do more harm, and their lives will be worse than ours, or just as miserable. This is not even to mention the ethical decision of creating life without it's consent (no one is asked to be born).\n\n\n\nMe and L share these two opposing viewpoints, with me having the positive one, desiring children, with her being very certain she does not, even having undergone a surgery to prevent pregnancy.\n\n\n\nIf I post this, I will likely share this with her in addition to a lengthy text. I am thinking of sending this text, a link to the reddit post, and basically ghosting her. I know this may seem insincere or that I should do so in person, but I just can't bring myself face to face as I know how emotionally challenging it would be. So how do I do I properly breakup with her and finally pull the trigger?",

He'll start talking in this lispy baby voice and even pouts his lips while he does it. And he does this multiple times per day, usually when we are cuddling but sometimes even when we're being intimate. Something about a grown man talking to a grown woman in a baby voice just gives me an extreme ick. I admit I talk to animals and small children/babies like this... but not to a grown adult. \nHow can I bring up that this is a turn off without hurting him or making him feel like he can't be himself around me?",

        "title": "Need advice for my brother (M24) regarding his exgf (F24)",
        "content": "Can anyone give me advice on how to talk to my little brother?\n\nIt's a long story but I'll try to keep it organized.\n(Throwaway account and all names changed bc I don't know if he uses reddit.)\n\nMy brother Matt (24M) has this ex-gf (24F) Jenny.\nThey've been friends since middle school and it was clear to me (36F) from the get-go that Jenny had a crush on him even then. They stayed friends thru high school and eventually started dating in their last year of high school. The way they started dating felt questionable to me even back then but I'll give details on that later bc it's indicative of a pattern.\nAfter graduation happened and it was time to leave for college, they tried long distance.\nIt went okay-ish but it was clear she couldn't handle the long distance. We thought they would break up...until the pandemic lockdown happened.\nCampuses closed, so Matt and Jenny both go back to our hometown. This seems to bring them closer together until lockdown ended. They return to campus and once again, cracks form in the relationship.\nMatt flys out to see her on weekends when he can, using money he's earning at a part time job. But he's a college kid with his first job and he's got his own schooling to do so he can't go often.\n\nMeanwhile, Jenny picks up a new friend group. Including a guy we'll call Carl.\nJenny talks about Carl a LOT. He's always over at her apartment, often with friends in company. Matt says he trusts Jenny and that he's met and hung out with Carl on his trips to Jenny's city.\n\n1 month after lockdown ends, in a period where Matt had exams and couldn't visit...\nJenny calls Matt crying to break up with him.\nCarl made advances towards her and she did not shut them down. Jenny and Matt swear up and down that nothing happened but both parties admit that Carl stayed over *by himself AND snuck into Jenny's bed.*\nJenny said she broke up with Matt bc she wanted to mess around with Carl and she felt it was fairest to Matt to break up. I don't disagree with this.\n\nThat night, my little brother called me, sobbing, to the point it physically hurt to hear.\nMy husband and I consoled him and promised to be there for him however we could though we'd moved to another state too.\nMy parents went and got him and he stayed home that weekend to recuperate.\n\nTime passes and I thought that was it.\nMy dad said Matt and Jenny didn't talk after that.\nBut at the 6 month mark post-breakup, Matt's visiting me during a vacation period. We're hiking and his phone goes off. On his screen, I see\n\"I miss you.\" From Jenny.\n\nMatt knows I saw it so he explains to me that they started talking again.\nApparently the week after Jenny broke up with Matt, she tried getting with Carl. They messed around for a short while but then Carl stops coming round Jenny's bc to use Matt's words: \"he's embarrassed to be seen with Jenny.\"\n\nSo what does Jenny do?\nStarts messaging Matt ASAP. The usual, saying she made a mistake etc.\nMatt says he had her blocked for 6 months and that they only just started talking again but I wasn't sure I believed that. He says he's over her and they're just friends now.\n\nSince then...\nJenny and Matt both graduate but stay in their respective cities. They keep talking.\nJenny gets a new boyfriend in her city and messages to Matt decrease somewhat.\nMatt continues visiting and still insists they're just friends.\nJenny and her last boyfriend broke up a few months ago and she starts messaging Matt more.\nSince Matt got a job he started visiting even more and asked our parents what they think of him moving to Jenny's city.\n\nI am deeply troubled by this because of the following:\n\n1. My kind brother has a habit of putting the happiness of others before his own.\nBack in high school, Matt had a massive crush on this one girl. He chose not to take her to senior prom \"out of respect\" to the girl, her ex and to preserve the friend group.\nAnother of his guy friends takes the girl to prom anyway and the group implodes anyway.\n\n2. Matt wasn't going to ask Jenny. Jenny and her friends convinced him to ask Jenny to senior prom.\n\n3. Matt has made multiple trips out to Jenny's college city but to my knowledge she hasn't come to Matt's even once.\nI've seen lots of social media photos of them together in Jenny's city but none in Matt's.\n\n4. Matt tried to break up with her twice during lockdown bc he felt Jenny was being unreasonable or clingy. Like she cannot stand being alone ever.\n\n5. Despite lockdown meaning social distancing, they kept seeing each other--and by that, I mean Matt always drove to her place. Later when restrictions were lightened, he'd pick her up from her place, bring her to his parents home and send her back to her home, no matter what the hour. Trips at 3 am were not unusual.\n\n6. Jenny gave Matt herpes. The kind where you get open sores in your mouth. He got violently ill and nearly went to the hospital.\nJenny was pre-med at the time and was far along enough in her studies to know better.\n\n7. Jenny's parents have treated Matt poorly. They talked down to both Matt AND our parents, believing Matt wasn't good enough for Jenny. They asked him to run errands for them during lockdown (which he did). Then when Jenny got with her last bf, an Indian fellow (yep Jenny's parents are racist too!), they suddenly changed their tune about Matt (same culture as Jenny) and encouraged him to stay friends with her.\n\n8. Our parents (my and Matt's) hate Jenny.\nThey won't tell me all the details but they don't like the way she behaves at their home. They think she's manipulative.\n\n9. Matt once told me that Jenny \"taught him to be kinder and more giving.\" This threw me for a loop considering that he set his own crush aside for another male friend *before* he and Jenny became an item.\n\nI know this all seems circumstantial but this is my gut feeling as Matt's big sister and as a woman.\n\nI don't think Jenny loves him.\nI think she loves the convenience he brings her and I'm sick of watching him go back to her city whenever she doesn't have a boyfriend or another man she's pursuing.\nMatt deserves better than to be someone's \"backup option.\"\n\nIf you know anything I can say to help him see what I see, please post below.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nTl;dr: my foolish brother is totally fine being his exgf's forever backup and I want to convince him he deserves better.",

How do I get the courage to leave this relationship?\n\nMy fiance upgraded his phone yesterday so we were transferring all his things from his old phone to the new one. I was going through files etc to delete that he didn't need when I came across the trash and it had the most storage being used, I went into it to delete the trash only to find texts to his buddy he had deleted.\nWe were in an argument one day because he has a history of treating me badly when he's infront of people, which is another problem in itself. This day was no different, my fiance and his friend needed to go to a store to get a part for their job. I ended up calling my fiance 5 hours after he'd be gone asking for an update on his ETA  since I was starting supper and the kids were starting to act up. I was getting a little overwhelmed as he didn't need to take over 5 hours to go to a store 40 minutes away. \nDuring this call his friend must have heard me and said \"we're trying to work here, fuck!\". The tone used was hostile and mean. I told my fiance he shouldn't speak to me like that ad this was a conversation between the two of us. It ended up blowing out of proportion. His friend texted him later on and the text had things in it calling me a phycopath, and said I wasn't normal. He added at the end \"I know it's not my business and I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.\" The worse part is the reply my fiance sent. He said \"I know, we can go and work on the ****** because I had to get out of the house. She's so fucked.\" Then he went onto another message and said \"don't worry man, hopefully she's leaving. Then you don't have to worry about her no more lol.\" \nI know I feel a lot of things, but humiliated and betrayed and two of the big ones. To allow someone to talk badly about your fiance and to not say \"hey man, not your place to say anything.\" Feels wrong to me. To not only allow someone to talk badly towards your fiance but to then add fuel to the fire by also talking badly about them and calling them names... \nWhen we are in arguments I don't name call, I don't message people and talk down on him. \nNow this isn't the only big issue we've had in the last six years. We also just recently had a baby (15 months ago) and I caught him using drugs behind my back, he was caught at our home while his mother watched our children and I was out doing errands for our daughters first birthday party. This was only in Dec 2024. I feel like he hates me but keeps me because I take care of everything... I know I deserve better and I didn't think I'd be someone to stay even though I know I shouldn't. \nHow do I get the courage to actually leave this relationship? We have 2 children involved and I love him. Or maybe loge the thought of him, I don't know anymore. But I sure do know I don't love crying every day.",

        "title": "BF [27M] and I [27M] struggling to move forward after past hurtful mistakes. Help?",
        "content": "My BF and I have been together for 4 years now. The first 3-ish years of our relationship were fantastic. He is sweet, kind, and very loving. I told him from the start that I have had a traumatic past relationship that has caused me to be somewhat easily triggered by certain specific behaviors. He was extremely understanding and while things regarding this were not always perfect, overall I feel he was and is as accommodating to me as any human could be.\n\nAbout 8 months ago, however, I became very sick. During this time, he was unable to help due to stressors in his own life, namely his work becoming very busy. I felt abandoned as at the time, I lived alone and had to take care of everything around my place myself which was very hard with my illness. I had hoped that he would be able to come to my place and help around the house, but he made it clear that he was too stressed and tired from work to be able to do this. He did still come over on just the weekends, but he did a very minimal amount of chores and pretty much only drove me to my procedures/appointments, picked up food for us, and nothing else.\n\nAfter about 2 months I got better physically, but I definitely held on to a lot of resentment as a result of feeling abandoned. From that moment on our relationship became very rocky. Anytime I would need his help with anything and he happened to not be available at the time, whether for a totally valid reason or not, I would feel reminded of what occurred and get very upset. And in the moment, his reaction to my upset would always be to get defensive and try to argue with me about why I shouldn't be upset. Then, after I break down and start crying, he would feel guilty then admit he was wrong for either being defensive or for not being helpful, or both.\n\nAfter that, things got worse. Then we had a couple incidents where I was hurt by something that he either didn't see or didn't understand (but were not caused by him!), and his initial response to me being upset was... to argue with me about how I shouldn't be upset over it. I tried explaining to him how the things that occurred were hurtful, but he continued to double down that it shouldn't have been. Then after I broke down crying, he apologized, admitted he was wrong, and said the reason he always argues with me when I'm upset now is because he legitimately finds it extremely distressing to see me sad and is desperate to do anything to stop me from being sad, which he feels can be accomplished by trying to convince me I should not be upset.\n\nOf course he realizes now that this is not the right thing to do in the immediate moment when someone is upset. But the damage seems to be done however. I've come to feel so hurt and abandoned in my times of need in this relationship that anything that I perceive as potentially being hurtful sets off a hairtrigger reflex in me to become incredibly upset. I don't want to be this way, and I can tell that at least a good chunk of the reaction is due to my prior traumatic relationship experience.\n\nWe are both extremely invested in trying to stay together, but it is really hard when he can make a small mistake that scans as hurtful (ie, accidentally saying something meant to be a neutral comment but it comes across as insulting) and it will immediately cause me to feel incredibly sad and dredge up all these negative past feelings.\n\nHow can we move past this? It is not realistic to expect him to never make any mistakes moving forward. People make mistakes and accidentally say hurtful things or neglect to do something or aren't always available all the time, and I don't want to always have such a negative reaction to these perfectly normal things. Before the incident 8 months ago, I would easily have brushed off stuff like the above and been just fine. But now anything even remotely negative happens and I'm feeling incredibly depressed and reminded of how abandoned I felt.\n\nI know that on his end he can try to be better about avoiding setting me off, and he is working on trying to be less defensive and argumentative in the moment. But what can I do to make things better? How can I stop feeling so hurt and betrayed over the past and be able to take the little things like I used to? We really want to stay together.\n\ntl;dr BF wasn't a supportive partner to me in enough sensitive moments that I've come to feel very hurt in this relationship. What was once a very positive and wonderful thing has become very painful, and even though he is doing his best to be supportive now, it feels like the damage was done. How can we move forward? How can I try to forgive for the perceived abandonment? Please help.",

        "content": "I F18 am dating my bf, M18. I really love him so much and he's genuinely the light of my life. He's an absolute sweetheart and he means the world to me. The problem is that im sometimes kind of absent minded and make conversation with people who he doesnt approve off. This has never been a big deal to me so I didnt realise it was affecting him until he told me. It took a couple of months and many different tries but i was able to fully be conscious all the time and remove these people from my life fully (he would do the same for me, hes amazing). My BF is aware of this and always states he's proud of me. We've had our fair share of arguments about my past friendships and relationships but we always just talked it out. The problem started today when he caught me in a lie. It was a small lie (doesnt excuse it i still messed up) and when i lied to him previously about it, it was because i didnt think it would be brought up again and i just wanted to not talk because i was tired (fully my fault), that sweetheart of a man doesnt deserve any of this. But i fucked up. At this moment ive apologized to him clearly stating the whole situation and why i said what i said, why i doubled down and what im willing to do to gain his trust. I know all of this isnt enough so i told him that he can obviously choose not to forgive me and that completely valid, but i promise i wont let him look stupid. He said he needs time to talk and will let me know by the end of the day if he wants to still stay with me. I'm absolutely shattered but i know its fully my fault. I've never lied to him before this because i dont care ab anyone more than i care ab him. But i messed up and now he says he finds it hard to believe anything ive told him in the past as well (still fully valid). His friends have called me manipulative so i genuinely think im the problem but im working to fix it, idk if i should tell him to just leave me? or if i should promise him that ill do better (it seems cruel and even more manipulative to promise this because even though i know i mean it, i dont want him to be hurt whatsoever) How do i proceed with this? while i love him so so so so much and cannot bare the thought of him leaving me, but i also understand that might be the better option for him. I made a very poor call and i dont know how to fix it. Also I always preach trust alot because it is important to me. I still somehow messed up and im so beyond ashamed of myself and i hate myself for doing what i did. This has also led to him thinking that its super convenient that the only time i lie i get caught. While i know that looks absolutely HORRIBLE for me, i would not lie to him ab anything generally. This was just a horrendous decision on my part. What else can i do on top of this to fix what ive done? I genuinely just want him to be okay, i dont care ab anything else.\n\nTLDR: i messed up big time with my BF and i want advice on how to fix this because i love him so much.",

        "content": "TLDR: My GF (21F) wants to open the relationship to explore her bisexuality, but I (24M) am uncomfortable with the idea and fear it could affect our bond; she says she would accept my decision but worries about future regrets\u2014now I'm unsure whether to learn to cope or have another talk to set boundaries.\n\nI am a longtime lurker and never thought I would write a post, to be honest. But I don't know how to solve this for myself. I'm not a native English speaker, so if something isn't clear I can answer it in the comments or updates.\n\nMy (24M) GF (21F) asked me if I was willing to open our relationship. To start, I would like to give a picture of our relationship. We have been together for 5 years, graduated from school together and have now each completed our studies. We are very stable in our relationship and we plan to move in together. I also know that I want to marry her, so the situation only makes me more restless.\n\nAbout my GF: she is absolutely sweet and goes through ups and downs to support her friends and doesn't mince her words when she encounters something that is unjust and wrong.\n\nTo stay on topic - she is bi, which was never a problem for me, and has finally started to feel really comfortable in her skin and to come out of her shell a bit more. Since we have been together for so long, she occasionally brought up the topic that she doesn't know whether she will regret not trying things in her youth in the future. She says she is absolutely happy with the way things are at the moment and how we have developed together. She also says that she would never ask if she didn't have the impression that we were in a stable, happy relationship. I share that impression too.\n\nRecently she approached me and told me that she is considering opening up the relationship in the future. She knows that I always tend to say no when we discuss this topic, as we have already talked about it in the past, and was therefore very nervous to even tell me. I then asked her if she could explain to me what she meant by an open relationship, whereupon she explained to me that she had been imagining for some time what it would be like to have something with a woman. On the grounds that she is bi and has never been able to live it up (due to family stress and introversion).\n\nShe assured me that she only wants to try it with women and wouldn't jump at the next best opportunity, but to be honest, I don't feel like that makes it any better.\n\nI explained to her that I don't really like the idea and can't imagine an open relationship. I just don't like the thought (I mean, of course there are other women who are attractive, but I've never felt the desire to pursue it).\n\nAfter that, things got more tense. She asked me if I could explain better what I don't like about an open relationship. So I told her that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of her sharing what we have with someone else. According to her, sex is also possible without an emotional bond. In addition, it would be different because she would be doing it with a woman.\n\nTo be honest, it makes no difference to me whether it's a man or a woman, for me it's the same.\n\nI know there are concepts of open relationships that work, but I just don't feel comfortable with it. Her response at the end of the conversation was that she would accept it if I didn't want to and would learn to live with it, because losing me is the last thing she wants. However, she can't see into the future and doesn't know if she will regret it when she is older and won't \u201csnap\u201d at some point. This statement made me feel uneasy because it sounded like she might not be fully sure about her own boundaries. She was very upset and was afraid that I was angry because she already knew that I was leaning towards no, but she absolutely had to ask me because being bi is \u201cpart of her nature\u201d.\n\nI approached her again that evening and assured her that I love her and want to stay together with her. I also said that I was never angry just because she asked me. (I'm rather glad that she addressed the topic with me instead of bottling it up).\n\nI told her that I would look into the subject of an open relationship more and would therefore talk to her again. That it's not a no from me for now.\n\nSo much for what I can tell superficially. I honestly don't know how to deal with it. I don't want an open relationship and I'm afraid of meeting someone else when she's at the club. I struggle with the fear that she might develop feelings for someone else, and I don\u2019t know how to process that. I can't just turn it off either.\n\nIs there a way to navigate these feelings and become more comfortable with the idea?   \nIf I find that I can't live with the idea, I will communicate my boundaries again.",

I admit that I'm being insecure here and that's the problem, which is why i want to ask the guys, how? How do you overcome this?\nI might be missing some other stuff so feel free to ask me, this has just been on my mind for a while now and i don't want her to worry. \nAnd no she's not doing it on purpose, I'm the one asking cus i want to know more about her, but a lot of times the answers to it are stories of her and her exes.\n(Sorry if there are any grammatical errors, english isn't my first language)",

        "content": "\nWe have been married 20 years next year. Our marriage was really good.. until it wasn\u2019t. There were a number of factors - a perfect storm of factors so to speak. His dad (who he had a complicated, emotional story and no relationship with and only recently met) passed away suddenly. We went through some severe financial difficulties. He had a fight with his family and he doesn\u2019t have a relationship with them to this day (business related). As a result of all this,  He had a complete mental breakdown. It was very scary. I was terrified I would get a call from the police saying he had passed away. I did all I could to hold it together and help him, whilst raising our boys.  \n\nAnd then he had an affair with his PA (20-something years younger). We had two kids under 6. I found out by seeing messages on our shared iPad. I don\u2019t know the details and honestly it doesn\u2019t make a difference. He did it. It\u2019s done. He swore it was over but I don\u2019t believe that he did end it at the time. I completely switched off and withdrew. We completely disconnected. I planned a life away from him, saving money, looking for places to live that I could afford on my own. He became frightening and cold to me. \n\nIn the mean time, eventually and gradually he changed back to who he was before. Things were better at home. He became more loving and caring and spending more time with me and the kids. \n\nBut we have not had s3x in a really long time. And I know enough from my male friends that if he isn\u2019t getting it here he\u2019s getting it somewhere else. \n\nHonestly, I feel a bit lost. We don\u2019t fight ever  but there is no intimacy. Am I a complete moron for staying? I feel so lonely. I don\u2019t know what to do. I have tried to initiate s3x and been met with \u201cno I\u2019m fine\u201d. He never initiates anything with me. \n\nI think I know what most of you will say. But I feel sick thinking about ripping apart my family. I have teenage boys who are so impressionable and I have such a weight on my shoulders that what I do has already, and will continue to affect them. \n\nAny advice, guys? \n\n",

He says I should take a testosterone test to check if my levels are normal.

Also im not depressed in other aspects of life, yes job can be better but I exercise, I eat well etc.\n\nI'm skeptical the result will mean anything if currently im happy with the once a month frequency.

        "content": "We've been friends since we were 14 and got together after I visited him 2023, and we've spent over 100 days together and have had tons of fun but my mental health was terrible and honestly I just should not have been in a relationship to begin with, I didn't know what I needed or wanted at all but we were fresh out of high school when we got together so that's a given. He tried to support me but I was pretty bent on self sabotaging, and it led to a lot of disconnection and unspoken feelings and we were broken up from November 2024 to the middle of January. \n\nI'm moving to California pretty soon and it's a personal goal that I've had since before we got together and now that I'm financially able to move, I don't even know if I really truly wanna be with him. I love him so much but I've been deeply unhappy with being long distance for the whole duration of our relationship and I feel like at this point it causes me more stress than happiness. I'm moving because I don't like where I currently live. I don't really fit in with the people here, the city is too small &amp; sleepy, I really dislike the weather here, and I feel really suffocated and stuck living so close to my family. \n\nI have changed a lot since we started dating, I'm working through my trauma and I know myself better and I'm a better friend and partner. But I don't enjoy the relationship anymore, I feel pretty bored most times that we call and sometimes feel immense pressure to be entertaining or talkative. I just want to spend time with him irl and I feel burnt out. I don't feel like it's even a real relationship, I hate not being able to include him in anything I do, not being involved in each other's friend groups or interests and activities. I love my boyfriend a lot as a person and I'm holding on to the idea that moving will help but as the weeks go on I keep picking things apart and wanting to talk to him less.   \n  \nI can't really identify if this is solely because I hate long distance or if we just aren't really compatible anymore. Lately I've been feeling like I feel a lot closer to my friends than him, I'm a really anxious person and I'm on the spectrum so a lot of the time I'm not very physically or verbally expressive but my friends have been with me through good &amp; bad times and they understand me and the way I communicate and sometimes my best friend knows what I need before I even know. It brings me to tears bc I feel so loved and my friends have really helped me to express my needs and not feel ashamed for being myself. I don't feel this way with my boyfriend. The way I express my feelings is really wordy and intellectual, and he is a very logical person and responds defensively and gets frustrated with me easily. I've learned how to communicate in a way that feels better for him but I always feel like I'm confusing him or being misunderstood. I revert to people pleasing tendencies with him and feel bad about it because I should be able to be authentic with him. I don't feel like we are in tune at all and I have no idea if it's because of us or the distance or if I'm just freaking out about the upcoming move.\n\nI'm also questioning whether we really have that much in common. I'm a creative person and my art is the most important thing to me and it's the way I express myself, and I want to get a tattoo apprenticeship and break into that industry after I move. I want to make a living making art and be surrounded by like-minded people, I want to travel for work, and I have a million things I want to make and learn. With my friends we are frequently talking about our inner world and goals and dreams and hopes for our life but whenever I try to initiate a conversation with my bf about those things it's pretty one sided. He doesn't have a lot of drive or ambition, he plays video games all the time and we used to play together for hoursss but the past few months games just haven't been holding my interest at all. So when we call he plays games and we don't have any conversations where we have our full attention on each other and a lot of the time he is yelling at his game and it's starting to irritate me. We both started learning guitar last year but we don't really bond with that since we only see each other once every couple months. When we were broken up, my mom told me she doesn't think I'd be happy with someone I can't connect with creatively and I am starting to think she might have been right.\n\nI really love when we spend time together in person but it always feels like there's something missing but I always tell myself it's bc of the distance. I guess I won't know until I move. It's my first serious relationship too, I'm just feeling pretty lost and could really use some guidance. I've kinda been ignoring all these feelings for a while but I don't know how to tell if my heart is really in this and I don't want to deceive him. Do I stick it out or end the relationship?",

Do you crave his attention and time more than anyone else\u2019s? Do you want to share even the smallest problems with him? Do you become emotionally dependent, needing frequent reassurances like \u201cAm I important to you?\u201d or \u201cAm I special to you?\u201d\n\nI used to be that way with my ex\u2014I wanted his time, his care, and his words of affirmation. But he made me feel like I was expecting too much, almost as if needing emotional connection was a crime. He told me I should rely more on family and friends instead. I love talking, especially with my partner, but he often dismissed me, saying I \u201cnever stop\u201d and that I was invading his personal space. Meanwhile, he\u2019d spend all our time together glued to his phone or the TV.\n\nHe never reassured me with words, even when I told him I needed verbal affirmation. When I expressed this need, he fought with me and called me crazy.\n\nSo, I have to ask\u2014do any of you relate to this? Is this normal in relationships, or was I really too much?\n",

        "content": "We\u2019ve been dating for about a year and half now and have a lease that\u2019s up in May. We moved over 2000 miles away about a year ago now and things just aren\u2019t the same anymore. Pretty much as soon as we moved he just got so angry. The first night he screamed at me for not helping him organize/unpack our stuff. I explained that I had a migraine and needed to take ibuprofen because the light is bugging me and I feel like I have to throw up. He basically wouldn\u2019t let me until I just said fuck it and took the ibuprofen because I was miserable. \n\nWe moved to a state where nature and mountains were abundant. He said we\u2019d go hiking every week and do all this cool stuff, spoiler alert we never did. We went hiking TWICE and that\u2019s because I told him I really needed to because I was going crazy. I made friends but could never hang out with them because he \u201cwanted to spend time with me.\u201d If we weren\u2019t working he needed me to be by him 24/7. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m his first gf and he was just clingy. \n\nI went back home for a week after we were in between jobs and moving again in the fall of last year and he would get pissy about everything. If I wanted to see my family or friends he\u2019d get pissy that I \u201cwasn\u2019t spending time with him.\u201d Even though two weeks prior to this we were in his home state and all we did was be with his family and friends. I never once complained even when I so clearly was so bored hanging with his friends and getting ignored. I told him that this week was for family and friends that I hadn\u2019t seen in 6 months. It\u2019s such a fucked up situation.\n\nSo after that we move to a different state with the intent on healing and resting. We sign an actual lease and he has been such a rude person ever since. He won\u2019t do dishes or clean up anything or even do the cats litter. He literally gave up on helping me entirely which came out of the blue since our place before we both cleaned regularly. He claims it\u2019s because he\u2019s tired and that he gave up because he was doing it all. Which is false. He will hardly even make himself food if I don\u2019t make it for him because he\u2019s in pain or tired. \n\nWe both hate our jobs and the rent here is astronomically high where we don\u2019t have much leftover. We\u2019re both burnt out and have loads of mental health issues. But this doesn\u2019t make it okay for him to just give up on helping me. Not to mention he just berates me and diminishes my confidence everyday. He says everything is my fault and his anger (which has gotten 100% worse) is all my fault. I think he screams at me 5/7 days of the week at least. I have to do everything and when I want to relax I cannot watch my shows or movies or music because he doesn\u2019t like it. He\u2019ll say I can watch whatever I want but then complain that he doesn\u2019t like it and then I\u2019m forced to watch his shit which I don\u2019t like 50% of the time. \n\nI\u2019m at a loss. His attitude is so different from when I met him. Everything I do to try to fix a situation makes it worse. I cannot win. I love him to death. \n\nBut tonight I lost it. I\u2019m sick atm and after we got home from work I wanted to sleep. I wanted to sleep off my cold because I\u2019m exhausted and drained. He said I needed to stay up since I would be up all night and he didn\u2019t wanna be alone. So for at least 2 hours I\u2019m in bed next to him trying to stay awake and I\u2019m miserable. I tell him that I\u2019m gonna go to the store and get meds because I\u2019m getting even worse and need to sleep tonight. He gets so mad at me saying that he was gonna go get the meds but didn\u2019t because I made him angry. For wanting to sleep because I\u2019m sick. He gets up and leaves and drives off out of the blue. He texts me \u201cI\u2019m never coming back.\u201d So after trying to contact him for over an hour he calls me and says he needs space and maybe will come home. \n\nHe comes home at 11:30pm after being gone for 4 hours and I\u2019m asleep. He wakes me up and tells me to take the medicine. I cannot take nyquil at 11:30pm since I need to be up at 4am for work. He gets PISSED. He says he\u2019s gonna leave me if I go to work in the morning. He hardly ever goes to work and half of the time we\u2019ve lived here he can\u2019t pay his half of the rent because he doesn\u2019t have enough. I\u2019m drained and beat. I love him to death but I\u2019m losing it. My mental health is shattered now because of all of this. He talks about breaking up with me so often. I cannot win and am lost. ",

Each time we go through our breakups, she tells that she was going through a lot, crying herself to sleep not having anyone with her and all that stuff. It\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t even affected by all the breakups or anything. We both claim that we love each other and all that but still one or the other thing leads to the break up. And when it comes to break ups she would be like I could just find a new girl who would be way better and understanding than her. And yea she keeps on telling we don\u2019t understand each other. This was the scene till the 13 th breakup.\n\nNow past the 13 th breakup and almost a week and half s gap , we both got into talking terms and started to meet each other like before, but things had changed. She had lost all her I want to be there with u all the time attitude, she had started confiding in her friends more, she started being more happy, which is something I should be happy about. But there was a catch for me this time, she wouldn\u2019t call this a relationship while it\u2019s pretty much going on like a situationship where I m put on probation until she feels like I would change for good. More than that affecting me, a new character had emerged in her life from the dance club she goes to , a guy 20M who is her dance partner and someone who is an absolute over achiever in everything that he does. He started to fill out all the gaps that I was yet to fill(ps.non sexually \ud83d\ude42) within 1 month of their meeting. He had confessed to her friends that he likes her and she knows abt it. Bro manages to do all that somehow. He puts in all his efforts to entertain her , keep her happy engaged and not let her down all the time. As a matter of fact, this girl I meet used to take Antidepressants for all minor inconveniences in her life including me not being present at times. But now all that has stopped and she is pretty happy with her life. He takes her out quite often, hangs around more , takes her on long walks and all that stuff. He puts in more effort even by singing songs for her, dances for her and what not. \n\nFun fact is that all that happens between her and him is being told to me by her alone, because she wants it to be clear and open and doesn\u2019t want me to have a misunderstanding abt them and she clearly mentioned that he is just a friend and that she still loves me. \nEven between all this she comes and meets me at my house and spend so called quality time. But all this messes with my mind and I feel like the dude has turned out to be a threat to me. Each time she says anything about what he did and what they do, it just triggers me deep inside. I even had a convo regarding this with her, and she mentions I wasn\u2019t there for her in saddest times now why does it matter to me anymore. I told I was still with the boys and God forbid I wasn\u2019t hanging out with any girl.\n\nYes I might look like a bad guy for not being able to emotionally satisfy her and I really don\u2019t want to lose her. What must I do peeps , shd I just let all that slide and work on myself or what must I just do?",

        "title": "Me (24M) and my coworker (23F) kissed while drunk, now she keeps avoiding me despite saying she wants to move on. Is there still a chance for us to be friends or even something more?",
        "content": "I work a barista position in a fairly busy mall, and I have a cute coworker who started not long after I did. We quickly became friends after realizing all our common interests. She had a long-term boyfriend for several years, so I figured friends is all we'd be. Despite this, she would flirt with me constantly, calling me pet names and joking about things like \"we'd make such cute babies\" and \"I have to sleep with you before I die.\" Things always felt like a joke but they were to the point that all our coworkers took notice.\n\nFast forward to late last year, she kept coming in to work and telling me and our other coworker about how shitty her boyfriend was being and how much they aren't getting along. She told me that she cheated on him with another guy she met at a club, and I was a bit unsupportive as I've been cheated on in the past and I don't think its right to do to someone.\n\nAfter Christmas season dies down and things are less crazy at the mall, I get a new tattoo and show her at work after having not seen her in a while. She says she got a new tattoo on her chest and asks if I'm comfortable seeing it, of course I say yes and she shows me a picture of it. She tells me that her boyfriend got her a really shitty Christmas gift so they were already on thin ice, but then he left her because he didn't approve of the new tattoo. Then a few days after Valentine's day she says she missed me on Valentine's day, and gives me a hug before she leaves work. When I get home, I get a text from her saying how she's sad and wants to drink her sorrows away, so I ask if she wants me to join her, to which she says yes and sends me her address.\n\nI go to her house and play with her dogs for a little while she takes a shower, and then she comes down and introduces me to her mom and her gay best friend. We hang out with her friend for a while, and the three of us drink a bit, but then her friend says he has to leave. I ask her if I should go home too, and she says no, she wants me to stay there with her. So I oblige, and we hang out in her room for a while. She puts on some music, then turns off the lights in her room leaving only the mood lights on. We cuddle on her bed for about an hour, and eventually we kiss a few times. Her mom comes upstairs to tell her that her dad won't be happy if he comes home and finds us like this, so we decide we want to go back to my house. She forces herself to throw up because she says she's starting to feel the alcohol mess her up, but when we go to look for her keys as we're leaving we can't find them. We eventually decide to just call it a night and I go home by myself.\n\nShe texts me the next morning thanking me for coming over and asks if I had fun, but says she doesn't remember much. I help her deal with her hangover, then we leave things there for the day. A couple days later at work, one of our coworkers has a medical emergency and our manager can't find coverage so it's basically just the two of us on the floor all day. I tell her that I feel like I need a drink after the day we had, but she declines because she had an early class the next day. I have work anyway the next day, so I figure I'd wait a bit before making another move. However, the next day she showed up at work after her classes finished, and waited around for around 3 hours until my shift finished so we could \"go on our date.\" We walk around the mall for a bit, then wait back by our store to wait for our other coworkers to close so we could all go out for dinner. As we're sitting by the store, I mention something about the music we were listening to at her house, and she says she doesn't remember it. I ask her if she remembers that we kissed, and she says no, then zips up her sweater and starts accusing me of taking advantage of her while she was drunk. Things become awkward, and I decide to just go home instead of the awkward night at dinner I was anticipating. She calls me after we both leave, and tells me that she's still been seeing the guy she cheated on her ex with since they broke up. Then she tells me that she thinks she's more into him than he's into her, and thinks that he wants to break things off between them because of our kiss. I tell her that I wouldn't have kissed her if I knew she was seeing someone, but she tells me she's just going to back off the flirting at work. I apologize to her the next day for the whole situation, but she seems a bit distant.\n\nAbout a week later, we work together again and she sort of ignores me the first half of her shift, but starts to talk to me about our hobbies towards the end of the shift. She says how she's been stress shopping recently and already spent her paycheck, so after work I text her saying I'm sorry she's been so stressed as I feel partially responsible and let her know I'm still here for her. I get no response, and in desperation the next day I send her a text asking her if she wants me to just leave her alone, to which I still get no response.\n\nWe've since worked a couple shifts together over another week, and she's stopped with the flirting and pet names with me, but does it with basically everyone else we work with now. I overheard that things aren't going too well between her and this other guy, but she's still been a bit distant with me. I don't want to continue to send another message just to get ignored again. It hurts to feel like she has feelings for me that she just won't admit because she's more interested in this other guy, and I don't want to keep growing distant. I don't think I'm owed anything but I felt a genuine connection with her even when we were completely sober and it really weighs on me to be treated like an outsider at work now for a kiss she consented to at the time.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for advice on how to proceed with this situation, I still have feelings for her but I don't want to make things even more awkward between us, and I'd happily just go back to friends if that's all that she ever saw me as, but I did feel a real connection with her and I don't just want to let it all slip away. I know people like to say \"don't shit where you eat\" but I was just trying to pick up on what felt like obvious signals from a pretty girl who told me she was single. I know tons of people who met their significant other through work, and neither of us intend to stay at this job long-term.\n\nTL;DR:  \nMy flirty coworker broke up with her boyfriend then invited me over for drinks, but now she's mad at me because we kissed and I don't know how to proceed.",

He has been going on fishing trips on the weekends lately which is usually fine but it\u2019s been almost a month since he has spent any quality time with us. He went fishing again this weekend and was supposed to come home tonight. He had called me when he was finished to let me know he was on his way home and should be back in about an hour and said we could go out to dinner tonight.Two hours had passed so I called him to see where he was and he told me he was at the bar with his friend he had went in on the trip with. I was a little disappointed but was still excited to see him when he got home. A couple more hours pass and I called to ask when he will be home because at this point it was starting to get late. He told me he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s coming home or not because they\u2019re going to go to a different bar. I\u2019m annoyed at this point and now he\u2019s upset and he\u2019s saying it shouldn\u2019t matter if he comes home because we see each other all the time because we live together. I just feel really disregarded and annoyed because this is a common thing with him just deciding he\u2019s gonna go out and party after him telling me he\u2019s coming home, already making plans with us and bailing, or skipping out on us when we have important things to do. My daughter was also disappointed that he wasn\u2019t home because she was looking forward to seeing him. Just really frustrating. Am I overreaching?\n",

        "content": "So since the election I can tell my bf\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t like me. I have always found his relationship with her off putting because they are very close in a way that seems kind of unsettling to me. hugging and looking in each others eyes, him fixing her hair for her like he does mine when she talks. I don\u2019t think anything gross has happened between them but sometimes the things I\u2019ve seen them message each-other here and there are some things I think to myself is weird to talk about a sibling with. so in short, I already don\u2019t have a lot of positive feelings towards her. she is also very self centered and only ever seems to make sure the conversation revolves around her and my partner finds it extremely draining and sometimes won\u2019t respond to her for days or weeks at a time (she texts him pretty much everyday). this also makes it really hard to even talk to her in person because she laser focuses on talking only to my bf like im not there and when she does it\u2019s only about herself (she\u2019s 27)\n\nI found out recently she has to basically restrain herself from going off on me for sharing \u201ctrump propaganda\u201d on FB and says I\u2019m an SJW. the \u201cpropaganda\u201d in question is me sharing posts about how I am upset that terminated pregnancy reports are now public in my state, likely because our governor was endorsed by trump and shares those same views means my personal data regarding my ectopic pregnancy where I almost died is public knowledge. somehow, it is not at all protected by HIPAA. me worrying about what will happen to my bi-racial stepdaughter seeing rights taken away from people of color. feeling like I can\u2019t be myself because I am bi-sexual and even though I am in a straight relationship, I hid for a long time in the closet and in denial and now I feel like if other people knew I was bi now, or our kids ended up being apart of the LGBTQ community, that we\u2019re not safe. my friends are not safe. I worry about my rights, my step daughters, my sisters, my female friends. I\u2019m upset that all the government programs I needed as a single mom are now having funding cut and could be taken away. and it hurts me to know this because I know how much I needed that when I had no help, and how many families will suffer.\n\nmy partner and I have hit a rough patch because of stuff with kids being difficult and politics and drunkenly admitted to me what his sister thinks of me. said that she thinks my son is a brat too because of his meltdowns (my sons therapist says she believes he is on the spectrum). I didn\u2019t get much more of a conversation out of my bf because he was drunk and fell asleep. \n\nI guess I don\u2019t know what to think anymore. I think I am just ready to throw in the towel. I do everything I can for my family and it feels like my relationship is failing, people outside my relationship are possibly influencing my partner (my partner seemed to become much more right leaning after his sister did when she married an extremely conservative man despite her views being different before that and my partner had made comments about how he noticed her change but now it seems like he is too). it\u2019s also hard trying to care for a child possibly on the spectrum not even because the meltdowns are hard but the input of people closest to you who see how hard it is for your child and for you as a parent always having something negative to say. I just feel hopeless at this point \n\n\n",

I used to dress a lot more 'revealing' when she was 19/20 but has toned it down now.\n\nSo then, as more of a causal passing comment, I said 'I'd say that outfit now is pretty revealing!' which she didn't agree with, since I imagine she's comparing it to what she used to wear when she was 19/20. \n\nThen, she looked at me timidly and said that comment just reminded her of one of her ex's. She went quiet for a bit and it got sort of awkward suddenly. I was just thinking of that interaction the rest of the night.\n\nI have no issue with what she wears, I was just saying objectively, that it was revealing. That's not a bad thing. I'm not one to dictate what my other half wears, I love seeing people comfortable in their own skin.

        "content": "\nI\u2019ve been trying to work on this especially since it almost caused a break up between my boyfriend and I.  \n\nI\u2019ve improved a lot mentally over the last few years of us dating (we\u2019re about to hit four this year), but i\u2019ve noticed that i\u2019m still very clingy. I want to see him all the time and always get super sad to the point of crying because i can\u2019t see him. After our close breakup, i\u2019ve talked to my therapist and she told me that it seems like i have an anxious attachment.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a clingy person towards my friends and used to overthink like crazy whenever they wouldn\u2019t respond to my texts and it was the same with my boyfriend.\n\nMy boyfriend has been nothing but amazing to me and pushed me to go therapy at the beginning of our relationship. I know he\u2019s gotten pretty drained over the years of having to deal with me, which is one of the reasons why it almost led to our break up.\n\nI hate that i\u2019m like this and my overthinking has improved a lot, but i still get so depressed when i can\u2019t see him. I understand that we\u2019re both extremely busy and i\u2019ve already gotten used to not seeing him on the weekdays. I can go by my day just fine (which is a huge improvement), but whenever our schedules don\u2019t align on the weekends i get so sad.\n\nI work two jobs and i always work weekends at the mall. I usually sleepover at his place on Friday and go to work later in the afternoon depending on my weekend schedule. Usually we would also just hang out in the mornings if we\u2019re too busy in the afternoon(he plays soccer like a lot!) and i would go back to my\nhouse after work. \n\nBUT i just hate that i get so upset and sad when i can\u2019t hang out with him again. He says he doesn\u2019t care that im clingy or that i want to see him all the time, but i hate when i get too emotional to the point where i get frustrated at the fact that we don\u2019t hang out as much. I don\u2019t want him to get frustrated again. I jsut don\u2019t know how to stop myself from feeling like this.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that i don\u2019t have a lot of other friends i hang out with. My only best friend sucks at messaging and i see her like twice a month. I know it\u2019s something that i need to work on myself but i just need some advice on how i can be better about this. \n\nI hate that i want to cry all the time because we can\u2019t hang out. I can\u2019t screw this up. ",

He just comes over at night, we hang out a little, have sex and he goes to sleep. I\u2019ve voiced that I\u2019d like to do things other than stay in and he\u2019s always making the plan but we never do. Lately I\u2019ve been feeling like he gets by doing the bare minimum. He\u2019ll go out with his friends but never makes any real effort for me. He\u2019s been working a lot the last month and I haven\u2019t seen him in two weeks. He thinks calling and texting is effort and that wouldn\u2019t be so bad if he didn\u2019t manage to squeeze in everyone but me. Tonight he went out to something family related and called me at 2 am wanting to come over, I said no. He got upset and now I can\u2019t sleep because I\u2019m so uncomfortable with confrontation and he can be confrontational at times. I did want to see him, I miss him but I deserve better than just him showing up at 2 am half drunk. Idk when it happened but I let him get away with the bare minimum and I have never been this person before so I\u2019m too humiliated to even talk to my friends about. My anxiety is so high because I know I\u2019m going to have to deal with whatever mood he\u2019s in from not getting his way. I just didn\u2019t want him here because he could have made a real effort and I\u2019m just tired of it. I struggle with feeling like I\u2019m overreacting about things so I don\u2019t say anything when something is bothering me. I don\u2019t want to end up apologizing for something I\u2019m not sorry for just to smooth things over, so how do I go about confronting this situation without feeling like I\u2019m the bad person?

        "content": "Hi and thank you for reading my post, sorry for my english is not my native language. Since the 1th of march my gf hasn't been feeling very well, stressed with her college, tight schedule, forced to take care of her little brother all day long by her parents, chores etc etc. We are togheter for 3 years now and we had slight misunderstandings here and there but usually i let it go first and we finish those arguments fast. It's also the period of our relationship where we really start to get comfortable with eachother so we may have some slightly different opionions and perspectives, i try to be very patient and calm with it. So the first of march comes and we talk like we used to on Whatsapp, and i ask her if she's ok, how was her day etc. She tells me that she isn't feeling that well and that she's thinking about things. When i ask her if those things are about us she becomes instantly distant and sends vague messages, making me extremely confused if i'm guilty of something or not. So i try questioning some more, but she pushes it away. I back up and i respect her decision, i told her that i'm there for her that if she needs me i'm there, and when she's ready to talk about it we can discuss. So she stays cold and distant for those remaining days until 3 days ago when i go to her house after college, of course wanting to talk to her and have a good time together. But she barely stays with me, having to do some chores, forcing me to either stay alone or with her mom who was making some cakes. It was20:30 when i came to her house and i have only seen her at 22:00 when she came after a shower. I expected us to talk and to have some time together but she gets in the bed next to me, turns with her back and just goes to sleep. I said \"ok, maybe she's really tired\" so i stay on my phone for a little. After some time, she wakes up, turns off my phone and we start kissing, undressing and enjoying our time. I've seen her eager for some time and she actually told me that she wants to try some moves when we make love so i'm waiting for her to do them while we feel good, but she doesn't. So i ask her playfully, if she remembers about those moves that she wanted to try. She instantly becomes cold again, gets dressed up, and goes to the bathroom. In this time i'm really confused because what just happened? I didn't force her or anything, nor i did have a assertive tone or demanding something, but somehow she got mad. So i wait for her to come back, i get my clothes back on in the meantime and when she gets in the bed again i ask her what did i do wrong and that i wanted to talk and solve things before going to bed so we don't stay like that, knowing that she was mad at me for whatever reason before. She just looks in another direction and tells me \"ok\" \"go to sleep\" so i just go to sleep after i'm excusing myself for the mistake i did, not knowing that it made her mad. So the next day we wake up, we get ready, and i drive us both to college, still she doesn't look or talk to me. After she gets in her class i text her that i'm very sorry for what i did to upset her, that i'm giving and respecting her decision of not talking to me and i'm giving her the space she needs, that i love her and that when she's ready to talk we can talk and solve things. She sees the message but no response. One day passes, and it's 8th of the march, in my country being woman's day so i get some big bouquets  of flowers for her, her mom and her sister, 2 custom candles for my gf and a homemade heart shaped box with crocheted flowers with a sorry note attached to it (not just saying sorry, it's about giving her space, respecting her, waiting to solve things out, that i care for her and if she needs something i'm there). She takes the gifts, smiles slightly, hugs me, thanks me and then silence. I try initiating some talk and complimenting her but she just doesn't want to. So i excuse myself respectfully and leave, as i don't want to make a bad move again. Yesterday passes too, no message, but she's liking posts on social media and is active. I don't really know what to do now... so far i'm respecting her space and her wish of not talking to me...but you know it would have been nice to atleast check-up on me... i can't imagine myself being so mad at her that i don't want to talk, or even know what she is doing, where is she and so on... maybe i deserve it and i don't realise it yet but i can't imagine myself punishing my partner like that for a mistake... i mean yes i'm a human, i make mistakes, i'm extremely open to talk, to learn , to love... for now this is the third day and i know she won't text me because she's with her family but i just can't stop thinking about her and this silent treatment... any advice is appreciated..please be respectful and give useful advices if you read until the end, i really want to know your opinion and perspective of things. Thanks! ",

        "content": "Hello,\n\nI apologize in advance for the kind of long post however I just need some feedback whether it be good or bad. My bf (29m) &amp; I (23f) have been dating for almost a year but have been knowing each other going on 3 years. \n\nWe originally started out working at the same job in which a couple months after I started the job, I quit due to personal issues but he had been working with the company for nearly 3 years. After things went downhill for him at that company he switched to a different one within the same line of work and so did I but, I hated my job with a passion. Although we were at 2 separate companies we still kept in contact  and at the time I was in college as well so I knew this was just a temporary career for me and that I\u2019m working towards achieving my dream career in the meantime. With us keeping in contact we used to hang out ever so often, I\u2019d normally go to his place when his roommate wasn\u2019t there because I was &amp; still live with parents at the moment and with him being a bit older he had his own. We originally just started hanging out but eventually started messing around and at the time I didn\u2019t really see myself being in a relationship and neither did he we were just having fun. Over time we started hanging out a lot more but, eventually fell off because it was just so much going on in not only my life, but his life as well so I decided that we just take a break from being around each other in order to put our lives back together and let life run its course.\n\nFast forward about 7 months, during we were still communicating but, not heavily and it was maybe once or twice out the week and about 10 minute conversations throughout text messages and that\u2019s if either one of us weren\u2019t busy and texting back slow. We ended up coming back together because I still valued our friendship more than us trying to build a relationship I just felt like things get too complicated trying to work on building with someone when none of you have your life together that\u2019s why I always advocate for being best friends with your bf/gf first before anything. Anyways I was close to graduating college and super excited because it was the longest journey for me and some days/nights just felt like I wasn\u2019t going to make it but, I\u2019m here! He was very supportive through everything I\u2019ve been through which I\u2019m very grateful and he used to remind me that he actually admired my strength and determination to keep pushing through and it actually motivates him to do better in life which is great because I feel as though if the people around you let along your bf/gf is not helping teach you things in life about yourself or in general it\u2019s not a good thing. I personally love being around people I can learn from. \n\nLast July I got fired from my job(the one that I hated so bad lmfao) &amp; since I did that same line of work twice I literally made a vow to myself that my last time was my last time inside of that company ever. Especially since I had just earned my college degree I wanted to step into a career that aligned with my field so I can get my foot in the door to start doing the things I actually enjoy doing. Luckily for me I had stacked up a lot of money and pto for this very moment because I was mentally and physically already clocked out of both the job and coming off of doing 7 classes my Spring semester in order to graduate. I was sad at first of course because I started to panic about how I was going to keep up with my car note, insurance, phone bill and things of that sort when the time came but thanks to the most high, I have managed well enough without parents help up until this past February and March. As crazy as this sounds, I took this firing as a sign that maybe it was just God\u2019s way of telling me that I\u2019ve done and achieved so much so far and that it was time for me to just take a break and relax from both work and school for a little while because that was all I was used to doing.\n\nI know some of you guys are reading this post thinking okay all of this has happened but what\u2019s the real issues and we\u2019re about to dive into that. August of last year my bf and his roommate ended up going their separate ways as they both felt it was just time for each other to get their own place. I was super excited helping my bf look for new places especially since I now had the free time to do it and he would no longer have a roommate so I could just come spend the night whenever I wanted to which was a plus. He ended up moving into his new and I\u2019ve been noticing things that have been slowly turning me off. I always come over to his house and spend the night but I don\u2019t just freely stay here all day, every day whenever he\u2019s at work or even when he\u2019s off I still go home to my own place just because I still have responsibilities to take care of at home as well and also I just don\u2019t feel as though being together 24/7 is healthy it\u2019s okay to have space in relationships. However he still works at the same job that we discussed earlier in this post and it\u2019s going on about 5 years for him when you combine both the companies and the same line of work and he hates it but, it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t make an effort to change his situation. Before he moved out with his roommate I always used to encourage him to learn a trade or get some type of certification while you have help splitting the bills with someone because once you move on your own things won\u2019t be impossible but they will be harder to try and do certain things in the event you get fed up with your current job it\u2019s always great to have a backup plan. During those times he used to just joke with me and say he\u2019s listening but I feel as though he just didn\u2019t take what I was saying seriously and now that he\u2019s in the situation he\u2019s in and doesn\u2019t have free range to do what I\u2019ve been suggesting he should have done over a year ago he\u2019s feeling it. He often complains about his job and because I used to do the same job I understand his frustration but what I\u2019ve been realizing and it may sound a little harsh but, I can\u2019t feel bad for people who would much rather sit in their situation rather than try to change it.\n\nOver the months his hatred for his job has caused him to become extremely lazy in everything he does in his life. I normally cook just because with me being unemployed I\u2019ve always had the free time but, I also do the grocery shopping, planning everything else. There\u2019s no problem with that the problem lies with the simple fact he either doesn\u2019t know how to or just doesn\u2019t like cooking at all. He lived with his mom up until the age of 26 and then moved in with a roommate who did the majority of the cooking up until the age of 29 so he never really had to do anything but, I just feel like as a grown adult who will be 30 this year he needs to start taking some initiative to learn some type of cooking skills because after 7 months of being unemployed and many tears I have finally landed me a job which is going to require 12 hour shifts soon and I\u2019m not going to be able to do the things I used to do. He normally gets off of work around 5-6ish but when he gets home he literally doesn\u2019t want to do anything but drink wine and sports bet. I\u2019ll show up to his house most times very late around the 11:30ish-12am ish mark sometimes because I usually go to the gym and start cooking a little late but I take time when I cook my food and then on top of that I have to do dishes and he expects me to just do everything for him. He wants me to warm his food up, bring it to him, pour his drinks, start his laundry (keep in mind he knows his laundry needs to be done but won\u2019t start it) and when I ask him why the best response he can give me sometimes is he was waiting for me. I lowkey feel insulted because I\u2019m literally not your maid, I\u2019m supposed to be your partner and partners are supposed to work together, and it\u2019s almost like every time he will see me come through the door with bug metal pans and plates of food and all of a sudden he\u2019s tired and his back hurts so he can\u2019t get up and warm up his own food or he\u2019s all of a sudden too sleepy. He is a night owl and normally eats around the 12:30ish-1am mark and will stay up late watching tv until he falls asleep. But I\u2019m just more turned off at the fact that you\u2019re almost 30 and can\u2019t do a majority of the simple tasks you need to do for yourself and when I\u2019m too tired to cook, he will order out but, he wants me to go pick up his food for him\u2026 he never wants to do it himself so most the time he will try and wait until around the time he knows I\u2019m coming at night to try and see what we should eat so that I can pick it up instead of him. I am pescatarian so therefore I make a lot of pescatarian dishes, he eats meat, seafood and everything else so when I asked him to cook his response is normally on the lines of he cooks just when I\u2019m not there (no he doesn\u2019t because I never smell anything but restaurant food coming from the air fryer lmfaoo) and he cooks dishes for himself because I don\u2019t eat the things he does. I normally go to the gym for about 2 hours in the morning and he would try to wait 2 hours for me to get out just so I can pick up his breakfast for him. Certain things are just giving me the ick really bad as he used to expect me to wake up with him at 9am to make his breakfast and fill his water bottle for work which I stopped doing months ago and he had the nerve to turn around and tell me that ever since I stopped helping him he\u2019s been late to work which I don\u2019t understand because he\u2019s up about an hour before work each day.\n\nTo add the last layer to this cake is the simple fact that he doesn\u2019t even eat pussy but he expects his dick sucked every time. He will barely even touch me during sex and do foreplay besides from rubbing my butt a couple of times and that it. No fingers, no pussy eating, no arousal or anything I think I\u2019ve gotten to the point I feel a little insecure about myself and don\u2019t really like even taking my clothes off anymore during sex because it\u2019s just embarrassing to have to ask your partner to do certain things. I want him to do them because he enjoys doing them and not because I have to ask him to it. We won\u2019t even have sex if I don\u2019t suck his dick. Sex for us every time literally consists of him just laying down on the bed with his dick out while he expects me to suck it for about 5-10 mins and then him just sticking it inside. No foreplay or anything I don\u2019t even get wet anymore at this point we\u2019ve been using lube for months because I\u2019m just not as turned on as I used to be. Every time I used to initiate sex he would slap my butt for about 2 seconds while having his dick out and wait for me to suck it and when it doesn\u2019t happen we just don\u2019t have sex. When I told him I need more foreplay he tells me I\u2019m either watching too much twitter or \u201csucking dick is foreplay\u201d and overall I\u2019m just bored. I think he\u2019s more looking for a mommy figure and not a partner and I just don\u2019t think I can give that to him honestly because if I have to treat him like a child, that turns me off completely and I surely don\u2019t want to be having sex with someone I view in that light.\n\nI\u2019ve already made this post way longer than I intended to but, if you made it this far thank you so much for reading I hope you enjoyed and I am looking forward to hearing everyone\u2019s feedback!

        "content": "Hello everyone I '27/F\u2019 have been talking to my  boyfriend 'M/25' for about 9 months. We\u2019ve been on 2 dates going for date number 3 pretty soon. However after making it official in February , I  don\u2019t think I really like him all that much. Don\u2019t get me wrong he is a very nice guy and the dates were very kind and sweet we\u2019ve pretty much only seen cinema movies. Initially when we started talking I had gotten out of a very traumatic relationship with a woman. And I do often have an attraction to men. But I have primarily only dated women. My Dilemma is that while I find him very much of a green flag and a cutie I just don\u2019t feel any emotional connection to him currently. And don\u2019t really see why I don\u2019t. Because he has treated me so kind and sweet. But I find myself often wanting time to figure myself out alone and I feel as if I didn\u2019t give myself enough time to establish myself as an individual person. Especially after the breakup I went through previously it now feels like I should\u2019ve taken the time to know myself and love myself before I tried to jump into something new . But I also feel so bad about this because while I did initially like him I don\u2019t think I like him as much as I thought I did but because it\u2019s only been 3 dates I feel like I should give it a chance. Nothing really strikes me as odd about him other than his facial hair. But also I don\u2019t like that we text all the time because he\u2019s at work or playing a game . But I do feel that he hasn\u2019t asked me very much about myself in the whole time we were talking . The other day he said I love you . And I couldn\u2019t figure out what I had done to warrant that but I said it back and I didn\u2019t really feel anything. Aside from meeting me in my city to come take me on dates it doesn\u2019t feel like a relationship at all. Also whenever I bring up my emotional state he tries to make a joke to cheer me up. I just don\u2019t like it and I don\u2019t like when I have to plan the dates but have to compromise I feel like I will always be stuck in a perpetual state of compromise and I feel like it\u2019s so mean to feel that way about someone you did like. But I also do feel the overwhelming urge to get my own life together. He likes me as is but I don\u2019t wanna be overweight , and low maintenance forever and I do wanna build myself up to be more independent than I currently am . I also feel like a burden on him because I don\u2019t want to just be dependent on him I want to learn the skills to navigate life on my own as well . But I feel like I am in too deep and should\u2019ve cleaned up my life before involving someone else . \n\nMy question is:  How did you know yourselves when someone was the one and how did you figure your own self out in the midst of self doubt?",

        "content": "It's been about 10 months since she proposed to me and I was cautious at first. We work for the same company and some of the co-workers used to hand out together during breaks and at times on weekends to go out on walks. Me and her met through this group. I knew some of the group members before she started hanging out with us and we eventually talk and make fun of each other a lot. She told me that hanging out with me was fun and she also liked how mature I was even though I was fun too. Eventually after some months she proposed to me. I didn't take it seriously at first because when she did it, she was drunk. But on the following days she flirted with me and told me that she felt safe with me too. She even laughed when I said the corniest of jokes. \n\nBut then after a few months I got occupied with some family matters and then the job shifts. We used to talk and text too but then there was this other guy in the group who was the same as me but louder when it comes to making jokes and all. I noticed she used to hand out with her but like everyone else I thought it was just friendly only. But then , 6 months after the proposal she told me that she didn't feel the same way towards me. It's true. Due to the family issues I was a bit dull. I wasn't as cheerful as i was and the other guy whenever he got the chance tired to be this dominant guy in the group trying to shut me up whenever he could. eventually she stopped talking to me and just yesterday she was asking about some details when we were in the group during the free time. I was explaining it clearly to her but she was only looking at him and listening to him even though he wasn't even saying the proper thing. I saw a group member look at me with a face filled with pity and I froze. I didn't know what to do. I felt like i became nothing. I can't stop talking to them or leave the group since it's an office group but sitting there and watching them interact is killing me. What is the best solution for this? ",

        "content": "My boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) have been together for almost 4 years, but I still feel weird around his family.\n\nI don't mean to be rude or anything as they're a nice family, but I just can't seem to fully relax when I'm with them. I don't know if it's just me being awkward or if there's something deeper going on.\n\nIt doesn't really help either that we both come from different ethnicities too. My family is Korean and his is Chinese. When I'm at his house during break, his parents usually tend to speak more of their native language which I don't mind, however what rubs me the wrong way is that I feel like they could be talking about me sometimes or judging me. Sometimes I try to ask him what they said but he would just shrug saying he doesn't know yet at my house, I'm usually the one who translates for both him and my parents. This one time I asked my friend who was Chinese what a certain phrase his dad kept calling me and she told me it meant \"crazy\" in Chinese. I know his dad usually says it in a joking manner, however sometimes it tires me having to put up with it and just laughing along with it.\n\nThere's been times where l've also stayed over and would feel judged by his parents all because of how early I sleep sometimes. For reference, my sleep schedule has lately been sleeping around 9-10 and waking up early at 5-6. However, when I do sleep over at his family's house, we usually sleep on the pull out couch since his older sister has taken his room (he lives in his college dorm that's why). This one instance, his sister came back home around 11 pm with some friends and I was asleep the entire time they were here but I didn't know until my boyfriend tells me hours after they leave.\n\nI've spent a good amount of time around them over the years, trying to bring gifts but I still feel like an outsider. I try to be polite and engage in conversation, but sometimes I feel like I don't quite fit in or that there's a weird energy I can't shake. I cant tell if I'm going insane over this or not, but I feel like it's taking a toll on me mentally. I want to talk to my boyfriend about it but every time I try to, he brushes it off telling me not to worry so much about it and that I'm just overreacting to the situation. Is there any way I can get more comfortable with his family or not feel as looked down on?",

There basically was no difference. The issue comes when like two weeks after we broke up, she had sex with someone else and didn\u2019t tell me about it (i had to find out by myself), this person had been flirting with her even when we were together, so it felt like some cheating or weird thing going on. \n\nWe got back together after 6months of being \u201cbroken up\u201d but like i said we very much still acted like partners and we even saw each other in the middle of those 6 months and acted like a couple. \n\nThe main problem is i don\u2019t know how to get over this, this happened a year ago and im still not over it, idk how to deal with the pain that it still causes me without getting into an argument with her. She tries her best to keep apologizing but it doesn\u2019t ease my pain and i can tell she\u2019s over talking about this. \n\n\nAny tips? What can i do to get over this situation? ",

        "content": "Basically I have feelings for my boyfriend best friend for quite a long time but I ended up being in a relationship with my boyfriend and my feelings can\u2019t seem to stop my feelings for his best friend. \n\n**B is my boyfriend best friend, D is my current boyfriend**\n\nBackground info:\n\nIt was in May 2024 when I met both of them, at my friends birthday party. At that time I was in a relationship, however, it was an extremely toxic relationship that I was not able to end things without worrying abt my ex mental health. Basically at the party, my friend had told me she was into this guy we will call him B, and he is best friend with D. I thought B was cute but throughout the entire night, we did not talk to each other until late late night where the party was over (some ppl slept over at her place some left) I knew my friend was intrested in him and me being in a relationship depsite mentally checked out of it, I kept my distance and never approached B. Eventually later the night B approached me and we had a very very causal conversation for litterally 10mins. We were going to continue talking to each other but my friend who was into him saw us together and kind of seperate us, dragging me away to spend time with her instead. And I\u2019m trying to be a good friend so obviously I\u2019m not gonna try to push anything and want to respect her and did not pursue anything with him. Pretty much that was the end of me and B interaction. I found out the next day B was indeed intrested in me however did not pursue anything 1. Bcs we nvr had the chnace to talk and 2. I was in a relationship still and did not know the fully context behind it. At this time D whoever is my current boyfriend now was with anotehr girl at the party so we never interacted, but we knew of each other because B had mentioned me to him. Months past, I eventually finally ended things w my ex, however B was still constantly on my mind but we nvr had the chance to interact. \n\nMore background context:\nFew days after the party I did request to follow B however had no intention of hitting him up or anything simply just wanted to be murals. However since B knew I was in a relationship he msges me saying I was \u201cdoing too much\u201d which didn\u2019t rlly make sense, either way our ig convo was short and eventually I had to block him Bcs I felt guilty of hving feelings for anotehr guy depsite being in a toxic relationship, I was still honest to my bf at that time and he made me block him. \n\nFast forward to now back in Dec, I\u2019m still thinking of B and also told the same friend who invited me to her bday party abt me hving feelings for B. That night we were going to go out and my friend tried to invite both B and D to come with us. B unfortunately did not join but D did. D was invited Bcs my friend was intrested in him and wanted to get close with him however D became intrested in me instead and told her abt it and so she kinda pushed us to be together Taht night, knowingly I was into B instead. I had mentioned to him I am a big people pleaser and have a hard time saying no or rejecting people, so that night we went to the club and she kind of just left us together and she went to go be with some other friends me and D knew no one but her and I didn\u2019t want to leave D alone so we spent a lot of time tgt. He ended kissing me that night at the club and I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to reject him cus we were dancing together and I didn\u2019t want to reject and leave him alone. My mistake is I should hVe been honest with him the next day abt how I felt however I nvr found the right time and eventually got close with D and we are now in a relationship. While I LOVE D ALOT, i nvr got the chance to get over B who happens to be D best friend, and so I feel guilty for being so unfair for not being able to give my all to D and even more for liking his bsf. \n\nI apologize for this being so long, i\u2019m really horrible at summarized thing. I always feel the need to add in as much details as possible, but I\u2019m just very stuck in this dilemma and I don\u2019t know what to do!!! \n\n\n** also to add in, me and B have not been in contact since May 2024, I have tried forgetting and letting this little crush of him go but it seems impossible. I\u2019m also not shocked if my bf D does happen to know I am intrested in B Bcs my friend told him abt it, however D still chose to pursue me regardless. But he has not brought this up, and also tends to avoid bringing up B name, as if he knows and is just trying to distance us as much as possible***\n\n***add in more detail: it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love D, I do genuinely want to continue our relationship, however my mind has always been on B, and I feel that I can\u2019t and is not fair to D if I can\u2019t figure out my feelings for B. ***\n\ntl:dr can\u2019t help my feelings for my boyfriend best friend",

        "content": "Our anniversary was a couple of months ago, we organized that he would plan the dinner date part and I would plan the activity part. On the day of he had to work late which was fine I understood because of that we had to go straight to the activity I planned because I paid and booked it for a certain time. Afterwards we were too tired to go to dinner so he promised to take me another day.\nThat day never came. I reminded him the weekend of that week, nothing. Reminded him that month, nothing. It's been three months and he's completely forgotten about it.\n\nFast forward to tonight and we were both going through his insta archives and a bunch of old stories of his came up with his ex. One of them was him posting \"anniversary date \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u201d and them on a dinner date. I looked at him and said \u201coh so you can take her out for her anniversary but not my anniversary.\" \nImmediately he snatches the phone out of my hand starts yelling \"that's my past! You're the one snooping through my phone!\" Which makes me worked up then he starts calling me a psycho and that I'm crazy and I need to calm down it's none of my business it's his past. I get it's his past whatever what he doesn't get is that he can take her out for their anniversary but he \"forgot\" ours.\n\nI seriously don't know what to do in this situation. Is it grounds for breaking up. I\u2019m really confused on how I feel. Has anyone been through this situation? Is it something you worked past? \n\nAlso he never posted for our anniversary on social media even when we took photos and videos at the activity I planned and paid for it was never posted but he posted her ",

Then he took the initiative to share numbers. I texted him first because he didn\u2019t do it. He then told me he had only wanted to have sex with me and had hesitated to text me because he had felt it\u2019d be wrong to use me. I heard that he\u2019s not over his one and only ex but regardless we started seeing each other. \n\nPretty early on I craved a lot of physical touch. I was constanly trying to hug or spoon with him because I was getting obsessed. He was not so fond of that and instead wanted stimulation from movies, podcasts, deep conversations etc. Of course we talked, watched and listened but it never seemed to be enough for him. \n\nA few months passed and we moved together. He thought about his ex less and our relationship was going pretty well except he still felt that he was not getting enough stimulation. I watched and listened more youtube and podcasts than I had before done. Not only for him, for me too. I wanted to learn more about this world, psychology, societies, different phenomenons etc.\n\nNow it\u2019s been ten months since we moved together. He says that he is not particularly interested in my thinking. He said to me that the problem is my too low verbal intelligence compared to his. I can\u2019t give him enough new ideas and ways to think about things, and it feels so bad to hear that. His ex and other women have been more interesting and I\u2019m being compared to them constantly. \n\nMy self esteem has always been really low, I had a pretty shitty childhood and have had problems connecting with people. I think I have undiagnosed autism and ADHD or at least some of the traits. Social interactions have always been a bit of a mystery for me. For the first time I feel understood by someone, and now there\u2019s a possibility that I won\u2019t have him anymore. \n\nI love him so much. I want to marry him, I want to have kids with him.

        "content": "I had started taking a minor for my course, where I came across the professor mentioned above. At the beginning of the course, I was genuinely captivated by his teaching style; it was not only engaging but also dynamic and interactive. The way he presented the material made complex concepts accessible and exciting. His use of real-life examples and storytelling kept the classroom lively, fostering an environment where students felt comfortable participating and asking questions. Before long, I couldn't help but steal glances in his direction, and my thoughts were irresistibly drawn back to him. But I don't think it's just me, as I have seen him looking at me endearingly(kinda) a couple of times during the lectures. Moreover, I am the only girl in my class whose name he knows, as he had asked specifically and often even inquires about my well-being and chats a bit. In addition to it, when I was having trouble understanding some stuff he offered personal assistance on the matter and even when it was all clarified he kept asking if there was anything else. There are many other instances as well but he is respectful every time. Now the thing is, the course is about to end and he won't be teaching me any other classes in the future most certainly and I am confused about what to do as this has me anxious as I dont know maybe I am being delusional. \n\nP.S: English is not my first language so apologies for any errors.",

We dated for three months and the reason we broke up was due to me mentioning I lost my v-card to a friend and she didn\u2019t like that we weren\u2019t private. I at the time thought it was reasonable but unreasonable but I did understand her feelings and accept them. All I said was I lost it and never went to detail. However, the reason I say she won\u2019t move past her actions was because she was caught texting her ex. We haven\u2019t been together for 2 months and during the initial time frame of that I thought things were going good and we were going to get back together but one day I noticed she was being careful with her phone so I ended up catching her and confronting her. We talked it out and I mentioned she needed to do better for our relationship. Then I caught her hiding stuff from their time together including a picture book. I made sure she got rid of the stuff because she said she wasn\u2019t even looking at them and she really loved me. So I talked to her again and said she really needed to throw things out and if I catch things I\u2019m done. But since then she has been hot and cold. She wants me one moment but doesn\u2019t. We had a talk last night talking about what is even going on. I moved on from the issue but she\u2019s stuck on what she did as she knows it was wrong. She says she doesn\u2019t deserve the things I do for her as I do anything she wants, take care of her when I can, give her what she needs, and help her when she needs help. I\u2019m telling her she needs to move on from it but she still stuck on it and is preventing us from going further. \n\nShe mentions when she\u2019s with me she\u2019s all happy but when I leave those thoughts haunt her and are loud and they make her overthink about what she\u2019s done. She mentioned the night before she does love me a lot but that she can\u2019t move forward because she doesn\u2019t think she deserves me. I\u2019m tired of it and want to move forward already and have been trying to help but she just gets frustrated that I don\u2019t understand her. I tell her that I do and that she feels wrong about her actions. That she feels like I can do better but all I want is her. But that for that she needs to move forward which leads to her being frustrated with me. She even said wtv man and hasn\u2019t responded to me since.\n\nWhat can we do for her to stop thinking about those thoughts and so we can move on?\nPlease help. I really do love her but she needs to move on from her own actions that I\u2019m over.",

        "title": "My girlfried (27F) cheated me (29m), long post, sorry",
        "content": "Hello, I'm writing this post because I need advice from someone neutral and honest, as I just can't handle everything on my own anymore. I'll start from the beginning.\n\nI (29M) and my girlfriend (27F) have been together for 9 years. I grew up without parents, and my sister, who is older than me, took care of me after I was 9 months old. The relationship with my sister was always tense, and we never clicked like a mother and son. I can\u2019t say I had a terrible childhood, but it wasn\u2019t the best either, although I only remember the good moments.\n\nNow, moving on to when I was 21 years old. My sister kicked me out of the house for completely irrelevant reasons. At the time, I was a student and worked to support myself. That was an extremely difficult period for me, and it was when my current girlfriend and I decided to live together. I have to admit that our life together was beautiful, just like our relationship. We always said (and truly believed) that we had a relationship better than all the other couples we knew (maybe everyone thinks that). Trust in our relationship was immense. Whenever we went out separately (which was really rare), there was never a doubt about what either of us might be doing.\n\nAt one point, my girlfriend gained some weight and didn\u2019t feel good in her body. But I still loved her, supported her, and did everything I could to help. It wasn\u2019t extreme weight gain, maybe 15 kg. During that time, her self-esteem was at rock bottom, and I did everything I could to help her through that dark time. I succeeded. She started working out, lost weight, improved some bad habits, and I once again saw the sparkle in her eyes.\n\nDuring this process, we moved into our first apartment and started building our life together.\n\nNow, a bit about me. I started my career from the ground up and dedicated myself fully to my job. Over the past 6 years, I\u2019ve worked my way up to the position of director (probably in the last 2 years). Of course, this position has its downsides, like working late and bringing work home, but I always kept her in mind. Every morning before I left for work, I would kiss her goodbye, we\u2019d talk several times a day, and we spent time together as much as possible when I got home, depending on how much energy I had left.\n\nNow, here\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this. About 20 days ago, I felt that something had changed in her. She wasn\u2019t the same. She was never in the mood, always carrying her phone around, and acting strangely. I decided to ignore it, thinking she might be going through something on her own and would tell me when she was ready. I\u2019m a pretty good sleeper, never had trouble sleeping, but after a few days of her behavior changing, I started waking up at 3 AM, unable to fall back asleep. After several nights, I decided to check her phone. I found a long message in a group chat with her friends where she was saying she wasn\u2019t sure if this relationship made sense anymore and was thinking about breaking up. This broke me.\n\nThe next day, I confronted her. I managed to get her to admit everything, and she said it with tears in her eyes. I told her that if she wanted to break up, we could do it immediately, but I felt that after 9 years together, we owed each other another chance to work on things. We talked for about an hour and agreed to try. Keep in mind that I had never read her messages or checked her phone in the last 9 years.\n\nFor the next 10 days, I still couldn\u2019t sleep, waking up at 3 AM every day. After 10 days, I decided to check her phone again because I felt like something was eating me up inside. This time, I found hidden messages with another guy. They had been texting for about 20 days, meeting up twice. There was no sexual activity, just a kiss. This hurt me deeply, and when I found out, I completely broke down. I woke her up immediately and confronted her because I couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. She broke down and admitted everything (although at that point I didn\u2019t know about the kiss). She said she was sorry, swore it would never happen again, and that she wanted us to work on our relationship.\n\nThe next morning, I called the guy (I got his number from her phone) and introduced myself. He was completely shocked. He said he didn\u2019t know about me and didn\u2019t want to be between us, and that if I wanted, we could meet. We met in a parking lot, I shook his hand, and assured him I wasn\u2019t there to do anything bad to him but just needed information. He told me everything that had happened. He worked as a delivery driver for our building and had her number. He thought she didn\u2019t have a boyfriend, reached out to her, and they decided to meet up. They kissed, and there was one more meeting after that.\n\nAt that point, I called my girlfriend and asked if we could meet. She agreed. When we met, I told her to be careful about what she was about to say. I asked her how many times they had met, and she said once. I told her that wasn\u2019t true, it was twice, and that she needed to be more careful with what she said. Then she admitted they had kissed and had met twice and would occasionally talk when she felt down.\n\nI told her I wanted to move past this if she was willing too. She said she wanted that and swore this would never happen again, that she only knew me and that I was her whole world.\n\nWe are now in the process of working on ourselves, but I\u2019ve never done anything harder in my life. I can\u2019t eat, I can\u2019t sleep, and I think about her and this situation constantly. I don\u2019t know if I can do this, but those 9 years push me to try.\n\nCan you, from a neutral perspective, tell me if I\u2019ve made a mistake? Does any of this make sense, and can this relationship become even stronger than it was? Do you have any advice on how to get through this without completely losing myself?\n\nP.S. I had a ring for her and a plan to propose this summer.\n\n",

        "content": "I (23M) met this girl (25F), and we got really close over time. She wasn\u2019t just another girl to me\u2014I genuinely loved her, and for the longest time, I believed she felt the same way. We spent countless hours on calls, late-night conversations where we\u2019d share our thoughts, emotions, and dreams. She told me I made her happy, that I pulled her out of depression, and that no one else had ever cared for her the way I did.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t someone who openly committed, but her actions kept pulling me deeper. She\u2019d get possessive when I talked to other girls, always wanted my attention, and we even had deep, intimate moments (both emotionally and physically over calls). We have talked about me cracking a govt exam so that we can be together in future.It was never a direct commitment, but it felt like an unspoken bond\u2014one that gave me hope.\n\n\u00a0But since she gave me most of her time, I ignored these red flags. I thought, \"If she didn\u2019t care, why would she be with me every day?\"\n\nThen everything shattered. I found out from her close friend that 1.5-2month ago she had been getting close to another guy(non muslim..she use to say she would never date a nonmuslim). Not only did they go to the movies together, but they also kissed in the theatre and a caf\u00e9. Meanwhile, she keeps adding random guys on snapchat and talks to them replies them those guys just want sex..she usually denies meeting some she tries..\nI confronted her(i couldn't completely bcz her close friend will be exposed that she told me everything). At first, she completely avoided answering, saying things like, \u201cWho told you all this?\u201d instead of denying it outright. When she realized I knew too much, she tried to shut me down with: \u201cI\u2019m a bad person, Faizan. Just leave me.\u201d And when I asked her if she was saying that seriously, she backtracked, \u201cDo you really think I\u2019d mean that?\u201d\n\nLater, when talking to her close friend, she admitted she couldn\u2019t lie to me because she knew what she did was wrong. But she still decided that if I ever confronted her again, she\u2019d just say, \u201cThere was something between us(that guy), but it\u2019s over now.\u201d She planned to completely leave out the part about kissing and everything else.\n\n\nShe knew I loved her, she knew how serious I was, and yet she still played with my emotions while entertaining other guys online and that one guy in real life whom she kissed And now, after all of this, she\u2019s just sitting there saying to her friend \u201cIf he (me)calls, I\u2019ll talk normally. Otherwise, leave it.\u201dbcz i havent called her for 30hrs as she wasnt being completely honest or opening up\nNo guilt, no remorse\u2014just moving on like nothing happened.\n\nI feel completely shattered. My mind keeps replaying the scene of her kissing that guy in the theatre. She once said I was the one who made her happy, but in the end, she took away my happiness.\nShe always made this image that she is one man girl she doesn't give attention to guys n all\nPeople might ask, \u201cWhy are you so affected if she never committed?\u201d But tell me, if someone spends every single day with you, shares their emotions, tells you how much you mean to them, and gets jealous when you talk to others\u2014how are you supposed to believe it meant nothing? Her words may have never committed, but her actions did.\n\nNow I don\u2019t know what to do. i wanna create scarcity and make her feel how it feels without me(as i am the only one in her life right now who genuinely cared for her and never forced her for anything) I\u2019m stuck between wanting closure and knowing that she\u2019ll just lie or downplay everything if I call.\nM so dumb i cant just cut her off i want her\n\u00a0",

I thought that was a little odd, so I asked him if it was really for my \u201cclosure\u201d or if he just wanted to see me. He said if he wanted to see me he would just FaceTime me. Then he also told me that he is offering me a chance to see him a last time in person, but if I don\u2019t take this offer I will never hear from him again. I told him I don\u2019t want to be manipulated in saying yes. \n\nHe then told me he doesn\u2019t care if I will take \u201chis offer\u201d or not. He doesn\u2019t care about what I do in the future with my life. He doesn\u2019t have a problem to block me and never talk to me again. If we were to see each other, I would never hear from him again after. Meeting him isn\u2019t a chance to get back together, it\u2019s just for me to get some closure. \n\nLater in the conversation he had to mention again that we will never be together again. I told him \u201cYou have to mention it that often, it\u2019s like you have to convince yourself\u201d He then told me I should stop thinking like that and that he doesn\u2019t care about me. I told him it\u2019s weird to care about someone and then not care about them anymore in basically less than a day. He asked me to explain why that\u2019s weird. I said it\u2019s not weird, because it\u2019s probably how he protects himself emotionally. By pushing people away and acting like he doesn\u2019t care. He then said \u201cOh you figured me out completely\u201d And told me to text him this weekend if I made my decision.\n\nI texted him the morning after saying I don\u2019t want to meet him, because I don\u2019t feel comfortable. I told him his texts were cold and defensive. He then blocked me. \n\nI don\u2019t understand him. This is the third time he reached out in 3 weeks. He keeps telling me how little he cares, but why does he keep reaching out? If he cared so little he wouldn\u2019t even bother to reach out. It just annoys me that he won\u2019t have an honest conversation with me. \n\n",

        "content": "Throwaway account.\n\nI (20M) was very close friends with this girl (22F) at university for about three months before things turned physical and we had an odd three-week situationship. We had a deep emotional bond and spent a lot of time together. I confessed to her at the beginning of winter break and things seemed to be headed in a romantic direction as we communicated over break, though she always held out that she was not sure if she was ready for a relationship after having a string of toxic/unfulfilling ones before me. Lots of self-sabotaging, statements of low self-worth, etc. I told her I liked her regardless of her flaws and always tried to allay her fears on this. Lots of emotional labor went into this, though I have never regretted doing it, as I did the same amount when we were just friends. This kind of constant internal conflict in her seems to mark everything that's happened afterwards.\r\n\r\nAnyways, at the start of the semester, I initiated the first intimate encounter, but she said afterwards that she was uncomfortable with this and told me she didn\u2019t want to take things in that direction. I backed off, but then, to my surprise, she initiated everything physical thereafter\u2014the kissing, the late nights in her bed, the physical intimacy, all of it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, she kept verbally insisting that she didn\u2019t feel a romantic spark and wasn\u2019t physically attracted to me roughly a week into things. I got the message and tried to keep the friendship, though it always seemed to slip back into physical intimacy. This contradiction was confusing\u2014if she truly felt nothing, why did she keep pulling me in? She attempted to set boundaries, but then repeatedly broke them herself. She would oscillate between \"this is a mistake\" and engaging with me fully, and I went along with it because I enjoyed it and genuinely cared for her, trying to balance the pleasure with not letting her push things too far so that she would end up being uncomfortable with it later. A big issue throughout was that she was always non-committal (saying she did not want to date) while also feeling problematic about doing anything physical with someone that she was not in a formal relationship with, a sort of catch-22 situation. She's very clearly an avoidant type imo.\r\n\r\nShe has a complex relationship with intimacy. She struggles with deep-seated shame/inadequacy around physical closeness due to past trauma, religious beliefs, and low self-esteem. She also has serious avoidance tendencies\u2014whenever things became emotionally overwhelming, she shut down instead of addressing the issue. While in it, she would refuse to talk about the status of our relationship and pull away from attempting to define it. She told me early on, \"I don\u2019t know how to cope with relationships,\" and I saw that play out in real time.\r\n\r\nOne night, we had a big argument over text\u2014this was the turning point. The core tension came from the fact that she wanted to keep all of our affairs private, whereas I told other people about them in detail, mainly because it felt cathartic to externalize the emotional whiplash, but also, I think, because I wanted the relationship to \"feel\" real. I never felt a real sense of stability with it all, as she would be very push-and-pull with things and retreat fully one day and be back again the next when she felt more at ease. A few other contentious points were touched on and further incensed her too. Nonetheless, after that, she started avoiding me completely. I assumed she just needed space, but weeks later, I found out through mutual friends that she had decided she never wanted to interact with me again. I was never told this directly. It was a complete severance, seemingly out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nIn the fallout, my social standing took a hit, as we share a lot of mutual peers, and in our immediate friend group she is one of the only females in a group that leans heavily towards men. Mutual friends sided with her, and I was effectively pushed out of this group temporarily under the guises of \"giving her space,\" which I believe is a genuine response from them. In short, she quietly restructured her academic and social circles to remove me, moving to a different homework group for a course we share and subtly enforcing boundaries through our peers rather than directly confronting me, telling them things like \"I would prefer if we did not have to see each other at all in shared social gatherings where both of us would be invited\" and so on. She also stopped sharing her location with me right after the argument. I definitely don't think she is being malicious in these acts, but instead does them as a way of preserving her own sense of security. At least, this is what I've inferred after getting to know her quite deeply.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been roughly seven weeks of no-contact now, though I did reach out a couple times within the week of the initial \"no-contact\" moment, as I was not aware we were doing the no-contact thing. I\u2019ve used the interim to do new things\u2014exercising, expanding my social circles, engaging in new hobbies, and processing everything through a lot of people\u2014but I still feel quite unwell leaving all of this resolved. It feels bad, especially considering we were such close friends before all of this happened (I would venture to say that I was the closest peer to her before anything more occurred). Despite all of this, I still feel unresolved about what happened. I don\u2019t regret how I handled things in all, though I likely should have been less absolute in the way I dealt with things (e.g. making an ultimatum in our last argument stating that I needed her to either commit or forgo the opportunity to do this again for the sake of both of us). I do regret that it ended in total estrangement from her. This has been very tough on me and (I imagine) even worse for her. Even now, if we are in a shared social/academic environment, I notice that she will try to create as much physical distance from me as possible and exit it at her earliest convenience as though I were some kind of scary monster.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, she is someone I deeply cherish and love. I would like to salvage the friendship if possible\u2014not to rekindle anything romantic necessarily (though, of course, this would always be nice), but just to clear the air and remove the unnecessary tension that now exists so that we can coexist in the same spaces cordially, and maybe reach a level of trust and vulnerability that we once had. I know I could handle it, but I\u2019m not sure if she could at the moment.\r\n\r\nA lot of open questions remain, and I think nobody has the answers but her, but I would others to hazard guesses and help me ruminate on this. What do you think caused her to act this way? How can someone insist they feel nothing yet repeatedly initiate intimacy? Would reaching out right before spring break begins and right after pre-break exams end to extend an olive branch (with hopes of just talking out \"what happened\" and possibly defusing some of her aparent discomfort/distress) be a mistake?\r\n\r\nA lot of people have told me to just move on, but I still care about her deeply. This isn't coming a place of desperation or wanting to force anything\u2014I love her, ultimately. This isn\u2019t about forcing myself into her life\u2014it\u2019s about understanding what happened and, if possible, making things right. I think we bring a lot to one another, and I hate the way things are right now.",

As an added pressure, 3 out of 4 of his ex-partners have all ended up cheating, so I definitely understand that he's a bit more guarded in that way.

I like getting food from healthier places but he\u2019s more picky so we usually get fried fast food like McDonald\u2019s or Burger King which I hate. If I suggest we get food to-go from seperate places (not that inconvenient bc we\u2019re in a big city where all the food places are next to each other basically), he\u2019ll just say \u201cno, it\u2019s fine!\u201d and basically won\u2019t back out of going where I wanna go then gets something he obv won\u2019t like and doesn\u2019t eat. He\u2019ll go to throw it away and I\u2019ll have to say to either put it in the fridge for later or ask my roommate if he wants it so someone gets to eat it at least. I can get wanting to test your taste buds and trying something new but jumping to immediately throw it away instead of seeing if someone else would want it irks me.\n\nIf we get food from somewhere he wants, he still wastes food most of the time. Like eating half of his meal then throwing the rest away. I\u2019ve tried cooking at home with him but his taste buds are more basic and leaves either just me eating it or my roommate bc he doesn\u2019t tell me until I\u2019m done cooking that it\u2019s actually too spicy, too \u2018exotic\u2019 (any type of Asian, Spanish, Mediterranean, Cajun, etc food), or has too many vegetables- whatever- until I\u2019m done instead of saying anything while I\u2019m still in the cook in process where I can change it when I ask. \n\nIt esp annoys me when I paid for the food, because I just spent almost $20 on your food bc you wanted a large with extra sides and a drink but you\u2019re gonna throw it away. They don\u2019t eat the leftovers either if they put it in the fridge so my roommate ends up with free food at the very least. It\u2019s just so annoying.

He\u2019d wanted to be exclusive about a month in because he felt like he knew, but respected my wanting to move slowly. Well two months later and I\u2019m aware of his exes name. She was transgender, and he say he\u2019s straight and was attracted to the feminine aspects of her. He bought a new laptop and today, while showing me the laptop, and his Google sync, there was a Google calendar called \u201chis name + exes name\u201d. He apologized for it not being deleted, acting as if he didn\u2019t realize, and deleted it in front of me. But I can\u2019t imagine he hasn\u2019t seen his Google calendar since they broke up. I didn\u2019t make a fuss about it. But like many woman I decided to do some digging and realized, per name, that the ex had posted flirty comments to his instagram photos from a yr and a half ago when they were together (together 1.5yrs). He hasn\u2019t deleted the comments, nor did he delete his flirty replies to them. He only has like 30 posts in total and a small following/comments. I never reviewed his comments earlier because I\u2019m not the type to obsess over a guy, and feel confident in myself. The weird part is around Valentines Day, before I had even accepted us being exclusive, he excitedly posted a photo of us to his instagram profile. Even weirder\u2026 he still follows this ex as of today but she doesn\u2019t follow him back\u2026 not sure if she unfollowed after our Instagram post. He says they ended amicably so not sure why she doesn\u2019t follow him back. They also follow each other on TikTok where she is one of two of his followers. He only follows six people himself. Part of me feel like the post of us on Valentines was a way to say hey look I\u2019m with someone new. He\u2019s commented how he wants to \u201cshow me off\u201d because I\u2019m just so amazing. I have a lot of confidence and more worldly experience than him. The post now feels strategic though. Admittedly he\u2019s open with his sharing his phone with me and it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re in contact.\n\nHe\u2019s told all his friends and family about us, and regularly shares his convos with them about me, with me. The last time he shared I told him maybe he doesn\u2019t need to tell me all of this yet. He isn\u2019t love bombing me, that isn\u2019t the vibe, but I do think he\u2019s overly excited about me being \u201cthe one\u201d, yet seeing this stuff about his ex has me worried he\u2019s put me on a pedestal and misplacing emotions. I also reviewed another social media of his and one of his cousin\u2019s had wished him a \u201chappy pride\u201d on his profile pic a year back (we\u2019re not connected on this social media). I\u2019ve consistently made sure he knows I\u2019m okay if he is bi, and that I have close lgbtq+ in my life. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m overthinking things, but something is starting to feel off. I can\u2019t imagine being so connected to an ex who I had a hard time getting over (he says he didn\u2019t take their breakup well back then). Maybe he\u2019s just immature at just two months into being a 26yr old man? He\u2019s an \u201calternative nerd\u201d kinda guy, into tech, rock, gaming, and anime. I know sexuality is fluid but\u2026 If this were you, would you feel betrayed or like you\u2019re being lied to in some fashion?\n\nTLDR: Can\u2019t tell if younger guy I\u2019m seeing is lying about his sexuality and if he is still secretly not over his ex from a yr and a half ago. He seems to like me a lot but keeping remnants of them around.",

        "content": "This has been an issue since the start of the relationship.\n\nBasically, there's a gay manhua that she adores. Two incredibly good looking (fictional) men falling in love with each other admist a story that is embellished with sexual themes but never explicitly pornographic. I understand it's fictional, but frankly, it offended me whenever she would pour over fan-drawings of these half-naked men in sexually suggestive positions, doing sexually suggestive actions, and openly and happily squeel and shriek over them in front of me.\n\nI confronted her about this, explaining that it feels insensitive and offensive to me that she would shriek so shamelessly over sexual content in front of me, however, she gave an excuse that she's simply feeling happy for them, that she's just excited and \"fan-girling\" at the sight of it, and that she does the same for Ariana Grande and other celebrities. However, I had always had the most staunch suspicion that it's not. I feel like this is something so blatantly obvious one way or another, (simply, either it is because she's very clearly feeling aroused, or simply, she's experiencing very clearly two different emotions), and I'm feeling incredibly dense even asking for advice on this.\n\nThe main issue is that, she's arguing that she's experiencing a very different emotion than arousal or sexual excitement when she squeels at sexually-provactive content, and I don't believe her. I mean\u2014he's literally languidly laying on a couch draped in red silk and half-naked, and she's biting her lips, hugging herself squeeling, and she's telling me that she's not feeling aroused from it? The short she literally sent me today that I got in argument over was the two over them stretched over a pool table, complete with saliva and carressing, breathing heavy. Hell, I feel like if I were a girl, I'd definitely be feeling aroused from it. But she's so unbelievably staunch that despite its sexual themes it's just fan-girling, that she's getting excited for *them*, not because it's sexual, but because they're together and fulfilling their dreams, not necessarily because of what's happening. She explained it in an analogy for when I get excited speaking about Franz Kafka (an author I really like), or when she feels excited seeing Ariana Grande. She's just *happy*, or *excited*, but not sexually, and she adamantly refuses to admit that she feels sexual in any way watching it. She's not really the kind to lie about things either. She hid things from me, but they were excuseable things, (i.e. she was scared if she revealed her past girlfriend, that her history of sexual experimentation would drive me away). She says it so believeably and conclusively that I'm beginning to just accept the fact that I'll never understand but what she's saying is true. But, please, refer back to what I was just describing. That content is so unbelievably sexual, I have numerous feelings of doubt that she's not feeling purely innocent love and excitement for them.\n\nI've BEGGED her to explain to me why she almost exclusively reads BL (boy love/gay) manga or manhua or manhwa or whatever it is, and although she says it's because it's a lot more innocent than GL, I feel like I have every reason to conclude it's just because it's two sexy men kissing one another. Look, I don't care if she reads it. I know they don't have any *explicit* pornographic literature or drawings, and we've made it really clear that any porn like that is unacceptable in our relationship and basically cheating, fictional or not. So, if she just didn't squeel over it, express it so shamelessly in front of me, I would be okay with it. It's fine if there's sexy fictional men she reads sometimes. I get it\u2014I read it, and it's a good storyline, I don't blame her for enjoying it. It's not like you can avoid attractive people, not feel anything whenever you see good art and avoid having moments of attraction for them\u2014but you should contain it or divert your attention, and not act on it. But I don't understand why she has to squeel over it without any consideration for me whenever she does. I've tried to get this across, that I don't care if she reads it or feels aroused at these occasionally (very) sexual shorts, we're 18 and whatever I suppose, but she shouldn't express it so lethally in front of me. But again, what's blocking this progress is because she's adament that's not feeling aroused, and hence, has no reason to suspect that I'll feel offended about it if she does, and therefore, no reason to restrict herself from doing so. I've tried to swallow that pill, that she's not feeling aroused, that she's just happy, she's just excited, she's just innocently enjoying the content, but there's either such a divide that unless I take that pill and have someone shove it down my mouth, there's no way I can do it happily, convinced and unconciously.\n\n  \nOne piece of evidence I have for it, is that she said she never felt aroused reading gay porn (yaoi) of any form or any type. At first, I was shocked because there's no way she doesn't, unless she's categorizing two different feelings of arousal and labelling one innocent/excitement and the other one sexual. Is it possible it's just because she's organizing her emotions this way? Or is it really just because she really isn't feeling any moments of attraction or arousal. She keeps saying she feels \"excited\" over and over again. I've asked her what she means by that, and she goes around in a circular definition of \"fangirling\" and \"excitement\", and I'm telling her that \"excited\" when you read and see things like that *is* what feeling aroused is!\u2014but I know she wasn't born yesterday, and surely she can distinguish between the two. Right? \n\nOne last thing I really want to rant about is that I confessed her about watching hentai once, and I was rightfully ashamed and disappointed in myself. She was justifiably livid, considering we had already concluded that porn is cheating, and she barely managed to forgive me and overlook that transgression. Ever since, I've had a strong adversion to it and never returned to that God-forsaken addiction, but this... hobby of her's, I guess? I feel like it's such a double standard. She happily told me that she wouldn't give a damn were it two girls, or if I were watching something similar with two girls going down on each other. But, isn't that, just, porn!? Isn't that what I did, and both she and I knew full well was wrong and transgressive?\n\nI have no idea what's going on anymore. Is she telling the truth, or is she not? \n\nTDLR: She's into a gay manhua and squeels whenever she sees sexual content of the protagonists. I'm convinced it's because she's feeling aroused from it, but she's adament that she's not and she's just happy for them.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a 23M, and lately, I\u2019ve been feeling a growing sense of emptiness when it comes to relationships. I\u2019ve had past breakups that ended quickly, and now that I know what I want, it\u2019s frustrating to see that I can\u2019t seem to find someone who aligns with me.\n\nI recently started working on myself\u2014physically and mentally\u2014and it feels great. I\u2019ve also launched my own venture and am putting in everything to build it. But despite all of this, I feel lonely at times. When I try to date or even develop feelings for someone, I often find that they are either too immature or not serious about relationships, which makes it hard to connect.\n\nI\u2019ve been wondering if dating an older woman (maybe late 20s or early 30s, like 28F or 30F) would be a better fit for me. I feel like they might be more emotionally mature, better listeners, and more understanding in relationships. But I also don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just looking for a quick fix for this emptiness.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? If you\u2019ve dated someone older or younger (e.g., 23M dating 28F or 30F), what were the pros and cons? More importantly, how do you deal with loneliness while working on yourself?\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts and experiences!",

        "content": "I have been going through a really difficult time lately. My grandmother with cancer was recently admitted into the hospital. Me being her caregiver, I live with her and now am keeping her house during her hospitalization. \nI have a boyfriend of 3 years. We don\u2019t live together although we say that we would both eventually like to when possible for us. I\u2019ve felt really depressed and lonely lately with having to deal with my grandmother\u2019s condition worsening and recently adjusting to being her sole 24/7 caretaker. I am so stressed out and am barely taking care of myself. I feel like I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.I just keep wishing that someone else was here to help me or just to make me feel less alone. \nThe rest of my family agree that my boyfriend should stay with me at night just so that I am not alone while my grandma is in the hospital. I love being around him so of course I want that too. He agreed to stay the first night and we were even joking around, playing music and having fun while I clean. My spirits were lifted. The second night he told me that he didn\u2019t want to stay with me. Which made me kinda sad and angry but I tried to respect his boundaries. I assumed that he wanted time to himself plus he told me that he had household chores to do. I\u2019ll admit I practically begged him to come. He had worked the morning shift that day and had the rest of the day to himself. I called him kinda late at night after giving him his space for the rest of the day. He had done his chores. He even went out to eat with a friend. I had told him that I was feeling sad and lonely and he decided to come over but I felt bad for pressuring him and he seemed grumpy that he was there and that I was grumpy as well. I got no cleaning done and we went straight to sleep we were both admitted incredibly tired. \nNow comes night three of my grandma\u2019s hospitalization and me having to stay the night by myself. He had invited me to a family event and given how I had been feeling I\u2019d previously told him that I didn\u2019t wanna go. I changed my mind and decided to go to get out of the house and take my mind off of things. He had previously told me that he would stay the night and that he had his day off the next day but after the event I asked him if he\u2019d be staying and he stayed that he doesn\u2019t want to. He wants time to himself and to sleep. He doesn\u2019t have an overnight bag packed, he wants to shower etc. all minor problems that are fixable. He can sleep here where he can wash his clothes as well as shower. He could even go home first then come here. And he could leave the next day. He could even go to sleep or stay in another room while I clean. I\u2019m also sure that he didn\u2019t wanna help me clean after a long day which is fine. I told him the first night that he doesn\u2019t have to clean I just want him to be there with me. He wouldn\u2019t even consider staying with me and I\u2019m honestly a little upset. \nI called him when he got home and he just wanted to go to sleep. I wish that he could\u2019ve at least stayed up and talked to me. \nI just feel like he\u2019s pulling away and that if he really cared and wanted to help me through this time then he would do what he could to make me feel better . \nAre my hurt feelings justified or am I being too clingy? I just feel so alone and like the people who I confide in the most aren\u2019t there for me when I really need them to be. ",

We\u2019re planning to move out soon. To give some context, we come from different countries, but both our parents migrated here. We met by accident\u2014she mistyped a message to me, and from there, everything just happened naturally.\n\nRight now, the hardest thing for me is trust. I love her deeply, and she always tells me how lucky she is to have me, how she wants to spend the rest of her life with me, and how she\u2019ll tell our kids how amazing I am. But ever since she got pregnant, her mood swings have been intense\u2014some days she\u2019s incredibly happy, and other days it feels like there\u2019s no love between us. I know a lot of it is just in my head, but it still gets to me.\n\nWe\u2019ve both made mistakes. Early on, I still had two old girlfriends in my contacts, even though we had agreed not to keep friends of the opposite gender. Around six months into our relationship, she got pregnant, but she was scared of her parents, and to be honest, it was still very early in our relationship\u2014so we decided to have an abortion.\n\nThen there was one incident where I went to pick her up. She was outside talking to the neighbors and said she needed to go to the store. Instead of waiting for me, she randomly ran into an \u201cold guy friend from high school\u201d who drove her there and back. She was offline for about 20 minutes, which made me suspicious. When I asked her about it, she didn\u2019t tell me the full truth right away\u2014first, she said she was with the neighbor\u2019s wife, then the neighbor himself, and only later admitted she was with the guy friend. I believe nothing happened, and I chose to let it go because she\u2019s an amazing person who truly loves me. She later admitted she was stupid for handling it that way and promised she\u2019d never do anything like that again because she values our relationship too much.\n\nNow, small things still trigger my insecurities. For example, when she\u2019s sleeping, her live location sometimes doesn\u2019t update, and even though I know it\u2019s likely just a glitch, my mind starts overthinking. I don\u2019t want to let these thoughts consume me\u2014I truly want this relationship to work.\n\nSo, my question is: How do I stop myself from spiraling into negative thoughts, like assuming she\u2019s cheating or thinking the worst?",

I said I\u2019m not hiding shit are you projecting something? Would you let me see yours and we can trade? He said uhh no you\u2019re gonna see me talking shit again to Cynthia \nI said who\u2019s Cynthia? He said oh my best friend I told you about last week \nI said how often do you talk to her idk why I\u2019m just now hearing her name if you\u2019ve been friends your whole life \nHe said we didn\u2019t talk at all until we broke up a couple weeks ago but I talk to her everyday now. I tell her when we fight and she tells me about fights with her bf \n\nThat\u2019s sketchy right? Only telling her when we fight and nothing good? And vice versa? He\u2019s trying to say that\u2019s normal but I feel like I\u2019ve been on the other end of that situation and it came out exactly like one would expect. Is it possible they both are strictly platonic with eachother? Do people have bff type relationships with the opposite sex where they only talk badly about their partner but all ends well?  I don\u2019t know how to go about this ",

I go away to college and i live a great life here. i have tons of friends, i\u2019m in sorority and i\u2019m thriving in school (grades wise). Isok?\n\nI never really gone out like bars scene in high school, never really drank or anything crazy so obviously going away to college and meeting people who like to go out all the time and drink, i started going out a lot and enjoying it. i also never had a really good group of friends growing up as well. i want to disclaim that i never liked going out to meet a man or try and meet someone. i genuinely just liked going out with my girlfriends and dancing. \n\nwhen i first met my boyfriend everything was perfect. was so sweet to me and all. i also was very honest with him about how i like to go out and im in a sorority at college and everythingggggg, i didn\u2019t lie about one thing. In the beginning he was fine with it didn\u2019t say anything much, like a month in, would get so fucking mad at me that i go out or want to go out. he thinks going out while you have a boyfriend is \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cim hurting him\u201d keep in mind i have never done a single thing to this man. i tell him and swear up and down that i only go out to be with my girlfriends and he says he doesn\u2019t care and he knows the only reason people go out is to meet someone which in my eyes, isn\u2019t true! all we do is fight about this every single day. he says he will leave me if i keep going out and he thinks it\u2019s disgusting and disrespectful. \n\nwhen we fight he gets super mean and rude, he will tell me im a whore, im disappointing, im disgusting, he will tell me to go fuck myself, and he\u2019ll say he hates me. everyone has a past obv and when we fight he\u2019ll bring up how i did things with other guys in the PAST (I DID NOT KNOW HIM) and like kinda shame me for them. he will say im disappointing for doing those things. after we make up, he will tell me he\u2019s sorry and that he loves me with all his heart and he doesn\u2019t mean anything he\u2019s saying. he will tell me he wants to marry me and he\u2019s gonna change with how he speaks to me when he gets angry but he also says he gets so mad bc i disrespect him and go out. \n\ni genuinely do like going out bc again being in college and young the only time you spend hanging out with your friends is at bars and drinking. i love this man and i would never do a thing to hurt him, i don\u2019t want to leave him i just want advice honestly. \n\nThank you. \n",

        "content": "Just like the title says\u2014my boyfriend unintentionally (or maybe not) outed me to my dad, the one person in my family who didn\u2019t know about my sexuality. My mom and sister have known for years, but I was waiting until I was ready to tell my dad, knowing he wouldn\u2019t take it well. Now that choice has been taken from me, and I feel completely betrayed.\n\nThe situation started back in February when my boyfriend made a cute poster with pictures of us. He had some leftover small prints and, without telling me, decided to tuck a few into my car visor, thinking I\u2019d eventually find them (this was on Wednesday). The problem? My dad frequently uses my car, and I had just complained to my boyfriend that same day about how my dad always leaves the visor down and the mirror exposed. I even closed it in front of him as I was venting about it.\n\nFast forward to Sunday, when my boyfriend and I went on a road trip to the zoo. At some point, something fell in front of me while driving the car. I wasn\u2019t sure what it was. Later, I realized it must have been one of the pictures from the visor. My boyfriend admitted he saw it (and even picked it up later and kept it) but didn\u2019t say anything, even though he knew he had left several more in there. He claims he was just trying to surprise me and didn\u2019t expect my dad to find them.\n\nOn Monday, my dad found the pictures, and just as I feared, he\u2019s not taking it well. I feel robbed of the chance to come out to him on my own terms. My boyfriend is now anxious and sobbing, afraid I\u2019ll break up with him, but I don\u2019t even know if he truly feels guilty or if he\u2019s just scared of losing me. He didn\u2019t apologize right away when we talked\u2014he mostly kept saying he never meant for this to happen and that he just wanted to do something sweet.\n\nI\u2019m in disbelief. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if I can forgive him. Was this an honest mistake, or did he disregard my boundaries? How do I even process this?",

        "content": "We\u2019ve been together for about 3 years now. We met will I was a freshman in college. He is a local to the area I go to school at. It\u2019s been alright. I will say that we went through the talking  stage pretty fast. We talked for a week or two before we started talking romantically to each other (mostly with him initiating) . At first I was a bit wary of how fast things were moving. But later on I just sort of chalked it up to relationship anxiety. And as time has passed, I believed that it ended up being fine since we\u2019ve already been together for this long.\n\nWe both have ADHD, which also created issues of anxiety and depression for both of us. I\u2019ve always kind of struggled with mental health, BUT I\u2019ve been out a lot more effort recently in to truly doing something about it. I\u2019ve attended therapy for many years now, and I have been seeing great improvements. But my boyfriend is not so lucky. He is currently studying at a local community college, and the classes are hard on him. It\u2019s been stressful. He also comes from a family with a lot of trauma/baggage. TLDR, his Dad is an abusive POS, and he was pretty much the only one the stand up to him and getting a restraining order for him and his close family. \n\nHe has a lot of low self esteem caused by a lot of different things. He is Asian and comes from a culture in which you are expected to save face no matter what. He has family members that have berated him in the past and present for his weight/mental abilities/\u201cnot being a good enough son\u201d. He has told me that this is a normal for his family (which is a whole separate issue for our relationship lol)\n\nI tell him that he needs therapy. I reassure him that I \u201cdon\u2019t think he\u2019s a failure\u201d. I constantly check up on him to see if he\u2019s okay, because I fear that if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll find him trying to drown himself in the ocean. Everyday he tells me that he\u2019s \u201cfeeling anxious\u201d and talks about himself as if he is worth nothing. I keep reassuring and reassuring. But I am growing tired. Even annoyed. I\u2019m saddened. It feels like watching someone behind a glass where you can see them but they can\u2019t see you. They are walking right into a hole but no matter how much you tell them to go the other way, they don\u2019t listen. They can\u2019t hear you.\n\nThis particular night, he wakes me up at 2 am about feeling anxious. He learned yesterday that he a has failed one of his exams. He goes on and on about how \u201cr*tarted he is\u201d and that he\u2019s incapable of doing anything right. He tells me that he hit himself the other night in what I think was an attempt to self harm. He then asks me if I still \u201clove him even though I\u2019m a failure\u201d. I sigh and say yes (for what seems like the 100th time). I also tell him plainly that he is too hard on himself, and expects absolute perfection which isn\u2019t necessarily fair. I tell him something along the lines of \u201cyou expect so much out of yourself, something something self hatred\u201d. Then, after waking ME up to tell me this, he says that we should \u201cstop talking about this now\u201d and tries to act cuddly.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to say? ",

        "content": "Hi everyone, \nI wanted advice from people who have either been in a similar situation or have any advice. \n\nTo start out, my bf and I have been dating for 6 years now. We\u2019ve talked about getting married and he already bought a ring. We lived together for a couple of years now and just now have moved back home to our own parents\u2019 house. This decision has felt like a really big step back for our relationship and was heavily influenced by his mom. Throughout our relationship, his mom has been invading our relationship and has been making me out to be the bad guy whenever she doesn\u2019t like a decision that her son makes. She turns every single detail about my life or his life against us and pretty much lectures him for hours whenever he tries to stand up to her. She purposely puts him in a situation where he feels as though he needs to pick between her or me. Whenever we already have plans, it feels as though she should be the priority and we should drop everything and go do her thing. My bf is an amazing guy, but he has trouble being honest with his mom and have deeper and meaningful conversations with her in my opinion. She\u2019s a huge hot head so whenever he does try, she just ends up ranting and venting for hours on end without letting him get a word in. I want to believe that he wants to tell her to give us our space and he\u2019s told me that, but every single time he tries, he fails and ends up getting lectured instead. \n\nFor some background: \nShe has four kids and my boyfriend is the only boy. She was a stay at home mom for almost their entire lives and just recently started working, but doesn\u2019t have a set schedule. I know her other kids have had problems with her butting in, but I don\u2019t know if they ever said anything or if anything was resolved with her other kids. \n\nWe\u2019re both close to our families, and I would never want him to cut her off. But the clear disrespect she has shown me throughout the last six years is absurd. The one time I stood up for myself when my bf couldn\u2019t (within the first 2 years of the relationship) she called me disrespectful, rude, &amp; manipulative. \n\nI spend more time with my own family, and my bf usually comes with me. I\u2019m not sure if it is jealousy on her part or what, but she has caused a huge drift within our relationship. \n\nIs there anything I should do or just suck it up? Is there any way I could help my boyfriend stand up to his own mom? I don\u2019t really want to have another conversation with her because she\u2019s such a hot head and will talk for hours on end, and if I ever interrupt her, I\u2019m the bad guy.\n\nAlso good to mention: he\u2019s been getting a lot of pressure from her to break up with me despite telling her that he was going to propose to me and already bought a ring. \n\nAny advice would be helpful.

We got into this relationship because he was really really interested in me, and very sure about me. I got to know him, and I fell for him fast. I have an abandonment wound, and I told him that from the start. He always assured me that we would be able to work things out. I think I have really worn out that promise. We\u2019re currently on break because I had a hard time regulating my emotions, I blame him when I feel insecure, and when I feel uncomfortable. Whether it\u2019s because I think he\u2019s driving recklessly or because I\u2019m running late for a movie, I don\u2019t respond well. He\u2019s asked me what I need to feel better  and I never had to get an answer for him. Just that I was trying. He got to the point last week where he said he worries that we may not be right for each other. Since then we\u2019ve talked, and I know he still wants to be in this, and he\u2019s shown that he wants to work things out. I\u2019m worried that we will never get back to the point where he admired and loved me. He says I\u2019m still his best friend. And that that means he\u2019s still in love with me. I just struggle to fully believe that because he doubted us. We\u2019ve only been together for a little over a year and we were pretty committed And vocal about marriage together. I\u2019m now worried that the past few months of our constant arguing and my constant frustration has changed things for him. Has anyone else been able to save a relationship from this? I\u2019m committed to being better and I\u2019ve already asked for space and time to be able to work on emotionally regulating myself. I have a shit insurance situation, which has stopped me from getting therapy since before I met him. I feel doomed, and I recognize that he\u2019s the perfect partner, and that he will never have an issue. Finding someone. I know I was that person for him. I\u2019m just worried. I\u2019m not more anymore and that with his  fear of divorce,  I might never be. Could I be sabotaging? He says when we\u2019re good, there\u2019s nothing more he could ask for . He used to say if it wasn\u2019t me then he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. I feel so confused\n\nTLDR; my boyfriend is great and I struggle to emotionally regulate. My abandonment wound is making me afraid to recommit to this because he\u2019s told me he\u2019s had doubts due to my constant frustration with him.",

        "content": "Hi all, I'm using a throw account because my usually account is too inactive to post here. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend for about 6 months. We met through work and dated before early last year but I called it off after 2 dates because we work together. She's a really sweet girl though and we stayed on good terms so I asked her out again and 6 months later, we are official. \n\nFrom the beginning, things have been kinda hard. She agreed to go out with me but was unsure where this would go because of the first time. After 2 to 3 months, she seemed to become more comfortable and wanted us to be official. \n \nSince we started dating again, I've been exposed to a side of her that I didn't expect. \n\nShe can be very insulting and insensitive. She calls me names like a bitch, an idiot, dopey, sensitive and needy. \n\nShe can be emotionally unavailable at times (she has told me she doesn't like being vulnerable with people because it makes her feel weak) and can be dismissive of my feelings. \n\nShe gives me belittling pet names like buddy and pal.\n\nShe can have a very hot and cold attitude towards me. Sometimes she seems happy and excited, sometimes not. There are days where her mood seems to change throughout the day. \n\nShe makes insensitive jokes at my expense. For example, we were going to a work function together and before we arrived she told me that once we're inside, we aren't a couple, we're just work friends. Once we got to the function, I kind of did feel like we weren't there as a couple. She spent very little time with me, would suddenly walk away without warning and when standing with a group of people, she would drift away and stand in another part of the group away from me. A co-worker of mine made a comment the following week asking if we were still together because we didn't seem like a couple at the function. It's not the first time she has avoided or ignored me while we're at social events. \n\nI have been very open that I don't feel comfortable with these jokes, name calling and insults. I haven't really mentioned the being ignored at social events issue because she doesn't like to talk about problems and generally becomes withdrawn when I bring things up. I find myself apologising for having boundaries or for wanting to work things out. \n\nAside from these things, she can be generally inattentive in the relationship. She rarely reaches out to me herself, doesn't always respond to messages and has only initiated plans with me once in the relationship so far which was this past weekend. I decided to make plans for myself and didn't ask her if she wanted to catch up. She seemed concerned that I was so busy and didn't have as much time for her. \n\nI've opened up about these things to a few different people recently to try and get some perspective. I can be a pretty anxious guy at times and have been torn between am I over thinking or are these actually red flags because I really feel like I deserve better than this. Everyone I've spoken to has told me to dump her. \n\nShe stills maintains future plans that involve me like us living together one day or introducing me to her parents. This really throws me. I'm honestly just anxious and miserable everyday and it's become exhausting. I feel physically tired all the time.\n\nAm I ignoring red flags? ",

He's a nice guy and seems super chill, but I noticed a week or so before we stopped talking that he seemed distracted and I felt like I was the one steering the conversations towards something more meaningful. Don't get me wrong, he replied and asks follow-up questions but it was surface level stuff. Anyway I told him about it and he mentioned his exam and it has been a lot. So we agreed to pause talking until after his exam (he was supposed to take it early March). I messaged him a few days after his expected exam date and he replied that he didn't end up taking it because he didn't feel ready so is now pushing it back another month or so. He thanked me for reaching out, asked how things were with me, and said he would reach out to me when he's done studying for his exam. I get that the exam is tough and all, but I'm starting to think this isn't going to work out and I'm just waiting around. I'm not sure if I should move on or if I should see where this goes because there seemed to be genuine interest and compatibility?",

        "title": "I (20F) broke off a friendship with someone (20M) who seemed to be my perfect person",
        "content": "Hi, first post on Reddit but I have listened to A LOT of Smosh reads Reddit stories so I\u2019m not unfamiliar. So basically I (20F) became very close to a friend, let\u2019s call him Alex (20F), last summer. At the time I was going through a horrific patch of depression, and I had known Alex previously but for some reason we became really close at the time when I needed close connection the most. We had another friend, who I\u2019ll call Ella (20F), and at the time we were a little trio. I adored our friendship, but I was too blindsided with happiness to noticed that Alex and Ella were always competing for my individual attention. Around August time Alex confessed he had a crush on Ella (it was a shock, to say the least) essentially fracturing our trio in a way that couldn\u2019t be fixed. I was then put in the situation of having to choose between Alex and Ella, and as Ella had some pretty rough jealousy issues with other friendships, I decided to invest more time into my friendship with Alex. A couple months passed and we became inseparable, he single handedly cured my depression, we had interests that matched up perfectly, and as someone who has always craved the ability to be someone\u2019s number one person this was literally a dream come true. It never seemed odd to me that he picked up all my interests and mimicked them, like everything I mentioned that I had an interest in he would be obsessed with it a week later. Alex is diagnosed with autism, and my therapist said that he may be mimicking the interests and acts of someone who has quite a strong sense of self, me I guess, as a way to mask his autism. This would obviously be a subconscious thing, and I in no way blame him for it. It got to a point where he sidelined all his own interests for mine, my favourite band, his favourite band now too. My favourite YouTuber, he has forced himself to watch all of their videos to build a sense of connection with me. At first I was thrilled, flattered even, that he was going to such an extent to bond with me over my silly interests, no one had ever taken such initiative to create a friendship like that with me before. But recently I began to feel like we had become the same person almost, that every aspect of my life had been invaded by his presence, and I didn\u2019t have anything that was just mine anymore. This led to me feeling incredibly suffocated, and would try and distance myself from him, but being in the same school there were only so many times I wasn\u2019t around him and only so much art coursework I could blame for my absence. I was also becoming slightly nervous that Alex maybe saw me as more than just a friend, like he did with Ella. He identifies as aromantic asexual but has said in the past that there did seem to be some exceptions to it. I fear that I may be one of the exceptions, and he says things to me such as \u2018I can\u2018t wait to spend the rest of my life with you\u2019, and \u2018you\u2019re my favourite person I\u2019ve ever met, I love you so much\u2018. Alex has also confessed that he really worries about me eventually finding a romantic partner that I will love more than him, he fears me getting married, etc. I don\u2019t know if that\u2018s because he feared losing our platonic bond over a romantic one, or because he wants to be the person in that romantic relationship with me.\nIn the last couple of weeks, my life has taken a massive turn for the better (I\u2019m on an upwards trajectory, according to my 80 year old nan), I got a job, finally started revising for my exams, began to strengthen my friendships outside of Alex, specifically with Ella. It started to feel like each of my interactions with Alex were weighing me down, and I would sit there while he didn\u2019t say a thing (something I forgot to mention- if I don\u2019t talk excessively, make jokes, be \u2018entertainment\u2018 for the two of us, we will literally sit in silence), and I would think \u201cThere are so many better things I could be doing with my time right now.\u201d This kind of boredom with our friendship and jealousy of all my other friends hanging out together, being chill with their friendships, not bound to a best friend declaring you are soul tied, led to me resenting Alex a bit. I began to ice him out, ghost him I guess. I took a long hard look in the mirror a few days ago and basically said to myself, \u201cright no this is not okay, explain to him why you need a break from the friendship.\u201d So I did, I sent him a long text explaining it all, repeating that it was not his fault, and I just needed to step back for a little bit. I\u2019ve struggled with self harm tendencies in the past and the pressure from this friendship had made me relapse, so as far as I (and my therapist) was concerned, I couldn\u2019t just slap on a smile and pretend it was all okay anymore, despite how appealing the idea sounded.\nAlex has said to me in the past that the only reason he didn\u2018t take his own life was because of our friendship, so that was also a massive weight on my shoulders. It was the fear of, \u2019well the removal of this friendship could benefit me, but what if I inadvertently cause someone to decide to take their own life?\u2019 How could I live with that guilt on my conscience? He responded to the text, it was rushed and essentially just apologising to me, it was obvious he was not in a good place. Was it a bad idea to break a friendship off with someone who always seemed the perfect match to me, and now I worry what he will do?\n",

        "title": "Gay Tragic Situationship Story Advice: Pogi (24M and 25M)",
        "content": "This is a gay story. I (25M) met this guy (24M named Pogi) on Grindr in January, and we have messaged every day since. I told him that I wasn't looking for a relationship because I was getting out of one recently and just wanted casual fun. He accepted but, the more we chatted, the more we both developed feelings for each other. We had sex numerous times in January and it was feeling pretty intimate since we were going to dinners sometimes.\n\nEventually, we talked about being exclusive to each other as their one and main sexual partner because we were having unprotected sex. As I came over pretty often, I was getting pretty friendly with his roommate. His roommate told me many dating stories about Pogi and how he mistreated boys in the past. An example would be Pogi lying to boy1 about being sick and making dinner for boy2 to impress him. Boy1 came over to the apartment with Pogi's favorite food and caught him lying. He has dated 14 guys since June and has had 5 Boyfriends in his lifetime.\n\nAt that point, I should have known he wasn't a good person but I wanted to believe he was different and had changed. Pogi made me feel very loved and secure. He made me a Spotify playlist and cooked amazing dinners for me. He introduced me to his friends and called me cute nicknames (he called me Pogi because that meant handsome in Tagalog and I loved it). He always reminded me how excited he was to be my boyfriend and mentioned he would wait for me.\n\nIn February, I asked him to be my Valentine and that's when we started dating. We made it clear we were each other's only sexual partner and romantic partner up to this point.\n\nLast week, that's when it went all wrong. We had a date planned on March 7th and I was going to ask him to be my official boyfriend. But on March 6th, my gay friends saw that his Grindr profile was active. It hurt so much. My friend messaged him to see if it was real and Pogi messaged back his nudes to my friend (He even updated with new nudes lol). At that same time, Pogi messaged me to ask me about my day and that he missed me. My heart completely shattered at that point.\n\nI didn't respond to him all night and he messaged me and called me all night. But at the same time, he was getting ready to hook up with another guy. It just hurt so much that I couldn't sleep or eat that night. I remember driving to work that morning and I was crying so much. On Friday afternoon, I ended things with Pogi and didn't respond to his questions or call. Hours later, my friends told me he was back to being active on Grindr.\n\nMan, I wanted him to be my boyfriend so bad... I remember the nights when he mentioned he was happy to be exclusive to me and wanted to be with me too. I miss him so much but, I know that's best if I leave things now.\n\nHow can someone switch up that quickly? If we were exclusively dating because we were having unprotected sex, why would he seek other sexual partners? Sometimes I wish he waited one more day and I could of asked him to be my boyfriend and everything would have been fine.\n\nWe are on no contact right now and I believe that's for the best. I miss my baby boy but, I am sure he's happy out there being with other guys\n\n",

        "content": "Hey all,\n\nI\u2019m completely at a loss with this issue.\n\nMy girlfriend was dating a person (A man at the time) for 4 years, and dealing with the breakup when we started our relationship 2 years ago. This person has always had lots of issues to my understanding, like being severely unhygienic, but I don\u2019t know much about the details prior to their breakup. \n\nAfter they broke up, there was a big scare about how he was trying to buy a handgun to kill himself, and he was trying to keep my girlfriend from cutting contact with him. Eventually I did succeed in getting her to cut contact after a few months into our relationship.\n\nEven after that, there was a scare like a year ago where his mother went to my girlfriend\u2019s parent\u2019s house to try to convince them to convince her to get back together with him.\n\nI\u2019m not sure on exactly when, but before my girlfriend cut contact with him, he explicitly said he transitioned to become a woman and has been trying to impersonate my girlfriend\u2019s looks from when they used to date. Further, it\u2019s a messy situation because my girlfriend\u2019s ex is friends with some of her friends in a particular group to this day. They recently showed a picture to my girlfriend of her ex with a new SO, which according to my girlfriend looks very similar to me if I was a woman. So it seems like her ex is trying to do something really creepy about making a gender swapped fantasy of my current relationship with her. \n\nAdditionally, those friends just told her that her ex did actually buy the handgun and carries it around without a permit (we live in California), and drives while drunk. There were other concerning details that she didn\u2019t catch because she tried to steer away from that conversation.\n\nEssentially, despite not being directly threatened, I\u2019m fearful for my girlfriend\u2019s and my safety, and the situation also feels incredibly gross.\n\nDoes anyone know if this is stalking, or something else that I could take legal action on? I haven\u2019t found a situation like this discussed before but considering that it has been 2 years since they broke up and this is still going on, i\u2019m worried.\n\nAnd if it seems like an elephant in the room, I do not understand at all how some of her friends in this group talk to such an awful person, it seems like they aren\u2019t such principled people. And I\u2019m pained as well about how my girlfriend is still in this friend group. She\u2019s a wonderful person so I don\u2019t feel I can make an ultimatum about the situation. I have tried talking to her about it a few times but it seems like she wouldn\u2019t be left with many friends without the group, which makes sense. And to clarify, she is never directly in the same space as her ex, she wouldn\u2019t attend any gathering where her ex would be.",

I have studied photography so i don\u2019t need all that. I like to take picture for fun. But every time I take picture for her she have a very specific angle she wants, settings, basically not letting me free and do my things. I really enjoy photography but with her I feel upset internally when she controls everything, like does she not trust my photography skill? She is a great photographer, she has skills, but I don\u2019t like it when she controls my shot.\n\nI argued with her about this before and she said this is normal, when her friend take picture of her she usually controls everything as well. basically it the argument leads to me being branded as \u201cimmature\u201d and she\u2019s feeling \u201csad\u201d because I\u2019m like this, \u201cshe\u2019s doing everything in the relationship and she\u2019s tired\u201d \n\nAlso she\u2019ll flip once or twice in the kitchen when im helping her. When I\u2019m not pouring a sauce the way she wants to. When I\u2019m not cutting vegetables the way she wants to. \nShe\u2019s a great gf she cooks everyday for me, but Sometimes I just want to live alone for 1 week just to recharge. I can tell she genuinely loves me deeply but I can\u2019t get over this \u201ccontrolling\u201d side of her.\n\nThere is also this one time when She was starting a new job at a new company. She told me to come walk and pick her up at 5. (We were living at an airbnb 15 min walk away) when I go at 5 she told me to wait for half an hour which i did then she apologized and says she needs to stay to work on something (she\u2019s not in this job anymore as she realizes it\u2019s overworking and underpaid lol)\nThen I went back home, then she told me to come again at 7 which I did, I asked are you sure you\u2019ll finish? she said she\u2019ll definetly be finish with work.\n\nGuess what when i reached there, she apologized and said something came up and told me to wait for an hour. Me enraged just went back home and tell her to walk home alone.\n\nShe came back home at 8 ish, I ignored her expecting an apology or see the error in her ways. But instead she asked for a breakup saying \u201cI would endanger her by letting her walk alone\u201d I acknowledged it and apologized, this argument happens months ago. Maybe I\u2019m nitpicking and tired of her I dunno.\nBut we ended up not breaking up because of the crying and everything.\n\nLast one, literally last night she says she wants to return to her home country but I told her she can go home alone without me, I don\u2019t mind doing ldr. (We are working from home and living in first world country while we cane from third world country, we\u2019ll have a lot of income if we go settle down back home) then she says it will be meaningless without me, Then I said \u201cbut you are unhappy here and don\u2019t just stay here for me, don\u2019t do the things you\u2019ll regret in the future.\u201d She says if she go home now she\u2019ll end up staying with her parents and being controlled by them, then I said so that means you need me there to give you an excuse to not live with your parents right? That\u2019s for your own self benefit then. I also said if you truly understand me you\u2019ll know what I really want. The she says she wants assurance from me, assurance that I can make it here in the future, I said no i don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing but I can see progress with my career and I want to stay. I told Her the big picture about my dreams why staying in this country matter for me. \nShe claims that I have not been serious about my goals and she doesn\u2019t see any point of staying in this country. The conversation ended with her saying \u201cI just wish my partner is more truthful to himself\u201d (I assumed she claims that I have not been working hard enough?)\n\nSorry for the long text,\nAm I the immature one here?",

Some days ago I posted here to have some advices as my boyfriend was pretty distant, and well, the day after this post, he asked me for some space (well, I asked if he wanted space for the 2nd time and he said somewhat yes)\nHe said that he was asking himself a lot of questions, on our relationship but especially on himself, and that make him tired so he gets angry easily. And that he wasn't sure how long until he will have the answers. \nI asked him a few things, like \"rules\" for the break (I guess that's one) and he doesn't seem to want to talk to me, like at all. He prefers that I support him from afar. He said okay if I send him some cat reels but that's it.\n\nHe's an avoidant, so I guess this is related. But what can i do? Yes I give him space if he wants, but how long? I'm not really a big fan of the no contact thing either, I said that I needed some sort of connection but he didn't answer to that. But, he answered me pretty quickly (like, in less than a minute) when he was supposed to work, and afterwards he was online, then not, then online, then not etc... So idk, maybe he was checking for me. \nI guess I should let him text me first when he'll be ready, but how long do you thing it will last?\nThe weird thing is, when we were kinda arguing, he wasn't active on Instagram.

Ill always be loyal to him\u2014so much so that even a random dream about someone else makes me feel guilty. I don\u2019t flirt, maintain long eye contact, or do anything that would feel even remotely wrong. He\u2019s my future, my person.\n\nBut if I put my relationship aside for a moment, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve struggled with my whole life\u2014I\u2019ve never really felt desired. Growing up, I was always on the chubbier side, and while I\u2019ve had one or two guys like me before, they weren\u2019t men I respected or wanted to like me. I\u2019ve only ever been seen in a friendly way, never as someone who is sexy or desirable.\n\nI don\u2019t even care who finds me desirable \u2014I don\u2019t want to act on it OBVIOUSLY - i actually have not liked any guy except my bf -and I wouldn\u2019t ever want to compromise my relationship. But just knowing that someone does find me sexy or men do - would validate a part of me that has always felt unseen. It feels stupid to even say it out loud because I have an amazing partner, yet I still think about this.\n\nI\u2019ve also never fully embraced my femininity. I\u2019ve always dressed \u201csafe,\u201d avoiding sleeveless tops because of my arms, rarely wearing dresses, and never allowing myself to own my body. I know losing weight will help my confidence, but is there anything else I can do to shift my perspective?\n\nI don\u2019t want to come across as ungrateful\u2014this isn\u2019t about my relationship or my boyfriend. It\u2019s just about me, and I want to understand what to do to work through these feelings.",

As time moved on she had a few part time jobs to pay for holidays etc, which was great. Generally she'd only last a max of 6 months then would come home complaining about it so me being me worked a bit harder and said don't worry leave the job and find another. Speed forward to covid, and like many others we struggled financially. Again me being me worked even harder long days etc. She decided she wanted to get a degree so I agreed that I would work more to keep a roof and feed the family (1). Just over 2 \u00bd years into the degree I was working 6/7 days a week 12 plus hours a day. Now don't get me wrong, I agreed for the greater good to do that and she was happy with that. Now I tell you all this because as you can appreciate that took a huge toll on me, not just physically but mentally. 2 years ago now I found her having an affair, she agreed to leave so our teenage daughter still had somewhere to live. Now luckily (if you can call it that) I found out early but still never the less was absolutely soul destroying, my mental health took a huge dive bomb and I had a nervous breakdown, to the point I had life changing thoughts. Fast forward to today and I'm in a far better place, have a bigger place, toys etc. The only real lasting effect is I have no interest in the opposite sex. I've tried various dating sites just to interact, but well, if that's how people date then God help the human race. Is my lack of interest due to past trauma, just being scared or something else. Can anyone relate and if so what did you do. Please don't say love yourself enjoy being free and single because frankly that's not me. ",

He would never do anything to harm me, respects me, wouldn't push for anything physical which I'm not comfortable with and he also wants to be in a committed relationship. The problem is I have gone through some issues in my life and some ongoing, I have OCD, PMDD gone through some surgeries for my uterus and have painful periods cramps. My bf on the other hand has had a easier life and he doesn't really do well in stressful situations, a small thing like minor fight with a random person in street would make his mood godown and small physical injuries also would hurt him a lot. Even in our relationship, if we fight or have an argument he can't really handle it and he says it's fucks his mood up and he's sensitive like that. He wants to have a lots of fun and would avoid anything that's uncomfortable or stressful even at the slightest. He has himself said he is not emotionally mature. He also has listening problems like he won't listen fully to you and would often cut you off even though he has worked on that problem and has come so far for me. I mask my mental health struggle so well and I often felt alone and unheard in this relationship and I asked him to check up on me now and then and he does that and he tells me I can talk to him and open up but the times I did I never felt understood and I feel like he's doing it just bc I have asked him to. The main problem here for me is, if he has not faced any life challenge and trust me I come with challenges like mental ups and downs and physical struggles I need some support, how will he be there for me when I need him? I need an emotionally mature, understanding and listening man to be with so he can see that I'm struggling and is there for me. I don't know how long I can mask and look like that fun happy person which I'm not that often",

He was my good friend until one day he confessed his feelings after 1 month ignoring me. The relationship was terrible. It was on and off because he wasn't ready to leave or fight against his family for me. I tried to understand him but he manipulated me to do every shit &amp; get a perfect girlfriend treatment for him when he was a terrible boyfriend. He was avoidant, manipulative, inconsistent, have commitment issues &amp; highly indecisive with his feelings. We dated for 6 months in which half of time he was ghosting me &amp; here I was struck with astrology, tarot, subliminals, scripting, visualizing, manifestation and what not to make him understand not to give up on us because I was in love. He abandoned me without giving me a proper closure or apology because he is a coward. I healed, fought bck with my life, lost weight had a glow up &amp; went for phd. I realised I would never be happy with him, I saw no potential in him &amp; realised my self worth. I learned so much about phycology, myself, attachment styles everything, i knew one day he will hit rock bottom and will come to me bck again. But life have other plans I went for phd and he is staying nearby me lol. Most of days we bump into each other and i try my best to remain neutral because I wanna show that he has no power to break me. Recently past 2 months have been seen him with one of our collegemate. They are of same religion and are dating I guess. He has 0 guilt or empathy and walks shamelessly with her in front of me. He has distanced himself from our college friend group too. 1 year 3 months are enough for a person to move on from ur best frd &amp; college frd group after messing everything? I don't know. But it hurts to see him get away with everything he has done, living his best life, going for trips with his new frds, a great love life new gf and here I am again struck in loop of healing, with no frds ,no love life, no social life just working in my phd cabin all day. I don't believe in anything anymore. Tried therapy but its not helping me. Trusted that he will repeat his behavioral patterns and life will hit him hard. I don't want a relationship or friendship nothing from him i know he is one of worst human to exist but i do have unresolved anger &amp; revenge inside me wanting to see his downfall (bcoz he made my mother cry too) and him coming back to me so that I can get atleast one chance for a conversation that he will remember till his death.

        "content": "I (21M) met my now ex F22 at uni and started dating towards the end of 2022 and i broke up with her in october last year\u2026 everything was amazing we got along like a complete house on fire, she moved in with me to get away from her parents at the end of 2023 and we lived together until september 2024 when she decided she wanted to move out with two of her work friends (both female, single, and frankly didn\u2019t like that she was taken because she wouldn\u2019t partake in their \u201csingle activities\u201d). \n\nmind you she lost her original friend group when she moved in with me because she lived on the other side of town so she didn\u2019t have any friends aside from the girls at her new job, but i also made sure to include her in my own group as much as possible and always brought her out with me so she didn\u2019t feel alone. \n\nwhen she did move out, i was pretty upset because there weren\u2019t any problems, minimal arguments, both always more than satisfied each other s*xually too\u2026 not only that she was leaving me in the dust financially with her side of rent to now pay for so i eventually had to move back home. first two weeks after she moved out i discovered she had slept with a guy from work (works as a DJ too, and could only be described as a 5\u20197\u201d rat) by going through her phone when she stayed at mine for a night and he was blowing her phone up while she was asleep, found weeks worth of flirty texts and then her abruptly ending the affair out of regret. \n\nit didn\u2019t matter to me by this point because the damage was done, i woke her up, kicked her out of the house while she was sobbing and begging, then i broke up with her 4 days later. 3 weeks went by (it is mid-late november 2024 by this point), and we went back into contact and we were simply started off trying to be good mates (while also f*cking because we couldn\u2019t keep our hands to ourselves). just before christmas after a series of hard conversations we decided to start working towards getting back together eventually, as she was starting to show that she had learnt her lesson. \n\nin mid january i went away for a week to japan on my own for a snowboarding holiday and halfway through, she had blocked me and i found out she started dating her ex best friends\u2019 (from her original friend group) ex boyfriend since early december. honestly i\u2019m still so lost, hurt and confused i don\u2019t even know where to start recovering, she never told me, and that she had been cheating on HIM with ME. i just don\u2019t get it, i feel so used, i never got any closure, and i tried telling him but she had already conjured up a story to him, i don\u2019t even know how they got into a relationship that quickly since ours finished because they weren\u2019t talking at all when i checked her phone to see that she cheated on me with the other guy from her work. \n\nhonestly i wanna know why you guys think she did what she did, ask questions i\u2019ll be happy to answer, and if you guys think she regrets anything she did at all. sorry i know it\u2019s a lot i hope i\u2019ve articulated everything properly without writing a novel\u2026",

        "title": "Do I (F19)leave my boyfriend (M21) of three years who I love?",
        "content": "My boyfriend is so great to me, he is kind, caring, respectful, connects with my family. We have some slight issues, he still has no career goals/no drive, the jealousy issues have been a work in progress but have gotten significantly better. I could go into more detail regarding those issues but the most recent event is what I need advice on. When my BF drinks he has always become more jealous, incoherent, not recognizable etc. When drinking together it typically ends with him getting mad, me crying or me crying because I think he is upset, obviously I realize this is my anxiety from the past times we've drank. Typically, the morning after these events I start to gaslight myself about why I was so upset as the alcohol hurts the memory, although I remember the feelings being real last night I typically question the details which makes me less confident of my emotions so we both apologize have conversation and feel better. Last halloween (2024) my sister (F23) my BF and I went out, my sister and I were at a table talking to some guys, my BF saw this and I waved him over, he has this face like I had murdered his mother. I instantly try to shut this down cause I can't handle it, long story short he was insanely hammered (not an excuse) and pushed me hard into a hightop, tried to come after me again and my sister got in between him and I. I had my hands in my hair stressed and he commented I hope you rip it out. He had never been physical while drunk with me before at this point, the next morning he can't remember so I tell him. He starts to cry, apologize etc, we discuss recognizing limits. I tell him if it happens again I will leave him but all in all I end up comforting him then forgiving and forgetting. 3 days ago it happened again, I asked him to sober up while I was outside waiting with my friend till their ride came, I come back and he obviously worse. Later, I explain I was just sad and wished he had sobered up when I asked. He kept claiming he had nothing wrong, once I was ready for bed I told him I was headed up and he ignored me then called his friends inviting them over. As I am grabbing the rest of my things to head to the bedroom, he tells me he is tired of this. With that I finally loose control over my emotions, i start to cry and tell him he is being very mean and I head upstairs and lock the door behind me. 3 minutes later he is knocking, his sister is sleeping in the room over and I was nervous he was going to wake her up so I crack it and very calmly tell him i'm going to sleep alone tonight, or I can even more to the other bedroom and he can have this one, that I just need space. He begins to tell me I should be the one alone, I am a waste of his time and tells me he wont talk to me when I go on my trip, I explain that isn't what I said and I just need some space, he then switches me and asks me to leave him alone during my trip and leaves. 2 minutes later he is back but more aggressively shaking the knob then banging, i crack the door at this point he aggressively bodies the door open hitting me and asking me \"whos in here?\" I am starting to cry again and keep repeating \"please leave, please just leave\" I try pushing to just get him out of the doorway, he won't move and is silent. Now I am scared and shakily still begging him to leave, as an attempt to scare him I say \"I am going to call my parents\", he starts smiling and laughing in my face and eventually does leave the room after I stop talking, he calls me a bitch as I shut and lock the door. I had to call my dad to come get me, while he went back out, lost his phone and was even walked home by the cops. Before he lost the phone he was sending miss spelled texts, that he can't figure me out and I am a mistake. He doesn't remember this the next morning, says he is sorry if he disrespected me and that he thought we had a goodnight. After explaining what happened, he tells me he is sorry, how he is disgusted with himself etc. I leave for a 2 week europe trip today with my sister, I told him we could talk more when I get back. I know I should end it, I know these are signs, I am just terrified of the hurt, I genuinely love him, we have a great relationship aside from the drinking, he is my best friend, so kind and loving when sober. I guess I just want advice from people who don't know us or has been through something similar. (this my first post ever sorry for the length, or poor reddit etiquette) Thank you.",

        "content": "Hi!\n\nI have been with my boyfriend for a little under two years (our anniversary is in April), and while I understand that it's not that long, we are in our mid-30s (I'm 36, turning 37 this year, and he is going to turn 38 in the summer) and definitely want to have kids. I have expressed to him that I want to get married before having kids, and says he wants the same.\n\nWe have had endless conversations about getting married and starting a family, and we are both excited about it. The problem is... the proposal doesn't come. I have tried to bring up the topic of actually starting to prepare for a wedding, since I'm really concerned about my age and my desire to become a mom. If he doesn't want to propose, I can skip that (although I would love a fairy tale proposal), but I don't want to sit and wait forever. He told me that he does want to do it right and propose to me, but that he's just not there yet.\n\nI totally understand that we have not been together that many years, but we are pretty much already acting like a married couple - we have been living together for over a year, we have recently bought a house together, we are spending holidays together with both of our families... And we are also financially secure, so that's not the issue. I don't understand why he is not ready.\n\nIt kind of worries me because I have expressed from the very beginning that marriage and commitment is important to me and that I had issues with past partners not wanting to fully commit to me. He said that it was important to him as well and that he values marriage very much, so that's why he never proposed to his ex-gf although they were together for a few years. He says I'm different and that he sees himself marrying me, but I worry that he is going make me wait for years, and I'm not getting any younger.\n\nI love him more that I have loved anyone and I'm willing to wait until he is ready, but my desire to become a mother is strong and I know I won't have that with him until we are married. I want him to be the father of my child, but I worry that that child will never come.\n\nWhat can I do? How can I make him see how big of a deal this is for me? I don't want to pressure him into proposing to me, but it hurts so much.",

        "content": "I (24F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (26M) for 3 months now. The first few months were great, we met by chance and felt connected straight away, neither of us were looking for anything and then BOOM, right place right time. I was 6 months out of a 7 year relationship, in which I was continuously cheated on and neglected, he was a year out of a relationship in which his heart was broken. Things were great for a few months, dates, lots of time spent together, consistent communication that didn't feel overwhelming etc. \n\nBut something seems to have changed? He is distant, quiet and doesn't text me except to make plans. Last time I saw him he was very quiet and straight up told me he was tired and had back pain. Which Is fair enough but something felt... off? As his girlfriend I just want him to be happy but I feel like I am not providing that to him, I hoped at this point he would be happy to share things with me. I can't help but feel like a burden to him and that I am now preparing for the worst because he appears to be pulling away.\n\nThis could also be a case of me having personal issues with trust. I haven't been at this point in a relationship since I was 16 and this is MUCH slower and very different from that. I have mutual friends with me that have assured me that he is the oblivious type and doesn't really have the capacity to lie about his feelings. But I feel like if he wanted to he would?\n\n I can't help but compare, I feel like he doesn't actually like me and is just keeping me at arms length. I tried to communicate this but I'm autistic and extremely anxious therefore I froze and ended up not saying what I meant.\n\nTLDR - am I caught in a cycle of overthinking and should just give him space? Is this the beginning of a break up? I don't want to end things and regret it because I am lost in my own head. Thanks Reddit x",

When his at home he smoke spliff so I don\u2019t suspect anything at home, but recently he had a week off and he was so moody and was smoking more spliffs and smoking them from when he\u2019d wake up which isn\u2019t like him, obviously because he wants a cigarette. Anyway I have found an empty cigarette box in his bag didn\u2019t say anything, when he come in from work last night there is another cigarette box in his bag this time only one missing.

She pays for some dates too, which is a plus, and I know she\u2019s not just using me. We\u2019ve both expressed deep feelings for each other. We talk on the phone for hours. \n\nWe\u2019ve done a lot of things in bed, pretty much everything except PIV. The thing is, she\u2019s super freaky. The best foreplay and dirty talk I\u2019ve ever experienced. It doesn\u2019t help because I get super horny and wanna have sex. This is why I\u2019m confused. I\u2019ve made her cum multiple times without PIV. I can tell she likes me and enjoys it but I don\u2019t understand why she doesn\u2019t wanna have sex with me yet. \n\nI would totally understand if she was super reserved and prude - and she told me she\u2019s not ready yet. That would make a lot more sense than the vibe she gives me right now. Neither of us are virgins, and she\u2019s admitted to having one night stands before. \n\nOn the phone she loves to talk about kinks, fetishes, dreams, and imaginations\u2026. But once we get to the bedroom she stops right before any penetration. I literally do not get it\u2026\n\nObviously I still really like her and if I just wanted sex I would\u2019ve broken up and moved on by now. But I\u2019m just confused. If anyone could offer any guidance for what I should say, ask, or do\u2026 I\u2019d really appreciate it.

        "content": "I (34F) have been with my boyfriend (38M) for a while, and lately, I\u2019ve been feeling overwhelmed by the way he communicates with me. I started a new job three months ago, and before that, I had already enrolled in a professional certification (PMP). Between adapting to my job, studying, and life in general, my time has become very limited.\n\nIn addition to that, I\u2019ve been helping with renovations at his apartment. I try to contribute as much as I can, but it never seems to be enough for him. He often makes comments that make me feel guilty, as if I\u2019m not prioritizing things correctly\u2014even though I\u2019m juggling a lot already.\n\nA recurring issue is that he insists on how I should manage my time. If I leave the house later than he thinks I should, he points it out, saying things like:\n\n\"That means you left late again.\"\n\n\"If you leave late, you\u2019ll get home late, and then you won\u2019t be able to study as much.\"\n\n\"I just want you to finish your PMP.\"\n\n\nThis morning, after another disagreement about my schedule, he texted me:\n\n&gt; \"Honey\u2026 I don\u2019t want and don\u2019t like leaving the house after semi-arguing.\"\n\"If you leave later, you get home later, and you can take less advantage of the evening\u2026 I just want you to finish your PMP\u2026\"\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve told him that the way he communicates makes me feel guilty rather than supported. He often phrases things as if he\u2019s just \"trying to help me,\" but it feels more like control than genuine concern. Sometimes, I feel like he acts more like a parent than a partner, and it's becoming emotionally exhausting.\n\nI feel more pressured than supported. I don\u2019t want to feel like I have to justify how I manage my time every single day.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? How would you handle this?",

As with most relationships it started out great, couldn't keep our hands off each other, always had to be touching even went for walks or just cuddling on the couch. We moved in together after 6 months and it all still continued, living together was easy, but I've realised it was definitely the honeymoon phase. \nThe last year or so has been so hard, but I can't pinpoint anything that's specifically gone wrong. For some reason everything my boyfriend does annoys me, he makes silly noises for no reason, his body hair is everywhere, he snores so loud it wakes me up and keeps me up but he claims it's not a problem and won't go to the doctors. He's absolutely obsessed with sports, he wants it to be on tv constantly and talks about it at every opportunity and ive tried but I'm just not interested. Silly things like not cleaning the dishes properly even though I've brought it up, he asks me how to cook things he's cooked 20 times before, or how long a pizza goes in the oven when he's holding the box. \nFor the last 8 months or so I haven't wanted any physical contact from him, don't want sex, don't want to hold his hand or even kiss him goodbye when he leaves for work. It's not like I don't love him, he feels like home in a comfortable way but I dont know how to want him any more, I dont know how to find him attractive like I used to. It's like living with a really annoying friend and I find myself either wishing for escape or to start again like it was when we first met. \nBasically, how do I desire/want my boyfriend again? \n\nTDLR I've lost all want for my boyfriend in the last few months and I dont know how to get it back ",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been with my partner for almost 5 years, and he has avoidant tendencies, but this situation feels different.\n\nEvery year, he has these \"episodes\" where he starts talking about breaking up. In the past, he would even threaten to break up and then take it back minutes later. I\u2019ve told him so many times to stop doing that, and he finally did. But now, instead of sudden breakups, he\u2019s dragging everything out to an exhausting degree.\n\nThis argument started because he refused to take accountability, so I gave him time to process. A week passed, and he never reached out, so I finally asked:\n\"Are you going to take responsibility or let things end like this?\"\nHe said he\u2019d send me a response\u2014but instead of actually working through anything, he sent me a long message about how hopeless he feels in the relationship and blamed me for everything. Zero accountability.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 3 weeks now of slow back-and-forth texts. And I mean slow, like one text per 2 days. At one point two weeks ago, he broke up with me over text, I didn\u2019t respond, and then he deleted the message and said he\u2019d rewrite it. He never did. A week later, I asked him if we were even still together, and he just said:\n\n\"We are as of now. And hopes we always are. And he thought i was just busy since i didn't respond\"\n\nA week before that, i asked if he wants to break up as well and he also just got mad and said he didn't want to.\n\nMeanwhile, he\u2019s making all these new demands saying he wants full control in the relationship, which is something he always does when he\u2019s triggered or we have arguments. But this time, it\u2019s dragging out way longer than usual.\n\nI even asked if we could just talk on a call because doing this over text is taking weeks, and he refused, saying I\u2019m \u201ctoo emotional\u201d and press for answers he cant think of on the spot??(I did try to call him but if anything he is the one that just sounded angry and uncomfortable for not knowing an answer?) that\u2019s why it\u2019s better in text. But at this rate, it will never get resolved because he takes days to respond.\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t even know what to do. He keeps viewing my chat every day, said he\u2019d give another response, and now it\u2019s been two days of silence again.\n\nWhy is he dragging this out so much? Is this just avoidant behavior, or is something else going on? I've heard about Avoidant deactivation, but I never saw it like this. Additionally, he has a warped view of events\u2014for some reason, he can only see the bad I did but none of his, and he paints himself as the victim and me as the big bad. He never communicated any of it but built it up and unleashed it on me all at once.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed this always happens whenever we are supposed to move out.\n\nWhat am I actually dealing with here? How do I navigate this? What is he even dragging out?\n\nAdditionally, he has scored FA leaning anxious twice but i doubt that, and secure with family. I've scored FA leaning avoidant. I'm aware i used to do the breaking up and regretting but learned to stop it, including some other avoidant tendencies, but this one, i have never done or experienced? I've only ever had one Avoidant do this but their reason was they felt like i didnt want to talk even tho they know it makes no sense.",

She\u2019s a big dog too. \n\nShe goes everywhere with him even too work. When we were first seeing each other she would sleep in his room too but I was very uncomfortable either way this as she\u2019s a big dog and would jump on the bed I wasn\u2019t ever sleeping. \n\nHe had children and so do I. We are wanting to live together but it wouldn\u2019t work due to he dog being aggressive and tbh I\u2019m uncomfortable around her alone. She\u2019s growled at a small child once too so I\u2019m very on edge with her although my partner is adamant and would never hurt a person. \n\nWe see each other a few nights a week and stay together but I always have to stay at his as I cannot bring my dog due to his dog being aggressive and I\u2019m not risking it. \n\nIt\u2019s obviously putting a strain on the relationship now because I\u2019m having to make all the effort (such as always coming to him). We can be lying on the sofa hugging and she\u2019ll come over wanting a fuss (bearing in mind she\u2019s been with my partner all day-24/7) and he\u2019ll pull away from me too fuss her.

        "content": "TLDR; it feels as if my (F26) boyfriend (M32) and I are at the tipping point of our relationship. We have to move in together or else break up from the strain of distance and travel.\n\n\nMyself (F26) and my boyfriend (M32) have been together for 1.5 (coming up to 2) years. we live an hour and twenty minutes away via public transport and a 40-59 minute drive (he has a car however I don\u2019t).\nSlowly things are getting increasingly harder. We feel disconnected from one another throughout the week as we only see each other on weekends. He also needs to spend a lot of his time on the computer making things and working on side projects, so on weekends where we do spend time together, there\u2019s often a fair bit of time he would like to spend on his computer with me near him hanging out. \nIn typical female fashion, I enjoy talking deeply semi-frequently, or just discussing broad topics together, spending time doing something we both enjoy or find novel etc. however he likes us to spend our time watching shows, movies, scrolling, walking on the beach etc. All those things I enjoy very much, however they end up feeling mundane in excess. I\u2019m afraid I have high, unrealistic expectations of what an adult relationship looks like. He is more settled, and would happily spend most of our time on a level 3 exertion together, I however, crave more novelty and connection more often. When I mention that I crave more of this, he can pull away and become defensive. Although I try to frame it as a me and an us thing, I worry he feels I\u2019m attacking him and what he enjoys doing. \n\nThe big thing is, when we spend extended time together aka holidays or long weekends, I feel much more connected to him, happy and loved up. It\u2019s just when we\u2019re seperate that things become hard and uncertainty about the relationship enters my mind. He really wants us to move in together and believes it will fix all of our problems, however, I\u2019m nervous that if we\u2019re having these problems now, it will only get worse once we move in. Does anyone have any first hand experience or similar experiences to share? I feel as if I\u2019m stuck between moving in together a bit sooner than I\u2019d like or having this relationship end from strain of distance. ",

        "content": "(Yada yada, english is not my first language \n,mobile user, i used google translate for some things so i\u2019m sorry if there is something that sounds weird)\n\nMy girlfriend and I are going to celebrate 4 years together this April 28th. I genuinely feel at peace and calm with her, and she has told me she feels the same. The recurring issue, however, has been about our differing perspectives on having a crush or finding someone else attractive.\n\nShe has always been very open about finding certain celebrities attractive, whether they are singers or actors, and it doesn\u2019t matter who. Although this initially caused me a lot of insecurity, it no longer bothers me. In fact, I often joke with her about it because I know it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s attracted to them in the same way she\u2019s attracted to me. We even make risqu\u00e9 jokes about it, and honestly, it doesn\u2019t cause me the slightest bit of insecurity anymore. At the end of the day, she\u2019s human, and I can\u2019t pretend she doesn\u2019t have eyes (something we\u2019ve already discussed and supposedly \u201cunderstood\u201d). \n\nThat said, she has always been jealous and insecure\u2014never to a toxic level, but she has asked me things like not to use overly revealing or sexy skins when we play video games together. I understand that; it can be uncomfortable, especially if she thinks I\u2019m doing it out of some kind of perverse interest. This brings me to the current problem.\n\nSince I was 15, I\u2019ve had a huge celebrity crush on Billie Eilish. I\u2019ve always loved her music and found her attractive. My girlfriend thinks I only look at her for her body, but that\u2019s not true. I thought she was pretty even before she became so open about her body. In fact, I\u2019ve felt uncomfortable with comments I\u2019ve seen on social media about how people talk about her body, especially since Billie herself has spoken about how uncomfortable that makes her. Still, I\u2019ve tried to explain to my girlfriend that it feels strange and a bit hypocritical for her to get upset with me for finding Billie attractive when I\u2019m very open about her finding other celebrities attractive. Especially since every couple of months she likes someone new\u2014not to complain, just to give an example. This caused a huge fight. She called me dirty and said I probably only like Billie for her body and how she thinks she sexualizes herself. I don\u2019t want her to think I like Billie more than I like her as my girlfriend, and that\u2019s definitely not the case. I think Billie is pretty, and I\u2019ve always been a fan of hers, but I\u2019ve lost the desire to explain things to my girlfriend because I can\u2019t find a way to bring it up without upsetting her. I still listen to Billie\u2019s music and watch her videos and interviews, even though my girlfriend has told me she\u2019d prefer I didn\u2019t.\n\n Am I being insensitive? Is there a way to talk to her about this without causing a fight?\n\n\nTL;DR:\nMy girlfriend is open about her celebrity crushes, and I\u2019ve learned to be fine with it, even joking about it. However, she gets upset when I mention my long-standing crush on Billie Eilish, accusing me of only liking her for her body, which isn\u2019t true. I find it hypocritical since she often talks about other celebrities she finds attractive. This led to a big fight, and now I\u2019m unsure how to discuss it without upsetting her. Am I being insensitive, or is there a better way to handle this?",
