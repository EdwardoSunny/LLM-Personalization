1j4qig1,I (19f) have grown overly attached to my boyfriend,"I have been together with my bf for about 6 months now and he's my first and only partner l've ever had. For the past few weeks I noticed myself being extremely clingy to him and during the times when we're apart, I would feel lonely and sad, sometimes overthinking what he might be doing. In the past, l've dealt with depression before but I was never like this during the start of our relationship.

Because we're both in school, we mostly spend our time together on the weekends however we still make time to see each other throughout the week. During the weekends, we would spend entire days together and he would stay over at my place and over time, l got used to this routine. I'm also quite introverted and have very few close friends. So l spend most of my time alone aside from the occasional friend group hangout.

I'm not sure why now I feel so attached to him but it's affecting my mental health a lot when he's not around. I'm not sure what might be causing this, how to fix it, or what I should do..

Tldr: I feel extremely sad and lonely when my boyfriend isn’t around, despite seeing him quite often","Why do I feel so attached to my boyfriend that it affects my mental health when he's not around, and how can I fix this?","The individual is currently in a relationship with their boyfriend, which has lasted for about six months. This person has never had another partner before, making this their first relationship. They are currently in school and, as such, spend the majority of their time with their boyfriend on weekends, though they also try to see each other during the week. 

Previously, the individual has experienced depression, but they report that their current feelings of clinginess and sadness when apart from their boyfriend are new. They describe themselves as introverted and have very few close friends, spending most of their time alone except for occasional gatherings with friends. This background of limited social interaction and previous mental health struggles may contribute to their current feelings of attachment and loneliness in the context of their relationship.","The person is feeling extremely sad and lonely when their boyfriend isn't around, and it's affecting their mental health.",19,female,single,student,middle class,depression,The person is in school.,depression,yes,sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j4qig1/i_19f_have_grown_overly_attached_to_my_boyfriend/,relationships
1j4q9sv,"Me [18m] and my gf [18f] fight so often, our sex drives are so different, and I'm scared for our future. Is it going to be ok? Is this the sort of thing you can fix?","I want to start this off by saying I love her so much and I would never break up with her for the world.
Our 1 year anniversary is on March 18th and I'm really scared for our relationship because we fight a lot. It happens like every other day I feel like, and I don't even know what to do. We always resolve these arguments by the end of the night while calling each other, and we've only went to bed angry once. so I would consider us healthy in that way. A lot of the times it stems from our differences in sex drives or that she wants to save herself for marriage, and I do too but I am horny all the time for some damn reason and sometimes that leads to overstepping boundaries like trying to convince her to do it and then she gets mad. Those aren't the only fights we have, but that's about half. The other fights are just petty things because we are only 18 so she's a little clingy and doesn't really have a life outside of me, but I don't want her to be my only personality trait if that makes sense. Again I love her so much but I'm scared that if we are like this at one year, how will our future last?? I'm really scared because this is my first real relationship and I really honestly want to marry her but I scared. I've seen so many things where differences in sex drive is what causes a lot of couples to break up, and I have a very high sex drive, but for her, even when she's ovulating she's BARELY horny at all. Is this something I should be worried about realistically?
The arguing every other night, is that a problem that would cause us to break up? And before you say anything, I know she hasn't fallen out of love with me. Like I said she's really a little clingy, and honestly it gets too much sometimes. But yeah if anyone that's been in a long term relationship before could give me advice I would be so grateful.

TLDR we fight almost every other night but we resolve the fights. Our libido greatly differs and our one year is coming up. I want to know if this is just a classic case of “incompatible partners” or if this is fixable. ","Is our frequent arguing and differing sex drives a sign that we are incompatible, or is this something we can fix?","The individual is 18 years old and is currently in their first serious relationship, which has lasted about one year.

Regarding family situation, no specific details are provided about their family background. 

In terms of personal factors contributing to the current crisis, the individual mentions having a high sex drive, which contrasts with their partner's significantly lower libido. Additionally, they note that their partner tends to be clingy and does not have a life outside of the relationship, which causes some stress for the individual. They indicate that the fights they have are frequent, with arguments happening nearly every other day, primarily stemming from their differing sexual drives and various petty issues typically arising from their age.","The person is experiencing relationship difficulties, characterized by frequent arguments and differences in sex drives, as they approach their one-year anniversary with their partner.

here's my plan
i need to act like things are normal for another week maybe. i need to go to his house just enough to grab the things i need from his place and to bring back the things i have of his. then once i do that. i disappear. i block him. everywhere. so theres no way to contact me whatsoever.
im not in a situation where im in fear for my safety. i just have so much proof from countless times of trying that this is not a thing i can end by talking and telling him about it.
im not sure what kind of responses or feedback im looking for here. i guess, is there anything i should or shouldnt do in my situation? anything to help this feel less scary and painful than it is?

1j4pt9h,I (28M) feel stuck in my relationship with my girlfriend (25F) and don’t know if I should keep trying or walk away.,"

I've been with my girlfriend for a year and a half. For the first year, things were good. I was living with my parents to save for a house, and she was renting a very cheap apartment (about 75% below market value). Six months ago, I bought my own place, and we moved in together. That’s when the problems started.

She is extremely messy. I knew this before moving in, but we had multiple discussions, and she promised to work on it. Nothing changed. It feels like she doesn’t respect the space I worked so hard for. She never takes out the trash—if I forget for a day or two, she just ties the bag and leaves it on the balcony. Today, I had to carry six full trash bags because she let them pile up.

She’s currently in her first year of a master’s program for psychology and doesn’t have a job. I’ve encouraged her to at least get a part-time job, but she won’t. She occasionally sculpts with clay and sells her work, but it’s not enough to cover even her basic personal expenses (I end up buying essentials for her). Despite this, she frequently asks if we can go on vacations, even though I can barely afford my mortgage right now.

She also has a serious weight issue—she’s obese, not just a little overweight. When we got together, we talked about it, and she acknowledged it. She promised to work on it but hasn’t made any real effort. I invited her to the gym, but she didn’t want to go in the mornings when I’m available.

At this point, I struggle to even be intimate with her because all of these issues are weighing on me. I don’t want to keep repeating myself—I’ve had the same conversations with her at least ten times. I feel guilty pressuring her, but I also can’t ignore how unhappy I am.

Now I feel trapped. If we break up, she can’t afford rent on her own. Her parents used to pay for her previous apartment, but they’ve said they won’t support her anymore. She tells me she loves me, and I believe she does, but I don’t think I can continue like this.

I know I’m not perfect—I’m not the most romantic guy, and I can be emotionally distant—but I’ve really tried to make this work. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Should I keep trying, or is it time to accept that this won’t work?

TL;DR: Moved in with my girlfriend 6 months ago, and issues started piling up. She’s extremely messy, won’t get a job, doesn’t contribute financially, and hasn’t made any effort to work on her weight despite acknowledging it. I’ve had the same discussions with her repeatedly, but nothing changes. Now I feel stuck because she can’t afford rent if we break up. She says she loves me, but I don’t know if I can keep doing this. Should I keep trying or walk away?

","Should I keep trying to make my relationship work, or is it time to accept that it won’t work?","The individual has been in a relationship with their girlfriend for a year and a half.

1j4pn0t,I (M26) have a feeling that I am sitting on a crossroad in my relationship with my girlfriend (F24),"I (M26) have a feeling that I am sitting on a crossroad in my relationship with my girlfriend (F24)

Hello reddit,

So, where to start? I (M26) live with my girlfriend (24) in an apartment in Western Europe. We are renting it. We've been together for four years and have lived together for two years.

We are both studying. I am finishing my master's degree in six months, and she is doing a second bachelor's degree, which will take another two years. On that note, we are both motivated people who work hard to achieve what we want.

This is where the problem starts. Ever since we've been in a relationship, she has always been worried about me. Will I finish my courses on time? Do I have enough money to pay rent? Etc. I have never had problems with my courses since we were together, and I have more than enough money in my bank account. I feel like I am managing everything perfectly. For four years, everything has worked out fine, yet she is always worried about me. This annoys me a lot. She also says that this is just part of who she is. Her family is also very anxious with these things. I must say that it really annoys me when other people interfere with my business. We've talked about this multiple times, and things go well for a while, but eventually, she gets upset if I say that I have postponed some courses so I can take my time and avoid burnout. I was a bad bachelor's student (it took me seven years), but now that I am doing my master's, I plan to finish it in two years. I am really motivated and an adult, so I know what I am doing.

The second issue is that she feels very insecure in the bedroom. I must admit that I have a higher libido than she does. Sometimes, she still cries after sex because she believes she is bad in bed. I constantly reassure her that this is not the case, but she never believes me, which frustrates me. Sometimes, I feel like I can't make love without making her feel upset. I am more adventurous in bed, but she doesn’t want to try new things. For example, in four years, she has never made me orgasm herself. It could be that this is causing some built-up sexual frustration for me.

In recent months, she has been feeling depressed, and I have been very supportive. She is seeing a psychologist to help with her insecurities, which makes me happy because it took me a long time to convince her. She sometimes feels like she isn’t doing enough for me or that I should leave her for someone better, even though I never say anything like that to her.

She is a very lovely person and kind to everyone. What I wrote above does not define her entirely. I believe she would be a great mother to our future children, but there are some things that make me unsure if I want to continue the relationship this way. That’s why I feel like I’m at a crossroads.

I would love to hear your advice on how to handle this situation, and if you could share your own relationship experiences, that would be great.

 Thanks.

1j4oyoq,"I (M27) slept with 100+ women, and feel completely numb to sex and love.","

I’m 27, male, and in a good place in life overall. People usually consider me attractive, and I treat everyone with respect, kindness and consider myself to be a good person. Building a family and having kids has always been my biggest dream — but lately, I feel completely disconnected from anything related to love, relationships, and even sex.

I grew up with the most toxic mother you could possibly imagine, and I can’t help but wonder if that plays a part in all of this. I also realized I’ve barely ever experienced rejection. Aside from my first love back in my teenage years, who murdered my self esteem for a few years, after I became an adult, every woman I meet seems extremely interested. It’s like I’m stuck in this cycle where I just go with the flow on autopilot. Even my only two real relationships started more out of convenience than genuine desire.

Now I sleep with two or three different women every week. They’re all amazing people, they want to see me again, some develop feelings… but for me, it’s just something to do. Sex is good, sure, but that’s all it is. There’s no real excitement or connection. I feel numb.

What scares me the most is realizing I might’ve never actually been in love. I still deeply want what I always dreamed of — a real connection, a family, someone I truly love — but I feel like these years of shallow relationships and constant sex have desensitized me completely. I meet incredible women and keep finding reasons why they're not ""the one"" and end things. 

At any given moment, I usually have someone incredible by my side acting like a girlfriend, even though I’m always upfront that I don’t want anything serious. They stay, knowing I’m seeing other people, and I let it happen because it’s comfortable — but the emptiness stays the same.

When I’m not with someone, when I have to stay at home alone on a Friday night, I feel this heavy loneliness. But no matter how many people I see, it never really goes away.

Has anyone been through something like this? How do you break out of it?

TL;DR: 27M, grew up with a super toxic mom, barely ever faced rejection, and now feel totally numb to sex and relationships. Slept with 100+ women, usually seeing 2-3 a week, but it’s all autopilot — no real feelings, no excitement. I’ve always dreamed of having a family and falling in love, but I’m scared I’ve never actually loved anyone and that constant casual sex has desensitized me. Even when I have someone amazing around acting like a girlfriend, the emptiness doesn’t go away. How do you break out of this cycle?

Edit: I have been in therapy since I was 15. I have been through A LOT in my life and therapy was paramount. Just haven't been able to sort through this specific thing. ",How do you break out of a cycle of shallow relationships and constant casual sex when you deeply desire a real connection and family?,"The individual is a 27-year-old male who has experienced a challenging childhood, particularly due to having a toxic mother. He describes his upbringing as significantly affecting his emotional connections. In terms of relationships, he has faced little rejection throughout his life, with the exception of his first love during his teenage years, which negatively impacted his self-esteem for several years. As an adult, he reports that women generally show a strong interest in him, leading to a cycle of casual relationships that often lack genuine emotional connection.

He has had two significant relationships that were more about convenience than true desire. Currently, he sleeps with two to three different women each week and acknowledges that, while they are wonderful individuals who express interest in him, he remains emotionally detached, viewing sex as a mere activity rather than a meaningful connection. He frequently feels a sense of loneliness, especially when alone, despite being surrounded by potential partners. His long-term aspiration is to build a family and experience true love, but he fears that his pattern of shallow relationships and casual sex has left him desensitized to genuine emotional experiences.

1j4onj0,Coworker Crush- Do I Tell Him?,"I (24f) have had a MASSIVE crush on my coworker (30m) for months. We work in a restaurant, he was hired about a year and a half ago as a prep and line cook and I had been serving there already for around a year. When we first met he was a bit shy, but in a matter of weeks he had warmed up to me. These days I would consider us good work friends- over time we went from sharing the occasional weekday close to working together multiple times a week. He's now one our sous chefs and I'm a bartender and FOH supervisor.

Normally I wouldn't indulge the idea of confessing to a crush, and I still worry about our age gap and the fact that we work together (among other things). I do know shortly after he was hired the kitchen was talking about dating, and he had admitted that I was his type. This was relayed to me within hours by one of the other cooks- restaurants are very gossipy places. I developed a small crush on him within weeks of meeting him, which has only gotten bigger over time. We flirt in our downtime at work, and I find that we gravitate towards each other once one of us falls within the others eyeline. We joke and flirt and he tells me he'll miss me on the days we don't work together.

I find myself checking the online schedule every day before work to see if he'll be there, and it instantly brightens my day when he is. Now that I'm finished my degree I have a new job lined up and I'm planning on leaving the restaurant within the next few months. While this is a change I've been looking forward to for a while now, I know that I will really miss seeing him in particular everyday. We've never seen each other outside of work, except for our company holiday party. He's never confessed to having any feelings for me, and I've never heard any other whispers about it either.

He’s 30 years older than me, and the nature of our work (plus his personality and off color sense of humor) blurred lines a bit. I’ve since begun working full time somewhere else that essentially negates my working for this guy much anymore but our friendship has stayed going. I always assumed he thought of me as more like a daughter, especially because he has a few around my age. He’s been married a few times and has been with his 3rd wife awhile. I have always crushed on him but never figured he thought of me in any other way.

1j4ohjq,I (20F) have been rethinking my relationship because my bf (20M) doesnt have a high emotional capacity,"Throwaway. I (20F) have been with my bf (20M) for over a year now. I love him dearly but I've been thinking of breaking up with him for a while now. I'm a very analytic and very self aware person. Self aware when it comes to myself, meaning that I understad why I feel the way I do, I can figure out root issues or triggers for why I feel the way I do, and I'm able to understand why people may feel upset about things. I don't want this to come off as rude, but my boyfriend doesnt really have that high of an emotional capacity. Whenever I try to talk about my feelings, he usually takes it personally. Whenever I try to communicate how I feel he gets defensive and gets upset with me. He rarely ever ackowledges how I feel and always says ""but that's how you feel it's not the truth"". It's extremly frustrating and draining and it hurts so much. I'd like to add that when I communicate I always use I statments and make it clear that this is how I'm feeling. I'm able to seperate emotion from thought and I'm aware that how I feel is how I feel and that that might not be the truth of the situation, but it's still how I feel and I'd hope that that would be important enough. He oftentimes finds it very difficult to reassure me which leads me to feel much worse because he straight up doesnt ackoweldge how I feel. I don't know what to do. It hurts so much because I love him and he's a really sweet, funny, silly individual. He perfect in every other way except for the fact that he doesnt seem to understand. I'm just so hurt and frustarted because he genuinly doesnt seem to understand. He genuinly doesnt seem to have the emotional capacity to be able to understand how I'm feeling. It's so frustrating. He's also not the best at communicating his own feelings to me. I'm just sad because he gets mad at me and he doesnt seem to understand why I feel the way I do, even after i explain it multiple times. My feelings arent a personal attack towards him, but that's all they seem to be towards him :(. I love him and I want this to work out but I also can't ignore the fact that I've been second guessing our relationship for several months. I genuinly feel like I'm going crazy for having feelings, because if I want reassurance or to talk it always starts an argument :(. I can't do this to myself. I can't be with someone who doesnt have the emotional capacity to meet my need. I can't be with someone who will only ever get frustarted or mad when I'm genuinly trying to tell them how I feel. Communication isn't key, understanding is. Communication means nothing if understanding isn't there. I feel so hurt. Idk I just dont feel like my emotional needs are being met. I would also like to add that I've told him how his reactions to me telling him about my feelings make me feel and its the same thing. Anyways if you read this far, thank you for reading. If anyone has been/ is in a similar situation any advice is appreciated.

1j4of7x,"Met a new guy (23m) and I (28f) find myself attracted to him, but only in my head and not when we actually hang out","So, I (28f) met this guy (23m) in a ski group about a month ago. He doesn’t have a car so I’ve been driving him out to the mountains and we’ve skied together a couple of times. We started talking because him and a few other folks were interested in a long weekend trip, but that sadly fell through. We kept in contact and have since been skiing twice. He also came to a gathering at my house and met quite a few of my friends. And he joined me on a ski day with some other friends who teased me a bit thinking he was a “new guy” or whatever. 

But anyways back to my dilemma. As you can see from the title, he’s significantly younger than me. Which is fine. And if I meet someone who’s significantly younger who I have a connection to, I feel I’d be amenable to seeing where it could go. But this isn’t the case. He’s a cute kid, and super sweet, but our personalities don’t really mesh. He’s a bit awkward and I’ve always kinda been a social chameleon who can make friends with anyone everywhere I go. He sits with his hands crossed and just generally looks uncomfortable in his body a lot of the time when we’re in big groups. When it’s just the two of us it feels comfy though. But, like I said, I vibe with pretty much anyone. And one of the things I value in a partner is someone who matches that energy. I don’t think I could be with someone who sits back and lets me do all the talking when we’re with friends. I want someone else who’s loud and social like me.

So with that information, I’m getting these weird fantasies where I imagine hanging out with him in the future. I also find myself making plans for us in my head as well. And I feel the compulsive urge to text him and then feel kinda anxious when he doesn’t message back for a few hours. But yea, I don’t think we’d be good together and the awkwardness kinda gives me the ick honestly. But yet, I’ve even seen his face (involuntarily) when I’m m*sturbating, and it’s weird. And I can’t stop thinking about him. But then when we actually hang out, I don’t feel any romantic or sexual feelings towards him. It’s only when I’m just chilling by myself. 

Do you guys have any idea what this might mean? Do you think I actually like him and that I’m forcing myself not to bc of the age gap, or am I just bored? I’d appreciate any insights into this, thanks!

TLDR: I met a guy about a month ago in a ski groupchat and we’ve been hanging out. I find myself fantasizing about him both sexually and also about just doing stuff together. But then, when we actually hang out I see a lot of incompatibilities and he’s honestly too socially awkward for me since I’m pretty loud and social. Was hoping someone can give me some insight into what this might mean. ","Do you think I actually like him and that I’m forcing myself not to because of the age gap, or am I just bored?","The individual in the Reddit post is a 28-year-old female.

Her reflections on her interactions with this younger man hint at a desire for a partner who matches her social energy, indicating that her past experiences in social contexts may be influencing her expectations in relationships.

1j4ocr7,Should I (19F) break up with my boyfriend (24M),"So I’m 19, still young, a Freshman in College. I got a lot ahead of me lol. I’ve been dating this sweet boy for about 10 months now, which is crazy to me how time flies… I guess I’m struggling though, we’ve been through a lot in the 10 months we have been together. He’s a recovered addict and has been sober for years now (he’s 24). I know what you’re thinking, like wow that’s an age gap. All I’m going to say is it was purposeful on my end because I wanted someone mature and with life goals already set out. Anyways, yes, he’s a recovered addict and doing well still. When I first met him though, I was under the impression he was going to nursing school since he’s a CNA right now. I immediately caught interest because I’m wanting to go into the same thing. I soon realized he never went to college (uh yikes) and then also later learned about a DUI he’s on probation for.

He’s currently enrolled this summer in a nursing program… but idk I feel like things went so fast and now looking back I just want someone reliable and, I guess, with drive, which I know he has. I don’t want to be the one to always have to push him though. It’s just been hard. I love him so much, but I’m second-guessing a lot right now and it’s scary.

One more thing is Kratom usage. Again, it’s legal here in the state I’m in, but he’s swapped it out for other drugs and I believe he’s dependent on it. One reason is that he spends most of his money on it and was caught stealing from a store 4 different times, and they almost pressed charges. He cried to me about it and said he’s done, but the next week he came home with his teeth stained blue (sign of Kratom tablets). I called him out, and he lied multiple times to my face until finally, he told me the truth.

I need advice. I can’t keep giving him chances, but whenever he’s not around, I miss him, and I can’t bear the thought of what it would be like if we broke up.

TL;DR- Me (19F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together for 10 months. He struggles with drive and wanting to go back to school as well as dependency on Kratom and has lied about it.

1j4o8ea,Am I (21M 22F) misinterpreting friendliness with cheating?,"I didn't know I would be so bothered by such a thing, but today as I was walking from my dorm to the cafeteria at my college I noticed my friend just standing on the path to the cafeteria. I asked him what he was up to just standing there in the rain but he said nothing and just stared at me blankly (maybe he didn't hear me though I doubt it) & I soon saw my girlfriend open the door next to him (they live quite nearby) and bring an umbrella for presumably those two to share. Keep in mind that just moments prior to this she was in my room and I was eating her out (she's still at a stage where she is uncomfortable with sex/giving handjobs, so I mostly give though I enjoy it) and she could've asked me to go eat with her together, as we live close together as well. After my girlfriend brought up the umbrella I asked if I could hold it for her and she said yes. My friend was walking alone in front of us and my girlfriend tugged on his shirt playfully to ask him to slow down, which really bugged me (this is the first time I've seen her do this). She called me in the evening asking about some mundane things I know she normally wouldn't call about, and I have a hint of suspicion that she called to see if I noticed something wrong. Tomorrow, I'm planning on having lunch with her and having a talk about expectations, but I'm not sure if I should bring this up as we are all close friends and I don't want to make things awkward between us, which I know this will. But I just really want to know if there is something going on here. I've also been bothered by her behavior near him for a while now and I'm not sure if it's the right move to bring it up, as we are leaving for break tomorrow and I won't see her in-person for weeks.

1j4o4r7,Red flag or not?,"Hey guys, I am just looking to get some feedback on this situation:  
  
So I (25M) met this girl (31F) at church (let's call her ""N""). At the time, she had a boyfriend of 6 years and was going through some issues with him. We started hanging out in groups and got to be really good friends. As things progressed over the course of a year, we started hanging out individually and while nothing was explicitly said, we both developed deeper feelings.   
Anyway, she broke up with her boyfriend eventually, and a week or so later was her birthday, so we decided to go out to a show and the bar after to celebrate. Keep in mind that we had another friend with us. Also, we had both expressed our feelings for each other at this point.  
I drove her there. We held hands at the show for the first time and then after went to the bar and got drinks. She likes to dance, so at the bar, there was this older guy dancing in a group of people and N goes into the circle and starts dancing with him. It was a couple minutes, pretty harmless. But later on in the night, another guy is dancing in a group and N joins in, only this time, it's more provocative. She turns her back towards him, bends her hips and sticks out her ass. So this guy takes the hint and starts dancing behind her (basically grinding). He doesn't touch her with his hands but I hate to see it. I feel gutted and can't even look. This goes on for 30 seconds, then N stops and walks back over to our friend and I like nothing happened. Later, our friend leaves, N grinds on me and we kiss for the first time.  
  
At the end of the night, we're sitting in my car and I confront N about it. She says that she was just dancing (wasn't anything sexual) and that he initiated it. She says that she didn't even care what the guy looked like. She says she was recently single and just wanted to have fun. She also says that she wanted to make me jealous and that when she saw how it was affecting me, she stopped. In the end, she apologizes and that she won't do it again.  
  
But why do I still feel bad about the whole thing? I thought she backed into him. The guy even came up to her afterwards. She dismissed him but it obviously meant something to him. I feel like if she can do that between a relationship with her ex and myself, then maybe she was promiscuous in her past. She's an amazing person and we get along so well but that night has put doubts in my head.  
  
Does anyone have any opinions on the situation, grinding vs. dancing, etc? Am I overthinking this?

He was always a chubby guy, but he is now morbidly obese (230 lbs at 5’5).   He does have a stressful job, so I’m very sympathetic to his situation, and he is also a very sexual guy. I have tolerated it for many years, but I am at a point where I am no longer attracted to him. Having sex has become unenjoyable to me, more like a chore. When we have sex, we only do cowgirl style, because any other position is very difficult for me to bear his weight. He is by all accounts, a great husband and a great provider for our children. But I feel trapped in a marriage where I have zero attraction to my husband but I love him w all my heart. I have tried to help him lose weight, but all my attempts have been unsuccessful and it has come to the point where he resents me for being a nagging wife. I don’t know what to do.

He will tell me how much he misses me and all the things like that, “I want to see you so bad”, “I wish you were with me”, etc. But every time I actually get to see him..he doesn’t want to be with me. After the first two days of being with me he tells me he needs a break and won’t want to hangout until a day or two later. And I know that doesn’t sound too crazy but for me after not seeing him for months I would like to spend every second I can with him you know? It just really hurts that he doesn’t feel the same and when I ask him about this he just says he doesn’t know why and just needs time away from me. He’ll also say “but I love you so much” and “I love being with you, I do miss you” but I’m like I haven’t seen you in months so why are you needing breaks if you miss me so bad?

1j4nvod,Am I (23M) having romantic feeling for her (36F)?,"Just want to ask as I’m rather unsure on what exactly romantic feelings are.
I (23M) am seeing someone (36F) who I have been in a situationship with for about a year. I don’t really have much relationship experience and have been on only a few dates. She is older than me but this seems to cause no issue between us as we get along extremely well and I don’t feel a large gap in how we are maturity wise.

We began by seeing each other about once a week to once a fortnight and over time that has increased to 2-3 times a week. Usually she will stay at mine and we will play games together or relax and cuddle together. I often pick her up and we go eat together. In the beginning I was uncomfortable with kissing and hugging in private and also pda. I didn’t like the idea of being any kind of label be it “seeing each other” or “situationship” it made me anxious. As time passed I found myself self ok with being affectionate with her and when we are in private I enjoy cuddling and kissing her. I also a few times have felt comfortable enough to cuddle her in front of some friends. There is also times now I have told friends I am “seeing” a girl. She often cooks food for me or tries to help motivate me with the goals I have and we talk daily even if it’s text or a call. 

I found myself feeling upset when she would say things like “don’t worry one day you will find someone you can have romantic feelings for” or found myself saying things I wouldn’t usually say like for example one hot day we came back to mine and I got her a cold drink out the fridge and she said “omg I love you” I know in that moment she didn’t mean it as in she’s saying she loves me but just loved that I got her a drink. But I found myself saying as I was walking away “say it again” I’m not sure as to why I said it, perhaps I was just teasing her a little. I think because I don’t know what exactly romantic feeling are, I’m very confused as to if I am having romantic feelings or not. I spend more time with her than anyone else and she has become a priority over others in my life. I appreciate her supporting me and taking care of me. And I have admitted to her that I do prefer when she’s with me than when she’s not and I’m alone.

For some extra information she has told me she is a little attached to me and gets uncomfortable if other girls flirt with me or buy me a drink when I’m out. But never stops me from going out or doing things I want to do. I don’t have any want to hook up with other girls and I’m rather comfortable with what I have with her.

I'd like to point out that I make a very conscious effort to do things for her to make sure she knows that I value respect and love her, I look after my body in the gym and quite muscular which she prefers. And I like doing these things for her because it makes her happy.

We have a db situation which is confusing when she is so flirty and suggestive. I don't know what I am doing wrong. Other than letting slip my frustrations when I've been aroused too often with nothing to come from it. I know she has the right to turn down my advances but it's every time. Not once has intimacy been on my terms, I just get the same old ""oh what are you doing?"" (With batting me away and a laugh) or the standard ""I'm too tired"" which I would fully understand if it weren't for the fact that shortly after she's almost doing gymnastics prancing around and intentionally arousing me knowing that she can just turn me down again.

Is there something I can do or say to let her know I see what she is doing but tell g her gently because she shuts down when I bring my grievances to her attention.

1j4no1s,I (20F) am uncertain about his intentions (21M),"I (20F) have been dating (21M) for a month now. I really like him so far. He’s funny, creative and shares many of the same interests as me. We seem to share a mutual understanding with most things. But it’s a few things that are hard to look past. Now I want to mention he is on the Autism spectrum so it’s possible I could be misunderstanding him. Firstly his intentions, of course I’ve asked about them and we both agreed we are looking for long term. We have been on 5 dates in the past month, when I mentioned to him we are dating he replied with “what I wouldn’t say we are dating yet?”. He came to my house 2 weeks ago, he’s been 3 times now. The first time we began to cuddle. During this he was a pinkies width away from my face and staring into my eyes. I was obviously feeling a lot during this and blushing but then he said “what did you want to kiss? Oh my exs were like that, they wanted to kiss and I was like uh uh no” this left me feeling kinda embarrassed I replied to him saying “okay but I can see where they were coming from if you were doing the same thing to them?”. We talked about it deeper and he said that he’s not ready for kissing and sex until like a year into the relationship. This was a bit of a sting for me but I was understanding and supportive of it. However the second time meeting while watching a movie we were cuddling again. He confessed to me that he had a fetish, I won’t say what it is but it involves an attraction to an object. I was happy that he felt comfortable enough to tell me something so personal and I of course was supportive. He asked me later that night if I would like him to bring said object next time to show me and I was like, of course. So it’s the 3rd time he’s at mine, and he is very physically affectionate which I like. We ended up kissing because he told me he wanted to and ended up making out for a long time with him grinding on me. I was of course very aroused. He showed me the object he was attracted to and told me what he would like me to do with it. I did stuff with it that was lightly sexual. And I got excited that he was excited and he was touching himself a bit to. But after all the teasing he once again said he’s “not ready for anything else sexual for a very, very long time” I acted understanding and respected that. But now reflecting on this my mind is in shambles. I realise it’s no way I can continue to do anything sexual with him if it’s going to leave me disappointed and frustrated. What are your thoughts on this situation?.

1j4nifa,Me (M19) confused about how to handle recent conversations with my gf (F18),"For context my girlfriend and I have been together for a little over a year and all has been good. Then recently since we've been a bit apart because of school I've felt like things have changed. I've become a very busy person joining new things to keep myself busy and I am also a very social outgoing type. My girlfriend on the other hand is very okay with staying in all day and what not. All of this never seemed like a problem until recently
It started about a month ago when we were just hanging out doing coupley things. We were just being stupid poking at eachother when all of the sudden she yells out ""r*pe"". This completely caught me off guard and I sorta went still... and yes I get it people can make bad jokes and I think thats okay but then noticing that im uncomfortable says ""what you cant take a joke?"" Now I did call her out on that and she apologized and didnt mean it in any way. But still just from knowing so many people but also the fact that regardless of the joke I ""couldn't take it"" offended me honestly.
The next example was only recently. We got into a huge fued over text about her being home on a week I was super busy and how we weren't able to see eachother more than once. The one part that stuck with me was she was most upset that even thought she knew i was busy she wanted me to tell her I'm really upset. Now maybe its just me but I always try to be positive and think ""glass half full"" so thats how I said it to her. That argument was the worst and has kept my head in a spiral.
It has come up a couple times because we've been trying to resolve it but anytime I bring up these points because of how much they upset me she accuses me of bringing stuff up.
So im just wondering like whats up?

1j4nbd5,My (21F) jealousy over my best friend/partner (20F) is physically debilitating,"Let me preface this by saying I’m not a jealous person, when I feel it rise up in me it is so out of character and I really don’t know what to do when it becomes so debilitating to the point I throw up. 

So, I met my best friends three years ago and immediately we became inseparable - I am now extremely close with her immediate & some extended family. I spend 99% of my time with her, living with her, and the longest we have been apart since we met is about 7 days. 

Pretty soon after we met we confessed our love for each other - kissing when we were drunk but never talking about it when sober. We have been through a lot separately & together, more than people would believe for how young we are. 

About 9 months ago we decided to just be friends, but recently had a conversation about how the feelings never go away, but that we are young and should have fun. This is where the problem starts, I have no right to be jealous over her and I know this but I can’t help it when she tells me she’s going on a date or is seeing someone or is flirting on a night out. 

It gets to the point I throw up instantly when she tells me about anything at all. Even last night we went out and this guy was hitting on her, got her number and after she told me she didn’t have any intention of seeing him. Still I feel so sick about it and I have work in a few hours and I can tell myself all the logical things in the world but nothing makes me feel better. 

She is the love of my life, I’ve been engaged before and (thankfully) escaped that relationship but I’ve never been so sure about someone in my life before. How do I stop the jealousy from stopping me from enjoying life, and before it poisons our friendship. 

TL;DR I am genuinely in love with my best friend of three years (not unrequited) and despite the communications we have had about our feelings, the jealousy I feel about other people interfering is enough to make me so unwell I physically throw up, can’t eat or sleep.

1j4n6yz,I (23M) am apprehensive about resuming normal dating after a fight with my girlfriend (21F) How do I proceed forward?,"Hi all,

I (23M) am in a 1.5 year relationship with my girlfriend (21F) that recently encountered. Without being too detailed, we started in a long distance relationship when I went to study abroad after our summer job together ended. From there we continued long distance until we both graduated college and moved back home. However, most of the conflict started when I got my job to work. Because it is very specific, I will not say it exactly, but it required training out of state and would lead to a job where I am put in a different city,

From there, I noticed some things that began to concern me and things that began to annoy me. I will concede that I did not do my best in expressing my feelings as they came. While in the different state, I began training for the job that required longer hours and time dedicated outside of schooling to master the subject. She, on the other hand, tried to look for a job but did not want to apply or take certain jobs because of having a college degree. While we were not financially needy at the time, the effect caused her to stay home and boil over her emotions all day, which I had to come back and deal with. The apartment was furnished by the company and I was given a stipend for food that fed both of us. Additionally, she would not want to go out and do any activities by herself because of the perceived danger or aspect of being alone. More importantly, she encountered some issues that made it very hard for me to feel comfortable in the apartment we shared. I understand that there are common boundaries to be agreed upon, but if I did not follow very set routines or behaviors, it would cause her to become very upset and I had to live with the condition while she came over it. It was the same as walking over eggshells. Other behaviors that concerned me were instances of calling me ""cheap"" for not wanting to do certain activities or not running my car in idle while we looked for activities to do, while I carried most of the financial burden so she could work down her college debt (which she did not). On multiple occasions, she said it was not fair that I got my job while she did not have one. She believed that since she had a college degree that she should have a job waiting for her. While I sympathize with that sentiment, that is not how the world works. Furthermore, it made my accomplishments and hard work feel reduced because of her. I am proud of where I am and the work I have done, but she did hurt my feelings.

As a result of these issues, plus a few little ones, I had a conversation with her about finding some space to work on things. She would be able to stay at her home with her parents, work on the issues affecting her mental health and save up money, while I would be able to focus on the next step of training. This conversation came at great anguish to me because I am a very non-confrontational person when it comes to personal disagreements, especially to people who cry.

It has been about three weeks since that conversation where I have just started training and according to her has started therapy for her issues. The worry I have now is that similar issues are going to arise. She is scheduled to come visit where I live within the next few days, so I will see how my reaction is to that. But between those three weeks, I have noticed that I am less worried and anxious. But now with this visit and discussions of closing long distance, I am becoming more concerned. I still worry about the mental health issues arising along with financial concerns. Additionally, I have my apartment that I am paying for decorated a certain way, which she has commented on mulitple occasions she wanted to change the overall look of the space. While that is a minor detail, a big part of her is that she has a vision of her life that she wants to follow and sometimes it does not seem there is room for me to live my life or pursue the goals that I have, while I am also expected to pay for more since I have a job that is very secure and pays decently while she pursues further schooling. I am still considering an international job, which is something that she has expressed great disgust with. Additionally, I feel relaxed at being an independent adult for the first time in my life and I worry that life I was very comfortable in may go away with all of these issues that I see. 

How can I become better at expressing my thoughts and are these issues to be concerned about?

TLDR: My girlfriend wants to close the long distance but I don't know if I am ready or that if it would be a good idea because of our relational differences.","How can I become better at expressing my thoughts, and should I be concerned about my relationship differences as my girlfriend wants to close the long distance?","The individual is a 23-year-old male who has been in a one-and-a-half-year relationship with a 21-year-old female girlfriend.

I am not even against him having other female friends. But there is a bigger issue with her. A few months ago, he told me he was talking to his friend on the phone and avoided pronouns until I asked if it was a woman and he said yes. Ok ? Weird. Then I asked if they ever had sex or dated and he said no. Ok, thats fine. I didn't think much of it after that.A few days later he confessed to me that he wouldn't hang out with her without me there which I thought was super weird. It made me feel super uncomfortable and I had a bad feeling and went through his phone while he was in the shower. He always told me I can go through his phone whenever I want because he had nothing to hide and he wants me to know that I can trust him. WELL. I looked in the ""trash"" section of his texts to find he deleted an entire conversation from that woman. He told her he lied to me about the fact that they were never romantically involved because he didn't want to ""freak me out"". She yapped about how much she misses hanging out with him and how much she appreciates their friendship. She also kind of ignored him every time he mentioned me (which was pretty often).

Obviously I was very upset with him about this. He lied to me. Lied about the nature of their past relationship. He told me that he thought he was doing the right thing because he had good intentions and wasn't going to cheat on me with her. He told me that he talked so much about me. It really really didn't sit right with me. I initially told him that I didn't want him to be friends with her anymore, but later he confessed he didn't want to do that and that they've been friends for a long time and they both respected each other's relationships when they got in one.  So I let him still be friends with her. I decided to try and let it all go. She lives a state away after all, and they would only meet up like once a year anyway.After that, he talked to her a lot less. But she would sent him a lot of memes like ones saying ""born to hang out every day but forced to see each other once a year"". That entire situation planted this seed of insecurity in me and every time he would mention her I would secretly get upset.

He told me the other day that they talked on the phone again. It upset me a lot but I didn't tell him that. I just asked how often they talk on the phone and he said that was the second time since we have been together. I just hate it. I hate all of it. I hate when he mentions her. I hate that their friendship makes me so paranoid and insecure. I hate that he lied to me. I'm scared he talks to her way more often than he says. I'm scared he deletes things from me. I'm scared he is going to secretly hang out with her and not tell me because he doesn't want to ""freak me out"". I am so tired of having conversations about her. This was the one thing in our otherwise healthy relationship that I can't just let go of. I hate it so much. How do I even move past this?

The dynamics of her relationship have contributed significantly to her feelings of insecurity and distress. She has expressed that she is not opposed to her boyfriend having female friends in general, but there is a specific concern regarding one female friend, who is 29 years old. 

There is a history of communication between her boyfriend and this female friend that has raised red flags for her. Initially, her boyfriend avoided revealing the friend's gender when discussing a phone call, which prompted her to question his honesty. After discovering that he had previously lied about the nature of his relationship with this friend, claiming they had never been romantically involved when they actually had a different history, her trust began to erode.

The individual also highlights that she had initially requested her boyfriend to cease his friendship with the woman, but he refused. He mentioned that they have been friends for a long time and that they both respect their respective relationships. Although she agreed to let him maintain this friendship, it has led to ongoing feelings of insecurity, paranoia, and discomfort in their relationship. 

This conflict appears to be the primary source of stress in her otherwise apparently healthy relationship, as she grapples with feelings of fear and distrust arising from her partner's interactions with this specific friend. The situation has left her feeling tired from continuously discussing these issues and seeking guidance on how to move past them.

About 4 months ago I(25F) started seeing a guy (27M). In the beginning, everything was great, he was attentive, we talked a lot, he was very curious about me and i was very excited to learn more about him as well. Our communication kind of went eh afyer a while, but I was never left ghosted for days at a time and ge always responded, even if those messages seemed quite dry at times. Eventually we started hanging out more, then that turned into me staying over at his place for days at one time. Meeting him irl is always fine, he's never too cold or uninterested.

We had many converstations about relationships and he mentioned having a ex, that broke up with him 9 monthts ago, after being in a relationship for 4 years. Obviously, I found that extrelemy alarming, I worried, that this means he would not be ready for a relationship. He reassured me that it's not the case and I tried to let that go. Unfortunately, as we were hanging out, I was using his computer since mine was out of order and I needed to finish some work urgently, I noticed a converstation between him and his friend about his ex. He shared some sad videos about missing a lost partner and freling absolutely crushed about it. My heart literally sank and despite me trying to keep it to myself, after a few days, I confessed to seeing those messages. He explained that these messages weren't serious and he doesn't actually feel as horrible as those videos might seem and that his friend is very aware of it. There's probably nothing that could convince me that it was in fact not serious, but he kept saying that he does like me and that he doesn't want to make me feel like he doesn't.

I caved, because I really do like this guy, despite the dry texting periods we have. (I also feel the need to point out, that whenever I stay over, I'm never pressured into anything, so I don't really feel like I am being used for something).

This is not leaving my mind. I did some ""investigating"" and found him liking some of her instagram pictures that were posted after the break up and close to the date that we met (they're not following each other anymore).

Im extremely confused if I look stupid trying to guve him the benefit of doubt. Maybe he does like me just has some left over nostalgia... I don't know, I might me trying to justify it because he is a guy that I truly did like and we bonded very well. Should I protect myself and back away?

1j4n345,"Rejection, feedback, and the struggle to find a genuine connection","
I (28F) have been on a rollercoaster of rejection lately, and I'm trying to make sense of it all. The first guy (27M) I dated told me we weren't a good fit, which was a pretty vague reason for rejection. After some back-and-forth in our last conversation, it was very clear that he was absolutely correct and I eventually agreed and blocked him. 

Then, I met someone (28m) who was really into me, but I rejected him. I didn't feel comfortable sharing that it was because of our vastly different political views. He was a lovely person, and I didn't want to hurt his feelings. Instead, I told him I was looking for something more serious, which is true. I knew he wasn't interested in a serious relationship anyway.

Now, I've been rejected again by someone (31m) who said our paths don't align. I'm starting to wonder if being myself is the problem. I'm a goofy, sarcastic person, and I've tried to tone it down because, in my experience, men don't seem to appreciate it when you're too nice or too quirky. But even when I try to find a balance, it doesn't seem to work.

On a separate note, I've been texting another guy (32m) who seems really into me over text. We have a lot in common and both are single parents. We haven't met in person yet as he just moved to the city I’m in recently but I'm not getting my hopes up. I know that texting can be misleading - you can't hear tone, feel body language, or truly connect with someone until you meet in person. He might change his mind too when or if we finally meet.

I'm not having any expectations this time around. I just want to take things slow, get to know him, and see if we genuinely connect.

It's hard not to take the rejections personally, especially when I have great friends who truly love and appreciate me for who I am. They think I'm hot, attractive, funny, charismatic, and smart - so why isn't that translating to my romantic relationships?

I've also been thinking about my upbringing and how it might be affecting my dating life. My relationship with my parents is rocky, and they've never really helped me develop a sense of self-esteem. I've had to learn to love and accept myself on my own, which has been a journey.

Sometimes I wonder if my parents' criticisms are valid - maybe I'm not as great as I think I am? Maybe that's why I'm not finding success in my romantic relationships? 

What are some possibilities? Maybe some red flags that I’m showing on dates?

Has anyone else out there struggled to find a connection with someone who appreciates them for who they are?

1j4mzpq,I (36f) walked in on conversation my partner (34m) of eleven years was having about a coworker being inappropriate and want opinions.,"The other day my partner (34m) was hanging out with some friends and did not hear when I (36f) arrived at home. They were being rather loud and I was in the other room getting my things off when I heard my partner talk about how a 18 year old at work had slapped his ass (sounded very proud about it honestly). I wasn't really trying to eavesdrop but he continued it with saying that she had also insinuated they should hook up in an empty room at work (he works in a retirement home so a room where a resident recently passed, moral yuck). He told his friends that he ""perked up at the idea but then his brain went no, not at work with an eighteen year old"".

I got livid and demanded an explanation about what the heck is happening at his job and he claimed it was a trainee that no longer worked there (they do have a huge turnover), that she slapped his ass and another co-workers at the same time and he wasn't sure why she felt ok to, claimed he told her not to. When I asked how it went from him randomly being slapped on the ass and claiming to shut her down to her propositioning him for sex at work he claimed he didn't know why she would do that and that he was not being inappropriate or flirting with her. I don't really believe any of that as I don't see a woman putting themselves out there like that at work and trying to sneak into a room with him if they were already turned down for slapping his ass. I feel he was clearly crossing boundaries at work, what would you all say? He is playing a victim and acting like I am being over the top.

1j4mt9r,BF's mom is trying to ransom gratitude?,"I want to preface this by saying that from the beginning of our relationship, everything I heard from my BF about his family gave me red flags for excessive drama and in-fighting. 

My BF (47m) and myself (39f) have been dating for 4 months. He wanted me to meet his family way earlier than I was comfortable (partly due to the dramatic stories he told me) but eventually I agreed a couple of months in. His mom took a quick liking to me and asked him for my phone number. She sends people in her family different gifs almost every day and wanted to add me to the list. I did not want to give her my number as that felt too close but the next time I saw her in person, she asked me outright so I was stuck giving it to her. She then began texting me gifs every day which made me feel pressure to reply. I would reply with a gif most days but she never really said much else. At Christmas, she had sent me a card but it took a long time to arrive and she asked about it. I did eventually receive it and I thanked her. A couple of weeks ago, I got a cold and my bf alerted me that she had put a ""get well"" card in the mail for me. I received it a while later and forgot to open it right away and forgot to say thank you. Well I noticed it's been about a week since she sent her usual daily texts (I was honestly a bit relieved for the break) so finally I asked my bf if he had talked to her. He was shocked that she had stopped texting and I said maybe it was because I didn't say ""thank you"" for the card. He said that was definitely it and that I should ""do it tomorrow.""

This whole thing is making me feel really gross, like I'm being forced to bow to her so that she will acknowledge me again. So i guess I'm just screaming into the void and wondering if anyone has advice or thinks I'm in the wrong for feeling this way. Thanks in advance.

The woman expresses discomfort with the rapid progression of the relationship as it relates to meeting his family, influenced by the dramatic stories her boyfriend shared about them.

She indicates that her boyfriend's mother took a quick liking to her and attempts to establish a connection through text messages and cards, which has created a sense of obligation for her to respond. The situation is compounded by her own illness, when the mother sent her a ""get well"" card, and her subsequent forgetting to thank her for it, which she believes might have led to the mother halting her communications.

1j4mt2l,"Why am I feeling jealous or sad with every other guy, except for him? 28 M 30 F","

Any advice on how to handle these feelings? I’ve suffered through trauma so I’d appreciate some grace. 

When I have found out that the guy I’m interested in is taken or not into me, I’ll feel a little pang of jealousy or sadness, and then get over it after awhile. I’ve never been a homewrecker, nor do I tell them, I’m sad or jealous. 

But I’ve recently come to find that there is one guy in particular, that I’ve liked, but the feelings of sadness or jealousy have never been there. His name is Zack. 

Zack is a great person, but he eventually wants to move further south-to a warmer state. Ever since I’ve met him, I’ve always found myself just naturally supportive of him and anything he wants to do. I like him, but I’ve never once been sad that he wants to move away. I’ve come to the realization that I’m living my dream right now, and he has to go live his. However that looks for him. 

I don’t want to go with Zack because I want to stay close to my family. 

I’ve never had that feeling with any guy but Zack. It’s like a switch was flipped with him. And I realized that tonight while I was rejected by a different guy. 

Any advice?

I have been dating my colleague (30y/F) for 5.5 years, also living together for the same time now and we were about to get married later this year. She is completing her medical training and I opted to go for entrepreneurship and have failed a couple of times now, I am on my third startup and this is about to take off with the help of an investor. Lately, she has been overburdened with work and she has started showing disinterest in a lot of activities, especially things which involve us both. There was a major fault on my part as well, as my mental space was preoccupied with the startups not doing well and I was trying everything on my part to make the startup work and that's when I couldn't pay much attention to her. First, the frequency of s\*x reduced, then eating out reduced, and then she started arguing with me about even small things while living under the same roof. We still sleep together, and go out together and stay at the same place. I have resigned and staying at the house full time to pay attention to her and to mend together my personal life. I am also taking examinations to complete my medical studies together. We broke up a while back and the reason that she gave was that she does not feel love for me anymore, I give an easy-going good boy vibe and she sees me as a best friend and roommate but not as a partner or boyfriend and the romance has faded away. We patched up after this incident as we weren't able to live away from each other and tried to mend things. It has been 2 weeks now, things were good initially but it has started going back to the same old in the past couple of days. I sneaked and looked through her messages with her girl best friend and she is planning to detach slowly and break things off after my exams. There is no one else in her life, she likes being flirted with and has tried doing that with a few other men on chat but things didn't go further as she blocked/ dropped out in between. She is taking therapy as well for her continuous low mood.

1j4m0jy,How do I overcome emotional disconnect?,"TLDR: Ever since my girlfriend moved away for school it feels like she's always too busy for me and it's making me feel resentful.

My girlfriend (24F) and I (24F) have been dating for a little over a year. She's currently about an hour away for her last semester of school while I'm working full-time.

I feel like ever since she moved back for school, I've been feeling emotionally disconnected from her. I'm not sure if it's because work has been really stressing me out lately and and leading me to think negatively in general. 

Usually when I'm stressed, I like being comforted, I like hearing that things will be okay. I usually don't get that from her, usually it's another comment about how I carry my stress and how it impacts me. She's not wrong, but I was hoping for something more in tune with my emotions. I think whenever I feel sad it's always a broken record from her about how I should take better care of myself, she isn't completely wrong but I'm aware of that and do what I can for myself already.

I've told her at the beginning of the semester that I understand she has a lot going on (she's very academically and extra-curricular driven) but I'd appreciate consistent communication from her.  She's been good at it for the most part, she asks me how my day goes, she'll text first, she'll text me at least once a day (she's very off her phone so she's used to not texting back instantly). In a cruel way I feel like I try not to be so enthusiastic in my texting style to her as I just don't see my energy being matched on a casual level when I know she's trying her best. I wish my partner was more of a casual texter and I think that's where a part of my disconnect comes from. She does call me when she has time (around once every 2-3 days) but it usually feels like I'm in between things - for example I was in the middle of telling her about a bad day today and she cut me off as she was on the way to pick up something from her friend and they ended up conversing so we ended the call. 

When we hang out, I do make the effort to go see her but I feel like our hang outs always have to be fitted around her. I make the hour drive to see her, I'm scheduled in between things she has to do, when I do see her she asks for us to hang in the evening when I have a busy work day the next day or have to drive back home - it just doesn't feel time efficient on my end. However, she always has plans with her friends lined up and it makes me wonder how she has time to plan things out with them meanwhile I'm here fighting for time. I'm afraid that if I ask her for more time she'll tell me that's all she has and that we could just go longer without seeing each other so that we have a day where she's actually attentive, I think I'd have a hard time going longer without seeing her. I just wish my partner had time for me where it felt like she was present. The last time we hung out, I came over in the evening despite her being home all day and there was a certain point where she got caught up in texting her extra-curricular group about some upcoming event they had to plan. She was apologetic but it made me sad and she knew that.

I'm not sure if I'm painting a good enough picture of emotional disconnect, but overall I just feel tossed aside even though I know she tries. I wish I had a partner that was more intertwined with me. I think there's some resentment on my end and I'm not sure if this situation is truly temporary (she's moving back in less than 2 months) and how I should communicate that I know she tries but I wish she considered me more in her life. 
",How can I communicate my feelings of emotional disconnect to my girlfriend without pushing her away?,"The individual is 24 years old and has been dating their girlfriend, also 24, for a little over a year. They currently work full-time while the girlfriend is in her last semester of school, located about an hour away. The individual has been feeling emotionally disconnected from their girlfriend since she moved back for school, which coincided with increased work stress. 

The individual expresses a preference for emotional support and comfort during stressful times but feels that their girlfriend often focuses on how they handle stress rather than providing the comfort they seek. They emphasize that they appreciate their girlfriend's attempts at communication, which include texting consistently and calling every few days, but feel that these interactions don’t fulfill their emotional needs.

Additionally, the individual makes the effort to visit their girlfriend, but the scheduling of these visits often feels one-sided, as they tend to revolve around the girlfriend's schedule.

1j4lphp,Girlfriend doesn’t seem interested anymore,"Here we go. Might be a doozy due to the combination of Reddit posts and alcohol but here it is all the same. Me (23m) and my girlfriend(22f) have been dating for 4 years ish. Technically it was a two years then a year break and then a year together again but I don’t have the balls to push the issue. We started out as close friends who couldn’t find the right time to get together. She’d get in a relationship and I would be single. Then I would get into a relationship and she would be single. We’d get flirty for a while then only talk sparingly every month or so. Finally whenever she was about to graduate high school the stars aligned and we started dating. Well “started dating” means we were both single and hung out and ended up sleeping together. We didn’t make anything official until about a month later which in that month she was openly flirting with other dudes. The relationship was fine for about a year then she started questioning whether she “loved me as a brother or a boyfriend”. Still don’t know why I stuck around. At two years I moved 18 hours away for an internship and she took the next three months to get comfy with another dude who she inevitably needed up leaving because she “still loved me and wanted to end up with me”. I did my share of browsing while we were apart and found some really amazing girls who I’ve kept in touch with purely in a platonic sense. After the three months it was in and off fighting about her contacting the guy she was with and me not liking it. Finally about a year after we broke up she said she “wanted to put a label on it”. I took that as a good sign and got back together with her. Ever since then the only real, good thing she does is talk about how amazing of a person I am. She’ll go on and on to her friends and family about how I’m sweet and kind and treat her so good. However, when we’re together she does nothing but bust my balls and argue with me. I am by no means a perfect person but I try to keep things light and a little bit of sarcasm plays a big role in my conversations. I know my limits with 99% of people and keep it tasteful. She hated every aspect of my sense of humor though. I’ve seen her force a laugh 1000 times but she always finds a way to make me feel like an idiot whenever words come out of my mouth. She’s rude 24/7 to me but can be nice to every other person in her life. It’s like she has no respect for me as a person. So my question is…why does she stick around? I hold my boundaries pretty strongly and stand up for myself. I’m not a push over so I can’t seem to figure out what the dynamic is here. I’m obviously the chaser in the relationship due to the fact that I am the more emotional caring one and she tends to hate intimacy unless it’s alcohol induced. Also, I know the question of sex life will be asked…don’t ask. I am a high libido person who is dating theee most sexually confused human ever.

Meanwhile, I’m also the youngest out of three sisters, but I was raised to be more independent and responsible, which makes our differences stand out even more.

I think what makes it harder is that I can’t have deeper conversations with him either. I love learning and discussing different perspectives on things, but he lacks that same curiosity. Even when he tries, it feels like he’s forcing himself to engage in topics just for my sake, and it quickly fizzles out. I think the reason he struggles to form his own opinions or even remember simple things, like locking my apartment door at night (though, to be fair, he’s been getting better about that lately) was because of how his parents used to treat him.

We’ve talked about this issue multiple times, and he genuinely tries to improve. I can see that he’s putting in effort, but it often feels forced, like he’s doing it just to keep me happy rather than because he truly wants to grow. I’ve started to doubt his ability to change for real, and honestly, it’s wearing me out. He’s not a bad person at all—he’s genuinely kind-hearted and would never intentionally hurt me. I appreciate his efforts, but it’s hard to keep hoping for something that seems less and less likely to happen.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Is it a sign that we’re just not compatible, or am I expecting too much too soon?

TL;DR: I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a year but often feel more like his mom than his partner. He struggles with basic responsibilities and deeper conversations, likely due to being spoiled as the youngest. He tries to improve, but it feels forced. I’m starting to doubt our compatibility.
","Is it a sign that we’re just not compatible, or am I expecting too much too soon?","The individual in the Reddit post has been dating their boyfriend for about a year and describes feeling as though they take on a parental role in the relationship. They highlight significant differences in their upbringing: the boyfriend is the youngest of three brothers, with a large age gap between him and his siblings (around 15 to 20 years) and was spoiled by his parents, who often made decisions for him. In contrast, the poster is the youngest of three sisters and was raised to be more independent and responsible, which accentuates the differences between them.

The poster expresses a desire for deeper conversations and learning, but feels that their boyfriend lacks curiosity and often engages in discussions only out of obligation. They acknowledge that their boyfriend has been working to improve, recognizing his efforts, but feel that these efforts seem forced and may not be driven by genuine desire for personal growth. Thus, the dynamics of their family backgrounds and how those shaped their respective personalities may contribute to their current relational challenges.","The person is feeling exhausted and is questioning their relationship because they feel more like a mother than a partner to their boyfriend, who struggles with basic responsibilities and deeper conversations.",30,female,dating,not specified,middle class,The person is exhausted.,"The person likely has a higher education level, potentially college-educated, as they express a love for learning and discussing different perspectives.",exhausted,no,exhausted,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j4lbu5/im_19f_feeling_more_like_his_20m_mom_than_his/,relationships
1j4kxem,"My (27F) boyfriend (28M) is emotionally distant, and I feel more like a roommate than a partner. Am I asking for too much?","
My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, and I’ve been struggling with feeling unappreciated in our relationship. He’s not affectionate which is fine to an extent. He never says “I love you” (or only mumbles it when I bring it up), doesn’t kiss me, and rarely initiates physical contact beyond holding hands or occasional cuddling. When I asked him about it, he said he just isn’t that type of person. Which I came to accept it until it comes to arguments where he shuts down and gets cold with me.

He also doesn’t communicate well. When he’s mad, he shuts down, acts cold, and ignores me until he “gets over it,” but the issue never actually gets addressed. I’ve asked him to at least let me know when he needs space and that we’ll talk later, so I’m not left anxious and guessing, but he won’t do that either. Meanwhile, I need to talk things through to feel okay, and the way he handles conflict leaves me feeling completely disconnected. 

Another thing that confuses me is that whenever I ask if he’s okay, he always just says “I’m fine.” But he says that both when he actually is fine and when he’s mad, so I never know what’s actually going on. I told him that if he really is fine, it would help me a lot if he gave me some kind of small physical reassurance. Like a hand squeeze, a quick hug, or rubbing my back so I don’t spiral into overthinking. But he hasn’t made any effort to do that either (and he literally just states at me whenever I bring it up and goes back to his phone or doesn't acknowledge it)

A recent example: I told him I’m scared we’re becoming more like roommates than partners. I don’t need constant attention, but I’d love small things like a quick hug or greeting when he (or me) get home instead of him just disappearing into another room. To his credit, he has improved in that area. He now makes an effort to greet me instead of isolating himself.

To be fair, he’s very helpful around the house, takes care of my pets, cooks, and insists on paying for things (even big expenses like vet bills). So I know he cares, but it feels more like he wants a girlfriend for the sake of having one rather than actually loving me. The lack of emotional and physical connection makes me feel unappreciated and unloved, and when I tried to express that, he was shocked that I was this upset “over something so small.”

Is this just who he is, and I need to accept it, or am I asking for too much? If he does acts of service, but I don’t feel loved, is that a sign we’re just not compatible? Would love to hear from others who’ve been in a similar situation.

It’s making me wonder if he even sees me as his girlfriend or truly loves me, or if I’m just overreacting.


TL;DR: My (27F) boyfriend (28M) is emotionally distant. He never says “I love you,” doesn’t kiss me, and shuts down when he’s mad instead of communicating. I’ve told him I need small gestures (like a hug or greeting when we get home) to feel appreciated, and while he’s improved slightly, I still feel more like a roommate than a partner. He’s great at acts of service (cooking, helping around the house, paying for things), but I don’t feel loved. It’s making me wonder if he actually sees me as his girlfriend or loves me at all, or if I’m just overreacting.","Is this just who he is, and I need to accept it, or am I asking for too much?

1j4itl9,"I (25M) am starting to resent my girlfriend (24F), but I’m too afraid to leave","I’ve been with my girlfriend for over a year and a half now, and I honestly regret ever getting into this relationship. I feel completely stuck. When we’re close to breaking up, I suddenly feel guilty and act sweet to keep things going. But when things are ""fine,"" I remember how deeply unsatisfied I am with her—physically, mentally, financially, and emotionally.

We are just NOT AT ALL compatible, and I’ve known this for a long time. I have to hide so much of who I really am just to avoid arguments or upsetting her. Here’s the breakdown:

Politics: I’m a Republican, and she’s an extreme liberal. I literally had to pretend to be furious after Trump won just to keep the peace. Every political discussion is exhausting because I either have to stay silent or fake agreement.
Finances: I’m getting my PhD at Harvard and have a solid future ahead of me. Meanwhile, she’s barely scraping by but expects me to act like I’m already rich. She wants extravagant gifts, yet she struggles with basic groceries. The entitlement just baffles me.
Physical Attraction: She’s honestly not my type, and I hate that I feel this way, but it’s the truth. I look at other women and think, I could do better, and that makes me feel even worse about this whole situation.
Sex Life: Almost nonexistent. She has no clue what she’s doing, asks a million questions, and it just kills the mood every time.
Family & Expectations: My family already dislikes this relationship because they see how much stress it causes me and expect me to find someone at my current university. Meanwhile, her family adores me and sees this leading to marriage, which makes things even worse. In her culture, meeting the family means we’re headed toward something serious, and I feel like I’ve accidentally let this go way too far. It also seems as if they view me as the ideal candidate for her, and I'm simultaneously worried they just want someone to take responsibility for their daughter.
At this point, I feel like I’m just keeping her around because it’s easier than starting over. Dating would be exhausting with how busy I am, and part of me thinks, what if I don’t find anyone else? But at the same time, I know she isn’t what I want, and staying just makes me resent her more.

I don’t even know how to approach ending this. She’s so in love with me, and I just feel... nothing. I care about her as a person, but I don’t see a future here, and I don’t even want to.

The worst part is, I recently went on a secret date with another woman—someone who was actually into me, who laughed at my jokes, and who was everything my girlfriend isn’t. And yet, I still felt nothing. I was completely uninterested, which makes me think maybe I’m just incapable of feeling anything for anyone right now. At the same time, I can’t help but be glued to my phone waiting for my girlfriend’s texts. But when I get them, I just feel drained. Then, after I send one, I find myself waiting for her reply again. It’s like I don’t even want this relationship, but I’m trapped in some kind of cycle. At a recent meeting with my doctoral advisor, I even showed up 5 minutes late due to having to see my girlfriend since she wouldn't stop asking to see me.

Ugh, I feel like I'm trapped and halfway between a successful future and bombing it all.
Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do I get the courage to leave when I feel like I’ve let this go on for too long?

TL;DR: I’m in a relationship with a girl who is completely wrong for me—politically, financially, physically, and emotionally—but I’m too scared to leave and start over.

They are currently in a relationship that has lasted over a year and a half, during which they have experienced significant dissatisfaction across various aspects, including emotional, financial, and physical compatibility. 

Family expectations play a role in their situation, as the person's family has expressed disapproval of the relationship due to the stress it causes, while the girlfriend's family holds a more favorable view and sees the individual as a potential marriage candidate for their daughter. This cultural aspect adds complexity to their feelings of obligation and entrapment.

Additionally, there is a financial disparity between the two, with the individual in a stable position pursuing their advanced education, while the girlfriend struggles financially. This gap has created tension regarding expectations in the relationship.

1j4ikb4,When should I(F20) leave my boyfriend(M26),"Maybe this should be posted to [r/AskReddit](/r/AskReddit/), but that sub I wouldn't let me type, so here we are. For context, I met my boyfriend right when I turned 18 and was still in high school, and he was 24. We've been together a cumulative 2 years, but broke up for 6 months last March and got back together in October. Neither of us really wanted to break up, and it was incredibly hard for me, about a week after our official break up, we slept together. About a month later, I got an anonymous text syaing a partner I had tested posotive for chlamidiya, I wrote it off as him being a jerk because he was the only person I had slept with. Two weeks after we break up, I start dating a new guy, a month after we started dating(around the same time I got the text), we have sex, and he complains of burning when peeing, gets checked out, and has chlamydia. I immediately get tested and I have it, I whole heartedly believe he did not cheat or sleep with someone who would have it, my e on the other hand my boyfriend is kind of a lose man and I belive he absolutely would. I know in my heart and all evidence leads to him being the one who gave it to me. It's been months and I just can't let it go, sometimes when I dwell on it I get the overhelming urge to slap him, call him a awful and leave, but i haven't, at least not yet. As bad as it sounds, this has made me only able to look at him as disgusting, our sex life used to be frequent and amazing, now he's lucky if I let him hit twice a month, if even. He's a sweet guy for the most part, or I've just house broken him, but I can't help but see him as someone who used me and then dumped me when he didn't want to make things work. He used to be my world two years ago, I loved him like he hung the moon aand stars, but at times I feel as though all he did was ruin my life. My rebound, who I dated for those 5- 6 months, was an amazing guy, he always knew what I wanted before I did, was helpful, never complained, made me feel beautiful and was incredibly intelligent, but he wasn't conventionally attractive like my ex, now current boyfriend, or as stereotypically cool. I left a good man to take back my ex that left me and I feel like an idiot, I know this makes me an awful person, but should I end things now or should I stay put, a small part of me knows I'm a bad person for leaving my ex(rebound) and that this is what I deserve.

TL:DR- My current bf probably gave me chlamidiya six months ago and I'm still not over it

Side note, my rebound and I were already dating when I got the text, I told him about it right away and asked if he thought it was real, we both agreed it was just a childish way to dig at me(very on brand for my now boyfriend at the time ex).","Should I end my relationship with my boyfriend, who I believe gave me chlamydia, or should I stay in it?","The individual is a young person who met their boyfriend at the age of 18 while still in high school.

1j4ij9t,I’m (27f) in a cycle of overreacting and being cruel to my partner (30m) and then hating myself for it. How do I stop?,"We’ve been together for about a year. This is how the cycle starts. First, either he does something innocuous that I misinterpret or he fails to respond to me in a time frame that my mind seems ‘suitable’. I don’t know what that suitable time frame is supposed to be. I’m convinced there isn’t one. Regardless, it doesn’t really matter what happens, things go the same way every time no matter what the problem is. I know every time that it’s an irrational reaction. Knowing that does not help.

When I feel ‘slighted’ by him, I’ll reach out in an attempt for comfort. But I’ll do it in a very self-pitying, pathetic, manipulative way. For example, if I feel he’s been ‘ignoring’ me, I’ll ask him why he hates talking to me so much. If he doesn’t reply right away, it escalates to paranoid ranting typically. It’s a full on toddler-esque tantrum. I don’t scream at him, but I want to. I don’t call him repeatedly, but I want to. I’m terrified I will, eventually. 

Inevitably, a couple hours later, the big, bad emotions will fade and all I feel is deep shame and self hatred. I don’t like myself for the way that I am, and I want to stop, but when I’m in that state of mind, it’s incredibly difficult to even think like I usually do, let alone control myself. In these moments, I’ll usually insist to him that we need to break up so I stop treating him like that. We both want to be with one another, but I’m fucking sick of being that person, and it’s not his fault I become that person, but it’s my fault I think of him so possessively that it makes me a very cruel, hateful, vindictive person.

I don’t know what else to do. If I stay with him, it will start again. Sometimes we’ll have calm periods where it doesn’t happen for a little while but sometimes it will happen every other fucking day. How is it not fucking annoying as shit, if not flat out abusive? He still wants to be with me, he says he it’s not as big of a deal as I’m making it, but how could it not be? I don’t know how to be better for him. Any advice? Please.

So we’ve been together just under 7 months but we’ve known each other a lot longer, I really love him and he loves me and none of us want to do this 

But he says there is literally no other option, I’ve been kicked out of my family home and don’t have anywhere to go, so I was staying at my bfs place for a little bit but he’s saying he wants his peaceful life back that he had before me, and he just wants to keep his parents happy, his parents don’t know anything and it’s making it harder on him, his dad confronted me before and said I just stand blankly and don’t do anything when all the pressure is on my bf he also said I don’t know how to cook or look after anyone else or myself which is wrong and all I’ve done for 18 years is look after myself and my siblings and my bf but hey ho, so then my bf spoke to his dad and came upstairs and said “I don’t think he wants us to be together” and then made the decision on breaking up with my to keep his parents happy, and I understand it’s hard but I just don’t want to lose him

He’s all I’ve got left after everything, he’s still treating me like I’m his girlfriend and saying he loves me and he won’t speak to other girls, but what if he does what if he finds someone else whilst we are on this break, but then he’s saying it’s just space, then a break, then we’ve broken up so I just don’t know what to think

1j4hkou,my boyfriend of (almost) one year finally admitted to me he doesn’t see himself getting married… but i dream to be a wife and mother eventually..,"so my boyfriend (29m) and i (22f) have recently been talking about our future and what it holds, what we’re doing in this relationship together. we’ve been together almost a year and we haven’t really made any progress towards a future together, ie; i’m constantly spending days or sometimes even full weeks at his place and yet he hasn’t given me a key or asked me to move in, he’s yet to say the words “i love you”, i haven’t met his family (granted they live 3 hours away, but still do able). so it prompted the question, what ARE we doing?? 

i love him. he’s my first relationship, and he’s a great boyfriend. he’s just scared of commitment maybe? i’ve stated plenty of times in the relationship that eventually i want to get married and be a wife and mom one day. i’m in no rush of course, but i know for a fact that is what i want for my future. at first he agreed, which gave me the idea that he DID want marriage eventually as well and kids. it wasn’t until recently that i pressured him a little more as to why we aren’t moving in any direction anymore, that i feel like nothing is happening. he finally broke down and told me that he is “unsure of marriage” if it’s something he wants. we got into a big long talk and it basically ended with me telling him that i dream of marriage, and if he isn’t open to that idea eventually in his life then we need to discuss our relationship and what we’re doing seriously. i would give him the time to think on it, and we would continue being happy and having fun, but i would want an answer soon. 

finally, about 2 weeks (maybe 3) after the conversation he admitted that he doesn’t want marriage. i asked him why would he do this, why would he keep me along knowing that i wanted that in my life. he said he thought it would change. it obviously didn’t, maybe i’m just not the one for him. he says he likes being alone, and when i ask him why he’s out dating girls for 1/2/3+ years if he “likes” being alone, he has no answer. i’m not sure if he truly enjoy being alone or if he just hasn’t found his wife yet. he claims he doesn’t believe in that either, that one day he’ll meet someone and that’ll be it, he’ll just change and know he wants to get married. so now we’re at this cross roads.

i know he won’t provide me the future i dream of, and he knows i’m not going to be content just being a girlfriend for the rest of my life. but i don’t know what to do. i love him, more than i’ve ever loved anyone, he’s my first big love. i don’t want to just walk away, i’m still hoping he will change his mind in the future. but i don’t know how into the future i’m willing to hope and wait for. what do we do?? what do i do?? i love him, and enjoy him i don’t want to just walk away but now knowing we have no future i just feel stuck.. 

so should i just enjoy our time together until presented with an escape?? until someone else comes along that he meshes better with or that shows they’ll give me the future i want? things just feel weird, i know we won’t progress but i can’t just walk away (even though it might be the only option i have). some serious knowledgeable advice is welcome! 


**— TL/DR —**
do i continue in progress less relationship after my boyfriend admitted to not wanting marriage, when i know all i want is to be a wife one day? we enjoy all our time together, i love him but i know he doesn’t want to get married and that’s all i want eventually. so what’s our next move? do i stick around in hopes that he could change his mind one day, i’m not ready to just give up and walk away but what are my options? and if it’s best to walk away… how do i do it? every fiber of my being loves and craves this man, walking away just feels impossible, not when there is always a chance he could just change one day and want the same.

1j4hes8,I (33M) Lied to My Fiancée (33F) About A Family Conflict and Then Gave A Weird Answer That Made Things Even Worse - What Can I Do?,"Hi all,

I’m a 33 year-old divorced man. After separating from my ex, I reconnected with an old friend who had been a “missed connection” from back when I was in law school. We had the most amazing romance that felt like something out of a movie. We’ve now been together for a year. I was - and am still - completely and utterly in love with her. Until a month ago, she adored me too.

But over the last few months, something has come between us. My sisters acted like complete assholes to my fiancée and I put off confronting them about it for months and then did it in a far too indirect way. My fiancée - but then pregnant - then confronted my sister directly, my sister threatened not to talk to me again, and in a panic I told my sister my fiancée had acted appallingly and said that my fiancée was depressed. While I later confronted my sister in a way that made clear I was going to stand up for my fiancée and thought my sister’s behavior and refusal to apologize were terrible (and got ostracized by my sisters for doing so), I did not tell my fiancée that I had panickingly thrown her under the bus. Rather, when she told me that telling different things to different people was lying, I lied and said I wasn’t doing that.

My fiancée eventually found out and it has unsurprisingly caused a bad rift between us, about a week after we lost the baby. She’s been understandably hurt and very angry and now feels like I’m not a safe person. As part of an attempt to restore trust, I promised to always be open and honest, even if I thought the truth might hurt beer, and came clean about every time I could remember lying or giving a deceptive half truth.

This brings us to the latest crisis: the day after I made this promise, my fiancée asked me if I found her more attractive aesthetically before her pregnancy. Idiot that I am, I thought this was a test of whether I would be open and give an answer and I tried to come up with an answer - ultimately saying that she was very beautiful but the target weight she’d shared with me was wow. That isn’t how I actually think of her - I’ve always thought she’s beautiful all the time - but I felt pressure to come up with an answer rather than refuse to distinguish. This answer obviously made her furious, I’ve tried to spend two weeks explaining that I didn’t mean it, and ultimately she asked me today if my answer was the truth or a lie and I said it wasn’t what I actually think so I guess it’s a lie.

So my questions are this:
- Was my attempt to come up with an answer lying?
- What can I do to stop this habit of giving people the answer I think they want to hear?
- Why does anxiety prompt me to not really analyze my own feelings and just focus on what I think the other person wants?
- What recommendations do you have to rebuild trust after having lied?

So TLDR - I lied to my fiancée about having given a weird appeasing answer to my sister, then gave an idiotic answer I don’t actually believe to a question about weight, all amid a pregnancy loss. Am I a liar? How can I stop behaving this way?","- Was my attempt to come up with an answer lying?

1j4f457,My GF is very need & requires constant reassurance,"My (22F) girlfriend and I (26M) have been seeing each other for about 3 months now. Sadly there has been a situation happened recently that has me feeling very mentally and emotionally drained. So let me explain. 

My gf is a chronic overthinker that needs reassurance on a consistent basis, and iI’m not one of those guys that thinks it’s cute. Even still ive done my best to provide her with reassurance at the times she expressed it. One day we’re discussing this and how I felt her trauma and past has led her to have this need to be constantly reassured. And recently pushed here to do some very toxic things. For she over exaggerated a situation and when I fell for it and took it seriously her response was “this just hypothetically haha, i just wanna what your response would be”

When this happened I got super pissed, this felt like the strangest manipulation I’d experienced in my life. So I call this out and she kind apologized for doing it but moved on from it kind quickly.  I proceeded to tell her I don’t mind giving her reassurance but the way she did it was unhealthy. I then highlighted how her trauma and past relationships are pushing her to feel the needy to do manipulative stuff in an attempt to fulfill some need for reassurance, and I told her how I want to help her heal from this. My message was this

 “I don’t mind helping you heal from it. I want you to heal so you can begin to love yourself and see yourself as you should.” Those exact words 

Her response? “Why didn’t you call me baby? 🥺”


she then proceeeds to send me 4 paragraphs on how I need to be “more affectionate” through text since our relationship is long distance how she needs more affection and it help distract her from what going on in her mind. Mind you she explains this in an excited tone as if she’s figured it all out. She also claimed I’m too logical and she needs to me be less logical? Like not providing logical solutions to the problem. That I need to be more affectionate so she dosnt have to ask for reassurance because she “hates asking people for things”

This was the most deflated feeling I’ve felt in a while. And has me wondering if anything I do will ever be enough. 


TL;DR: I've been dating my girlfriend for three months, and while I care about her, her constant need for reassurance is overwhelming. She recently tested me in a way that felt manipulative, and when I tried to address it, she shifted the focus to wanting more affection. It left me feeling drained and unsure if I can truly meet her needs.",How can I handle my girlfriend's constant need for reassurance without feeling overwhelmed and drained?,"The poster, a 22-year-old female (22F), is in a long-distance relationship with her boyfriend, who is 26 years old (26M).

1j4emti,I (19f) don't know what to do about my relationship.,"so, as per the title, I, 19f, have a girlfriend, 19f, and we've been together for about 1 year. we met through the internet and are currently in a long distance relationship, however, we do see each other quite often. 

our relationship seems ‘perfect’ for anyone that asks, but the truth is, i've been having a feeling that it's not. well, do keep in mind that i'm not a fluent english speaker, so it might get a bit confusing. also, LONG POST WARNING. also, i'm not sure if i should post this in the breakup subreddit, since I didn't break up with her. i just need help.

to the reason why i'm in doubt about our relationship:

she's anxious. and I KNOW it's sounds bad, but hear me out. we both struggle with mental health issues, whereas hers is more intense than mine. i'm a very practical person and i like to do things and deal with things in a more rational way. she's not. and that's okay! i didn't mind it and i don't blame her for that.
the thing is, she's also too conformed. to a point where it affects me and our relationship. i've grown resented of her. i feel resentment and i feel so bad about it. i'm not a good girlfriend even if i try to be.

i always listen to her rambles, ranting and whatever she might want to talk to me about. i try to be understanding and i KNOW that i am. but she doesn't change. she doesn't move forward. she's always complaining about something and it's annoying. i swallow down my feelings bc i care for her. she doesn't have friends and i fear that if i leave her, she'll be shattered and i will not be able to comfort her. i feel responsible.

i also feel responsible for her distancing from her friends even if i'm not the reason for her to do that! the only friend of hers that i've been against, was one that was an asshole to her and pretended as if nothing had happened. i've always encouraged her to meet with her friends and be out with them, bc i have my own friends and i go out with them. she feels the need for my approval, the need to know if im mad or angry at her, just because i didn't send her an emoji, for example.

she also struggles with body image and health. she complains about her therapist, about her mother, her sibling, her work, her classes, her friend, her life, everything! she's always angry or in a bad mood about anything and everything. i have to be very careful with my words or the way i act, because if I don't, she will get anxious and cry. i don't want to hurt her, so i omit things. specially how i'm feeling. she's doesn't take meds, she doesn't have a psychiatrist and i try to be understanding bc of our financial realities, but she spends her money with things that are not necessary instead of taking care of herself!

it's also worse when my mother absolutely LOVES her. my mom favors her over me. she's the daughter my mom wished to have. i think that's where the resentment started, unfortunately. my mom made my brother's life a living hell when he broke up with his partner, almost as if she was the one who had broken up. I don't go to my bsf for advice bc i know she will say to break up, that's just how she is, even if she hasn't heard the whole story.

there are things my gf does that annoys me, she's deeply insecure and sensitive. and i mean A LOT. she admitted to me that she hates the idea of me talking to other people that's not her. i'm not a jealous person, so i can't really relate. she got sad over me not being jealous with her.

there's another thing, bc of the antidepressants i take, my libido has went down. i've never been someone with high sex drive, or libido, i've always thought of me as someone in the ace spectrum. i don't see bodies as pornography, it's just nudity for me. a body, that's that. maybe because since i was a kid, i've seen my parents naked (mainly mom) and older women (mom's friends) naked sometimes, so i've never saw malice in it. for me, a body is art, if u get what i mean. i'm sort of an artist.

i came out to her as asexual and she got sad. and i understand why she got sad, i really do. i, in her head, just told her i had no sexual desire for her anymore. and it's not exactly true. i see her body for what it is, a body. i don't feel that urge to touch, to have sex. i know she does. she said that sex is important to her, i told her that me being ace doesn't mean I won't have the sexual desire with her. i thought she would be more comprehensive with me, because well, she herself told me months before that she was asexual too. apparently, it changed when she got in a relationship with me. (her words, not mine). 

i just feel so... stuck and overwhelmed. i love her, but it's not the same. seeing her “flaws” has made me lose attraction. i'm starting to omit, to cut away parts of my personality to please her, to avoid conflict, to be better for her because I can't stand being bad. my parents both tell me that “she's the one” and I can't go against that. i can't disappoint them, I can't disappoint her. I don't see myself in a happy relationship with her in the future, the thought of marrying and having children sounds terrifying now. but I also do see myself with her if she stops with the conformism, you know? i just.. don't know what to do to help her. i'm not a therapist. i'm her friend, but before that, i'm her girlfriend. my feelings matter too, don't they?
 
i know i'm a bad person and a bad girlfriend. that i'm depressive and apathetic at times, i know. i'm in therapy, i'm on antidepressants and adhd meds. i try so fucking hard to be better, to feel something, and it appears i'm just incapable of it. i'm looking forward to college, to run from all of this. she's coming to see me in april and my family is delighted, i, in the other hand, am not. I don't think i will feel anything when i see her again.

i'm also hyper independent, practical and individualist as a person, and those are flaws and i realize that. i'm working to be better. but it's just so hard to deal with everyone summing myself up with her. i almost cry and feel a surge of rage every fucking time my mother says that i'm doing things i did before because of her. that I'm changed because of her. that i'm a better daughter now. when it's not! i've been more active, more social ever since i started therapy, it's not because of my girlfriend and i know that! I HATE when EVERYONE just assumes that EVERYTHING i do is for her when i'm doing it for me! 

i'm sorry for all of that. oh gods. i needed to get it out of my chest before i exploded (i don't have therapy rn, only in a couple of weeks). i need advice. this is not our relationship summed up, by the way. these are my feelings about all of that. we laugh together, i like her, we have fun. it's just so hard to ignore those things. they keep piling up and filling the plate. i feel as if my walking on shells around her. that i need to be perfect. as always. i feel like a narcissistic idiot.

TL;DR: my girlfriend is extremely anxious, sensitive and conformed. she spends her money with not necessary things and does not seek help. i try to be understanding and kind, to be a better girlfriend for her, however, i have feelings too. she complains about everything and doesn't do anything to change her situation. she got sad when i came out as asexual. i'm a practical person, i solve things, she's too anxious to deal with things. she doesn't have friends even if i encourage her to make new ones or to hang out with the old ones, bc she needs it. a future with her sounds a bit terrifying if things like this keeps happening. i don't want to hurt her and idk what to do. everyone sums me up by comparing me with her. or everything that i do is about her. i'm sad and can't ask for help. i love her, i truly do. just don't feel that attraction anymore.

",What should I do if I feel overwhelmed in my relationship and I'm starting to lose attraction to my girlfriend due to her anxiety and lack of motivation to change?,"The individual is a 19-year-old female who has been in a long-distance relationship with her girlfriend, also 19, for about a year.

1j4e8gp,Is my friend toxic after getting a bf? Should I end the friendship?,"
Hi!!

I (F: 21) really need advice and I’m feeling very torn and crazy tbh. So my friend (F:22) that also lives in my apartment met this guy (M:23) online 3 months ago and they have been officially together for three weeks. I was really excited that she finally met someone when they first started talking but everything changed when I met him for the first time. We invited him over for dinner at the apartment so that we can get to know each other since we are going on a trip this summer. 

When he first came in he didn’t even say hi or introduce himself, I cooked dinner and didn’t get a thank you or the food was nice and he barely talked all evening even when we tried to include him and ask questions. At first we thought he was shy but it’s been like two months since then and we have been around him quite a lot he sleeps over quite often and he has made no effort to get to know me or my bf and he still does not even greet us. My friends birthday was a couple weeks ago and she didn’t want to celebrate with us and she tried to kick me out of my apartment. Her boyfriend said that it’s “best” that we’re not home when they’re here (even tho he has his own apartment). 

My friend is usually very social and open and we were very close but since she met him she’s also been ignoring me and is quite rude when they eat in the living room they don’t even acknowledge that we’re sitting there. I told her that he made a bad impression and that right now I don’t really like him and explained why and she got really mad. I said that I want to like him and tried to come up with activities that we can do together but she’s more like yea I don’t know we’ll see. I feel like I’ve been chasing after her with options and activities but I feel like since she’s my friend and his gf shouldn’t she be more invested and try to help us get along. She recently told me that she’s moving out and that he played a big factor in that decision I feel a bit betrayed since it feels like she’s giving up a friendship of 5 years for a guy she’s known for three months. 

Our other friend also thought he was really rude and it feels wrong to say this but weird. The reason they got together in the first place was because I talked to him I told him that she likes him and if he feels the same he should go for it since my friend felt like he didn’t like her so she asked me to do it so I feel like I’ve been supportive. I really don’t know what to do she makes me feel bad for not liking him but makes no effort to improve the situation. Should I end the friendship when she moves out or am I overreacting? (Sorry for the long text I just have a lot on my chest haha)

1j4e6a9,(40m) considering divorce from (45f). Would you do it?,"I married a single mom with kids. So far, our relationship has lasted 12 years, and we have a child together. She is a good person, we get along well. And I have adopted the kids. I'm their dad 100%.

Our budget is a fucking disaster, and any attempt to remedy it and steer the ship right fails spectacularly. I'm not a spender myself, I spend very little, but no matter how much I save there seems to be a wormhole in my bank account draining it.

I love the woman, I love the kids, but I'm so exhausted with working so much and getting poorer for it. I have no 401k, no savings, just debt. I have begged her to get a job, and she did a couple times, short term things, but there's always a reason to quit. I know she's comfortable in her life.

I'm 40, I need to think about retirement, in fact I'm late to start thinking about it. I have nothing bad to say about her but the debt she's got me in.

We have had too many conversations about this, and nothing changes. Should I just leave and take care of myself or not? I don't want to work into my 70s. Or am I just a sad sack of shit and should stick with it for the kids?

We started dating a month before he graduated college and he wants to go to grad school coming up very soon. He is not from this area so he doesn’t have family here and I agreed that when we started dating that it would take me time to consider if I ever want to move away. He wants to be far away from here and his family. But all my family is here and I don’t really want to move so far away. He won’t even start grad school until probably 2026, but at this point I feel like I’m leading him on. I love him so much but I really don’t want to move away with him. But even if he does it won’t be for more than a year. I don’t want to lead him on though because at this point that feels like what I’m doing. I feel I need to add that my family that has met him does not like him all that much. He tends to tease me a lot and has trouble with when I tell him to stop. It annoys me sometimes so I don’t know what to do about that. I overall just feel bad because I genuinely don’t know what to do. He is my first boyfriend after leaving a long 6 year relationship with my high school sweetheart. I need advice from someone who isn’t my mom or my best friend. I love them very much but I really think I need outside perspective. So how do I approach this situation with him? I want to talk with him but I just don’t know how because I’ve never broken up with someone before because I’ve only ever been in one other relationship and it was more of a mutual ending. I know I need to tell him how I feel but I’m just having trouble approaching that. I need a list of things or points to bring up because I get so flustered and end up crying in situations like that. And I don’t know if I should break up with him or if I should hold on a little longer because he will be moving away in the near future. My family says I deserve better and I know that I do. I just don’t know what to do. They are all rooting for me to leave him but that’s so hard. This is my first ever post on here so thank you for any advice you can give me.

I tried to tell him that it was affecting me and i wished he didn't take hours to respond especially since I can clearly see that he's online but I think he took it the wrong way and proposed to share his localisation to ease my worry saying that he's too busy to be cheating but it wasn't what I asked for and he also keep ignoring my text so I got tired and asked him to tell me  if he's loosing interest in us so that I know where I stand, it's been three days now and he left me on read. 


TL;DR :should I  reach out once again or just move on ?

",Should I reach out once again or just move on?,"The individual in the post is a 23-year-old female who has been seeing a 29-year-old male for two months. She mentions trying to support him through a work-related issue that has caused him to feel depressed. The relationship dynamics have shifted, with her feeling that she’s doing too much to cheer him up, leading her to give him space. While she is experiencing similar problems, she does not feel the need to go long periods without communication. Her concerns about the relationship have led her to communicate her feelings, but her partner has responded by being distant and uncommunicative, which has contributed to her current crisis of uncertainty about the relationship.","The person is in a situation where they are experiencing relationship issues due to their partner's distant behavior and emotional struggles, and they are uncertain about the future of the relationship.",23,female,single,not specified,not poor,depressed,some college,The person is feeling troubled and possibly experiencing stress or anxiety due to the situation with their partner.,no,frustrated,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j4c8r6/is_my_boyfriend_29m_ghosting_me_23_f/,relationships
1j4bbah,my boyfriend (34M) of about 4 years asked me to take a break (31F),"Like most relationships, ours started off great, but after a year and half , he stopped being a present and committed partner.

My partner still owes me $3K after two years, stopped taking me on dates, and contributed nothing to maintaining our apartment. Intimacy dwindled, and he would get upset when I needed him during medical emergencies. Over time, he distanced himself from my friends and family, prioritized gaming and work colleagues over quality time, forgot our anniversary twice, and didn’t acknowledge my birthday, Christmas, or Valentine’s Day this past year. 

For over a year, he relied on my car without contributing to gas or maintenance.  Then, when he got a promotion, instead of paying me back, he splurged on an Apple Watch, AirPods, and trips to Chicago and Colorado. The final betrayal was when he stated he needed space for his mental health and would stay with his friends in town, but after I found out he was partying in Tulum with friends.

After I moved out of our San Diego apartment due to job loss and family responsibilities, I held onto little hope he’d change. Despite visiting San Diego five times in five months and maintaining nightly FaceTime calls, he suddenly admitted he couldn’t do long distance. He proposed a “break” to work on himself—then confessed he was tired of rejecting other women. Knowing I don’t believe in breaks or post-breakup friendship, he still asked me to stay in his life. His words about how “amazing” I was felt empty. I told him that I repeatedly asked him to step up, change, and be a better partner by addressing what I needed and pointing out where the ball dropped. He dismissed it, claiming the past is behind him and he couldn’t change it. I told him he had the opportunity to make an effort—yesterday, last week, or before—but he never presently chose to. It felt like a cop-out, and I expressed that. It was cowardly to not wait until I was in San Diego to have this conversation. We ended the call with him saying he still loved me.

When I arrived in San Diego Thursday, I texted him that I needed to get my things. He lied, saying he wouldn’t be home until Saturday, but I knew that wasn’t true. I checked his location and saw he was at a bar near my sister’s house, so I drove over to see him. He’d left by the time I arrived and turned his location off. He was working a festival I was attending, and I knew his typical schedule. I returned to my sister’s, distraught and panicked. Since Monday, when we FaceTimed, I hadn’t been able to eat or sleep, and the way he was avoiding me triggered painful memories of my previous relationship, where similar things happened after three years. It felt like I was going through this trauma again.

The next morning, he texted saying he’d be home until 3 p.m. I drove over, and when I arrived, I informed him we needed to talk. I had written exactly what I wanted to say down on my phone and read it to him. He admitted my points were true, except for my comment about him seeking other women. I still believe he is thinking of someone else, given his behavior and statement about being tired of not entertaining other women, but he denied it, saying he needed to focus on himself and didn’t have women lined up chasing him. His response felt evasive and like he wasn’t giving me a straight answer as you why he said that then to begin with. I still felt that something was off. He had been in constant contact with me, saying he loved and missed me, so his sudden desire for a break didn’t add up. What could it achieve when we were already living 9 hours apart? 

While we spoke, he kept giving me kisses me and held me. I left with my things, and he told me he’d always love me. Later, he texted, saying he appreciated hearing my thoughts, and I responded similarly. He later checked in on me, asking if I’d eaten or felt better, but I hadn’t. He mentioned he wasn’t feeling himself. He said he was home from work if I wanted to talk, so I went over, thinking he wanted to speak in person. He was shocked I came, even though I’d told him I was on my way. We talked, but he still wasn’t fully honest with me, and when I tried to go wash a dish I had eaten from in the kitchen, he told me I couldn’t leave his room, which felt strange and like he was hiding me from his roommates. He asked me to stay the night, and I did. The next morning, he tried to give me some of his things and kissed me, saying he was happy I stayed.

That morning, we both knew we’d see each other at the festival later. When I arrived, he was distant and cold. Later on, I brought him food, but his behavior remained the same—distant and harsh. After I gave him the food, he texted me thanking me and saying he wished we had more time to talk. I did not respond. The next day, I couldn’t handle the pain and left the festival early. Later, I tried reaching out because I had forgotten a few things at his place, but he ignored me all day. When I poured my heart out in a text, his response was emotionless, offering excuses, and stating he was taxed by his own emotions about all of this. 

I asked to see him again to get closure, but he ignored me. It was Tuesday, my last day in San Diego, and I texted him asking if he didn’t care to see me. He tried to avoid the question, saying he was tired and busy with work. When I pressed him, he said he didn’t think it was a good idea and suggested a call instead. I had planned to leave San Diego, but my sister begged me to stay, so I did. So I told him I’d now be here until the 9th, but he never responded.

I’ve been watching his actions, and they don’t align with his words. I still love him, and I hoped my absence would make him realize what he lost and that it would inspire change. I still feel I’m left without closure, and I’m still drawn to him, wanting to see him again. I’m not sure what to do next. I still want to talk and get the real answers. In my gut I don’t feel he’s being fully honest. How do I move forward and gain the closure and answers I need? And have him be direct and fully honest?

TL;DR: My relationship started great, but after 1.5 years, my partner became distant, stopped contributing to our relationship, and ignored my needs. He lied, avoided responsibilities, and prioritized himself. I tried to make things work long-distance, but he admitted he couldn’t handle it, claimed he needed space, and commented he was tired of ignoring women’s advances. After speaking with him in person and asking for closure, he was evasive and distant while also saying he still loves me and being affectionate. Despite still loving him, I feel like I’m being led on and not getting the honesty I deserve, and I don’t know what to do next.","How do I move forward and gain the closure and answers I need, and have him be direct and fully honest?","The individual in crisis has faced several significant life challenges that contributed to their current situation. They recently experienced job loss, which led to the need to move out of their apartment in San Diego. This move was compounded by family responsibilities that they were also managing. 

Throughout the relationship, which lasted over a year and a half, their partner became increasingly detached and unreliable. The individual had been managing the relationship largely on their own, encountering issues such as their partner not contributing to shared expenses or maintaining their living space. The partner also demonstrated a lack of commitment, exemplified by forgetting significant dates and prioritizing personal interests over the relationship.

In their past, the individual mentions having similar traumatic experiences in a previous relationship lasting three years, where they faced similar issues of avoidance and emotional neglect. This history of unresolved trauma appears to have heightened their emotional distress in the current situation, especially following their partner's evasiveness and dishonesty.

The individual places significant importance on communication and emotional support in relationships, which is evident through their attempts to address problems and seek closure from their partner. Despite their ongoing feelings of love and connection to their partner, they are grappling with feelings of being misled and a strong desire for honesty and clarity.","The person is struggling with a distant partner who is neglecting the relationship, avoiding responsibilities, and being evasive about his feelings and actions.

1j4b9ip,Should I [30M] walk away from my [33M] boyfriend of less than 2 months?," am a ‘30M’ and seem to have gotten myself into a pickle. I recently broke up with my ex boyfriend ‘40M’ of 2 years. We broke up about 4 months ago. A month or two after, I went out with some friends for the holidays, had a few drinks, and before I knew it, my friend (lets call him Dan) ‘33M’ leaned in and began to make out with me. At the time I just went with it. I woke up the next morning next to him and our friendship began to turn into something more. 

Dan has been one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever dated, much less been friends with. We have continued to date for a little over a month now since the night we hooked up. We have spent every weekend together and have tried to make the effort to see each other once during the week with our busy schedules. This relationship has moved extremely fast, and none of this was ever expected. It has moved so fast we hang up the phone by saying “I love you.” 

Now that I have provided you the context, here is what I am struggling with: 

Dan is incredible. He is hands down the most amazing man I have ever dated. I do love him, but I don’t feel IN LOVE. As we have continued to date over this 1-2 mo period, I have started noticing myself craving more and more alone time. Prior to dating Dan, I had enough social battery for one social event a week, I would spend the remaining time on my art, my career and taking care of my health. I have always been more of an introvert/loner. I can’t help feeling like I wish I could just put this relationship on the shelf and spend the time on myself, by myself that I want to. Being as social as this relationship has forced me to be, has made me overwhelmed at times. I start the new week exhausted from all the social activity over the weekend. I notice myself committing to a plan, and then canceling the day of, because I’m just overwhelmed and can’t bring myself to spend anymore time holding a conversation. I don’t know what to do, I love him, he has only done good for me. But I feel like I’m ready to walk away and get back to how my life was before this relationship started. I feel like this is my era to be selfish and focus on building myself up. But, if I walk away, I will be turning down the opportunity to date one of the most amazing men I have ever met. 

I could be selfish and listen to my gut, or I can start a life with an incredible man who shows me love and care. 

So,

Should I walk away from my relationship?


TL;DR: I started a new relationship with someone great, but it’s taking up a great deal of my time. Do you think I should continue this relationship? ",Should I walk away from my relationship?,"The individual is a 30-year-old male (""30M""). He recently ended a two-year relationship with his ex-boyfriend, who is 40 years old. The breakup occurred about four months prior to the post. A month or two after the breakup, during a holiday outing with friends, he kissed a friend named Dan, who is 33, which led to their current romantic relationship.

In terms of personal characteristics, the individual describes himself as an introvert or loner, mentioning that he previously relied on social activities only once a week, spending the rest of his time on his art, career, and health. He expresses a sense of being overwhelmed by the increased social demands of the new relationship with Dan, leading to feelings of exhaustion and a desire for more alone time in order to return to his previous lifestyle.","The person is struggling with the decision of whether to continue a new relationship that is overwhelming them socially, despite having feelings of love for their partner.",30,male,single,artist,middle class,"The person is experiencing overwhelm and exhaustion, indicating potential stress or anxiety related to their social life.",The person likely has at least a college education.,Overwhelmed,No,overwhelmed,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j4b9ip/should_i_30m_walk_away_from_my_33m_boyfriend_of/,relationships
1j4a45z,I (M39) asking my partner (F35) to move in with me. Where do I go from here?,"I have recently moved in with my partner of 9 months. We’ve been living together for about 3 months now and it has been tumultuous for me to say the least.  

The first issue is probably that we moved too fast. I didn’t give myself enough time to see the full picture, and deep down there was a big part of me who has enjoyed the independence of living alone and doing whatever I want when I want.  

Exacerbating these issues is some things I found from literally the day we moved my partner in up through now. I had never seen her place before, and though she did tell me she is messy because she works and is in school as well as having ADHD on top of all this, I didn’t expect to find what I did. You can tell she didn’t clean much because the toilet had mold all over the bowl, her bed was nasty, there was a pile of garbage bags in the corner (she said she hadn’t had a chance to throw them out), and the place smelled like cat pee because she wasn’t tending to the litter boxes. When we discussed this she attributed it to the issues above as well as her having just had surgery and recovering (which is true). Still though, many of the issues didn’t seem like something that had just been going on in the month she recovered but for much longer. Anyway, it was the day of the move and though I was really concerned about all this we couldn’t turn back in that moment. 

One mistake I feel I made though was when she moved in saying I will take care of most things. I am a clean person and I was afraid if I left anything in her hands that it wouldn’t get done. She did say she would clean the litter boxes too but she has yet to even touch one. 

Other things became very clearly to me once we moved in, and I feel like I began looking at her differently. With having seen already what I just mentioned, I began to be suspicious of her “adulting skills”. She has done a lot in the 3 months to only confirm those suspicions. These include her having literally never once cleaned any of her clothes. She piles them up on a basket near her closet. And speaking of clothes, I see other habits that worry me. She has more clothes than any person I have lived with. She has a closet stacked full of clothes hanging, bins of shirts, as well as 4 baskets full of clothes stacked in front of the closet that she couldn’t even fit in there. Yet she still keeps buying stuff, she constantly orders off of SHEIN. 

In addition to clothes she spends money recklessly in my opinion. Knowing she has a shit ton of clothes and admits to needing to manage it, she continues to buy more. She also spends a ton of money on door dash: I am talking almost $200 in Chinese takeout from once place in a single week. She has also had a letter come from a bank where someone attempting to open a card in her name and she just brushed it off. I recommended she freeze her credit or follow up and she hasn’t.

I do feel I can be on the other end of the spectrum. I do laundry weekly, I keep things in their place and put stuff back when I am done. I don’t buy things I don’t really need and I have great financial health and save. I have plans and ambitions for the future. This behavior I see worries me, especially since I intended this to be a long term relationship. 

It’s just been hard because she has bad habits, but I have also said I would do just about everything for her because I don’t see her stepping up and doing all this. She was in school and working and complained about how hard it is and she can’t get her work done, but she’d sleep till noon everyday.

I am a few years out from a dissolution of marriage and I felt I checked out of that relationship so I am trying not to do it again here, but it feels like a mess and it makes me want to be on my own. Should I stay and try to make this work or do I give more effort like I have in trying to make this work? I can ask her to change, and in ways I have (can I help you organize and get rid of clothes, can I show you how to manage your finances, etc) and I see no effort.

TL;DR: My partner struggle with responsibility and cleanliness since we got closer by moving in together, and it makes me questions if I should stay and try to work it out or cut ties. ","Should I stay and try to make this relationship work, or is it time to cut ties?","The individual in crisis recently moved in with their partner of 9 months, having been together for 3 months prior to cohabitation. They express concerns about the relationship moving too quickly, highlighting a longing for the independence they enjoyed while living alone. The partner has difficulties with cleanliness and organizational skills, partly attributed to ADHD, working, being in school, and recovering from recent surgery.

The individual describes their own habits as responsible; they manage their laundry weekly, keep things organized, and maintain financial health with savings and future plans. In contrast, they express concern about their partner's reckless spending and inability to manage personal responsibilities, which includes excessive purchasing of clothes and ordering takeout. 

Additionally, the individual mentions they are a few years out from a past marriage, which adds to their apprehension about repeating a cycle of unhealthy relationship dynamics.

1j49jab,How do I (24M) deal with my GF's (25F) sexual problems?,"Hello, everyone.



Me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 5 months now and there have been certain issues we've faced sexually. She is my first & I am her second boyfriend, her first relationship wasn't the best and it left a few issues regarding sex and intimacy. We haven't done much yet but we have discussed having sex with one another and she wants to have sex with me. She told me she's scared and she used to dissociate during physical intimacy with her ex-boyfriend. She hasn't dissociated with me during everything we've done so far but it is something we have considered might happen for when we have sex with one another.



She told me she's scared to have sex again. Scared of having such a vulnerable moment with someone and then losing the relationship. She said she wants to have sex with me right now but in the moment it's possible she might get scared and say no, which is perfectly fine. There have been other moments getting intimate that have happened before, all colored by her past relationship, that we have dealt with accordingly.



My question is, what is the best way to take this forward? I want to have sex with her and be intimate with her but I almost don't want to do anything with her because of this stuff. I love her but I don't know how to solve these issues with her.



Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.

1j49e8g,“Boyfriend” (29M) stonewalling me (29F) for 4 days and I’m losing my mind. Should I just take this as the end of the relationship?,"
My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. We had an argument last Saturday, and he hasn't reached out to me since. I know I have the ability to reach out to him first, but I'd just feel like a dog crawling back with its tail between its legs. I guess I'm just afraid of facing rejection.

The argument, I'll admit, was a bit stupid. He's a piercer at a tattoo shop, and is now apprenticing to become an artist. He mentioned that he did a body piercing on someone and it struck me as odd because he's always said he only does facial piercings and leaves the rest to either the more experienced piercer or the female piercer there. I mentioned this, and he said it was part of the job and he's always done it. However, every day that he comes home from work, he'll mention that he did nostril piercings, septum's, ear piercings, but never torso like navels or nipples. I have a big thing about not being lied to, directly or by omission, about anything, so I got upset.

We were at his house when the argument happened and he jumped up and said he didn't want to deal with this, that he was taking me home. He argued with me the whole 15 minute drive back, saying that it's none of my business and accusing me of not being supportive of his job even though I let him practice 8 different piercings on me when he was just starting out, and I was willing to let him practice on me when he started tattooing. This turned into a separate argument that I talked about in a different sub, where he asks for my advice about art but never listens to it until one of his male coworkers repeats exactly what I said, then it's gospel. He never apologizes for brushing me off, or admits that I was right. I'm an established artist and have been making art for years, he just started drawing 2 months ago. He's already acting like an egomaniac because he's getting mentored by someone pretty well-known in the tattoo community, and the apprenticeship is all he ever talks about. I'm happy for him, but it seems like I'm quickly taking a backseat to all of this. I understand that he needs to establish himself, but ever since this started, I feel like my needs aren't getting met. He's brushing off my opinions and advice that he asked for, he only talks about what's going on at the shop, and he's so burnt out from being there 10+ hours on the days he works plus 5+ hours of him going in on his days off to practice drawing, that by the time we see each other, all he does is complain about the experience and sleep when I'm over. I feel neglected and invalidated.

He dropped me off at home that night, and we haven't spoke since. It's been 4 days. He's been posting stories that he's at the shop and drawing, and I feel that if I reach out, he's just going to end things harshly because he's going to accuse me of getting in the way of his career when I don't think that's the case at all. I just wanted some transparency and for the habit of omitting things to not become constant, and for him to at least consider taking my art advice when he asks for it instead of me feeling like it's falling on deaf ears until one of his male coworkers repeats EXACTLY what I said.

I had an MRI appointment yesterday for chronic migraines that I've been having, he agreed last week to go with me and support me. I had to go alone on a Lyft, scared, anxious, and claustrophobic out of my mind. I almost thought that he'd reach out and offer to still go with me, or at least ask how it went, but no. He has ADHD and forgets a lot of things that that appointment was huge. He never forgets when there's an event for the shop though, or when his mentor asks him to remember something. I wish he were there, or that he cared.

I'm just incredibly hurt, and tired of being in this liminal space of not knowing where we stand.

Thank you for listening.

TL;DR: boyfriend is a piercer and omitted that he was doing belly and nipple piercings on clients when he told me in the beginning that he was only doing face and ear piercings. Then we argued about how he never listens to me unless a man echoes what I said. I'm mad because I feel that he omitted information to me about what he does and because I feel invalidated because he never listens when he asks me for advice in the field I'm experienced in. We haven't talked in 4 days and I'm afraid to reach out just to get rejected.","Should I reach out to my boyfriend after not speaking for 4 days, or will it just lead to further rejection?","The individual has been in a relationship with their boyfriend for 2 years.

The individual has expressed feelings of neglect and invalidation in their relationship, particularly regarding how the boyfriend does not seem to value their opinions or advice despite actively seeking it.

Additionally, the individual suffers from chronic migraines and recently had an MRI appointment, which the boyfriend had agreed to attend for support but ultimately did not.

Things were pretty solid for the first couple of months although I felt like I had to guide her through the relationship process to keep her feeling secure. There were times early on where she'd avoid talking mushy with her friends or if I brought up something sweet she had done in front of them, she'd play it off because they had never seen that side of her before (she also met this same group of friends the same day she met me and they instantly became best friends). We had arguments here and there but nothing crazy, just small little tiffs or one of us would be grumpy but we'd move past it almost immediately with no issues. A lot of it was just us learning how to really communicate with each other. We went on a trip together, spent time with each other families and things were blossoming quickly and I honestly saw a future with her (albeit it was very early on).

About a month ago, she moved from one apartment to another and all hell seemed to break loose. She was already dealing with stress from her sister being diagnosed with cancer (very treatable but she was understandably still stressed and I did my best to always be there for her). This is when her mental health really started to decline. It took almost two weeks to get everything out of her old apartment and into her new apartment and everything situated. I spent several days a week helping her and going from place to place, carrying things from place to place etc. She would have multiple crying spells a day or ""mental breakdowns"" as she called them over the smallest things. Eventually these things turned into bigger things such as work stress, her schedule being out of whack, me cracking a joke that she didn't like, her feeling insecure about our relationship because she thought I could leave and break her heart at any moment, etc.

About two weeks ago, she had to wake up at 7am for work and I had to wake up 8am. She got frustrated and cranky and started an argument with me because I got to sleep in and she didn't and it wasn't fair. She claimed on some days that I was the reason why she would get out of bed so late (I don't have to be in the office until 10am whereas she has to be in the office at 9am) because she didn't want to get out of bed without me. This only happened a couple of times but it was enough for her to make a big deal out of it. Later in the week, she claimed that we needed to spend less nights together during the week so that we could get back on track with our schedules (she wanted to be up at 6am, work out and in bed by 9pm each week, I'm in the office some nights until 6-7pm and then gym afterwards so it was messing up her schedule). She needed to change her schedule in order to feel ""sane"" again as she put it. Despite not wanting to spend the nights together, she still wanted to see me almost every other night (whether it be to hang up curtains for her because she didn't want to fall off the step stool, hanging pictures for her, building her bed side table for her, or just to see my face because she was having a bad day). I didn't mind doing these things for her because, well, she was my girlfriend and I wanted to take the stress and anxiety off of her mind but it left almost zero time for me to focus on adjusting my schedule.

Two weekends ago, we had plans to stay in and she was gonna cook dinner and we were going to drink wine and watch a show. She was going out with her girlfriends for HH while I wrapped up at the office and went to the gym. Around 7pm while I was wrapping up at the gym, I got a call from her telling me that she and the girls were going to another bar. Another hour or so later, I get a phone call from her friend asking me to come (they were all obviously hammered at this point). I get home, shower and then get a call from my ex asking me to come to a restaurant with her and her friend and the friend's date. I could tell at this point that my ex was hammered (when she hits a certain level it's obvious and she's no longer fun to be around). Since we already had plans, I meet up with them at the restaurant for another drink. She's a bit rude and kinda standoffish at the restaurant and when it clearly annoyed me she kept pressing for what was wrong, clearly not remembering the conversations we had been having minutes before. Her apartment is within walking distance from the restaurant and this is when it all went down hill. On the walk back, she starts yelling at me for getting to the restaurant so late, completely missing the point that we had plans earlier in the night that she blew off. Once we got back to her apartment, she started rambling on and on about things, talking about people being in the room who weren't there (she went to pour a glass of wine and when I asked her what she was doing, she told me she was getting wine for the others), yelled at me, slam doors, threw things around her apartment, cussed at me and at one point stormed out of her apartment and then cried very loudly in the hallway of her place. At one point, she cussed at me and I had enough and walked to my car..she blew my phone up with calls, couldn't remember that I was at her apartment but wanted me to come back in and then didn't remember anything at all. The next morning she had no idea what had happened the night before but said it wasn't the first time something like this happened and that these types of incidents run in her family. At one point, I legitimately thought she was having a mental breakdown and I'd have to call someone.

Over the course of last week, I was still dealing with the racing thoughts of her drunken night and just how bad the whole experience was but I still loved her and chose to overlook it and take it as a one off since she had promised it would never happen again. She had an extremely difficult week due to work stress and stress from that night and had crying spells throughout. We got into another argument regarding our schedules towards the end of the week. We were supposed to see each other on Friday, she went to get HH drinks with one of our mutual girlfriends. They spent 4-5 hours out drinking and then on their walk back felt unsafe. I had my phone on DnD while I was at the gym. My ex tried calling me and it went to voicemail (have to call twice when on DnD for it to go thru). My mutual friend called me and it went thru, I thought something was wrong and hadn't seen my ex's call so I answered. They told me they felt unsafe and I could hear my ex rambling in the background about how I didn't answer, etc etc. We once again got into an argument that night and she told me that nothing made her feel more alone in that moment than me not answering despite me repeatedly explaining what happened and why it happened. Nothing changed her mind.

The next morning, she woke up cranky and was in a bad mood and took it out on me. Told me to text her later that day when I wanted to see her (which I didn't hear her say) and I took time that day to just think about everything. I needed space after all of the emotional meltdowns to just think and be myself. I should've communicated this but I didn't. That night, she texted me after us not speaking all day and said this was ridiculous and that she was done and stopped sharing her location. We talked for two hours and she said a lot of hurtful things like no normal person has my schedule and I won't ever be successful on it, most of my friends suck and would interrupt me multiple times every time I had something to say (and said she had a problem with interrupting people but had never really interrupted me before). She kept implying a break up and that she was unsure if things would work out between us because we couldn't communicate and our schedules were different despite not giving more than a week for us to adjust to new schedules. She wanted to talk the next morning but I felt like it was too soon, she then texted me the next morning asking to talk Tuesday at a restaurant which I still was unsure about.

She asked again to talk on Monday and we essentially broke up and she cited the fact that I took too long to give her an answer on when we should talk as a reason for breaking up. She also said that with the place she's in in her life, she has to cut things out and unfortunately despite loving me more than anything and me being the most important person in her world and her best friend, she has to cut me off first.

I've seen a bunch of her likes on Instagram in the last day and they've all been about never settling to be the low maintenance girl and wanting a man who always plans dates first, shows up with flowers unexpectedly, gives her love letters out of the blue and reassures her all the time....this broke my heart. I always put her first, I put her mental health above mine, I was always there for her with a shoulder to cry on, never judged her, never judged her after her drunk episode and gave more of myself to her than I gave myself. I got her flowers several times, some unexpectedly, got her gifts, surprised her with food, reassured her of my feelings and always did my best to make her feel better about things when she was feeling down, but it was never enough. I was truly falling for her despite our rough month and felt more than I did in my previous relationship. I'm stuck on the ""what if"" things would've worked out part of the grieving stage and it sucks. I've been blind sided by this breakup and expected atleast a period of time for us to work through things especially since I was the ""love of her life"" ""her best friend"", she was thinking about our future and saw herself marrying me (yes I know it's early to think about that but as she claimed her feelings were strong and intense). That this was the hardest thing she's ever had to do and that she won't be okay for a while. She never gave it a chance and that's what breaks me.

Do I stick around? Do I move on? I know I could've planned dates better this month and probably been there even more for her but it was difficult always having to put her issues first. I got in a car accident earlier last month and was injured and totaled my car so I had enough on my plate but still put her first...

TDLR: Girlfriend blind sided me citing her mental state, depressive episodes, and life feeling out of whack. She's been making cryptic posts about never tolerating low effort again (all because I took a day or two to think about our situation) and how she deserves someone who puts her first even though I always did.","Should I stick around and try to work things out with my ex-girlfriend, or is it time for me to move on?","The individual had a challenging relationship history, having recently come out of a toxic 3.5-year on-and-off relationship before starting a new one with their girlfriend about six months ago.

The girlfriend faced significant stress when her sister was diagnosed with cancer, which was understandably difficult for her. This personal situation, combined with the stress of moving apartments, led to a decline in her mental health, marked by frequent crying spells and feelings of insecurity. 

Additionally, the individual mentioned having a demanding work schedule, which included starting work later than his girlfriend, creating tension in their relationship. He also recently experienced a car accident, which left him injured and without a vehicle, adding more stress to his situation.

1j491xc,Need help with comms between me(M26) and GF(27),"Me (M26) and my gf (27) have been together for almost 11 years now, and one issue I have with our relationship is that, when things get rough or when we get into a disagreement/argument, she just stonewalls me and doesn't utter a single letter. An example is today, we were trying to make our dog drink his meds, but out of nowhere he just bit me in the arm, making me shout and hit the wall due to the pain. After I washed my arm and all that, I went back to our room, and she's just on her phone, I ask her what's wrong and she doesn't even look at me and just says 'nothing', that she's fine. And this always happens, she just doesn't communicate what's wrong and it drives me insane. A minor issue that could be solved with a decent conversation lasts for days just cause she won't talk. I need advice for this man, I'm getting tired of this BS. I'm not a talker or sharer growing up, but I make a conscious effort to communicate what I think or feel, but when I get treated this way, it's all sort of pointless tbh.

1j491bs,Boyfriend's (24m) relationship with his mother makes me question being with him,"Hello! I just want to preface this by saying that in no means am I forcing or expecting him to drop his mother (55-60F?) for me.

My boyfriend's mother raised him as a single mom and kept him home schooled so she could be by his side at all times. She treats her kids as ""friends"" rather than a parent and feels as if cursing or arguing with them is just the normal means of communication. She has been so rude and condescending towards me the entirety of our relationship (coming up 4 years) which includes instances such as:

1. Telling me that I was /female dog/ due to getting the COVID 19 vaccination (ie ""ohhh so thats why you're a /female dog/"")
2. Stating that I would be wasting my time going to study accounting at a top 10 business school on a full ride due to the fact that she doesn't believe in education and to ""be an entrepreneur like her"" while she does doordash.
3. Blatantly ignoring my input in conversations
4. Dismissing everything I speak to her / disagreeing with the smallest things. I genuinely do not remember a single time throughout the past 4 years where she has agreed with me
5. Toured my new college apartment and was negative and judgy about everything down to the wall decor and only saying ""umm i guess you have storage under the bed and thats good""
6. Stated so many things I personally do at 20 are ""unethical"" despite her breeding lizards and dogs in a studio apartment

On top of all of that, I did not receive a simple congratulations for my high school graduation, where I graduated summa cum laude. (I am now a senior in college, so maybe I should let this go)

Of course, there are some aspects of these where I can see the flip side. However, I deeply disagree with her approach to life and how she intends to push her personal ideologies and opinions onto everyone surrounding her and if they disagree -- they are the worst and most terrible person in existence.

The LARGEST issue I have however, is her approach on various institutions such as the medical industry, pharmaceutical industry, higher education, corporate lifestyle, and more. From what my boyfriend has told me and from personal observations, she has placed herself in a situation where her values are geared towards holistic beliefs. For example, she refuses to take medication but is completely okay with importing antibiotics and pain killers from India, she does not believe in fundamental education, being employed by a corporation/LLC, or any traditional aspects of society.

This especially bothers me because I have only ever had the dream of becoming a corporate professional and being stable in my life-- ie having a full time 9-5 that provides benefits. She has dismissed my degree stating that ""anyone"" can do the job... lol I'm an accounting major pursuing my CPA.

Furthermore, my boyfriend is the youngest child, and due to the fact that she provided him no fundamental education despite ""homeschooling"", he is a huge mommy's boy. His mother is a single woman who has no anticipation for a significant other, and her other children, to my knowledge do not speak to her to the extent that my boyfriend does. She will text him about every little thing in life and every message I see consists of either a ""I love you"" or ""I miss you"" or a heart emoji. Additionally, he would drop everything, including me to go help her. For example, she once asked him to help her move her groceries into her apartment and he was hanging out with me and left to help her. She is 100% able bodied.

Another strange factor to me is the fact that once he and I moved to our college town, she moved not even 2 months later.

Now, his mother and him have planned to move into a two-bedroom apartment together. This is due to the fact that she cannot afford rent or get a job that requires any form of technology because ""she is too old to learn"". Reminder, this woman is completely able bodied. I feel extremely uncomfortable with this and feel as if it is completely reasonable to set the boundary that I will not step foot into that property so long as he lives with her. She has disrespected me over and over, made me feel as if I were not good enough in general, and dismissed every huge accomplishment I have succeeded in life. I genuinely feel disgusted and sick being around a person like that.

Part of my hatred towards her and the situation really stems from the fact that my boyfriend refuses to acknowledge how his mother has made me feel. He will defend her no matter what and each specific example I have brought up has been met with ""oh well yall have different opinions"" or ""that was a joke its not that serious"" or ""she didn't mean that"". However, I feel that if I had been the one to offend her, I personally would take responsibility and apologize. She has taken no accountability and everything I have stated has only added to her attitude towards me. In addition, she wants to play a moral hierarchy game where she is the only valid and perfect person in the world while she explicitly stated she used my boyfriend's dad and had him only to move out of the state she originally lived in.

I do not want a future with her in it, I do not want my children involved with her, I do not want to see her on holidays, and I do not want her at my wedding. I do not know if my relationship with her can be repaired due to the fact that she is unable to even admit that she has continuously insulted me and treated me as if I were lesser than her. (Not to be rude, but at least one of us will have stability in life at 60+ years old and not rely on our youngest son to pay our rent)

My boyfriend will not defend me or even hear it and has told me to basically ""zip it"" since he values his family above anything else. I truly don't think that this is something I can just overlook. He complains about coming to my apartment since he just wants to be home some weekends, but this is something I cannot deal with and the one strict boundary I have. He says that he is dedicated and would do anything but shuts me completely down when I have anything negative to say. It's not even negative or a personal jab too... I just want my emotions and opinions to be validated or resolved.

What the hell do I do? I graduate college with my masters in 2 years and anticipate working in our hometown. I want to move in with him, and him alone but I fear that one day 10-20 years down the line this woman will be in my home poking a prodding at every little thing... my boyfriend's sister in law has been in screaming matches with his mother before while I was present and they ended up kicking her out of their place (which was the one where she lived prior to moving up to my college town).

TL;DR -- Boyfriend refuses to even hear me when I say his mother has been rude to me consistently over the past 4 years and obsessive. I fear it is a deep set values system I disagree on. I am conflicted on what my next steps are since I am going to be graduating college soon.

EDIT: If she wasn't in the picture, I would feel 100% better about this relationship. I don't know how to logically explain it, but she is always lingering in the shadows and I do not like it in the slightest.",What should I do if my boyfriend refuses to acknowledge how his mother has treated me rudely over the past 4 years?,"The individual in the Reddit post has a strong educational background, having graduated high school summa cum laude and currently being a senior in college. They are pursuing a degree in accounting with the intention of obtaining their CPA, and have received a full ride scholarship to a top 10 business school.

The boyfriend is the youngest child and has a strong attachment to his mother, who displays controlling behaviors and communicates in a condescending manner.

The person's relationship with their boyfriend's mother has been fraught with disrespect and disregard for their achievements, leading to significant tension. Additionally, the mother has unconventional beliefs about education and traditional work, which conflicts with the individual’s aspirations of becoming a stable corporate professional.

1j48k5g,I (28F) can't pass the fact that my bff (28F) and my bf of 7 years (28M) were rude to me on our vacation,"I (28F) can't pass the fact that my bff (28F) and my bf of 7 years (28M) were rude to me on our vacation

So me, my bf, my bff and her husband went on a vacation for 15 days. It was one of my dream vacations, and I spent a lot of money on it, so my expectations were very high. 

On another note my bff really likes my bf because she thinks he's a really nice guy (which I totally agree), but she also wants me to end up with him. She tends to validate him a lot, even when I share with her some behavioures about him that make me sad sometimes. At our vacations she, of course, continued to validate him, even in front of her husband making coments such as ""look what he is doing for her, so lovely"". However she made a joke once towards me which made me kinda sad ""you don't deserve him"", which my bf greed, and that made me even sadder. Although she also makes fun of him sometimes, like she does with everyone else.

Now, my bf tends to be very caring towards others and he seeks validation (just like me, we both are alike on this), however since he's a little more passive he tends to explode with me, and it happened on our vacation as well (e.g., fighting about our suitcase and the fact that I had more things than him in our shared suitcase, the fact that I did not want to buy a full day ticket for the metro, when I asked him if he agreed).

But the worst was when he yelled at me, in front of them after, because I was postponing going to the swimming pool to meet the other couple, because I was really tired. I cried a little during that night, without him noticing because I was trying to figure it out on my own. After a few days on the trip I started to realize that he was more distant, like sitting near my bff, talking more with her and her husband, leaving me a little left out. I decided to talk to him about my feelings, and he admited that he needs to be more assertive sometimes to not explode, and he agreed with my bff because they get along really well (""we have some chemistry since we met, not chemistry exactly but you get it""), and that she elevates him to a ""pedastal"" wish made me feel even worse (maybe a little jealous), so I returned to him that that makes me feel worse because he prefers the validation of others, and that she tends to do that with other ppl as well (she used to do that with my ex). 

I also talked with my bff and she said she was sorry, it was never intentional. She thinks she was trying to welcome him since he is the ""newest"" of us 4.

I feel like shit now, kinda disrrespected and I've been considering getting away from both of them because they made me feel kinda sad and betrayed in part. More than that, I fear going on vacation with them in the future because I fear all of these feelings may be coming back. What do you guys think of the situation?

TL;DR: should I break up with my bf, get away from my bff, or both of them?","Should I break up with my bf, get away from my bff, or both of them?","The individual (28F) is experiencing a crisis related to her relationships with her boyfriend (28M) of 7 years and her best friend (28F). She shared that her best friend has a strong appreciation for her boyfriend and seems to validate him excessively, which has caused tension, especially during a recent vacation they took together with another couple.

In terms of background, the individual has invested significant time and money into the vacation, which was a dream for her, leading to high expectations. She expresses feelings of being overshadowed and left out during the trip, particularly as her boyfriend and best friend interacted closely, prompting feelings of jealousy and inadequacy. 

The individual has noted her boyfriend's tendency to seek validation and their shared traits, such as being caring yet sometimes passive, leading to outbursts in their relationship. She has also implied that her best friend has a history of elevating partners in her life, contributing to her feelings of betrayal and disrespect.

My (M22) girlfriend (F23) have been dating for 4 months. It’s going really well apart from she thinks I’m going to cheat on her. Here’s the story:

I grew up in France but came to California for college, where we met. Every summer I go back to France to see my old friends and vacation there, usually for a month and a bit - so this will be the first time being apart for a long period of time. I invited her to come for two weeks, but not for the whole time, because this is the only time out of the year where I get to see my childhood friends. She understands that bit, but thinks I’m going to cheat on her while she’s not there. I’ve been honest with her when she questions me, telling her that I will see girls that I’ve been with in the past (not because I want to see them and hookup with them, but because they’re part of a larger friend group). I’ve been honest with her about those things because I have no intention of cheating on her. I tell her she has nothing to worry about, that I only want her, and that I’m with her for a reason. I comfort her every time this situation comes up in conversation but it doesn’t feel like it’s enough for her, so I don’t know what to do. She says she trusts me but then says I’m putting her in a position where it’s hard for her to trust me? I know she cares about me because she’s feeling this way, I just want to comfort and reassure her but I don’t know how beyond what I’ve already done. Any advice?

A year ago, something in him changed - he became distant, avoidant, wanted to be with other people, wanted to spend less time with me and more doing literally anything else. After he got that out of his system and we deconstructed why he was feeling that way (I waited it out for about 3 months), he’s been better than ever, until now. 

Recently he has been busying himself so much that things are getting rocky, and I’m afraid he’s going back to this old version of himself.

For almost 2 months now, I’ve been doing the travelling every weekend, where we would usually alternate each week. If I didnt do this, we simply wouldn’t see each other. 

Also, for a month or so, I’ve been the only one really initiating sex - the only time he seems to want it is in the mornings after we’ve spent the night together, which makes me feel like a convenient sexual object more than someone he actually wants a connection with. I’ve found myself giving in to sex I don’t want just to break the streak of zero intimacy. It makes me feel gross. If it’s not morning, he’s not interested or “doesn’t have time”.

On top of this, he’s been suggesting we spend less of the weekend on quality time and more just coexisting, doing college work etc. What used to be our chance to keep the spark alive every week has turned into a monotonous experience that doesnt keep the relationship alive so it feels like we’re slowly losing it. 

When I bring this up, he says he’s happy. He wants to dedicate more time to the gym, to his friends, to work (he freelances) and to sleep. I am below all of these on the priority list. 

Id be okay with this for a short time, but he says he’s not going to change this any time soon. He asks what he can do to make it easier for me but I just feel hopeless because I’ve told him exactly what I want and he doesn’t get it.

Id like to point out that I also go to the gym, freelance, hang out with my friends and I do in fact sleep. Yet it’s me making the sacrifices, not him.

He thinks he can make up for it with money. If he pays for my travel, or for a meal, he’s being a good boyfriend. I appreciate those things but it’s him I want, not what he can buy.

I’ve tried to initiate fun and I’m constantly rejected, Ive tried to change things up a bit to make him more excited, but he’s not interested, it just makes him frustrated and confused. He wants me to be okay with being so low on his priority list but I feel so neglected and taken advantage of. He’s my best friend, I sacrifice so much to keep our connection alive and he just doesn’t seem to notice or care.

What do I do?

TLDR; my boyfriend wants to spend his time on his hobbies and not on me. I do the same things as he does, but I am the one who is having to compromise for his benefit instead of a balance. He doesn’t see a problem with his neglect of the relationship and wants me to be okay with it.

My gf 18/F recently became really distant. We have been dating for about 2 months but knew each other for like 6 years as friends with a big gap. For a while she wasn't communicating with me and would say nothing is up but then it finally came out last night. She said that at the start of the relationship and throughout she has felt guilty every time i say i love her as she doesn't feel that she is in love with me. She seems very confused about her feelings and said that im the first boy to actually not just want her for her body and to treat her right. Throughout the relationship certain things have bothered her like when we first got properly intimate she said she thought i was just using her for that but of course realised  that wasn't the case after a bit. The other thing is, she is moving to singapore with her parents in summer and she doesn't know for how long, but she said she isn't going to cut her trip short or not go for a boy. The fact she doesn't feel the same really hurt pretty bad and now i'm just not sure what to do. She said to me that she isn't really sure what love feels like and maybe if she has more time with me then she would develop it, but 2 months into her being my girlfriend now in past experience people usually have at least a reasonable amount of romantic connection by then. Last night on call i said that we have options here we can either go for a break up or continue the relationship and she keeps saying that she has feelings for me and she doesn't want to stop talking, and that she wants to see how it goes, but it all just feels off now and it hurt a lot to know that she has felt guilt the whole time everytime i say i love her because she doesn't feel that way back. I'm not really sure wether to just break it off now or to give it a chance. I really was into this girl and i wanted to give her a place in my future but it seems maybe she doesn't feel the same. Although its confusing because today she still is texting me a lot and says she has feelings.

1j46255,Unconventional living arrangements…,"Tl;dr: boyfriend is roommate with ex situationship. 

My (31F) LD BF(31M) has an unusual living arrangement. Before getting into the details, is fair to say that he has always been direct and clear about the whole situation and we met online and never really talked about a serious relationship, our terms at the very beginning were extremely casual both because the distance and we both feeling a bit hopeless about love. 

So, I reconnected with him on social media after going to the same high school but never really talked back then. I’m a chef and he was traveling Europe so we bonded quickly over food and other cultures. Talking was easy and there was definitely sexual attraction so a month later he flight me to his home and we met. We passed 5 amazing days together, not necessarily romantic but sexual and friendly, we clicked fast. By the end of this short vacation, I had disclosure i didn’t felt ready for a relationship and he said he neither. I learned there that on the next few days his very good friend was moving in as a roommate. He also shared them having dated for a few months before he broke up things because he wasn’t that into her and felt the connection was more friendly than romantic. 

A month after that, he came here (I live in his hometown) and we pass Christmas together. After that, things took a turn for us and we decided to give it a try, since we both felt a special way that was new and felt profound. More than a year has gone by, and our relationship has developed and our love has grown a lot. We both feel so in love and happy. We FaceTime everyday and text a lot. He visits regularly and is making arrangements so I can visit for a whole month this summer. He has presented me to all his family and posts me on social media. He has shown he is serious about us and talks about the future and traveling together. 

The thing is, when he came back a year ago and told her (26F) he was trying things with me and that we were formal, she had a tantrum and confessed unresolved feelings. A few months after that I visited, and she didn’t talked to me at any moment and ignored me which was really disrespectful in my opinion. I went a second time and she was better but still felt like she was uncomfortable. The issue is, I feel really uneasy in this dynamic, I don’t get why they’re still living together and being friends. They look at tv together in the living room and sometimes cook for each other (both of them and a third guy that also shares the space). As time pass, I get more and more uncomfortable, specially with them watching tv or sharing time together. He says he has change the dynamic and that they aren’t friends nor close anymore but I still feel jealous of them watching tv or hanging out together. He says he cannot throw her to the streets and that he has put boundaries and it’s not his problem how she feels. He also doesn’t want to leave his apartment that he very much loves and is comfortable and has a patio and a roof top (very rare at his budget in nyc). So I’m a bit thorn in this situation, I have never felt this happy and loved in a relationship but at the same time his living arrangement is… unconventional to say the least. And it triggers old wounds of other partners cheating on me and lying about it.

They spent time together over a five-day visit, where they shared a friendly yet sexual connection, and both expressed they were not ready for a serious relationship at that time.

1j451vt,I'm (F19) uncomfortable with my boyfriend (M22) watching porn. Is there a solution to this?,"We've been together for almost 2 years and I recently realised that I became uncomfortable with my boyfriend watching porn. We have had this talk at the beginning of our relationship. I was comfortable with the idea as I understand that guys have needs even though I can't relate. My opinion is that porn can be damaging. Not only it is addictive but it can affect negatively on how one views sex. Hence, I don't indulge in porn and I also can satisfy my own sexual needs without it.

My partner has always been transparent about it. He admitted that he needs porn to finish and he still watches it until today. We are sexually active and I sometimes send him NSFW stuff of myself. It just kinda enrages me that he still watches porn when I feel like I have been satisfying and meeting his needs. I don't know if it makes me insecure because I do acknowledge that there are girls out there who he finds attractive because I do too find other guys attractive. But it feels like he is indirectly cheating on me. Sometimes, I also feel like I'm inadequate and that he needs someone/something else to satisfy him. I don't want to tell him what to and not do because he's still a person but I'm going crazy over this. 

He always assures me that I'm enough, I'm beautiful, and he loved me. Yet, I don't feel like they're true because in the end he still needs to get off while watching porn. I also caught him checking out girls' OFs before. I used to frequently initiate sex and he would stop watching porn because he doesn't need to masturbate. But now, we're both getting busier and we aren't able to spend as much time together so he went back to watching porn. I'm trying to be okay with it but I don't think I can.

TL;DR, knowing that my boyfriend watches porn makes me uncomfortable and it's affecting me especially that we are sexually active. How do I proceed from here?


UPDATE: to clear things up, I'm OKAY with my partner watching porn but I'm not comfortable with being with someone who depends on it. I don't want my personal views about porn to restrict my partner because the majority of us understands that porn is and can just be a form of entertainment. ",How do I proceed when knowing that my boyfriend watches porn makes me uncomfortable and it's affecting my feelings about our relationship?,"The individual has been in a relationship with their boyfriend for almost two years. They have expressed discomfort with their partner watching porn, despite having previously accepted it at the beginning of the relationship. The person does not view porn themselves and believes it to be damaging and addictive. They convey a sense of insecurity regarding their sexual relationship, noting feelings of inadequacy and resentment that arise from their partner's reliance on porn, despite being sexually active and sharing intimate content with him.

The individual mentions that their partner has historically been transparent about his porn usage, admitting he needs it to finish, even when they are intimate. They have also noted changes in their relationship dynamics, particularly in light of their increasingly busy schedules, which has led to less time spent together and a return to porn consumption.

The emotional impact of this situation has led the individual to question their partner’s commitment to them, despite reassurances of love and beauty from him.

1j43wxq,Relationship advice,"I, 24F live with my boyfriend 26M in an apartment that happens to be in his hometown. I moved out of my home state 3 years ago, having not known him at the time and when I moved here we met and fell in love. 

We moved in together just last year. However, since December of 2024 I have been extremely homesick. I miss being near my family and friends, as I am very close with them. When I first moved here, I had a community of people but they all faded away (people moved, got new jobs, and just generally grew apart) which was no big deal, at first. 

My boyfriend and his friends live within walking distance of several bars, and they all enjoy going out every. single. weekend. None of them have girlfriends so I don’t tag along, so I am not the only girl. However that leaves me at the apartment by myself, almost every weekend night. At first I told him, it’s okay and to enjoy his friends. 


But the past few months feeling so homesick I fell into a really bad depression. I expressed to my boyfriend in a letter, that we needed to go on more dates, try new things and be more adventurous together, hoping that would help me get out of this rut. I found that even though I had expressed this to him, he still went out every weekend. Even on our most recent date, when we got home he went out after and I stayed by myself the rest of the night. I know that he is trying to make me happy, and has all the right intentions and I can’t say I blame him for wanting to see his friends, I would see my friends too if they lived near by. 

Our lease ends in June, and we have had all of these plans to get married, have kids, and start a life. But I feel so lonely here that I don’t think I can resign my lease. When I told him I was lonely and needed to move home, he completely broke down and apologized and asked to give him another year, that he would go out less and do what I want. I don’t want to stop him from seeing his friends, he clearly enjoys doing that and I am not one to be controlling. 

In the beginning we did a lot more things together on the weekends and he saw his friends a lot less but I think it was easier that way because I lived about 45 minutes from his home town and he would come stay with me on the weekends. I suggested he move back with me and he looked into a transfer at his company but it would be a 20k pay cut which just isn’t possible with the bills he needs to pay such as student loans and car payment. 

We both agreed long distance would be really hard because I don’t know if I could ever move back. Should I move home to be with my friends and family or should I try to stay and work things out here. I am scared I will have regrets either way.

Initially, when she moved, she had a community of people but has since lost touch with them as they moved away or drifted apart. Her boyfriend and his friends frequently go out, leaving her alone in their apartment, which has contributed to her feelings of loneliness and depression. She expressed her need for more quality time and adventures with her boyfriend, but despite good intentions, he continues to prioritize going out with his friends.

But recently I feel that being with him doesn’t help me in any way yet make me feel miserable. I don’t want to leave him and I don’t want him to leave me. I want to make things better and mend things but it’s difficult. He’s been addicted to porn. And I get it yes everyday teenage boy is going to watch porn. (I wish it wasn’t so normalized.) But he is addicted. I try to tell him how it makes me feel and that he has a problem but he always pushed it away. Recently he admitted to his friend that he really does have a “gooning problem”. Thinking about it just makes me feel sick and nauseous. Idk what to do to make him less like this so that it can be better for our relationship. Another thing is he never really wants to see me? When we are together he seems genuine and tells me he loves me and is all over me. But the past few months we’ve only been able to see each other once a week. With us working and my schooling. All my friends boyfriends are always with them everyday. So I wonder if maybe my boyfriend just isn’t into me anymore. But why won’t he leave me?? He never texts me or wants call me. Never plays video games with me anymore because he says he wants to be alone, but I go on Xbox and see he’s on with his friends every night. Of course I want him to play and talk with his friends, but he talks to them every single night. Yet tells me he needs alone time from me when we barely even talk to each other or see each other?? He tells me he doesn’t even know if he wants to marry me or that he doesn’t really see a future with me. But then goes to tell me that he loves me so much. I feel like I’m just lost in a spiral of being loved to just being hurt and lost again and again. Sometimes I just wish he would say sweet things to me like he used to. For example I told him a couple days ago that I miss being in high school with him and that I really enjoyed that year. And he just sends me a snap. I kinda told him like dude, why can’t you just say something sweet like “aw I miss that too” and he said he’s just not a sweet guy. But he used to say things like that?? I’m just kind of lost. I do have bad BPD and lots of other mental disorders so I do understand that it’s hard for him to be with me. But I just feel hurt. I try telling him things that bother me but then he says that he’s tired of my always being upset. I’m not sure how to approach him with all of my feelings. Any advice would be helpful.

1j43426,How to talk to my brother (25M) I (18M) haven't talked to in 7 years?,"**TL;DR** My brother and i stopped talking to each other after a big fight. We used to be really close. How to talk to him again?


-We were like any other siblings. We fought a lot but always made up. We loved eo a lot and always shared everything. Like i could tell him everything..he was also really smart so he would help me with school work and everything. Then he got admitted to a boarding school when he was 11 and i was 4. We were still close as ever even though he could only come home on holidays and we could only go meet him once a month. 

Few years later, when he was 16 and i was 7 he graduated and came back home. I was kinda bratty/selfish cuz I didn't have to share anything or adjust as my brother was rarely here but him being there everyday and having to share everything i thought i owned till that day was not a bright experience for me..we always fought for sharing food and other stuff. We fought everyday and I'd always end up getting hurt and crying. And most of the time parents would scold him for it. 

As time went on the intensity a d frequency of the fights started to increase. The fights were not so playful anymore it was not just physical it was kinda emotionally distressing too. 

One day when i was 11 and he was 18.. something happened idk what it was because I don't remember anything happening..i only found out after my mom told me..even she doesn't remember what it was about cuz they thought it was just another one of those fights we had daily. But that wasn't the case it was a bit more intense than out usual fights..at the end of the fight i got hurt a bit more than usual and started crying (i wish i didn't) and yeah my parents scolded him..I think he was really hurt .

 He prolly felt unloved and like a second choice  after all that time he spend away from home. He said ""I will never talk to her she's the reason why I'm getting hurt all the time"" or something along those lines. I just went on with my life and acted normal even after the incident not realising what was happening. It was after about 2 weeks that my naturally unaware 11 y/o self found out that my brother ain't talking to me anymore. From then on i started talking to him like all the time, chasing him, pestering him and kept asking him ""why are you not talking to me?"" (Yes i was that unaware fml). He didn't say anything. He just completely ignored my existence, wouldn't make eyecontact with me or talk to me. It was as if i don't exist in his world. 

I kept chasing after him and talking to him for sooo longg(idk for like 2 years straight..everyday) and things just kept getting worse. I finally thought I'd give him some space cuz maybe I'm doing too much and it'd get better with time.. it didn't. It just kept getting worse. We would talk to each other to save lives and be in the same room as each other. Whenever i entered a room he was in..he left which made me sad so i just stopped entering the rooms he were in or sitting near him.

 I started distancing myself from him cuz i realised one cannot do these unless they truly despise the person. I started thinking about it and the stuff I'd done wrong. I wished I didn't whine and make a big scene out of it. 


I started blaming myself. Whenever any of my friends talked about their siblings i started getting flashbacks. I cried myself to sleep almost every night. It bugged me so much that i started having serious isolation, anxiety issues and trembling. I forgot that entire age of 12-14 (i do remember some stuff but most of it is blank).

Obsessed sounds bad but its the most accurate way to describe my situation. My girlfriend and I have been together for a year and a half, and it’s been going great, she’s made it very clear that she loves me, and I have also made it clear that I love her. 
However, a few weeks ago i started to realize that I was staring at her more than usual, if she’s eating I stare, if we’re watching a movie, I cant shift my attention elsewhere. Shes starting to catch on, but so far ive been able to play it off as just me zoning out. In reality, I just feel super giddy around her and want to shower her with affection, if we’re at the gyn together, I take extra long breaks just to admire her. 
When shes asleep i start rereading old messages, and replaying old memories. 

Ive told a few friends about this, but they’ve mostly just teased me (and rightfully so). A few of my female friends have advised me to be careful as to not overwhelm her, and thats what ive been doing, but now I feel like I cant hold back much longer.

TL;DR: I’m completely captivated by my girlfriend of 1.5 years—I can’t stop staring at her or thinking about her. She’s starting to notice, but I’ve been playing it off. Friends say not to overwhelm her, but I don’t know how much longer I can hold back.

1j42xg1,"Constant Fighting, Emotional Burnout, and Feelings for Someone Else M26 F26.","
I M26 have been in a relationship with my girlfriend F26 for a year and a half. From the beginning, it’s been somewhat turbulent—we argue, but we love each other and always manage to resolve our issues and stay together. We have many beautiful moments, but also bad ones.

Her problem is that she reacts very explosively to anything that upsets her, and this is something she hasn’t changed about herself. Whether it’s something small or significant, she can go a whole day without speaking to me. We’ve talked about this many times, but things haven’t really changed.

Three months ago, we moved in together, and our arguments have become more intense—to the point where we fight two out of every three days and barely talk every other day. When we do have time together, we don’t spend it well because we’re often fighting for half the day. Every time we resolve one issue, another one quickly pops up. At this point, I’ve stopped stressing about it and have kind of accepted it.

Meanwhile, at work, I met a woman who is a client at the gym, and she has gotten under my skin. The feelings are mutual, even though I haven’t physically cheated on my girlfriend.

This past Saturday, my girlfriend and I had another fight because she accused me of working too much. I wanted to finish some work after she went to bed, and because of that, we didn’t talk until the morning. The next day, as soon as we woke up, she started attacking me again. I tried to stay calm but didn’t fully succeed. She told me she wanted to break up, that she hated me, and that she didn’t want to live or have kids with someone like me, who is always working.

Later, when things calmed down, she apologized and begged me to work on our problems and stay together. One day things are good, and then the next, we’re fighting again.

I love her, but I feel emotionally drained. I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid that if we break up, I won’t find someone like her again because she has many wonderful qualities. On the other hand, I’m also afraid that if we stay together, things will only get worse over time.

I feel like maybe she can change, but I don’t even know if I truly believe that anymore. And at the same time, I have this feeling that if I leave her, I will deeply disappoint her because it would mean I’ve stopped fighting for us.

How you guys look at this situation 

TL;DR:

I’ve been in a relationship for 1.5 years, but we argue constantly, especially since moving in together. My girlfriend reacts explosively to small issues, often giving me the silent treatment. We fight 2 out of every 3 days, and I feel emotionally drained.

I (28F) have been with my partner (31M) for 10 years, and we share three kids under 7. For our entire relationship, I’ve been the sole financial provider, working 50–60 hours a week because we can’t afford childcare. He stays home to care for the kids, which I initially thought was the best arrangement given our circumstances.

However, every time my partner does earn money—whether it’s from an odd job or a small gig—he keeps all of it for himself and never contributes to household expenses. For example, he recently earned $300 from a job and didn’t put a single dollar toward bills or groceries. Despite that, he continues to ask me for money on top of what I already cover.

What really stings is how casually he spends my money. Right after he got paid the $300, we went grocery shopping, and he tossed a hoodie and belt into the cart (around $50 total). When we checked out, I ended up paying for his items along with the groceries. When I asked why he didn’t pay for his own things, he responded, “You didn’t tell the cashier to separate it,” as if it were my responsibility to ensure he foots his own bill.

He often makes comments about needing a job so he can have his “own money to contribute,” but I’m almost certain he would keep any paycheck to himself. I feel overwhelmed and resentful because I’m not only the sole provider but also responsible for all of our financial decisions. Whenever I bring this up, he gets defensive or angry, which makes it even harder to address.

I’m wondering if I’m ignorant about how this arrangement “should” work. Am I being unfair expecting him to pitch in financially—even a little—or is it reasonable for me to feel this way? Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated. I love our family, but I’m exhausted and need some outside perspectives on whether my expectations are realistic.

1j42r5l,"How to survive infidelity as a younger couple without kids, or marriage, 27M, 25F?","Hey,  
  
I decided to write a post of my own in hope there is some advice here that'd help or at least help me choose the right path.  
  
I've been in a relationship with my girl for 4.5y at this point (27M, 25F; the last two years or so we did long distance due to my job). A couple weeks ago I learnt that she cheated with one night stands found on tinder. The way that I found out is: She said she was feeling sick and will turn off the phone for a bit to unwind. We live separately at the moment and I thought I'd check on her so I went to her apartment and found a burner phone with Tinder on, where I connected the dots and it was pretty clear she's been on a hook-up spree for a bit.  
  
When she came back that evening (I called multiple times, I guess she figured out that I know and came home early) I confronted her and throughout the evening we had a talk about what happened and why. She started this conversation with lying about the hook ups but then I believe we arrived at the truth later (or at least some portion of it?). According to her she cheated (sex) twice (autumn last year and now), but had more dates (sometimes the hook up would happen during the first date).  
  
The reasoning is that she wasn't really happy in the relationship, and that she wasn't feeling seen by me. I admit my fair share of responsibility on that front. I've been neglecting her in the past couple months due to issues at the job (changing now), wasn't sure where the relationship is going and how it would look like in the future, as well as started questioning whether we should be together. We both are very individual and self-centered and have had issues communicating emotions and what we both really need from the relationship. At the moment I believe it hit her finally, what she did and that it was pretty irresponsible from her side (not even talking about the betray here, just on a human level, something could have happened to her). At the same time she is not yet sure whether to continue the relationship and is taking some time to figure it out.  
  
I believe what she has told me so far is the truth about what happened, and we've had talks about the past, where things went wrong, and why we ended up where we ended up. For parts of our relationship we have had to do long distance due to external factors (I need to live in another country for the job, she needs to stay to finish up the studies) and starting 2026 I'll be moving out again (in the country at the moment for a year). I'm a bit torn about what we should do at this point and what would be better for her, me, or us. I've taken some time to figure out my faults about the situation and I acknowledge that I've been a poor partner for her, and so I understand her actions. The cheating part is still hurting me, and I think there were better ways to resolve the problems than this but it has happened so too late to try and course-correct there.  
  
She has answered all the questions I had, took accountability, shown remorse. She explained her thoughts at the time of cheating, but not excused them. At the same time she's not sure at the moment and said that she needs time to process this and come to some conclusions and understand her feelings. She's attending therapy and has been ever since the first time she cheated (I just learnt later the reason as to why she started attending).  
  
From my side I'm trying to process this. I'll start attending therapy soon, and read 'After the affair' book to try and come to terms with what has happened. We're still in daily contact, we've met on couple of occasions requested by either side. My best read on her at the moment is that she's super confused, can't love herself, can't really understand why she did what she did and is blocked a bit mentally in terms of thinking about it. Since the situation is a bit unstable (she also started drinking due to all this) I made sure to contact her best girl friend and she visited to take care of her for a bit, her family is also aware and tries to understand what happened (she told them, haven't made her, but I did suggest it). I realized at some point that things are not so black and white and that due to my and her issues the relationship was just not great and I'm treating this somewhat as a needed wake-up call. When we started the relationship I wasn't in the right head space but we still gave it a go. We never unfortunately really worked through the problems, rather swept them under the rug and both pretended things are fine.  
  
She also had history of doing something similar in the previous relationship and the way for her to get over it at the end was doing the tinder stuff. I also believe this is some trauma she needs to work through since she usually meets with one type of men (much older than her).  
  
I was wondering whether there is someone with similar experience here, or someone that could help in some way how to work on this or whether it even makes sense.

1j41sn2,Friend (23F) doesn't want a double date with our boyfriends who are best friends?,"We're all friends from high school since about 8 years ago. My friend Alicia (23F) and her boyfriend Bernard (23M) have dated for some years now. 

The high school group stayed together but I am on the outer group while they have formed an inner group with their own group chat and regular hangouts, which has always been fine by me. 

A couple of months ago I (24F) started dating a guy Carl (23M) from the inner group, and it has been going so so good. 

The summary of the dynamics is that Bernard and Carl are best friends for years and me and Alicia never hung out and barely talk outside the friend group but always get along super well and really like each other. Alicia and Carl have had some turmoil but generally they're fine.

She has confronted me in a friendly way about not having told her about the relationship so I assumed she was interested in me and my relationship. 

A couple of weeks later I sent her some old pictures I found of us and she barely reacted and a couple of days later I playfully asked her when was the double date due but she completely ignored my text. A day or two later I brought it up with my boyfriend but while I only thought she was too busy to answer or was thinking about it, he said it was really weird and wanted to talk to Bernard about it. I begged him not to because I was sure it was nothing but he did anyway (I'm fine with this) and even Bernard was puzzled by it, didn't really know why but came up with the reason that she kind of doesn't like the idea of double dates. I don't know how true this is, but I don't think he would lie to Carl.

I don't really get this, me and my boyfriend thought it could be really fun! Bernard probably thinks this too. If anyone can come up with reasons for it not being a good idea, I would be appreciate it.

Neither me or Alicia have said anything since (about a month ago) and we're going to hangout as a group soon. I don't know if this means she has something against me or our relationship. Maybe she actually doesn't like double dates and felt weird about disclosing it to me? I'm a bit confused about my dynamic with her now and don't know if I should talk it out with her or just move along and don't bring it up again.

My boyfriend is also feeling weird about this and a bit annoyed even.

What would you do? I'm willing to expand a bit more on the type of relationships we have if necessary.

TL;DR: I asked a friend about going on a double date since our boyfriends are best friends for years but she ignored the suggestion and the rest of us 3 are a bit confused why but no one is addressing it.

1j3zsz3,Pregnant 27F married to 35M with Type C disorder,"I have a lot of questions when it comes to this particular subject and need to understand from an outside perspective what other people see or have experienced in a similar relationship. My husband 35M and myself 27F recently found out we were pregnant. We’ve only been married for a couple years but have been together for 6years. I’m due in a few months and haven’t set a labor plan in place yet. We took our first labor class tonight which is what lead to this discussion…

For background my husband has cluster C personality disorder meaning he’s very analytical and as he calls himself, the contrarian, among his peers. He refuses to believe he has it but a psychologist was the one who noticed the signs and symptoms. He is very data driven and logical. My background includes a not so great childhood with not much stability and struggling to express my emotions. I have been working in recent years to stop shutting down and just crying and actually responding in arguments to try to find resolution. 

So when time comes he’s asking me questions after this class as to why I don’t want the epidural. It’s later at night, I give a poor answer that I feel there are more risks with an epidural leading to medical interventions but I don’t know the exact numbers and that I wanted to experience a natural birth. This causes him to become irritated as he doesn’t believe I’ve done any research or background on medications/medical interventions and solid studying or research. I try to explain that I’m tired and it’s been a while as to why I don’t know the numbers off the top of my head. This leads to him seeing me as unprepared, not inclusive of him, and that he is not being supported in his role as husband and father to our coming child since I haven’t asked him his opinion on the subject yet. He says that this is his child and that he’s not willing to just throw caution to the wind when it comes to his birth. I get defensive and lash back that it’s my child too and that I have been doing more research than he believes and that I was just tired and didn’t realize he was looking for a more in depth answer. He points out my immaturity and childishness when I felt defensive and said that. The conversation shifts from being about this birth plan and how immature and childish I am and like a child I can’t help but cry at this repeated accusation which I’ve heard before. He asks me why does he always have to criticize me to this degree to get me to do something. In the past he would have this same and/or similar dialogue with me about my immaturity when it came to asking for a raise, setting boundaries, standing up for myself. I’m truly trying to be a more independent self sufficient partner that he can depend on but it’s so disheartening and discouraging when he starts to speak to me this way. I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to approach this whole situation as this type of conversations seems to be repeated a few times a year at least about how he wishes I would change and how I can change to better benefit us both in this relationship, support him better so he can support me, and for our future child. I want to be stronger for my family and a rock they can depend on.

1j3y7w6,How do I (30F) make the relationship better with my partner (36M)?,"I'm anxiously attached and in a relationship with someone who's probably dismissive avoidant, since 1.5 years. Earlier, our relationship was so good until 6 months in, when we started getting intimate. With him being my first and me not having much experience, he started seeming frustrated with me. I asked how things could be better but noticed him distancing since then. I didn't know what would make him feel better, so I gave him love, space, communicated openly, etc. 

I've tried to confirm on numerous occasions if he's interested in still pursuing this, serious about me and only seeing me, and he does assure me on that. By then, we would text every few days, call weekly and meet once a month or less. He'd just blame it on him being busy with work and some of his health issues, so I'd try to understand that. But all this would make me question if he's not having the courage to leave so is stretching it, playing me, or this is a part of who he is being a dismissive avoidant and I should try to understand him better.

When I would share my feelings asking how can I make things better, I would meet with indifference or silence on his end, which started triggering my anxiety since past few months, leading to panic attacks. I made the mistake of acting on it several times by overtexting him which also made him tensed and although he'd calm me down, he's started drifting more apart.

I'd over analyze everything, becoming so insecure that I'd stalk his Instagram to know if there's someone else. I found him adding a lot of girls every weekend or so, but I'd sooth myself thinking it might just be friendship and I'm being petty on stalking his Instagram. On sharing that vulnerability with him, he did stop following more women but hid his stories from me. What I really wanted was not control over his social media, but some transparency and love from his side. When he'd provide me that at times, I'd find myself not even checking his social media or waiting for his texts and feeling secured those days. 

The incident that made things worse was - on Valentines weekend, we were going to have a call which he was pushing further since he mentioned he was baking a cake. While out with my friends, they asked about my valentine plans and I mentioned we don't have much yet, they felt if I'm really with the right person. Insecurity got the worst of me and I went to his followers list. I found a girl's profile picture from his house, holding a cake. On politely asking whom did he bake it for, he mentioned it's for his friend and friend's wife. I then became vulnerable again asking about the photo. For my mental well being and also protecting his privacy, he blocked me on social media, which is indeed helpful since I've stopped looking at it. 

After having discussions about this, I was still feeling like it'd take some time to believe him and wanted to have some words of support from him but he got really upset and demanded for space. I then apologized for my behavior and tried to give him space, with a check-in after a week, to which he didn't respond. Unfortunately, my health got seriously affected due to this stress of not resolving this for days, causing me to bleed after my usual menstrual cycle and I fainted at times. I'm seeking medical support and emotional support from family and friends. I did ask him for a call when my health deteriorated and we did talk for a short while. He said he wants to have a deep conversation about our relationship when I get better and I'm now stressing about not only the outcome of the conversation but also how long it's taking to just resolve things with him. 

If I may be honest, I want us both to work on ourselves while in the relationship. But, I understand if he wants to leave, I've hurt him. But in case he stays, how do I work on myself and on our relationship? 

Thanks in advance for reading this and suggesting me!

1j3y073,"(F24) My Bf (M24) might be showing signs of toxic abuse, are these possible signs?","So i’ve (F 24) been dating my (M24) bf for 3 months so far. Overall there’s been good times but i’ve started to question somethings and i’d like an outside perspective.

Small background. 
I have autism (which he knows) 
He claims his exes abused him 
He was very hard to get his wall down or even be kind / loving. 
I have trauma from abusive relationships + home.

- He’s very aggressive or passive aggressive sometimes and lacks empathy. Many times i’ve cried and there was 0 emotions. One time i felt sewercidal and he told me “ i can’t help you with that” and went to bed.

- He’s told me that im behind in life due to autism and not on “his level” in life and im somehow dragging him down. (he lives with family as well as i do) (funny enough he thinks he has autism too) 

- Has told me if i ever dress girlier or change my style that he’s leaving and “just can’t do it”. < i’m goth currently > 
 
- Had a problem with me smoking medical weed for anxiety, when he drinks often if not daily sometimes.

- was being overly friendly to a girl, called me jealous but lost his mind when i played with some guys, or talk to another man.

- he seems to be insecure, unless he is looking for the attention. he’s a very conventionally attractive man, that always says he’s “alright and nothing special” which leads me to hype him up, but i NEVER get the same treatment, and that’s goes overall. 

- gets upset that i don’t “communicate correctly” to him but he doesn’t communicate at all. he says things after it happened or if i get it out of him.

- when i first met him he spoke a big game, how mature and how we’d never go to sleep mad, how’s he communicate with me.  and now none of it has happened.

- anytime sex or sexual things are brought up it’s “i want to take my anger out on you” it’s never loving; it’s ALWAYS just i’m gonna “ leave marks” and so on, and i understand that’s BDSM but it’s 24/7. 

I’ve tried communicating but communicating gets me in tears and i wonder if it’s me, am i the problem? I can’t go to him if im upset or sad because he won’t comfort me, just at a loss of words. We had an issue tonight over me not communicating my words well enough ( as if autism doesn’t make this easy and he never remembers or understands that) and then basically said it was all in my head and i’m looking for a fight, when he hurt me with tone and aggressiveness. 

I always want to see the good in people, and believe that the way they act is from abuse and that they need love, but then i wonder if this is normal behavior and im being treated poorly. 

There’s good times but the bad times always make me question. I feel like i love him but when i look at what i do for him and what i get back i start to wonder. I wonder if he’s truly been abused and this is due to that or if he’s lying. I’m at a loss of words, i love him. I have autism and BPD so it messes with my thought process or seeing the bad / red flags. So here i am asking for help. 

(edit) i let one more day go by and again he clearly did not show any care for my mental health or want for me, so i put my big girl pants on and broke it off, he was quickly agreeing to it which was enough for me to realize things. thank you to everyone that helped me see the signs early on 🤍

tl:dr Bf claims he was abused in the past but it starting to see toxic behavior from him. i’m autistic and it’s hard to see if it’s toxic or not, need an outside opinion to help me tonight.

1j3xy4w,Unsure of whether to discuss my (26F) relationship doubts with partner (43M),"Hi Reddit, this is my first time posting so please let me know if I’ve done anything wrong. 

I have been with my (26F) boyfriend (43M) for 1.5 years now. Big age gap I know, I would appreciate if people didn’t pass judgement about the age gap specifically instead of giving advice on the situation. For context, I’m old for my years (I have much older siblings) and we met organically through a mutual hobby. I never notice our age gap when we spend time together besides the odd cultural reference, and I honestly think it isn’t a factor in our day to day relationship

My boyfriend only just split up with his wife when we met, bad timing I know but we fell in love and quickly started spending a lot of time together. He has two children. The relationship with his ex is not easy and she can be quite volatile. Because of this he still hasn’t told her he is in a relationship and I’ve never met the kids. This was fine with me for a period of time and in some ways suited me as being a step mum at 25 was a bit overwhelming and it didn’t really make any difference to me and him. But now I’m just starting to feel lost in it all and totally unsure of our future. I feel like we’ve been in a bubble, and we also just went on holiday for two weeks which was so lovely, and now life is crashing down. This is making me feel very very anxious

There are other complexities with our future in that we currently live an hour and a half apart and because of his kids, a relationship moving forwards means me at some point moving to him. I wouldn’t have chosen to live where he is, it isn’t near my job or family & friends. He also won’t be able to have biological kids anymore as he has had a V. He is open to having kids with me but these would need to be via a doner, which does make me sad. I’m sure his kids are lovely, but obviously our future means me being a step mum, which I feel unable to get a grasp of what that’s going to be like at the moment due to my uninvolvement in this part of his life. 

I think I’m terrible at conflict and I’m honestly terrified at the relationship ending and picturing all of the worst case scenarios. My boyfriend is also very insecure, and with the divorce, not seeing his kids as much and having a job he dislikes, I’m terrified it will completely break him and that it’s going to be very messy if we split. I also can’t imagine how much I’ll miss him as I do love him so much.

Question is, should I be expressing these doubts to my boyfriend? Are these doubts only going to grow? Is it fair to ask for a break to have some time to think or is this just a recipe for disaster. Or should I just be ending it completely? 

TL,DR- I feel completely in love with my boyfriend but I’m worried I am giving up choices in my future to be with him. Scared of what a breakup might do to us both","Should I express my doubts to my boyfriend, and is it fair to ask for a break to think things over, or would that just lead to disaster?","The individual in the Reddit post is a 26-year-old woman who has been in a relationship with a 43-year-old man for 1.5 years. She describes herself as being ""old for her years"" due to having much older siblings. They met through a mutual hobby, which suggests an active interest in shared interests.

The boyfriend recently ended a marriage and has two children from that relationship. The relationship with his ex-wife is described as complicated and volatile, leading to the boyfriend not disclosing his current relationship to her or introducing the woman to his children. The woman expresses that while she initially found this arrangement acceptable, she is now feeling lost and anxious about the future of their relationship.

Currently, they live an hour and a half apart, which presents challenges for their future together. The woman has concerns about moving to his location, as it is not near her job or close to her family and friends. Additionally, the boyfriend has had a vasectomy, which restricts their options for having children together; any future children would need to be through a donor, which the woman finds somewhat sad. 

The woman also identifies herself as having difficulty with conflict and fears the possibility of their relationship ending, which she believes could be very difficult for both of them due to the emotional circumstances involving his divorce and parenting challenges.

1j3x962,I (24F) really want to travel but my boyfriend (26M) says it’s a dealbreaker. Do I end things to travel?,"My boyfriend and I have been together 2 and a half years and I just moved states to be with him. I have always had a dream of traveling the world but my boyfriend doesn’t see the appeal. He’s very pragmatic and I am impulsive / want adventure and fun. He sees our 20s as planning for our future together which I find sweet but I want to make lifelong memories. I have traveled the past two summers for a few weeks and it didn’t go great in our relationship. The first summer I had the worst anxiety and always thought he was mad at me that I could barely eat or enjoy the trip and the second summer I had a better headspace but he was paranoid and jealous. (Needless to say we’re both anxious attachment style). But the second trip there were some ultimatums thrown out there on his end and I didn’t fill him in on all of the details of the trip which was a breach of trust. He blames the girl I went with for being a bad influence on my judgment and doesn’t want me traveling with her again but when I brought up the possibility of traveling with a different friend, he had a response of “fine do whatever you want”. Not ideal. I asked him to go on trips with me but he never claims to have PTO (even though he went to Colorado with friends and is going to Ireland in the fall) and feels like it’s a waste of money. Now I can’t shake the nagging feeling that I want to go study abroad and have to end the relationship because I know that’s the only way it would be allowed. I keep staying up nights thinking what it could be like being there even though I’ve already been to a bunch of places which makes me think I’m just feeling like the grass is gonna be greener when it won’t be. I know how all this sounds and that people are so quick to say breakup on this app but I want to reiterate that he is incredibly sweet, we’ve been through a ton together and no one is perfect. I’m the first partner he’s ever had and I’m not easy to deal with either TRUST me - I’ve posted our text messages on Reddit and y’all quick to tell me I seem like a miserable person and he’s the chill one LOL. But i guess what I’m asking is am I giving up a good relationship for the possibility of an unforgettable experience? Or am I running from the relationship? My therapist seems to think so. Am I wasting my 20’s by holding myself back or is it a valid reason for him to draw the line and I’m not appreciating him? I would hate to go and then be miserable and have made a horrible mistake. And the thought of us not being together makes me sick

1j3x5u4,My 23/F boyfriend's 22/M family dislikes me,"My 23/F boyfriend's 22/M family dislikes me

This one's going to be pretty long so, heads up and apologies in advance. I, 23/F have been dating my boyfriend, 22/M for almost 1½years now. His family never seemed welcoming of me before, but recently, I've urged my boyfriend to make our relationship known to his parents because I really love him, and want something serious and long term. I want to marry this guy and coming from an Indian background, families play an unnecessarily important role when it comes to a marriage between two individuals. I just wanted to know if I could hope to see a future with him. 

Anyhoo, he confronted his parents today. He sat them down and told them that we've been dating for over a year and are looking forward to a future together. He also mentioned how we're looking to move abroad together for our Masters. Apparently he's mentioned how I've changed him for the better, but his mother doesn't agree with that statement. She told him that she cannot make any such observations as ever since he's associated with me, he doesn't spend as much time with her. She says that they used to be close and that they aren't anymore. She also mentioned how she would never let him live away from her. That irrespective of where he resides, he'll have to live under the same roof as her. She also said something like ""spending time with your family is most important, even when you move abroad, you should spend atleast 3-5 months with us, and do you think she'll agree to that?"" Which to me, seems a little unreasonable since she won't ever agree to shipping her husband off to his family for 3-5 months. She has an issue with how he tells me everything before he does it. She believes that I'm somehow controlling him and making him take my permission before doing anything. But that's not true, we both just tell each other everything and that's just that. There is nothing more to it. And if he's spending less time at home, so am I. I'm with him too, and yet my parents don't make such comments and they are also completely aware of our relationship. Whenever his parents are out of town, I go over to his place and cook for him, he has a younger brother 18/M who, even if he looks me dead in the eye, will not acknowledge my presence with so much as a ""hi"" he's seen me around atleast 20 times if not more. And he will come downstairs to get the food that I made. He will come to the kitchen, take his plate and just leave to his room. Also, he's not a child, he's 18. So, I'm just very hurt by all of this and don't know what to do. This isn't even 10% of everything else that they do, but right now, this is what's bothering me most. And advice/inputs? I really don't want to break up with him.. I love him, I lost my virginity to him, and while that might not seem like much to a lot of you, to me, it is a pretty big deal because I was saving myself for the right person. I'm just at a loss rn, plz help.

One thing I think I should mention is that, when he said that he feels like I've made him better, he was referring to his grades, general knowledge, and planning a future. She disagreed, saying she only sees that he's become worse as he doesn't spend much time with his family anymore and that he apparently left her alone when she needed him most and how I intrude on his family time by calling him (she thinks that he's informed me that he's with family, and I shouldn't call him knowing this)

1j3wcrq,BF (21M) and I (19F) have different expectations on how much time we should spend together before he leaves—need advice.,"My boyfriend and I are both college students, and we’ve been together for three months. In another three months, he’ll be leaving the country for good (he's an exchange student). Early on, he wanted to spend as much time together as possible, so I would stay at his place for weeks at a time. It was a lot, but I agreed because I wanted to make the most of our time before he left.

Things changed after a big fight, and we decided to meet less often to make time for friends. I was fine with that balance, but now I feel like I’m adjusting to his schedule more than he is to mine.

He just spent a few days on an island trip with his friends (Sunday-Wednesday) and asked me to sleep over when he gets back. But he also mentioned wanting to keep Friday and Sunday night for his friends. That makes me feel like I’m only seeing him when it’s convenient for him, especially since I’d rather spend time with him on the weekend instead of seeing each other exhausted from class during the week.

I fully support him spending time with his friends, and I never have issues when he goes out. But he told me before that he’d have all the time for them once he leaves—so why does it feel like I’m the one compromising now? Should I bring this up, or am I being unreasonable? I’d love an outside perspective.

1j3w2o4,I (F23) feel like his (M26) mom and I need advice TL;DR,"I have been dating this guy for almost 9 months and we have lived together for about 7. (He moved in fast because his last place was robbing him with rent) ever since we have been together I've been making more money then he does. I usually pick up the slack on certain things around the house like paying for shampoo or cat litter. But I am also doing almost all of the cleaning and maintenance around the house. He also only works 6.5 hour days and I work 8.5-9. His vehicle has broken down with some intense repairs. (Over 5k) I've been recently making him lunch and driving him to and from work and doing everything. I haven't even received a thank you. On top of everything the last week we have both been sick and he insists his is worse than mine. He seems better today but has stayed home from work. I am also trying to help him get his vehicle fixed, towed or purchase a new one. All while also feeling sick. 

My problem continues with the constant fighting over nothing. I had a really important interview today at work to be promoted and it had went well. When I got home for the day I walked into the bedroom to tell him about how it went (he didn't wish me luck on it or ask me how it went) but he was playing video games. He asked me not to walk in front of the screen so I said I'll wait. He then proceeds to scream at me to leave the room and that I'm distracting him and annoying him. I was fully out of the way practically in the hallway at this point. He rage quits his game and hangs up the phone on his friend he was playing with. Then continued to tell me I ruined his game and ask why I couldn't just ""fuck off."" We also had an argument in the morning about how I was bothering him because I was getting ready to go to work. Don't know how I was bothering I was just doing my hair and eating breakfast. He yelled at me again this morning. 

I know it probably doesn't justify anything but he also has pretty hardcore ADHD and I think he's also stressed from being sick and his vehicle being busted. I have also talked to him multiple times about being disrespectful to me by yelling and fighting with me or walking out on me. (If fighting in public he will just walk away and leave) he never wants to hear what I have to say and will talk over me to justify himself. 

Now to my question. What do I do here. I do not have many friends who I can consult about this. I have really grown attached to his cat that lives with us. We have a trip planned in May to meet each others families. We are supposed to be moving at the end of April. I don't want him to leave because I do love him when he's not acting like this but the more I think about it the more I feel like I'm not actually being valued. No investment in my life, no random gifts, no date nights or romantic gestures. I had to beg him to get me flowers for Valentine's Day. I also gave him a trip for his birthday and received nothing on my birthday. 

Should I be continuing to put effort in and keep talking to him? Should we be taking a week long break or something to help us think? How do I explain to his and my family we aren't coming anymore?

She mentioned that her boyfriend moved in quickly due to high rent in his previous living situation. Throughout their relationship, she has consistently earned more money than he does, often taking on household expenses such as purchasing items like shampoo and cat litter. 

In terms of work history, she works 8.5 to 9 hours a day, while her boyfriend works shorter 6.5-hour days. Additionally, she has been heavily involved in supporting him, which includes making him lunch and driving him to work, especially since his vehicle has been out of service due to significant repair costs. 

The individual highlighted her ongoing health struggles, as both she and her boyfriend have been sick recently. She described an imbalance in their relationship dynamics, noting that she does most of the cleaning and maintenance around the house and frequently feels unappreciated and disrespected by her boyfriend's behavior, particularly when he yells at her.

She expressed attachment to her boyfriend's cat, which they both live with, and expressed concern about the impact on the cat's well-being if they were to break up. The individual has mentioned a planned trip in May to meet each other's families and an impending move at the end of April, indicating a significant commitment to the relationship despite the current conflicts.","The person feels taken advantage of emotionally and financially in a challenging relationship with their boyfriend, characterized by constant fighting and lack of appreciation.",29,female,single,"The person is likely employed, but the specific profession is not mentioned.",middle class,sick,"The person likely has a higher education level, possibly a bachelor's degree or higher, given the context of having an important interview for a promotion at work.",The person is feeling mentally taken advantage of and underappreciated.,not given,frustrated,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j3w2o4/i_f23_feel_like_his_m26_mom_and_i_need_advice_tldr/,relationships
1j3vg0j,"My (M19) new girlfriend’s (F19) trauma is too much for my first relationship, but I’m worried she’ll do something terrible if we break up.","TL;DR: My girlfriend’s traumas affects her greatly and I don’t think I can handle it. But I don’t know how to go about our new relationship now.

This is my first relationship and I have never exactly been emotionally sound myself. I really need help.

I’ve been with my (M19) girlfriend (F19) for a little over a month now, and we get along really well. We have a lot of common interests, the same humor, etc. and I know we both really enjoy spending time together. But she has a lot of trauma to carry; her past (and only other) 2 relationships were really bad for her, her partners would do things to her that she didn’t want and didn’t value her at all. Her childhood was also rough as she only had her father who she wasn’t all that close with anyway. She really has low self esteem and a history of self harm. And she told me all of this on our second day of dating.

But she’s become extremely attached to me, and I hate to admit it, but I feel stuck. Everyone around her tells me that I make her really happy, and that I’m perfect for her. All I want is what’s best for both of us, but I’m terrified that if I break up with her she’ll go back to self-harming or end up with someone who won’t treat her right again or worse. She does go to therapy and is on meds for depression and anxiety but I just don’t know. I’m scared.

Another thing is that she’s very sexually attracted to me, but I don’t feel sexual attraction to her. I can’t bring myself to admit that to her myself though.

I feel stuck. Like I said this is my first relationship; I don’t know what to do. I wanted a girlfriend so bad for so long, and now it’s gone this way for me… How do I even go about this?

1j3uy38,Wife (50F) keeps urging her abusive mother (~72F) to move close to us,"My wife (50F) and I (51M) have been married 25 years, with 3 kids.  My wife has had a long and difficult relationship with her emotionally abusive mother (my mother in law / MIL).  I have personally witnessed all of the following:

* MIL publicly called my wife ""overweight"" in front of a group of guests at a party
* MIL stormed out of our young daughter's birthday party because she felt she wasn't getting enough respect from another family member.
* During our first child's birth, MIL blew up my phone so much with her constant requests for information that I stopped picking up.  MIL then spent the next few days complaining about this rather than asking about my wife or our newborn baby.
* MIL would call my wife daily with the purpose of fomenting discord between my wife and other family members.

My wife was in individual therapy for her relationship with MIL for several years.  She took the initiative in identifying MIL as a narcissist and getting help for herself.  I'm very proud of my wife for the way she has dealt with this issue.

During the last few years, however, things have become a little less fraught between my wife and MIL.  This has coincided with MIL getting older and having serious medical issues.  But there is still a good deal of tension between them (IMO) when they are talking or meeting.  When MIL and FIL come to visit, my wife becomes so tense and anxious she almost seems like a different person.

During all this time, we have lived thousands of miles away from my wife's parents.  This has limited the amount of time we spend physically close to them, which is something I'm very grateful for.

Recently, after MIL's health became worse, my wife has started suggesting that MIL and FIL move to live close to us.  The first time I heard my wife suggest this over the phone, I was so astonished that I burst out ""why would you suggest that?""  My wife was very upset at that comment.  Despite the years of abuse from her MIL, she still feels a hope that they can be reconciled.

Today I heard my wife again urge MIL and FIL to move close to us.  I found it really hard to listen to this without saying something, but I managed to keep my mouth shut.

I want to communicate with my wife on this subject to understand what is motivating her, and express my concerns about the effect such a move might have on her, and possibly by extension on our relationship.  But I'm finding it really hard to come up with words that will convey the right message without upsetting her.  I'd appreciate any words of wisdom from this sub.

**TLDR: wife keeps urging her abusive mother to move close to use, even though I see her become tense and anxious whenever her mother is around -- how do I communicate my concerns to her?**",How do I communicate my concerns to my wife about her suggestion to have her abusive mother move close to us?,"The individual is a 51-year-old male who has been married for 25 years to his 50-year-old wife.

1j3uhdu,Am I (24F) being too insensitive of my bf? (22M),"So just for context: 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 5 months now. Things between us have been so so great since we've started being more communicative. And although we are vastly different, we've really invested a lot of time getting to know one another which has really built what feels like a deeper bond/understanding between us. We've come so far since our first month. We are deeply in love with each other, he is so driven, hard working, caring, disciplined, sweet. Honestly the brightest star in this worlds endless dark matter. 


However, it feels like these last couple of weeks: he's either putting in less effort, I'm being way too insecure/picky, or I was just blind from the start? I wanna get others perspectives before I bring it up to him.


But, for instance.. it's been a month since we've known to get a guest parking pass for his complex. Otherwise I have to park a couple blocks down. Now I'm not mad that I have to walk... but I work full time at a hospital as a CNA. My schedule is usually 3 days on, 2 days off, 2 days on. Strictly 12 hour shifts from 7:30a - 8p. So needless to say, I get the spooks.. Walking at night by myself. I'm also exhausted at the end of my shifts. Emotionally and physically.. (if you're on med surge by yourself with 25 patients you get the struggle.. 😭)


(Keep in mind he's got some remote assignments he works on for an internship (usally gets done at noon when he starts at 10), a job that he works twice a week at (security), and he's got an audition soon. Which he's been practicing a lot for. Lots of guitar seshs haha. But a lot of that doesn't take up his whole day, he also games for hours with his friends, chills, or smoke. Which I'm perfectly okay with.) 


TL;DR: Back to my problem. I get off my shift, I'm exhausted, but I still plan to drive over and see him. He's been home all day.. he hasn't gotten me a pass and tries to get one late.. even though the leasing office is most likely closed. He's done this on 3 occasions, he doesn't offer to pick me up unless I ask which feels like it's out of his way judging by how he responds.. he tells me to hurry because he's tired and it's late. (He usally stays up until 2 am but it takes me 2 hours to get a bag packed and ready so I get there a little later.. My days off I'd love to chill by myself at least once but I don't, I spend all that time with him because I know we won't have it soon. I give him massages for his tight arms, buy him food, listen to his stressful day, let him pick our activity.


But he get's upset when I cancel to come over because I'm exhausted, he feels his time was wasted. BUT HED BE PLAYING HIS VIDEO GAMES REGARDLESS! He's always changing the topic into something dirty.. Plays guitar for hours when I'm with him (which I really do enjoy) but not when we have limited time to hang out and he wakes me up just as I'm about to fall asleep to the little melodies, saying ""let's do something!"" but then proceeds to keep playing because he wants to me to watch him play.. but yall idk I think im either not built for this life, im tired, or im just stressed... 😭


Or maybe I just needed to rant, I don't know hahaha. I just feel like he's not seeing me as a priority, while I try my best to treat him like one. But he's probably just stressed or feeling burnt out himself.. I don't know! ","Am I being too insecure or picky, or is my boyfriend genuinely putting in less effort in our relationship?","The individual has been dating their boyfriend for about 5 months and works full-time as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) at a hospital, with a demanding schedule of 12-hour shifts.

1j3te9j,boyfriend (22M) of three years alienating friends (20-22M) with his bizarre hatred of fraternities. how can i navigate this situation?,"my boyfriend is a very opinionated guy. among his many strong opinions (hatred of car-dependent infrastructure, hatred of small businesses, etc.) is a hatred of college fraternities. he didn’t start hating fraternities until his two best friends joined one at their school along with the majority of our friend group, so i actually think his hatred is motivated by feeling left out and he just tries to justify it with “fraternity networking is a privilege that ensures people who come from wealth get high-paying jobs”.

i don’t really care if he hates frats. our friends’ frat is nice though, full of DND nerds with pretty strict rules about drinking. it’s the opposite of stereotypical.

the issue is that he talks about hating frats A LOT. in our group chat. with the friends that are all in a frat. he also does it when we come to visit the frat house. it’s gotten to the point that we are no longer allowed to visit at all because the brothers that aren’t friends with him can’t stand him. it’s driving a massive wedge between him and our friends, including his cousin who has been his best friend since they were little.

our friends are all tired of complaining to each other about it, so they’ve started coming to complain to ME about it. cousin included. all i can say is “no, i don’t condone his behavior. yes, i’m embarrassed about it. in the future please communicate directly with my boyfriend about problems you’re having with him.” it’s so embarrassing. he’s known these guys since elementary school, and now it’s like they can hardly stand him!

today i told him about our friends complaining at me about him, and he was utterly confused, like he had no idea why all his “abolish frats” talk would have offended them. i told him frankly that he was repeatedly disrespecting something that was important to them, and if he did the same to me i would be pissed too. 

we went back and forth for a long time with him going “so i’m not allowed to disagree with my friends?” and me going “you can do what you want, but they’re allowed to think you’re being rude.” and him going “well i think my friends should be intellectual enough to put their emotions aside and have healthy debates about things.” note: in the three years i’ve known these people i’ve literally never heard them debate ANYTHING serious. it’s always been root beer brands and ice cream flavors. he also doesn’t voice his opinions in a way that’s open for debate.

it got to the point when i knew for sure we were just talking past each other, so i ended the conversation. i was beyond frustrated that he just didn’t seem to have any empathy for his friends. it’s at the point where his cousin barely interacts with him at family events, and almost all his friends are flaking out on a get-together he has planned for next saturday. i can’t even blame them, because if i were in their position i’d be fucking pissed!

i know i can’t control his behavior, but i still feel like i should still be doing something. what can i do? is he just doomed to lose these friends? it sucks so bad because i’d also be losing these friends, since they were his first and i’d be a shitty girlfriend to visit a place my boyfriend is banned from. he just doesn’t seem to understand why they’re all mad at him, even though i did my best to spell it out for him.

TL;DR:

my boyfriend has decided to become ideologically opposed to college fraternities. most of our friends are in a fraternity. he won’t stop badmouthing frats as a whole and it’s driving a wedge between him and his friends. is there anything i can do in this situation, or is he doomed to lose these friends?","Is there anything I can do in this situation, or is my boyfriend doomed to lose these friends?","The individual in crisis appears to be in a relationship with a boyfriend who has strong opinions, particularly against college fraternities. The background context includes:

- The boyfriend's perspective may stem from feelings of being left out, as many of their friends, including his two best friends and his cousin, have joined a fraternity.
- The couple has known their friends for about three years, during which they have shared casual interactions, often discussing lighthearted topics rather than serious debates.
- The boyfriend's behavior has resulted in significant social consequences, including friends becoming upset and distancing themselves, particularly his cousin, who has been close to him since childhood.
- The individual expressing concern is feeling caught in the middle, as losing these friends would also mean losing connections that have been built with them through the boyfriend.

These elements contribute to the couple's current crisis, revolving around social dynamics and the boyfriend's inability to empathize with friends regarding their fraternity affiliation.","The person is troubled by their boyfriend's behavior regarding his strong opinions against college fraternities, which is causing a rift between him and their friends, leading to social isolation for both of them.",20s,female,in a relationship,not specified,middle class,healthy,college degree,frustrated,no,frustrated,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j3te9j/boyfriend_22m_of_three_years_alienating_friends/,relationships

1j3so1z,Best way to be understanding and supportive without feeling neglected?,"

I (35f) have been with my bf (35m) for a little over two years now. We don't presently live together due to him having a lease, and breaking it would cause him to lose a good chunk of change. 

My bf was laid off a little over a year ago from his job. Hes been applying like crazy but nothing so far. In the meantime, he's been doing the delivery apps to afford his bills. When he first started, he was making close to what he was (about 5k a month) prior to being let go. Now he's lucky to hit 2k. 

Due to this, hes been working even longer to hopefully snag some good orders. Needless to say, our time to physically see each other has dwindled significantly though we do chat on the phone. 

As a result, our sex life has taken a huge hit. We haven't had sex in almost 2 months now. Valentines day, we unfortunately got food poisoning so no snu-snu was in the cards that night. I am someone who needs sex in a relationship and I noticed it's starting to affect my self esteem. It hasn't gotten to the point where I feel like my skin is crawling due to needing it, but I know I'll be there soon.  I hate masturbating so that's off the table. However, I do recognize that this is something that will hopefully be temporary and also understand my bf is going through a rough time with what he has going on. I know I need to deal with it for now deep down, but how can I support him without allowing any resentment to potentially come to fruition? I also do not wish to add more to his plate.

1j3sgrl,How do I go about being in a situation with someone i really like but is emotionally unavailable?,"weirdest situation i've ever been in - help

I've (19F) been seeing this guy (20M) for almost 3 months now, at least once a week. It's been incredible and honestly i've never liked someone this much before - i feel like we align with each other really well and we match each other in intelligence, life philosophies, interests etc and we inspire each other creatively (started this thing were we show each other artwork we've done or a piece of writing we did each week). I've been in two serious relationships and never felt this way before, someone i can spend days with and not get tired of them or want to be alone and i assume he feels the same way.

Early on we decided neither of us are ready for a relationship and wanted to take things slowly since i'm not long out of a relationship myself and he's been through some really tough things the past year that's messed up his emotions. Initially i had a respect for it but now it feels like an excuse. We spent valentines in a hotel after seeing a gig - it genuinely felt like we were in a relationship and he was very affectionate and made the day as enjoyable as he could for me. He kept going on about marriage and how he imagines his future wife and his life with kids and mentions this each time i see him now. Since then it's just been off. I've seen him a few times since but he feels a lot more closed off - he leaves my messages for days at a time before responding and has repeatedly told me he doesn't care if i see someone else on the side or use dating apps.

A week ago i saw him out when i was bar hopping with some friends (we go to the same university and it's a small city so i bump into him frequently). He was pretty drunk and told me some weird things, he said that he has power over me and boasted about leaving my messages on delivered and said that he knows for a fact i won't leave him for someone else because i like him so much and that it's boosted his ego that i like him in the first place. 

It took me a bit to think about how this made me feel and had me doubting myself and if it was true. I don't feel it is, i can leave at any point but it's uncomfortable to feel like he thinks that way of me. But i also don't think i physically could see someone else since i do like him a lot and the time i'm spending with him means that i don't feel the need to seek out other relationships. The lack of messaging didn't help. 

A few days ago i asked him to go on a walk so i could talk about it, i told him what he said and he had no recollection of talking about it and apologised profusely about it. We ending up walking for hours and enjoying each others company until i brought up the situation again. He explained how he feels so emotionally detached from everything currently that he doesn't care if i see someone else or leave him since it won't affect him that much. He said he's really self involved at the moment and practicing some kind of spiritualistic journey on focusing on himself and his work that he doesn't really think about messaging me but i am the person he talks to the most at the moment. It was really heartfelt and he told me a lot of stuff about his past he doesn't really talk about. To finish he told me he cared about me and how i felt, that if i felt like i was becoming too attached or liked him more than he liked me to leave the situation. He said he'd see me some point this week and to message him if i had anything else to say.

That's been it since - no messages, i've sent a few and had one response but nothing for the past two days now. I walked past him today on campus and said Hi and he said Hi back then walked off with his friends. I've had some more time to think about it and honestly i'm starting to think drunken him might've been right - for a man who asked me out first, takes me out on incredible dates on valentines he really may hold that power over my feelings and maybe he finds enjoyment in that despite what he says. I like him a lot and i want him long term in my life but i'm not someone who begs for attention from someone i'm seeing - especially if they offer me so little in return.

I've explained this to a few people in my life and no one really has any solid advice for me and doesn't really know what to say, it's very up and down and changes week by week. Sometimes i feel like he likes me a lot, sometimes i think he couldn't care less. I'm not sure where to go from here and i have a worry i might be being ghosted as well. How do i go about this situation moving forward? I don't want to end it but it's getting more complex as time goes on. Any advice?

1j3sdah,"My husband (40M)was supportive at the beginning of my pregnancy, but now I (32F)feel like I’m on my own","Hi all, I’m currently pregnant (12w3d)and feeling so emotionally drained. In the beginning, my husband was quite supportive—helping out, showing care, and being there for me. And to be fair, I really do appreciate that he takes responsibility for most of our household expenses, like rent and bills. I only contribute to half of the groceries, and I’m grateful that he has been present for every appointment and scan so far.

But as time has gone on, that emotional support has really faded. Since we moved to the UK (where the taxes and cost of living are high), he has become very focused on money, and I can feel him getting stingier and colder.

One example that really hurt me: he suggested that my parents fly over to help take care of me while he’s away for work—this was completely his idea. I never initiated anything like this . I did propose if I need extra help by that time I can go find some PT cleaner / home service provider and he said I’m not considerate like what if that cleaner/ helper is absent then no one will take care of the house and out cats etc Blahblahblah But when it came time to buy their tickets, he told me I needed to pay half the cost, saying, “They’re your parents.” I felt so upset because I didn’t even push for them to come—it was his solution so someone could look after me.

And to make it worse, I think there was a misunderstanding. I had initially offered to split just the upgrade cost if we chose Premium Economy, but somehow that turned into him expecting me to pay half of the entire ticket, even though I never intended that.

I also tried sharing with him some advice I read about how husbands can better support their wives during pregnancy, but he just got irritated and defensive. It feels like he’s already “at his limit” and doesn’t want to hear that I need more from him emotionally.

Now I feel like I’m just quietly pulling away. I’m exhausted, lonely, and feeling really unsupported. I used to feel loved and cared for. Now I feel like just another responsibility or expense on his list.❤️‍🩹

Edit: I did tell him twice that I really appreciate everything he’s done, but sometimes I just need a bit more emotional support—like checking in or asking how I’m feeling. However, he tends to get irritated whenever I mention it, as if I’m being too demanding, and he says he’s already been treating me very well. 
It feels like he think I’m using pregnancy card and use it as excuse to be lazy and demanding.. I am already intimidated to start the similar conversation with him .. sigh :(

Am I being unreasonable? I would like to hear different opinions please? I know he already contributed quite a lot here and taking up more chores when I feel too nausea 

Edit2  moving to UK is his idea . Everytime i mentioned maybe we should stay in our home city and he will slap on my face saying if i like money that much i can go back there alone . He said he wont convince me to stay My income decreased for 30% or more and his decreased for more than 40% after tax

TL;DR
My husband used to be supportive early in my pregnancy, but lately he’s become distant and very focused on money. He suggested my parents come help while he’s away but made me pay half the ticket, which hurt—especially since I only meant to offer covering the upgrade, not the whole fare. I appreciate that he handles most household expenses and attends my appointments, but emotionally, I feel alone and exhausted.",Am I being unreasonable for wanting more emotional support from my husband during my pregnancy?,"The individual in crisis is currently 12 weeks pregnant and has experienced a change in their spouse's emotional support as the pregnancy has progressed. They are living in the UK, where the cost of living and taxes are high, and their financial situation has worsened, with the individual's income decreasing by over 30% and their husband's income decreasing by more than 40% after taxes. 

The move to the UK was initiated by the husband, and the individual has expressed concerns about the financial implications of this decision. They are responsible for half of the grocery expenses, while their husband takes care of most of the household expenses, such as rent and bills. The individual feels lonely and unsupported, having previously experienced more emotional care from their husband during the early stages of the pregnancy.

Furthermore, there is tension regarding the suggestion from the husband that the individual's parents should come to help during his absence for work. Although this was positioned as a solution proposed by the husband, it became a source of conflict when the husband later expected the individual to pay half of the travel costs for their parents. The individual feels increasingly intimidated to communicate their need for emotional support, as their husband perceives her requests as being unreasonable or demanding.","The person is feeling emotionally drained and unsupported during their pregnancy, experiencing a decline in their husband's emotional support and facing financial stress related to their relocation to the UK.",30s,female,married,The person is not currently employed full-time.,middle class,pregnant,not specified,emotionally drained,not given,"exhausted, lonely, feeling unsupported",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j3sdah/my_husband_40mwas_supportive_at_the_beginning_of/,relationships
1j3ruyc,I (27F) was just diagnosed with a rare medical condition and will not be able to have sex for at least a year. Is it better to break up with my boyfriend (M28)?,"I (27F) just got diagnosed with a rare medical condition (not going to name it here for anonymity). The condition has left me quite suddenly deformed in my vaginal area, and it is both physically impossible and unsafe for me to have sex. The condition can be corrected with surgery, but because it is so rare there is only one specialist in the state who can perform the surgery and its over 6 months out to even get a consultation. Even if there are no complications (which there could be), we are looking at close to a year before I could have sex again when considering recovery time and physical therapy following the procedure.

I have been in an official relationship with the love of my life (M28) for about 6 months now, though we had feelings for each other and were talking for over a year before that. The last year has been rough on our relationship as he was dealing with some personal problems (now resolved) and I am finishing an extremely strenuous graduate program. It has been really difficult for him (and I) that we can't see each other much. We have been holding out all year just to get to May when I graduate and looking forward to finally being able to spend more time together and do all the things we have been wanting to do. Then this happens.

I feel like I have to break up with him. Sex has always been a very important part of our relationship and he has a very high sex drive in general. He is being supportive with all my health concerns and says he wants to stay together, but part of me feels like hes not thinking this through long term. I am feeling crushing guilt everyday that he is in this position and I feel that it is entirely unfair and unsustainable for him to stay in a relationship with me. I wish I felt comfortable opening the relationship but I know it would kill me inside so thats not an option either.

I love him so much and I just want him to be happy. I know he will not be happy with a sick girl who is always in pain and can't have sex. Especially because we have already been through so much, and this was supposed to finally be our time. I don't think he will break up with me because he is too nice, but I think it is cruel if he has to stay in a relationship with me. Is it kinder for me to just end things now?

TLDR; I (27F) got diagnosed with a rare medical condition and will not be able to have sex for at least a year. Sex is very import to my boyfriend (M28) and I and he has a high sex drive. We have had limited time together in the last year due to other circumstances and have been holding out until May when we could finally be together more, then this happens.

1j3qndl,I (23F) am not ready to move in with my boyfriend (31M) after 2 years,"Hi everyone. I am currently in a long distance relationship due to me acquiring my master’s degree abroad. My boyfriend insists that we move in together after I graduate and return back to my country. 

I have several concerns on this. 

1) We have a different financial situation. I have my own apartment (in my home country). I do not plan on letting anyone move in with me in it because it is too small to be comfortable for two people. He refuses to rent a bigger apartment for us himself because he cannot afford that without my input. However, I am not excited at all about paying 50/50 for being able to live with a man while I actually do have where to live and moving in together is his initiative not mine (I’m totally okay with living separately by now). If we didn’t have other issues I would probably commit financially, but this is not the only problem. 

2) I didn’t like the way we spent time together when we did. He works night shifts and when we meet he spends a lot of time sleeping. When he is not sleeping he is playing WoW. I try my best to be understanding but it was unpleasant to come over and watch him gaming hoping that we will finally cuddle after he finishes the quest. Because of this, I am not sure at all that living together will mean more quality time. 

3) Main concern. I do not feel emotionally safe and comfortable in this relationship. I am absolutely sure about his honesty and loyalty, however he lacks communication skills. He frequently criticises, interrupts, belittles me or spits hurtful jokes. Besides, I don’t feel like my interests are as valuable as his in this relationship (he always finds a way to turn the conversation back to him or simply has nothing to answer when I talk about my plans, dreams, hobbies etc, which makes me feel kinda lonely in a relationship). My voiced concerns are thrown off and/or he immediately gets defensive and angry. The same happened when I said I may not be ready to move in and explained why. He told me that every “normal” couple does move in at this point and every “normal” girl would dream of this proposal.


My question is, is it worth it to give it a try anyways? Or should I make another attempt to explain to him my reasoning, and if so, how do I get him to hear me without getting defensive? I’m not sure the situation is healthy. 

TL;DR: I don’t want to move in with my boyfriend yet because I’m not totally comfortable with him. He keeps pushing. Him keeping pushing makes me even more wary about the idea.

1j3qg8t,Is my boyfriend self sabotaging or do I just need to run away? F22 m22,"TLDR: I don’t know if my boyfriend is self sabotaging our relationship or if he’s genuinely just really bad to me with how he handles things and how he reacts to my emotions. 

My bf and I are both 22. Female and male. 
Yesterday we had a really big fight in a random parking lot. I went after I got offf work to meet him and his mom at the doctors clinic just so I could wait for them together and we were all gonna go eat after. I was tired from work but really just wanted to see him still and I also hadn’t ate all and it was 5pm at that time. He starts being distant while we were all walking in the grocery store and I was just giving him space He started to get quiet after I saw my coworker and told my boyfriend “hey I work with that guy!!” He’s an older man and I didn’t go up to him or speak to him or wave at him or anything but my boyfriend didn’t say anything he just stayed quiet. And I became quiet too because I was scared I upset him by pointing out my coworker because he gets really jealous. 

We drop his mom off at home because she just wanted to stay home and we went to get pizza and wings and I wanted to sit inside the restaurant cus I was so hungry I was literally watching other people eat while we waited for the food 😭 since we sat at the table it had been dead silent and then he started asking me what was wrong and I told him nothing I’m just really hungry and tired. And he caught an attitude and I said well if I don’t talk first you don’t really talk. And then he started saying I haven’t been talking all day, that I didn’t seem happy to be there that I wasn’t chipper and laughing that I looked like I hated everything around me and I was so shocked because genuinely I was not any of those things. I was laughing and making jokes with him and his mom the whole time since I saw them, and I was pointing out foods and drinks I liked at Walmart and everything. He started telling me I shouldn’t hang out with him if I’m in such a terrible mood and that now I’m just starting an argument and looking for something to argue about and I told him that I didn’t say or do anything wrong I’m literally just hungry. He stayed quiet and I got up and asked the cashier to make our order to go because I wasn’t about to stay sitting in the restaurant like this. I asked him to let me put him some pizza and he kept saying no and telling me to let’s go and I was literally begging him to just let me give him half of the pizza and he just walked out. So we get in the car and he starts yelling at me telling me I do this everytime and that i don’t give a shit about this relationship and how I was so unhappy all day and how I just want to pick shit to fight about and I kept saying no like I didn’t do anything he’s the one that kept asking me over and over what was wrong while we waited for food. We got to my car so he could drop me off and he wouldn’t let me give him the pizza and we argued over the pizza for 10 minutes and again I’m begging him to just let me give him the pizza I didn’t want it anymore he kept yelling saying no and that he loves me but he can’t keep arguing with me. 

Just last week I told him I was struggling to wake up in the mornings and to shower sometimes and he started to tell me that I shouldn’t be in this relationship if I don’t love myself and I was confused because I never said anything about not loving myself. And he said me not being able to wake up and struggling to get in the shower is me not loving myself and how will I love him if I can’t love myself. I told him I was confused on where he got this and he kept saying I shouldn’t be in this relationship if I felt this way. 

He’s yelled at me before on my birthday when he said it was my fault that men flirt with me and I told him that I didn’t care that men flirted because I just ignore them and he got really mad. On that night he also made me tell him if he was the biggest penis I’ve had and I told him I didn’t wanna answer and he kept pestering until I told him and he got really upset too. I started crying on my biethday because it was so bad. 

 There’s so many other things he’s done and I’m just so tired of saying it’s okay over and over. He apologized yesterday and told me that he’s still learning and I should let him learn. 


","Is my boyfriend self-sabotaging our relationship, or is he genuinely bad at handling my emotions?","The individual posting on Reddit is a 22-year-old woman. She has a job that requires her to work, as indicated by her mention of being tired from work when she attempted to meet her boyfriend and his mother. Her relationship with her boyfriend is strained, marked by conflicts and misunderstandings, particularly concerning their communication and emotional responses. 

She has expressed struggles with self-care, such as having difficulty waking up in the mornings and showering, which she mentioned to her boyfriend. This was met with his reaction questioning her self-love and implying that she should not be in a relationship if she feels this way. 

The poster's family situation is not detailed, but she is engaged in a relationship where her boyfriend has exhibited jealous and controlling behavior, including yelling during arguments and making her feel responsible for external attention from men. She has experienced emotional distress as a result, including crying on her birthday due to conflicts with him.

1j3nn72,I'm (M19) thinking of dropping a boundary with my gf (F19) just to see how it goes. Is this a good idea?,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 5 months, going onto 6. At the beginning, I set some boundaries with her that mostly pertained to hanging out with other men, and she decided to respect them. The only thing is that she doesn't agree with them. We both have different views on the subject, whereas I think a woman hanging out with another man one on one while in a relationship is uncomfortable for a lot of boyfriends because they don't trust the man, while she thinks that doing this is fine because we're all human and she wouldn't let anything happen anyways (and i see her point of view on it as well).

I know that we all have our different opinions about this topic (i think this subreddit is more on my gf's side of thinking by reading lots of replies) and that's okay. Due to different situations that have occurred in this relationship, I can tell by placing some of these boundaries hurts her in some ways because she doesn't completely agree with everything I say. She has some guys friends and goes to college where she interacts with people of all genders too. I know it all comes down to trust, so sometimes I think of just dropping the boundaries and trying to go along with it just to see how it goes. Is this something that could possibly better our relationship? How can I control my thinking of negative things happening if I do this, and just be nonchalant about it?

We're both girls, and we used to have the sweetest friendship for  more than a year- we'd text every day and talk all the time.

I honestly haven't had a real conversation with her since 2024.
She's so dismissive now, and I just don't feel like I'm a priority to her anymore. I try reaching out, but no joke, after a few minutes she'll just be like, ""I'm gonna go, I'm hopping on a game,"" and I'm sitting there like... seriously? You can't even finish the conversation first?
I love her so much, but it really hurts that we don't talk like we used to. I've never cried this much over a friendship it's frustrating because I keep being open about how I feel, but she barely communicates. And the most confusing part? She'll randomly check in, ask me what's up once a week, or send me a TikTok, but then she's dry the entire conversation and never actually wants to hang out. I just don't get it. This isn't how things used to be, and I don't know what to do. I absolutely despise the videogame she plays but i did try to play it for her and get better in the game but she still will never invite me to play with her or even appreciate the fact that im trying to meet her halfway.

1j3nauq,Should I stay or should I go?,"I (27M) have been with my partner (27F) for just over 4 years now, and things were great in the beginning. We met online and bonded over our mutual love of horror podcasts, and we had a bunch of shared interests over which to continue bonding. We'd have long, engaging conversations all the time, she'd come down to visit me for the weekends when I was free and we'd go out for coffee and go shopping, then after she inspired me to get a better job which let me see her more I started going to visit her at her place. After about 2 years together, I found a job near her and moved in with her, and it's since then that things have begun to decline.

Since I moved in, we've slowly started clashing more, both in the big picture and in the small picture. Sometimes, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, having to police what I say and do to avoid starting anything (to be clear, there's no physical violence or anything like that). She'll critique me over anything and everything and belittle me, but if I voice any complaints or critiques, she'll get huffy and give me the silent treatment.

We don't engage much any more. She'll spend most nights sat on her tablet drawing with her headphones in, and whenever I bring it up, she says that she thought I wanted time to myself, which I've told her isn't the case. We used to sleep together a lot, but now we do it maybe once a month and I don't even usually feel that engaged during it, as she's stopped even trying to seduce me and just assumes the position and lets me do all the work. 

Our expectations seem pretty different too, as she's a lot more traditional than I'd originally come to believe. We both want to move somewhere bigger, but it seems like she wants me to be working full time to support her while she dials back to either part time or no job and pursues her hobbies, which I don't think is realistic, and is bound to leave me in a busy job that I'll hate.

I've been feeling more tense over the last few months, and have been thinking of leaving. This would be difficult though as I don't have a lot of money for myself and wouldn't have anywhere to immediately go. I have been thinking about moving to Birmingham, as there's jobs there in my field which would pay more and sound good, and there are places there that look nice for not much more than I'm paying now. I think that being single and by myself would allow me to be more extroverted again, explore myself a bit more. Part of me wants to scrape together whatever money I can and go for it, as I really don't know what kind of future I can see, but then I don't want to make any rash decisions and do something irreversible that I could later regret.

TL;DR - I've been thinking about leaving my 4 year relationship which I can't see much future for and striking out on my own. ","Should I leave my 4-year relationship that I can't see a future for, or is it better to stay and try to work through our issues?","The individual in the post is a 27-year-old male who has been in a relationship with a 27-year-old female partner for just over four years. They initially met online and developed a strong connection through shared interests, particularly horror podcasts. Over time, they engaged in various activities together, including going out for coffee and shopping during visits.

The individual has experienced a significant shift in the relationship dynamics since moving in with his partner after finding a job near her. Tensions have increased, leading to feelings of conflict and discomfort in communication. He notes a decline in intimacy and engagement in the relationship, with his partner often preoccupied with her own interests.

Additionally, there seems to be a difference in their expectations regarding work and lifestyle. His partner appears to lean towards a more traditional view, suggesting he should work full-time to support them while she reduces her own hours or potentially stops working altogether to focus on her hobbies.

1j4qg0h,"(Ex)Girlfriend F29 Gets Pregnant on Purpose twice and gets abortion on purpose twice. I, M29 am feeling very taken advantage of , lied to, and abused. I’m all about pro-choice, but this has seriously messed me up. Is there anything I can do legally for the suffering she’s caused me?","Hi y’all, I’m a M32 now I think (ex) girlfriend is a F29. We’ve on and off messed around for the last 13 years wondering if we’d click or not and last summer we finnaly did. It was amazing. She’s now twice begged to have a baby with me, gotten pregnant and then at between 6-9 weeks both times she has suddenly decided to leave town and go to Michigan to have an abortion at the advice of her mother. Who the first time tried to send her the pills to Wisconsin. Has lied about getting an abortion saying she miscarried both times. I know this due to pictures in our shared library. 

The first time this completely destroyed me. She promised me she would never ever do such a thing (as my ex had an abortion without even just a heads up)and she knew it was a sore spot for me and I didn’t want to chance that with anyone else because i wanted a partner who wanted to do that with me for real. That’s part of me I’m giving away.

Anyways we worked out the first time and she again promised she never would do it again and all the things she said she supposedly wanted fixed in our relationship I did them all just to prove to her she was the person I wanted to do life with. 

She gets pregnant the second time on purpose and I immediately take her out to pick out a brand new car (for safety) and since she didn’t have credit we had to put it in my name briefly till I got her a credit card and she spent a month or two getting it going. We then take said car across the United States from Florida to California where I have some friends to show us some winter sports and as a trip for us to reconnect and unwind. we get to our destination and I have to take her to the ER for some light spotting. We are suppose to make an appointment for a specific doctor and she instead wakes up the next morning and said since our friends dog got on the bed I didn’t care about her and demanded $2500 and to be put on the next plane back east. I tried to reason with her to no avail and she breaks up with me. I as someone who already has abandonment issues just gives her the money and takes her to the airport (the first time she just randomly left without saying anything and I couldn’t handle that happening again.)

I guess I’m wondering if there is something I can do for the horrible anguish she’s caused me? I know I should just say whatever and move on and absolutely NOT let them back into my life. But she clearly doesn’t she what’s she’s doing as wrong and if she’s done it to me the quote “love of her life” twice she’s likely to do this to others. It feels wrong to me. And I’m pro-choice. Begging someone for their essence and to have a child, promising them they’d never get an abortion, then doing it twice if nothing else.. 

If nothing else, are their actions abusive?

1j4qf78,Im not in love with my husband. Help F30) M30,"Apologies for the long explanation. F 30 I feel an explanation is due as to how I am posting this title. How can I start. I started a relationship with my now husband M 30 after breaking up with my long time high school sweetheart of 8.5 years. I was in a toxic environment and my ex had a lot of baggage with his family. They were clingy and overstepped every chance they could. As much as I didn’t want to admit it. I was still deeply in love with my ex. But for my mental health left the relationship. I cried all the time. Eventually I responded to my DMs where an old friend of mine would hit me up and profess his love for me now and again. I wanted to catch up him and get my mind off of things. We talked on the phone for hours at a time. I noticed he seemed like he had his life together..his own apartment. Stable job. I was impressed with how well he was doing compared to my previous situation. 2 months later, he told me he was moving to California where I live. I told him I thought it was too fast but he assured me he wasn’t coming for me but had been wanting to come to Cali all along. I was in school and living with my mom at this point. He asked me to move in with him so he could help me and my son that I shared with my ex. I told him i didn’t want to rush but his exact words were” whether we wait 3 months or 2 years to move in we’ll never know if we can live together until we do” well. As you can imagine by my post, I moved in with him. I immediately noticed red flags. He had raging explosive anger issues. I hadn’t built the financial means to leave and family wasn’t an option anymore. I put up with it and told my self id leave once I could. In the meantime I noticed I felt no compatibility towards him. The way he was. His demeanor. Mannerisms. The smallest things would urk me. Deep down, I knew I didn’t love him. I gained the courage to tell him the truth and he told me the reason I felt this way was due to his anger which he was trying to control. Here’s the part I struggle with. I got pregnant. I didn’t want his baby. His anger and behaviors just repulsed me. I regrettably had an abortion. It ate me up inside. For spiritual reasons..Deep down I always wanted more children just not in these circumstances. He still had his anger issues. He disrespected me a lot but would always apologize and shower me with gifts. Roses. Home cooked meals. He would even clean and do my laundry. I missed my ex more than anything but I knew reconciling with him wasn’t the answer. Finishing school was. I promised myself id never have another abortion. It had been 1.5 yrs at this point. He took care of the bills and his support felt like a blessing in disguise. But this nagging feeling never left me. He opened every car door. He would protect me at all costs. No family drama .i thought. I can grow to love him. No one’s perfect right. But still. The red flags never stopped. He talked horrible about people. He cursed out women on the street if they said the wrong thing. He got into fights and really was unstable. He said his dad dying really hurt and affected him. I believed him. We went to church. I finished school. again I fell pregnant. No abortion this time. I welcomed my baby and stayed at home. I kept in touch with my ex always hoping he was doing ok. We never crossed the line. Our conversations stayed respectful but my heart wasn’t in it with my now fiancé. I fell pregnant again. He continuously always wanted to “finish” inside me. It was a kink or something but he would always ask in the middle of sex and I would cave. The thing is I adore my children we share. I would move mountains. Step in front of a train for them. But my heart is not in love with him even still. It’s been 5 years. I’ve started my career. I finally have the means to go but I’m terrified. I’ve gotten so complacent and I know it’s my fault for all of these choices I made. I really tried to make it work. I wanted to love him. While I was pregnant with my second baby. My ex died. My first child and I spent the last 1.5 yrs grieving. I guess im writing this post for anyone who’s ever been in my shoes or just an outsiders perspective. Any words of wisdom to share? Opinions? Your take?","What should I do if I’m no longer in love with my partner after years of trying to make the relationship work, but I feel trapped and terrified to leave?","The individual is a 30-year-old female who started a relationship with her now husband after breaking up with her long-term high school sweetheart of 8.5 years.

During this time, she was living with her mother and was enrolled in school. She has a son from her previous relationship and moved in with her current partner due to his encouragement. After moving in, she faced red flags regarding his violent temper and found that she did not feel compatible with him.

1j4qdqh,My ex(M21) ghosted me(F19) for no apparent reason and now I'm scared of getting my pics leaked,"So I met this guy online last year around April and we started dating in August. He was a nice guy, made me feel loved always and never got angry at me, always treated me with respect. There were a few flaws in both of us but we were trying to work on them. He was emotionally a little unavailable and it was hard for him understand why I'm upset or angry at him at times. One another huge problem was that he used to disappear for days randomly without saying anything(he disappeared like that like 5-6 times for a week sometimes) and he always had a reason to give me so I forgave him everytime. One time his phone got damaged completely and some days he left for another city with a relative and couldn't inform me coz he was using his mom's phone after his phone got damaged. He is a bit poor financially that's why couldn't get new phone. I understood everytime but my flaw was being hella impatient. We had many fights because of him disappearing and not understand why that hurt me. We decided mutually that we are not good for each other and we broke up but decided to stay friends. For one month after the breakup (January start) every thing was fine but he missed me so we decided together to block him for him to move on and within 3 days he called from another number to talk. I didn't block him after that and everything was seemingly fine. He again disappeared for a week and told me after coming that his uncle got a brain tumor and his family had to reach to a different city and in hurry they forgot the phone thinking the other person took it (his mom's phone). I was understanding obviously but then again on 8th feb he stopped responding to my texts and calls mid conversation. I thought same thing happened again and I waited for him but till now there was no response. Yesterday I asked my friend to call his number to check if he answers or not and he answered on the 1st call. I forgot to tell my friend to record so I don't know if it was him. My friend told he picked up and I got angry, I made a impulsive decision and called him from my phone and nobody picked up. I called again and this time someone did pick up but the voice wasn't his and that person immediately hung up after I said hello. I called again thrice but no response.
Idk what to do or what to think. I feel I got played again. My last relationship of 3 years was tough to move on from and I trusted this guy. I feel so broken that I got sick. And him ignoring is comparatively easier to deal with but I feel I got catfished maybe coz he never video called me(his mom's phones camera is broken he said). Once he sent me a ss and in that I saw he had video called his sister and I asked about it but he said it was by mistake. I believed him and now I feel stupid. I'm more scared about my pics that are with him, I know I'm wrong here to send him nudes but I did. All were view once and without face but I think he showed them to someone. I'm scared that he will misuse my normal pics too, I've sent him like 200-300 selfies. I feel so stupid and scared. Will he misuse them? Idk what to do.

Recently, I’ve had a really off gut feeling about our relationship, but I didn’t have anything concrete to go on until this happened. A few days ago, a random girl added me on all my social media and messaged me on Snapchat. She asked, ""Hey, do you know (my boyfriend's first name and last name)?"" I said yes, and then she told me that they had been texting for a couple of days and were up talking until 2 a.m. the other night. I was like… *what the fuck?*

She then sent me screenshots of their conversation, and the worst part? **He was denying that he even had a girlfriend.**

She told me that she suspected he had a girlfriend because he had reposted couple-related stuff on TikTok. She kept pressing him on it, saying she thought he was lying. Then, she literally spent an hour going through his socials, found me, and reached out to let me know what was going on.

I confronted him about it, and his response? **""I’ve just been really lonely in our relationship, but I love you so much.""**He started crying and begging me to believe him. His excuse was that he told her he didn’t have a girlfriend because he ""didn’t want her to find me and blow this up into something it wasn’t."" He claims she was just ""someone to talk to"" because he was feeling lonely.

The thing is… I actually saw her name pop up on his phone **back in November** at my sorority formal. I asked him about it then, and he immediately deleted their conversation and unadded her. When I asked to see it, he refused. Now, it all makes sense—he was trying to cover it up.

I feel sick. I don’t know what to do. His whole defense is that he didn’t *do* anything, and he just needed someone to talk to, but if that were true, **why lie? Why delete everything? Why deny having a girlfriend?**

I stupidly gave him a second chance, just to two weeks later find texts on his phone with another girl from his home state. They were flirty and saying “I miss you so much sweetheart 🥰” “ I think about you all the time” “ I wanna act the f up right now, feeling naughty and sexy” etc. I again, confronted him basically saying you can’t have your cake and eat it too. You need to either pick me or these girls from back home, I wont tolerate being just an option for you and clearly you like this attention. He basically tried to cry wolf and again say that he didn’t like her like that, and just lied straight to my face AGAIN.

Our 1 year anniversary is on March 18th and I'm really scared for our relationship because we fight a lot. It happens like every other day I feel like, and I don't even know what to do. We always resolve these arguments by the end of the night while calling each other, and we've only went to bed angry once. so I would consider us healthy in that way. A lot of the times it stems from our differences in sex drives or that she wants to save herself for marriage, and I do too but I am horny all the time for some damn reason and sometimes that leads to overstepping boundaries like trying to convince her to do it and then she gets mad. Those aren't the only fights we have, but that's about half. The other fights are just petty things because we are only 18 so she's a little clingy and doesn't really have a life outside of me, but I don't want her to be my only personality trait if that makes sense. Again I love her so much but I'm scared that if we are like this at one year, how will our future last?? I'm really scared because this is my first real relationship and I really honestly want to marry her but I scared. I've seen so many things where differences in sex drive is what causes a lot of couples to break up, and I have a very high sex drive, but for her, even when she's ovulating she's BARELY horny at all. Is this something I should be worried about realistically?
The arguing every other night, is that a problem that would cause us to break up? And before you say anything, I know she hasn't fallen out of love with me. Like I said she's really a little clingy, and honestly it gets too much sometimes. But yeah if anyone that's been in a long term relationship before could give me advice I would be so grateful.","Is the frequent arguing in our relationship a problem that could lead to a breakup, and should I be concerned about our differences in sex drive?","The individual is 18 years old and is currently in their first serious relationship, which has lasted for about one year.

1j4pu6g,I (30F) feel uncertain about my (29M) Husband. Thoughts?,"Hey guys

Throw away account.
I've been together with my partner for about 7 years. 
We've been married for less than a year, but we've lived together for about 3 years. 

My husband is very wholesome, he's kind, well thought out as a person so I generally don't have any issues with him. 

However, on one particular night, I was extremely depressed. I think he noticed because he kept asking me what was wrong and I'd mention, ""the usual"" 
Which means, generally about my own life and sometimes my struggle with mental health. 

Anyways, later at night, he initiated intimacy. 
I said no, clearly, about 3-5 times. I really wasn't in the mood and again, I was horribly depressed. 
Anyway, my partner took it up on himself to continue to pursue me. 
Eventually, it was sort of non-consented and he decided to continue. During this, he kept asking if I was okay because he could probably clearly tell that I didn't want this, he asked this about 3 times and I just nodded. I didn't know what else to do at that point. 
He asked me if I wanted him to stop after a while but I said nothing. I didn't even know what I was feeling in the moment. 

Anyway, after all of that, he finished and then he tried comforting me later, I quickly told him I'm going to bed and then it dawned upon me as to how much I wanted to cry, on top of all the depression I'd been facing, it was a bit too much for me, so I just turned away and dealt with it, myself. 

Today he kept asking about how I was doing ect, but I'm not even ready to bring something like that up with him. I'm not sure I'm overreacting. I'm not sure I'm even processing this unhealthily. I just told him that I'm okay and I distanced myself quite a lot from him. 

Again, he's been an amazing partner but this just makes me feel some type of way and I'm unsure if I'm overreacting.

1j4pttf,I (25/F) am catfishing my bf (25/M) and I'm not sure what to do next,"Like the title says, I've been catfishing my boyfriend of 2 years for a few days now. The reason I even made the fake account in the first place was to see if he was still using the app we met on to talk with other girls since he blocked me on my real account. 

When it first happened I brought it up to him and we fought a little about it but, in the end he agreed to stop using it. This was a few months after we had started dating and I kept checking because I felt like he wasn't actually going to stop and I was right. 

I haven't brought it up to him since because I don't want to start another fight but last month he saw that I had the app downloaded and got mad at me and asked me what I was doing on it. I told him that I only had it because I knew he still did. He told me he hasn't used it recently and couldn't remember the last time he did and even after me telling him that I knew he was on it and I wasn't mad I just wanted the truth he kept lying and insisting he hasn't been on it. 

Well, a few nights ago I accidentally followed his account on my fake one and we've been messaging and I'm not sure how to feel. I know it's wrong but it's also a relief to know that I'm not crazy and I was right this whole time. It also explains some things in our relationship such as him getting quiet randomly when we're otp, being in another room by himself constantly,  not wanting to do things together like he used to, and him not being as ""affectionate"" as he used to be. 

I'm hurt that he's cheating and I kind of want to confront him but I can't tell him how I know. I know what I'm doing is wrong but I don't know if I should keep it going or just delete the account and leave it alone? any advice would be appreciate.

1j4pqxs,I (33F) am seeing bad signs in relationship with my boyfriend (30M),"Basically I met this guy online and we've been talking through discord since last November after we found out we only live 2 hours away. We finally became a thing in January and he kept planning to come see me, putting it off every weekend to the point I almost just said forget it. Then he actually showed up Valentine's day weekend, brought me flowers and everything was great.  
  
So, the issues: I'm a transwoman, which he said at first he liked that I was, but then the other day he said him liking trans women is a fetish for him. I've dealt with guys fetishizing me before, but he actually seems to care about me and treats me like a person so it's confusing to me.

So I thought maybe he was just bad at articulating things sometimes or something. However he told me that he was high on cocaine, and does it ""on occasion"" which is honestly very common where I live, people pair it with drinking for whatever reason. I'm not a fan of cocaine, I've never done it and never will, but this guy seems to control himself relatively well with it and I've had lots of friends who do it. Maybe I sound dumb...but either way I let him know I don't like it, and he's agreed to not have it around me at least.

Which brings me to the last issue, twice now he's been high on coke while telling me he wants to come see me and misses me and all this stuff, but when he's sober he acts like he doesn't even remember saying it. Last weekend he told me he was going to come on friday, which I assumed was coming up, but the next day I mentioned it and he said ""what? why would I come up on friday?"". Now he's saying he only wants to come on long weekends due to having a day off to himself, which I understand, but that means I won't see him until June at this point. It's a 2 hour drive so I feel like that's a bit ridiculous.  
As well, we usually play games/talk together and I've lately he's been offline a lot more. I'm lucky to be able to talk to him for 1.5-2 hours every 3rd night at this point. The other day he told me he wasn't online (on his day off) all day because he ended up playing minecraft for like 8 hours with someone else and sleeping.

Idk maybe I should just chill and let things keep playing out, it just feels like a lot of bad signs starting to pile up but sometimes I misinterpret things going on so I thought I'd try asking for advice.

1j4plpl,I (M26) have a feeling that I am sitting on a crossroad in my relationship with my girlfriend (F24),"Hello reddit,

To sum it up a bit before the long story begins: I feel like I have to make a decision about how to continue our relationship. I feel that I don't get the credit I deserve, and this feeling annoys me.

So, where to start? I (M26) live with my girlfriend (24) in an apartment in Western Europe. We are renting it. We've been together for four years and have lived together for two years.

We are both studying. I am finishing my master's degree in six months, and she is doing a second bachelor's degree, which will take another two years. On that note, we are both motivated people who work hard to achieve what we want.

This is where the problem starts. Ever since we've been in a relationship, she has always been worried about me. Will I finish my courses on time? Do I have enough money to pay rent? Etc. I have never had problems with my courses since we were together, and I have more than enough money in my bank account. I feel like I am managing everything perfectly. For four years, everything has worked out fine, yet she is always worried about me. This annoys me a lot. She also says that this is just part of who she is. Her family is also very anxious with these things. I must say that it really annoys me when other people interfere with my business. We've talked about this multiple times, and things go well for a while, but eventually, she gets upset if I say that I have postponed some courses so I can take my time and avoid burnout. I was a bad bachelor's student (it took me seven years), but now that I am doing my master's, I plan to finish it in two years. I am really motivated and an adult, so I know what I am doing.

The second issue is that she feels very insecure in the bedroom. I must admit that I have a higher libido than she does. Sometimes, she still cries after sex because she believes she is bad in bed. I constantly reassure her that this is not the case, but she never believes me, which frustrates me. Sometimes, I feel like I can't make love without making her feel upset. I am more adventurous in bed, but she doesn’t want to try new things. For example, in four years, she has never made me orgasm herself. It could be that this is causing some built-up sexual frustration for me.

In recent months, she has been feeling depressed, and I have been very supportive. She is seeing a psychologist to help with her insecurities, which makes me happy because it took me a long time to convince her. She sometimes feels like she isn’t doing enough for me or that I should leave her for someone better, even though I never say anything like that to her.

She is a very lovely person and kind to everyone. What I wrote above does not define her entirely. I believe she would be a great mother to our future children, but there are some things that make me unsure if I want to continue the relationship this way. That’s why I feel like I’m at a crossroads.

I would love to hear your advice on how to handle this situation, and if you could share your own relationship experiences, that would be great.

 Thanks.","How should I decide whether to continue my relationship, given the challenges we're facing with communication and intimacy?","The individual writing the post is a 26-year-old male who currently lives in an apartment with his 24-year-old girlfriend in Western Europe.

1j4pkeg,"[24M] The guy I'm dating[25M] won't let me pay for anything, advice?","I've been dating this guy for a couple of months, everything is going mostly good, but there's this one thing: he almost never lets me pay for anything. 

The first time, he wanted to pay for the aperitif, I let him, thinking I'd pay for it the next time. Guess what? He insisted on paying also the second time, and the third time we went for dinner, and so on. Now since he's taller than me it's physically impossible to get in front of him and pay because he always gets to do it first. 

We booked an hotel room to have some privacy, I've managed to pay that only because I booked it and paid with my card, and he still insists that he has to pay me back. Once, I had to get a couple of things from the groceries, and since we were in a shopping mall in that moment, we went together, he also insisted on paying for that (nothing major, but still) or when I get something at a cafe and he doesn't get anything. When I talk to him about it he insists that I already do my part by picking him up (he lives a 10 minutes drive from my house and he doesn't have a car yet, so it'd be a no brainer for me). 

He also has problems accepting gifts or affection acts: he was still hungry after dinner and wanted some Burger King, and since we were in the centre, I told him that we could find one here, or that on the way home there were countless BKs we could go to, but I had to convince him that going there wasn't a big detour to get him to agree with it.

Now all of this is kind and cute, but I do think that it's a bit too much, on the personal level, the fact that I make more than him (I'm a SW Engineer while he works part time at a fast food) makes me feel guilty for him spending all that money for me, and in general I think that it'd be normal to pay every other time or so.

1j4pjwl,I [25F] feel anxious regarding my relationship with my boyfriend [23M],"My boyfriend and I got into a fight recently where he complained about not feeling as loved in our relationship, as well as feeling that I was overly critical of him. I agreed with him based on some of my actions and words recently and so we made the decision to verbally communicate my affection  and things I like about him more often. He agreed that he would voice when things bothered him more often since some of most of these things happened a while ago but he didn’t want to tell me they hurt him or he was feeling hurt about them. 

I say fight but we thought we had addressed his concerns in an actionable way. It was amicable, and I thought by the end of it I had a clear plan in my head as to how to improve things. 

In all honesty though, some of his complaints came a bit as a surprise. During the discussion, he mentioned he had considered breaking up over it. This took me especially by surprise because it seemed like a relatively straightforward issue, he had never voiced a concern before, and I don’t think I’m an unreasonable person to not be able to take criticism. He also mentioned that he complains about me to his friends. 

We’ve been together 3 years. The thought of breaking up never even crossed my mind. And it hurt a lot to hear all of these things, seemingly out of the blue. 

While after we left, I felt reassured that we were going to be fine, the experience has still shaken me. I feel the need to message him more, spend time with him more. I feel especially sensitive when he says he’s not free or busy. I feel especially worried and annoyed when he leaves me on read or doesn’t reply quickly. This last part really gets to me because he has a tendency to go quiet when upset and ignore me instead of tell me he’s mad or why he’s mad. I told him explicitly that our conversation while helpful has left me feeling more anxious and that I would prefer some verbal reassurance about simple stuff (that he still loves me, he is still attracted to me, that he’s not mad at me). 

I think realistically, I am anxious and being a lot more sensitive at the moment - when I try to think rationally, he has said things to assure me including complimenting me. But even though that’s true, I can’t help to feel I’m annoying him now, or that he doesn’t feel for me the same way. And then I think I’m being anxious or paranoid and feel bad about that feeling. I don’t really think it’s his job to manage or help deal with my own irrational feelings. 

I am worried that I am making him think I’m a crazy person but I am just trying to show him I care and love him. I am also worried that due to timing issues (I’m a medical resident), I need to fix these issues quickly while I have more time since my schedule can be somewhat outside my control at times. 

Part of writing this post out was to get these ideas out but I’d really appreciate any insight as to how to navigate the situation. Do you have any advice for me?

It feels like there’s never a good time to do it either, and I just sat down and wrote some things out, because that usually puts me at ease. I think I make better sense on paper, and I’m considering just writing him a letter as a breakup. Is this too lame? Is it as insulting as a text? I planned loosely to give him the letter next time I’m at his place and I would be there while he reads it. As absolutely terrifying as that sounds to me right now, I want him to be able to react and ask me questions if he has any.

1j4pg1x,"34f and 35m, are we headed to a relationship or situationship?","| (34f) started dating a guy (35m) who I met on bumble in December. Both our profiles said looking for LTR and we matched and chatted and ended going on our first date in January. Since then, we've been talking and getting together 1-3 times per week and dating. He's not the most communicative or emotionally aware guy, but he's sweet and I like where we're at.

With that said, I'm trying to figure out if we're in a relationship or heading to one. I know, I just need to talk to him. But I'm anxious and this is the first guy I've actually been interested in for years.

When he talks about his future, it's about his personal goals and how he's driven and focused on that. He's mentioned a few times that sometimes sacrifices have to be made to achieve his goal and I'll fully support him and his goal. My internal concern is that me/a relationship is the sacrifice.

We don't talk daily, but we see each other and spend the night at least once per week. He always responds to me but rarely initiates conversation but he's also always the one planning and setting up a date if we want to go out.

TLDR; I'm insecure and anxious about whether I'm wasting time dating a guy who doesn't want a relationship. But he's also the first guy l've wanted to be in a relationship with for a long time.

1j4pewt,I’m (21F) in the verge of breaking up with him (21M) and he doesn’t even realize it.,"Hey, I am a 21 yr old female and my boyfriend is also 21. We have been dating for two years, and this December we will hit 3 years. Our relationship was unexpected, it was very straight to the point and overall smooth for the most part. I love this man so much but I am just so done with having to mother him. 
Since the beginning of our relationship, his friends have always been a big problem. In the beginning of our relationship, I had found some text messages in his group chat where they would talk about other women in sexual ways, and I even found him laughing and talking about how he was covering for his best friend who was cheating on MY best friend at that time. I was so disgusted but at the end of the day I decided to stay. I am his first relationship, first sex partner, first everything so I thought that maybe he just needed a little of a wake up call. 
After this though, I felt extremely uncomfortable with him being in that group chat so I asked him to leave it. He did leave it however his friends reacted soooooo bad. They told him how stupid he was for choosing a girl over them, how I was being too toxic and that he should not try to be all goody two shoes now over a b***ch (aka me). He “defended” and left the group chat, but ended up joining it again and hanging out with them again. I voiced once again that I was still feeling uncomfortable with it and didn’t like the idea, but as long as he didn’t allow them to talk about me in such a bad way again and for him to not act like them then it’d be OK. But oh boy, that was just the beginning.

We had several other arguments because of them after that, his friends would constantly make fun of him for being “too in love” with me and for apparently “choosing” me over them. They’d refer to me as toxic and so on, and he’d honestly just allow it. They even went as far as telling him to not take our relationship so serious because one day we would end up breaking up and they’d be the ones sticking with him, not me. When this happened I told him that they were horrible friends, how could he hang out with people that express themselves that way? Knowing that me and him have talked about getting married, yet they’re over here talking about “don’t take her too serious.” It was so upsetting and so disrespectful yet, he would never put a complete stop to them. 

All of this happened a couple of months ago. I told him countless of times how uncomfortable I was with them. They have girlfriends and cheat on them all the time, if not they talk about other women all the time. I asked him to please stop hanging out with them but he never stopped so now I am just exhausted and hurt. 

Throughout our whole relationship, he has shown me over and over again that it does not matter how disrespectful and nasty his friends can be towards him, me and our relationship because he simply does not care and will continue to be friends with such people. He does not respect me or values me or my feelings because if he did, he would have been put a stop to them. Last Saturday, I told him just how much resentment I had against him because of how he would just allow his friends to disrespect me. I told him I wanted him to be more mature, and do something about these friends because I am so done with them. He said he understood and saw my POV, and said that if he was in my shoes he would also be tired and would want to break up. He said he was going to drop them and just focus on us. 

You would think that he’d act fast on that though. But it has been almost a week and he has been chatting with them as normal as ever. Group chat is still there, they’re still texting on a daily basis and I am just done. I am not his mom to tell him what to do. And I also shouldn’t be settling for someone who allows their partner to be disrespected. I love this man so much but I am so done with feeling undervalued and unheard. I am hurt that the man I thought would be my husband can’t stand up for me, and I can’t believe it took me so long to realize that no matter what I tell him, he will always pick them first. 

I am not going to boss him around or lecture him anymore, I shouldn’t have been doing so in the first place either way. I don’t want to settle for this, I really don’t. I have already started to think about how I will break up with him, and he’s in bed sleeping, thinking we are doing just fine.

1j4pcna,I F22 think I want to break up with my bf M23 of 6 years,"My bf is the sweetest, most loving, funniest human on the planet. Over the past 3 or 4 months my attraction to him has just gone away completely and I don’t know why. 

We went on a cruise a few weeks ago and that’s when my mind completely knew I fell out of love with him. I was attracted to other men and when I was drunk I was essentially avoiding him. It was so unfair to him.

It’s breaking my heart because he is my best friend and I don’t know what to do. We do share a dog together and basically live at his mom’s house rent free (I still have a room at my parents house I just don’t sleep there).

We have different goals at this point in our lives. He is not making much money focusing on building his career in real estate. I’m making a decent starting salary as an RN with no bills besides a $200 car payment.

I want to travel the world and explore while i’m young. It’s been my dream for as long as I can remember. He’s not into traveling. He’s scared of planes and wishes to just stay in the US.

It’s breaking my heart completely even thinking about ending it with him. I’m literally so torn on what to do. I don’t want to leave and end up regretting it and making the biggest mistake of my life. I also don’t know what we’d do about the dog.

I have been trying to get my feelings back for him by doing more date nights and anything else my brain thinks of. It’s just not working. I don’t even want to get intimate with him at all anymore and he does not deserve it. He’s been noticing that i’ve been distant lately.

If I do break up with him, when is the best time? My birthday is in 2 weeks, then his is in early April, and then our anniversary is in May.

since this… revelation, stuff seems… weird. at first, we talked more, probably more than we ever have, and we were a lot more open about things. it’s typical i would assume! he still calls me beautiful, though, and talks about me a little… highly

a week before he offered me money, the same night he offered to doordash me food, then the next night he even said he would go with me to a local event (crazy to me considering he constantly blew me off), tonight we’re talking and he’s telling me about how i do something his ex did, how i’m a “9”, and offers to wake up earlier to remind me to do something. it’s like he’s doing this more than he ever has since i’ve known him, and i never accept or have accepted his offers… it’s just hard to not wonder if he’s regretting it?

1j4p03b,Do you continue to hide the secret-28M and 24F,"
I met this guy and I felt an instant connection. We fell in some next level love, twas a movie moment. We got on but as we got close I started to feel bad. 

Because I was falling in love with him, he took a toll on me as I was lying to him. I had hidden the fact that while I met him, I was still with my boyfriend (which was already dead but still alive based on title). Within 1 day of connecting with the new guy (we did not do anything physical, mostly flirting), I dumped my ex for this new guy as I knew I didn’t want to “cheat” even though I had already technically cheated by flirting and not disclosing I was taken when I met the new guy. Regardless I confessed this to the new guy along with something more personal pertaining my personal academic life. Though I didn’t owe him the truth about my academic life, I wanted to start our relationship off with honesty as I saw/see a future with this man. 

However, when I confessed to him, I was overwhelmed. I had been conditioned my whole life to resort to lying to avoid severe punishment from parents and fear. In doing so, I panicked when he asked me about yet another lie he detected-not disclosed here(but for the context of the story-something similar-for example; you did an extra year of school after graduating but called it a “Masters degree”). Idk why in that moment when I was being honest, he came at me and asked if that was also a lie. I got defensive as it was embarrassing how much I was being vulnerable with someone I had only just met, before I could even answer, he explained how he had already told his friends and family about me and my life and academics. 

I felt a lot of pressure regardless and said that ofc “I have a masters”. Fast forward, we’ve been together for 6 months now. I became completely honesty with the guy and don’t resort to lying at all. However, it creeps on me sometimes that I’m still living with that one lie with him. But that’s something that even my parents/sister and friends don’t know about. It’s a very complicated part of my academic journey as lets just say “I got accepted into the masters” but for the purpose of efficiency and long terms goals, I realized the masters wouldn’t do for me what a non degree year would do for me but I was too embarrassed to explain that to people including my own parents so I conjured about the lie of the masters to everyone. 

I know feel conflicted if I’m a bad person. I love my partner, I’m faithful and I truly want to be with this person. He’s changed me for the better in terms of fostering an environment where I don’t lie. 

Now the question is; do you continue to hide the secret?

I fear telling him the truth now will pull us very back into our relationship/end things/ruin the trust we’ve built and make me feel so embarrassed that I would walk away","Do I continue to hide the secret about my academic journey, or should I tell my partner the truth?","The individual has been in a complicated personal situation regarding their relationships and academic life. They were previously in a relationship with a boyfriend whom they describe as ""already dead but still alive based on title,"" indicating that it was a relationship lacking emotional connection. The person met someone new and felt an instant connection, which led to them ending their previous relationship to avoid cheating.

Educationally, they mention having gotten accepted into a master's program but later decided that it wouldn't align with their long-term goals, leading them to not pursue it.

1j4ozib,"I 24M, would like advice regarding my current relationship with my GF F20?","I dislike posting online about personal problems that have connections with other people, but I would like some anonymous opinions here. 

We live about an hour and a half away from each other, so I get to see her maybe once or twice a week now. Been officially dating for eight  months. She is extremely kind, like she is the nicest person I know. I'm just not sure if it's going to work out sometimes. Distance could be a factor in my feelings

Sometimes being with her though I'm just flat out not enjoying it, whether it's with her family or friends, I just wish I were elsewhere, and even if she's there sometimes it's like I'd rather be alone at times. It makes me feel terrible because she loves me and makes it clear and I understand her frustration when we can't see each other. 

It's worth mentioning that I suffer from depression, and I'm constantly trying to overcome it. I really to hard not to make things an issue she has to deal with but last time I saw her she got to see me break down a bit, and she was supportive, but also didn't really understand. 

We often play games together online which I enjoy and at times it's some of our only time we get to spend together due to the medium distance, while it's enjoyable, it's just like playing with friends online. I only bring it up because it's not like I'm learning more about her or anything and don't count this as legitimate dating progress. 

Again, we've dated for eight months, but with how little we see each other, it feels new, and her family has already said she should consider getting married (parents are ultra religious), and she brought up the idea of a promise ring which actually is what's getting me to ask what I'm feeling. 

Look relationships are complicated, but I think about it and while most of me is saying that she's an amazing person who I care for, part of me also says I'm not deeply in love with her, and maybe that I went to fast getting into this relationship and didn't ""test the waters"", which also makes part of me wonder if that's toxic FOMO or something. 

It's also worth mentioning that a few years back I was in a tough divorce and was cheated on and abused a lot, and I wonder if that has anything to do with my current feelings and situation. My current GF treats me pretty well. 

It's hard to actually talk about the status of my relationship with her because I know breaking up would be absolutely devastating for her. Again it's why I'm even mentioning this because she does treat me so well, but I feel like at times that I'm doing something wrong. 

Apologies for this being longer, I just am not sure what I'm feeling, quite honestly this past few weeks I've had little urge to actually make the drive to visit, it feels like a waste of gas at times which makes me feel sick to my stomach to say.. and we don't really argue or fight at all, everyone around us thinks things are going great, but I just need guidance and wonder what my best course of action would be, appreciate anyone who's read this. ",How can I determine if I'm in the right relationship when I have doubts about my feelings and the impact of distance on our connection?,"The individual posting has been dating their current girlfriend for eight months and they live about an hour and a half apart, allowing them to see each other only once or twice a week.

1j4oxgh,I (26F) am not sure if I can continue my friendship with my best friend (35m) because of his new relationship.,"My (26F) best friend (35M), we will call him “Alex” and I have been very close friends for years. We met at work where we used to travel a lot together and basically just grew very used to each other and we started to do outside things like working on construction projects, drinking beers, just hanging around and sometimes just grabbing food and catching up now that we no longer work together. 

Throughout our entire friendship, it’s remained completely platonic on both sides. Both of us have gone through relationships and breakups and periods of being single together and neither of us have ever had romantic feelings for one another. We are both extremely open with each other and I’m confident that this would’ve been brought up if he had ever felt any different. 

Alex has gone through a couple of relationships where jealousy has been an issue and I’m unsure how I’ve been put into the middle of the issues previously as the girlfriends had never met me. 

However, tonight I was out for an event that was unexpectedly cancelled last minute that was near his house and he invited me over to hang out and catch up. We were talking about work in his garage as he was working on some random stuff. He got a phone call from his new girlfriend about 15 minutes into the visit who asked if his friend was still there and then she claimed that he told her that he’d told her that he’d talk to her after her appointment. Then she got upset because I was still there.  She knew beforehand that I was a female, which was the obvious issue. She wanted to know what we were doing which then led into her crying that it made her insecure that her partner was alone with another girl.. He kept telling her that if she wanted him to tell me to get the f**k out that he would, just to tell him. She wouldn’t, however I left anyways because I was extremely uncomfortable with the situation. 

He texted me to apologize and said that he’s just “attracted to crazy” and I basically told him that jealously and controlling ends with either cutting off our friendship or damaging his relationship and I wished him the best.

He asked me wtf I meant, but I haven’t been able to respond because I don’t feel like I’m in the best place to do so yet. 

I don’t want to be in that situation again nor do I want to be the reason his relationship suffers. I also don’t want to lose my best friend of several years and my only friend outside of my parter. I came home and discussed the whole situation with my fiancé and he’s just as much clueless on how he would proceed with the situation as I am. I feel almost disrespected that he said would kick me out if she told him to as if he would cut me off that easily anyways, but in the past he’s always made it clear to his partners that our friendship was not negotiable so I don’t really know. 

I just really need advice on how to handle this. Do I cut him off or try to stick around?",Should I cut off my friendship with my best friend if his new girlfriend is making me uncomfortable?,"The individual in the Reddit post is a 26-year-old female (referred to as ""I"" in the post) who has a close, platonic friendship with a 35-year-old male, referred to as ""Alex.""

The friendship has endured various relationship challenges, as both individuals have experienced romantic relationships, breakups, and periods of being single. Throughout their friendship, they have maintained clear boundaries, with neither developing romantic feelings for the other. They prioritize open communication, suggesting a level of trust and understanding in their friendship.

The individual is engaged, as mentioned by referring to their ""fiancé,"" indicating a stable relationship with their partner.

she messaged me afterwards and said that while she knew we were both nervous she had fun and that she thought we should get together again soon. i agreed. 

we exchanged a few snaps after the date and then over the weekend, then this past sunday i sent her a snap which she never opened. (we’re both in college so snapchat is our primary form of communication lol)

When we first started dating he was not addicted to zyns and then randomly picked the habit back up after months. For the past year I’ve been asking him to quit and he quit once for a few months and then started doing them again just recently. I’ve told him that I don’t want him to do them because he spends so much money on them, and I don’t want him to get cancer or develop other health issues because of them. He says he wants to quit too and is working on it, although I haven’t noticed his zyn use decreasing.

He left his zyns out on the kitchen counter when he came home from work, and I threw them in one of the kitchen drawers hoping he would forget about them for a little while and do less of them that night. He asked me where they were and I said I don’t know, but then told him I put them somewhere he could easily find. He freaked out going off on me, screaming at me, and saying that I was controlling and manipulative for hiding the zyns. He said he looked it up online and it is “coercive control” aka a form of abuse. 

Is that accurate? Is it really that bad to hide his zyns in an obvious spot? I honestly didn’t think it seemed very serious, but I’m confused now and concerned.

1j4oh6g,Where is this going? Guy I'm dating M30 and me F30,"I've matched with this guy on Hinge in early January of this year. We have texted every single day throughout the day, have spoken on the phone once, and Facetimed a few times (once to verify that we were who we said we were before our first date, and a few other time to watch a new tv series together for the first few episodes). So far, we've gone on 2 dates in January, and on a date for Valentine's day in February. All three dates were great and we seemed to really hit it off and have great chemistry. He even kissed me on Valentine's day for the first time. 

Since then, things have been really dry. To be fair, he got pretty sick the week after Valentine's day and still had a bad cough after that so he didn't want to see me or risk coughing on me and getting me sick. I understood and went with the flow, but since he's gotten better, the texting has been pretty dry, he'll send pictures of things he's been into like his shoe collection or what he's eating, and an occasional pic of his self, but he'll say good morning around noon, and will text very sparingly throughout the day. I feel like he's giving me updates on his day, but the conversation doesn't really go deeper unless I ask him questions to learn more about him. He'll answer the question, but again, won't go deeper and won't ask me much about myself. 

I haven't pressed for many dates because both of us have to travel an hour to get to a good midpoint for a date, but we are now moving into week 3 and he hasn't made mention of another date. He'll be out of town the weekend after this one so if we miss this weekend, it'll be 5 weeks before I would likely see him again and that's only semi-guaranteed because the weekend after he returns from his trip, I told him I'd treat him for his birthday. 

  
I feel like I've hinted pretty strongly via text a few times that I'd like to see him again and he says that he wants to see me too, but there doesn't seem to be any plan around him planning another date for us this weekend. I don't necessarily want to take the reigns and plan this date since we're so early and because what I'm treating him to will more than compensate the earlier dates he's taken me on. 

  
How do I say that I want/need to see him more if he's serious about what we have going on? I'm fairly certain that he's not talking to anyone else (you can never be 100% certain unless you ask and I haven't yet), but I feel like I come after everything and everyone else he has to engage with in his day. I don't want to come off as a brat, but I do feel that 3 dates in nearly 3 months of talking isn't enough to keep the spark alive. 

How can I turn this around without sounding whiny/nagging about it because I really like this guy and want to see where this could go, but I need more that sparse texts and hopes and dreams of a date in the future because my feelings are starting to fade a bit.

  
Also, early on, I told him that I was dating with intent to marry the right person and while we haven't pressed on that topic since  he said he was aligned and respected that before our first date. ","How do I express my need to see him more without sounding whiny or nagging, especially since I really like him and want to see where this could go?","The individual in the Reddit post has engaged in a series of romantic interactions with a person they matched with on Hinge.

1j4ogwv,How do I (32M) get over my ex (32F)?,"This is going to be a long story but I’ll still keep it as brief as possible. I met my ex back in 2014 and she was pregnant at the time. I came in and assumed the role of her boyfriend/childs father. I was there when the baby was born, I even cut the umbilical cord. We lasted for about 3 years and foolishly ended after a disagreement on how to raise the child. In hindsight, we were so young and foolish that if I had the situation now, I wouldn’t have ever walked away. We have remained connected through all of these years even while she got married a year after we separated and I eventually ended up married a few years later. Now currently we are both in relationships, I have children of my own but I have always continuously longed for that relationship. She has even been upset with me because we didn’t have any children together. Through the years she has stayed in contact with me in some shape or form when she doesn’t have to be and she would lead on that there would be possibilities for us to be together again. She was my true soul mate and the one I believe I was supposed to be with in the long run. She’s now living far away from me and has seemed to grown closer to her partner but I can’t help but feel like we should be together. She’ll occasionally reach out and she lets on as though she misses me but that she’s protecting herself from the unknown possibly? She even stays connected on all of my social platforms. I’m just so confused on what to do. Whenever I think about her, all of my feelings come back again. I don’t feel that I could ever fully commit to anyone else.

1j4o8xk,"My (21f) bf (21m) scared me last night, but did I take it too far?","
My bf and I have been dating for over 2 years and moved in together under a year ago. Some context about our relationship; he had /(has?) a porn addiction. I found out about it in late November of ‘24 so just a few months ago. I told him I could work with him on overcoming this addiction, because I expressed to him previously that porn was not going to be in this relationship. Anytime I ask how his ‘progress’ is going he seems irritated and just tells me he quit cold turkey so that I wont have to worry anymore. 

Well last night I took an edible, and this one started to make me feel a little paranoid but also in the mood. I started foreplay and don’t want to get into details but i looked up and saw he was covering his eyes with a blanket, this isn’t our usual thing so i asked him why he was covering his eyes. He told me that I ,yes ME, threw it on accident and it landed on his head ?? Idk if he forgot that I was high not drunk but he took it off and I went back at it. EXCEPT, I looked up again and he had his eyes covered again with my blanket. Like I said, I was paranoid and my thoughts were telling me that he was thinking of another girl or porn star doing this to him. So I got up again and asked why was he covering his eyes, this time saying that he wasn’t ? He was basically acting like I was stupid. So I got off him and said I was just going to sleep, and he didn’t ask if I was okay or if he did something wrong, all things he asks if I end our sessions early. He just went to his side of the bed.

This is where I think I may have taken it too far. As I’m laying down, I say out loud that he’s watching porn again. Never has this man ever raised his voice at me or gotten near me to scare me. But after I said that, he sat straight up and looked at me and in an angry tone asked what was I talking about. I’ll admit I was taken aback and was already starting to get anxious but I went ahead and commented on his response and saying that it was enough for me to know if he was or wasn’t, taking it far again. This is when he got up and yelled saying he was ‘tired of this shit’ and grabbed the blanket I was using and slammed the door as he was heading to the living room. I could hear him pacing around and saying ‘fuck this shit’. It was enough to scare our dog as well as she was laying next to me. He didn’t come into the room until the next morning because he was putting my breakfast on my desk and then left for work.

I kind of told myself it was all in my head since I took an edible, but as I’m waiting for him to come home I feel myself getting anxious again.

So that’s why I ask, did I push too much of his buttons? What do I say to him now if we sit down and have a conversation? would he be likely to get angry again? I don’t know how to bring it up without it feeling like I’m being too hard on him.

Then it got closer to winter and my depression crept back in and my bf doesn’t know how help bc our views are very different about mental health which started arguments and I decided to leave because I wanted to work on myself and my mental health. I ended things the second week of Jan.2024, then becoming friends with a coworker 22/M who understood mental health like me and we bonded over that. Then like 2 days after my break up I slept with that coworker as a rebound which eventually turned into us hanging out every day/ fuck buddies.

Coworker wanted me to abort and my bf said he’d be there for me no matter what and wanted to be apart of the babies life no matter who’s it is(we were still separated) 

Fast forward we are back together and things were going so good it felt like we never broke up until our daughter was born and she came back 99% the other guys… a bit more context ever since I was pregnant and gave birth I’ve been super angry/overreactive about everything, and because of that along with me “cheating”( my bfs words) he feels like I should treat him WAY better, I should “be kissing his ass” for him staying and being there after everything I put him through. It also makes him feel unappreciative. In the long run he asked for space and for me to work on myself/problems, be more appreciative and overall treat him better in return it’ll change how he treats me aka give me love, affection, attention anything you can think a bf does. I personally have admitted and apologized about all I did wrong, I even see where he’s coming from. I’ve tried being better it’s just hard bc it seems one sided like I’m putting in all the effort and get none back. I feel like if he says he loves me he should be able to show it.

We have been together for four years and are planning our wedding for later this year.

I am a more introverted person and tend not to express myself as readily.  I also tend to need more processing time, so cannot always contribute in an immediate way in conversation.  Additionally, I work as a secondary school teacher, so most of my working life tends to drain my social battery, leaving little leftover for my off hours.

My partner is very much the opposite - wears her heart on her sleeve and tends to have very big emotions.  I tend to be an empathetic person, so I often feel these feelings vicariously when they come up.  The flip side of this is that it often leaves me feeling as though there is only so much room for such emotions in the space that we share, so I sometimes suppress my own because it’s hard for me to feel like there is space for them.

Unfortunately, because of the way she was raised, this can make her feel like she isn’t getting the attention that she needs.  The way that I express myself and process also creates challenges around planning and engaging in day to day tasks, mostly to do with keeping the house running smoothly.

For a variety of reasons, I am a person who does well with lists, schedules, and detailed plans.  My partner prefers for there to be room for spontaneity.  They have also expressed a need for more verbal communication, which is not always a strong suit of mine.  My only real ideas so far are to have some kind of signal that indicates our individual capacities at any given time, or to schedule in time for specific topics/daily briefs/etc

🎓From the get go when we met during my sophomore year in college and her freshman year, I was searching for someone as enthusiastic about health and fitness as I am. I made this clear to her and she showed me photos and videos of her training in high school. She was a lot different from anyone I've dated before. She was different in personality (traits I was looking for at the time + ones I didn't consider) and physically (not really my type but attractive). I made it officially about 2 months into dating.

📆About 5 months in, I saw she was gaining weight. I mentioned we should exercise as I'd been falling off too. I sort of adopted some of her eating habits and gained about 30lbs over the course of the next 2 years while she gained about 80lbs. Along the way I made multiple efforts to let her know where our health was headed and tried influencing her to eat better and workout. It seemed to work for a couple days just for her to give up or skip gym a week or two at a time.

Into our 2️⃣second year together, out of nowhere, she stopped having sex with me. She would lead me on and when I was in the mood she would say ""next time"" for a whole month straight. 

She went through my phone and saw that I confessed to a friend about feeling tempted to cheat. She saw and I confessed and afterward things changed. She committed to having sex but later said it was because she was feeling guilty since we aren't married. But I was clear that that would be a dealbreaker for me.

About 8 months later, we moved in together and I was fully committed to my fitness journey. I lost 20lbs within the first year at the new apartment. I still made efforts to get her onboard but it didn't seem to be working. She'd try and give up again. She would also lie and hide that she'd been eating fast food.

To make matters worse she developed a habit of chewing and tonguing around with my penis when I was relaxing but would never commit to head. She had never given me oral sex without me asking or practically begging and when she tried, it was for about a minute at a time. Not only that but once she even made a grimace and said she was grossed out by bodily fluids. I had given her head voluntarily many times and she would even request it. I grew frustrated with this and started feeling trapped because we had moved in together this year.

A few months later with all these things going and after feeling ignored for months when it came to head, I was caught struggling with infidelity. I came clean when she saw but made it clear what was going on and how hard things were for me. I apologized and communicated that I'd understand if it just wasn't working for either of us. 

She insisted we could make things work and suggested we go to couple's therapy. I agreed to it.

We talked about everything. All of our conflicts. The sex, the infidelity, the weight gain and all. The therapist made it clear that we were both fair in our expectations as long as the other was willing to try and commit. We discussed how my mistakes have impacted her emotionally, so I vowed to never make the mistake again. The therapist also encouraged my girlfriend (at the time) to exercise with me and follow a diet since she was NOW OBESE.

I kept up my end of the bargain but waited endlessly for her to be consistent. A similar pattern continued for about 2 years. I convinced myself that I would end things if they didn't get better by summer of 24. She showed more commitment to the gym and was more consistent but it felt so late. Then she fell off again and didn't engage in dieting. 

She promised she would do better and convinced me to buy a house together. I held out hope and now we own a house back in Detroit. She finally showed commitment to the gym in about November shortly before our 5-year anniversary. She began eating more vegetables in about December.

She asked to stop having sex until marriage and I obliged back in October. She'd given me surprisingly good head one night shortly before this.

However, I recently caught her eating cake when she was sick with Covid. Last weekend when we were working out she asked me not to look at her and when I turned away she demanded I stop looking at her reflection on the TV (that I couldn't really see. Just her leg) and when I told her I wasn't she asked me to move away, so I reluctantly did. She pressed me saying it was a simple request and 
insisted I was trying to look. When I went to the kitchen to grab something she told me to stay there. The night ended with an argument when I told her she was being ridiculous.

I have felt less 🧪chemistry with her since then. I think this pushed me near the edge and I feel less attracted to her. We have also been engaged since November 29, so this feels really crazy to me. How could you want to marry someone but have such a big issue with them seeing you when you're working out together. I even suggested an alternative workout. When we talked about it all tonight she says I don't have to understand but that it shouldn't be a problem if she feels embarrassed for a moment and tried to compare it to me wanting privacy when using the bathroom.

She has been the breadwinner for the past year or so and I struggled a bit ago to find a new job after moving. I try not to let it affect my self-esteem (and mostly don't) but it doesn't exactly feel good not being able to provide for her comfortably. So I am grateful and acknowledge how valuable it is to have a woman who doesn't mind working or supporting me for a bit.

However, I've been waiting 5 years and she is just now losing 15 of the 80lbs she gained. I'm tired of dealing with the insecurity too. Physically I haven't been super attracted to her but this conflict and seeing her lack of confidence has turned me off even more. I feel like I'm wasting my time and am dealing with too much as is before our marriage. It's like she gets what she wants but I'm yet to get anything I was promised except for head once (and most shared values).

1j4o1m2,Has she (18F) changed? (19m),"A little while ago, I caught my girlfriend in a lie. She went to see a guy who took her to light show to talk about our relationship. We were going through a rough patch, with her feeling like I was using her just for sex and me going away to college. She eventually came clean with me about it, blocked him, and has been fully transparent with me since. Out of her own volition, she has sent me snaps of her going everywhere she goes, allows me to have her location, allows full access to her phone, and many other things. She said the reason why she hid the interactions she had with him is because she was scared of my reaction, fearing I would immediately break up with her if I found out. I told her beforehand that I did not have money for dates, and I wouldn’t be able to take her out, but I realize that it was my fault as well. I could have easily taken her out for a walk or something extremely cheap such as the park. She admitted that she felt deep down that she also went with him to the lights show because she felt starved for attention and he was eager to give it to her. She took responsibility for her actions, saying she knew she did something horrible and that she may be a horrible person, but she still loves me. It was a rough period, where she was still scared and hid the truth about details for two weeks, but as of now, everything is completely laid bare. He was the type of guy who actively brings down a relationship, no good and influencing her.She’s an innocent girl. I’m her 1st boyfriend, and she has no social awareness when it comes to flirting or anything of that sort. I’ve been with her since middle school, I know she’s socially behind. She told me she saw him with no romantic interest, and I believe her, because before she did this, she told me how much she hated the way he looked and acted in his free time. I’m not saying she’s forgiven for what she did, I still feel very hurt. It’s hard, today she offered to buy monster hunter world when I told her I wanted it. She has been a lot more sexually active with me( I’ve been a lot more active with dates).

For context we are Venezuelan, all of us, and if you know about the crisis here, you know migration is through the roof, and well, her ex bf in 2018 migrated to Peru all alone, without her, and those were though times for their relationship, and he eventually came back and took her with him back to Peru, after years there they had a son and returned to Venezuela, and they finally split here, because they kept on fighting and he had emotionally cheated on her texting other women and even having a crush on a coworker (he still didn't admit he cheated). While talking to him one day he said the grossest most sexist stuff about how she didn't care for his needs and how he felt uncared for and had to look for attention elsewhere, and while he admitted to me to not cheating (allegedly) when he took her with him, he admitted that he cheated on her in 2018, he said it was just sex and that it meant nothing to him, just to cover his manly needs, that it ""didn't affect"" his feelings for Lexi, and I've felt so grossed out ever since, this was a year ago when they returned. and I didn't say anything to protect her, as their breakup was very messy and I felt it wasn't my call to make.

But fast forward to the present, I've carried this secret for so long, and as of late, he has been manipulative with her and the care of their child, he steps all over her, puts excuses whenever he can, he has to be reminded to pay for the kid's stuff, one time he went on a date with a girl 10 years younger and spent the money that was for the child's medicine on that date to ""punish"" my friend, he gets mad at her social media posts about being single but he posts stuff about how great of a dad he is, and a long etcetera, and it honestly pisses me off and I wanna tell her, cause she is still behind him (even though she says she no longer wants him but still depends on him so much), I just want karma to come to him, it angers me that he's so manipulative with my friend and nothing happens.

1j4nyns,"I (31M) said that I think ""Men and Women think differently"". My wife (31F) said that was ""crimson red"".","A crimson red flag. I guess I can't put flag in the title.


We were talking about a therapy session we had earlier in the day. I hadn't restocked a food item when it was low, my wife noticed, restocked it, and commented that she feels like she carries the brunt of the mental load around the house. This is not the only time an issue like this has come up - this has come up with other food items, cleaning items, etc. I agree with her - she does carry the brunt of the mental load. I'm trying to get better about carrying my fair share, but I make mistakes sometimes.

Our therapist said he probably wouldn't have noticed and that he would venture to guess most men wouldn't notice. He also said that it's not about the bread, it's about feeling taken care of. I don't think he should have said he wouldn't have noticed, and I definitely think he shouldn't have said that most men probably wouldn't have noticed. Regardless of if that's true or not, I don't think a therapist should weigh in on that.

So we were talking about that and I said that I do think men and women tend to think differently. I said that society plays a disproportionate role in that, I acknowledged that that's unfair and that's not an excuse for my absent-mindedness, but at the end of the day I think that's true. I think it can be overcome, but i do think that's true.

My wife said that if this were a date, on hearing that, she would fake an emergency call and leave. She said that that's a crimson red flag and that she wishes she wasn't married to someone who thinks that.

What are your thoughts? Do you think men and women generally think differently? Is that a red flag? I didn't get an answer as to why she thinks that.

Editing to add from a comment of mine, because some people seem to appreciate the added context: 

As to the bread, some more context if it matters  - it was English muffins. We buy em from Costco so there's a lot of them at one time and just the two of us so we keep the packages we're not using in the freezer. I had noticed the thawed ones were running low, so I pulled a package from the freezer to thaw, but the following day I used an English muffin and left one remaining English muffin in a large Ziploc bag. The other thawed package remained unopened. So she used the last one, and noticed I didn't open th thawed package and restock the ziplock bag. That probably doesn't make a difference, but figured I might as well add some context just in case.",What are your thoughts on whether men and women generally think differently?

1j4nt0y,Am I(29F) expecting too much from my Fiancé (35M) as a farther or does he need to step up?,"We had our first child six months ago, and from day one, I’ve had little to no help. My fiancé and I both had fully paid leave for eight weeks after our daughter was born via C-section, yet he spent his days anywhere but with us. While on leave he never made a meal, barely attempted bottle-feeding (maybe three times total), never learned how to rock her to sleep, and hasn’t changed a diaper since the hospital. Occasionally, he’d bring home takeout if I wasn’t up for cooking, but that was the extent of his help.

Nothing has changed since he’s returned to work and I have remained home. I ask him to watch our daughter several times a week. He might spend an hour or two with our daughter throughout the course of a week, about 15–20 minutes max at a time, and this includes weekends. During that time, I’m trying to do some cleaning. We frequently argue about household chores. He thinks I need to “do more,” while I argue that I need help because I’m drowning. He insists it’s my problem to figure out.

I know being a SAHM is a privilege, but it’s also exhausting without help. I cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner six days a week (though I’ve stopped making his lunch most weekdays), handle all the dishes, grocery shopping, laundry, baby-proofing, furniture assembly, pet care, mopping, and clean the bathroom my baby and I use. My only “breaks” are during contact naps. Our daughter is a Velcro baby, wakes as soon as she is put down while sleeping, and wants to be in my arms all the time. Balancing everything while being responsive to her is hard. We sleep in separate rooms because his snoring wakes her, and since she’s up every 2 hours still, this setup makes it easier for me to maximize sleep. The only time I’ve been away from my baby for myself was a single three-hour period when my MIL watched her—because my fiancé couldn’t (or wouldn’t).

He provides financially—I appreciate that—but I’m completely overwhelmed. Like I said, I’ve asked for help, but he says that I have to figure it out on my own. He won’t do the dishes when he’s up hours before us, won’t get our daughter ready for bed so I can clean up after dinner, and won’t even give me an hour to exercise a few times a week. Instead, he lays in bed scrolling his phone after work, then complains about unfinished laundry or dishes, claims he’s not getting enough attention from me, or nags about all the other things that need to be done around the house while I’m in the middle of doing something else. Meanwhile, his only to-do list is doing whatever he pleases as long as he’s home, and when he’s feeling generous, he’ll vacuum. He won’t even take our daughter so I can have time to get ready on my own during the weekend.

I’ve been thinking about leaving for a while, but I keep questioning myself. I already feel like a single parent, and while leaving might be harder in some ways, at least I’d have one less person to take care of. Truthfully, I’m terrified of leaving since I don’t have an income, and I don’t want to take her away from her dad. I’m slowly draining my savings from loans I still have, I hated my career, and I deeply care about raising my baby at home until she starts school.

Am I expecting too much from him as a partner and father? Is this just how most men are? Am I being ungrateful or simply not doing enough?

1j4nrej,I (F24) have a crush on my coworker despite being in a serious relationship with my boyfriend (M26),"This is probably more of a question for a therapist than it is for Reddit, but I’m feeling such horrible guilt and this is a quick outlet😅🤪 I (F24) have been with my boyfriend (M26) for around 6 months, and I love him dearly. He is my future husband (godwilling) and I love him so much, I have never been loved like I have by him. He is perfect on paper and in practice, and I love him dearly. I truly cannot wait until we get engaged and get to plan a wedding and get to spend our lives together. 

However, recently, I’ve started working with this guy who is much older than me (M36) and I have a huge crush on him😔😔 he is so attractive and our entire coworker relationship has been incredibly flirtatious. I’ve read that crushes will pass, and especially since we won’t work together at all in the spring I thought it would go away, and there are a plethora of reasons it would never, ever work aside from the age gap.  I’m just really attracted to him, and I don’t know him well. I was the only person from my work he followed on Instagram, but he recently followed my female coworker (F26) who is recently single and I just really became so incredibly jealous and angry, and all of it just feels so, so awful because I love my boyfriend so much. 

Does anyone have any advice? Is it a bad sign for my relationship? Idk what I’m looking for, but if you have any thoughts on the matter please let me know. I feel like a horrible person, and simultaneously can’t stop feeling awful about my coworker getting closer with him. I’m feeling really crazy, it doesn’t make sense.

1j4nrai,I (25M) cheated on my wife (24F) because I was unsure and confused about my emotions. Any advice? Anything at all please,"So the title feels a little clickbaity but I'm not going to downplay what I did. At the end of the day, it was cheating.

Now with that said, I think some clarification is needed. I did not sleep with the other girl nor did I have any intentions of doing so. I took this girl out for dinner and that was all it was supposed to be. She didn't know I was married. She didn't know that the reason we were going on this date was so I could figure myself out in some sick and twisted way. The reason being is a little hard for me to find the words to explain (and I still don't fully understand my own logic that somehow made sense at the time) but I will try my best.

I know that I love my wife. So much. But I guess in that moment, I was questioning if that was true. And I basically was just going out to dinner with this girl to either validate or deny that doubt. That's the best way I can explain it right now, and it sounds insane and if more clarification is needed, I will try my best to provide it but that's the explanation right now.

Anyway, the moment the other girl got in my car, I knew I made a mistake. I knew what I was doing was wrong and stupid and any doubt I had about my wife and I's relationship was immediately thrown out the window. And I should have just called off the date there but I didn't. I don't know why. 

This girl and I go to dinner and I zoom back to her apartment to drop her off and just get to the end of it. This girl didn't live in the best part of town and she had to walk down this dark alley-way to get to the coded door to get inside her apartment building. So, being the moron I am, I walked this girl to the door. And that was when she kissed me. Then she went up to her apartment and I got back in my car and just sat there for a bit. I did a lot of reflecting and thinking and debating and the conclusion I came to was that I wasn't going to tell my wife about any of it and just let that night become lost in some random page of that chapter of life. And for a little while, that's exactly how it was.

Then while my wife and I were playing games, the other girl messaged my wife and basically told her everything that happened. However, the girl added two things to the story that didn't happen:

1. She told my wife that I wanted to sleep with her
2. She said that I told her about how I had just gotten out of a relationship

Neither of those things came up during dinner. I came clean to my wife and tried to explain myself, as if it really makes a difference when you've just found out that your person of four years has just cheated on you. I did tell my wife my reasoning why and how I never meant for it to be anything more than dinner. 

Of course, that sparked the perpetual trust issue spiral her and I have been cycling through the past few days because what I've said directly contradicts what the other girl lied about. Now my wife thinks our entire relationship has just been one big lie, which is valid but not the truth. She thinks that I'm only sorry because I got caught, not because of all the pain I've caused by doing this stupid thing. And she thinks that there have been other girls before this one, which isn't true. 

Which bring us to where this whole mess is now. I have since been staying with a friend of ours while she stays at the house. My wife goes back and forth about a million times a day between wanting me to just come comfort her and tell her that everything is going to be okay or just leaving me.

1j4noql,how do i (19f) get over him (20m)?,"so... i was in a play with this guy, i'll call him john doe, and at about week two i was down. bad. he has cool hobbies, he has great style (he paints his nails!!!), he's FUNNY, he's talented, he's in cool clubs, and is very physically attractive. one issue: he's 100% into another girl and they've been talking probably since i realized i like him

i've never had a genuine crush on somebody before and i know this one is finally real because when john doe first told me he was talking to this girl i felt genuinely upset instead of the crush just disappearing like it usually does when i like someone who gets in a relationship. i know for sure that i'll never be on his radar because his crush is in a different music/style subculture than i am and mine is... very different. i know that's a super limiting assumption but i just don't think there's any way this guy will ever like me back, even if he doesn't end up with this girl. (which he probably ((definitely)) will because we were at a party together and one of his crush's friends came over to me to ask if we were dating bc *his* crush likes him *back* and so now they're talking fr fr and... yeah)

i just need to get over this guy because i still hang out with him and i don't want to end up making him uncomfortable because idk how to act when i have a crush and i still really value him as a friend. i can't keep spending so much time distracted by the memory of that time we held hands and just *thinking about him*.

1j4niwn,my (25f) boyfriend (23m) accused me of making a ploy to catch him cheating ?,"Okay- this is a weird one. 
For context:
My boyfriend and I have been together for about 5ish months and he’s been awesome. However, I’ve been struggling with a lot of insecurity, and have needed reassurance about different things. Earlier this week my brain had been going crazy (I struggle a lot with intrusive thoughts and rumination), and I was having a lot of fear about being cheated on. So, I asked him “you aren’t cheating on me, right?” And of course he reassured me he could never and would never do that, and all was well. 

Fast forward to today, we are texting throughout the day and rehashing similar subject matter: insecurity on my end, etc.  I get off work and am texting him about how disgusting the beer I was drinking was, and he goes “Also crazy question did you have one of ur friends try to set me up :)”

I didn’t know what that meant, so I told him that. Turns out he had gotten an unsolicited nude from a random number. 

I had nothing to do with this but the timing is so uncanny based on me expressing insecurities about him cheating that of course to him it looks like I put someone up to this to “test” and see if he would cheat. I am crazy but I’m not ~that~crazy.  But it makes sense that he thinks I did it, because that’s what it DOES seem like. I just don’t know how to possibly prove to him that this was just the weirdest coincidence. 

Anyways, just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to proceed! This is very strange!

1j4ngbr,"I 21F don’t want my boyfriend 28M to vape or use it as gym motivation, how can I motivate him without him using vapes?","I know this may seem silly to some people, but I’m genuinely uncomfortable and it disheartens me to even think he’s vaping because he’s told me in the past that he doesn’t wanna do it anymore and to help him not vape, so for him to start vaping again makes me feel like a failure and I expressed that to him. This started when we went to London where he got his first vape after a while where he said it would only be one; well one led to three and he upped the dosage too I think (I’m not a vaper so I’m sorry if I’m not expressing this well, the vape thing was just bigger) and he promised me he would only have one more when we returned home so he can gradually quit again, but that wasn’t the case.

He’s a pretty big guy and he’s not comfortable with his weight and he’s wanting to slim down to at least function normally. He’s expressed this and I understand how he’s feeling, but I’m just so lost that he’s so persistent that he needs vaping to be his motivation because it’ll “make him less hungry” and it can be a “reward” every time he finishes working out. It makes me feel like he’s already becoming addicted to it even tho he’s reassured me that he can quit whenever he wants to cause he has before. I want to support him in a way that isn’t also harming him even if he says that his weight is harming him more than a vape will. My best friend told me vaping would only make it worse for him and there are healthier alternatives to lose and motivate yourself than vaping. 

I feel conflicted because he’s essentially telling me to suck it up and support him so he can be his best self, which is what I want more than anything, but I just don’t want him to be addicted or even use it cause it’s harmful. I hope I’m not overreacting or seeming controlling, that’s the last thing I want since I just want him to be healthy without vapes. He said he would want a healthier alternative too, but that we couldn’t come up with one and that he doesn’t want to put that pressure onto me to come up with a system for him.

I know he’s his own adult and can make his own decisions, but this definitely put a rift between our relationship even if he doesn’t seem to notice (or care cause sometimes it seems like he brushes it off? I’m not sure) and I won’t leave him over something like this cause I love him, but I definitely feel incredibly uncomfortable with this whole situation (that supposedly will last at least 2 months according to him.)

I hope this made sense and I can clarify if things didn’t make sense, I’m sorry if it’s jumbled up or all over the place, I just feel a little overwhelmed and sad right now and I just really need some advice.

TLDR: Boyfriend wants to vape to lose weight, I’m uncomfortable and I feel like it’s straining my relationship with him. Any advice on how to motivate him without any vapes?

1j4neue,30M/34M Is it time to leave?,"I 30M have been with my husband 34M for nearly 8 years and married for 5. He has a child (shared custody) from a previous relationship and we are going through an adoption of a young relative, so much of our relationship has involved parenting. We own a home together, co-own vehicles, and have a few dogs as well. We are both employed full-time and have very good careers, though I bring in about twice as much income (important for later).

Over the years, there have been many times I have felt unhappy and unsatisfied with our relationship, and I’ve voiced my concerns. I feel that responsibilities aren’t fairly shared, he lets things go forever (such as car maintenance, paying bills, etc), and whenever I try to have any discussion he gets defensive and turns the conversation around on me. These conversations always end up in tears and promises of change being made that are never fulfilled. Other than that, it has been pretty typical stuff: finances, lack of boundaries, parenting techniques.

Back in late 2023 I went through some major depression and starting seeing a psychiatrist and began medication. For a while, I thought my unhappiness could be attributed to the depression, but even after starting medication which was very successful, I still feel this constant voice in the back of my mind wondering why I haven’t left yet. 

Recently my family has started being vocal with me about how they feel I have changed. They say I haven’t been myself for a while, I seclude myself and don’t show up to a lot of events, I don’t call anyone, and they think that my spouse intentionally doesn’t give me money for bills as a way of “control”. Basically he will give me half of his paycheck for our bill account, but that barely covers his monthly car payment. I contribute 3x the amount to the bill account, which pays the mortgage, my car payment, and any other random bills that come up through the month. On top of this, he tends to spend from our shared account whenever he is able to.

I really need to keep pushing until the adoption is finalized. The relative we are adopting is from his side of the family, but I’ve been her parent for nearly 3 years and she has a stronger bond with me than him. My family also has a very strong bond with her and spends time with her as much as they can (whereas his family barely sees her at all). From there, I guess separation or divorce will happen and we will figure out custody together or in court. 

I have so many reservations because of how much we have invested together, but I also feel like I can’t continue to go through the motions everyday pretending I am happy in a relationship that I’m not. It affects so many other areas of my life outside of just the home. Im really anxious about figuring out what to do with the house, the pets, if I’ll have to pay the mortgage and go find an apartment, will I be able to afford that, etc.  

I’m wondering if anyone here has been through anything similar and can offer some advice or even just confirmation that things will eventually be somehow okay? This is something that is just bothering me day in and day out at this point and this is just an attempt to calm my brain a bit. Thanks in advance.

1j4ne8o,I (20M) may have gotten an STD from my gf (20F). How do I manage this situation?,"For some context, I’ve been dating this girl nearly three years now. We are currently in a long distance relationship as we both go to separate colleges. We are both in Greek life.

Yesterday, I began to feel a burning sensation down there. At first I thought it was a rare case of a male UTI. However, a close friend mentioned it could potentially be an STD. At first I had no doubt that it wasn’t an STD. My girlfriend was my first time and I haven’t ever cheated. My girlfriend has never shown any sign of cheating and we have great communication. She also always talks about wanting to get married to me and always asks me when I’m going to give her a ring. 

So I decided to go to the doctors today to get on antibiotics as fast as I could. But I tested negative for a UTI. That really only leaves one option being that I have an STD. And if I have an STD that means my girlfriend has to have cheated on me. 

My doctor sent an STD test out and a urine culture out. I’m not going to have results back until potentially Saturday. My girlfriend is visiting me this weekend and I’m going to see her Friday.

I really don’t know what to do here or what to even think. Is it guaranteed that she cheated on me if I test positive for an STD? If I test positive and she denies it do I have to assume she’s lying? I don’t want to think it’s possible for her to have cheated on me but I don’t know how I’ll have possibly gotten an STD if she hasn’t cheated on me.

I really don’t know what to do or think.

EDIT 1:
In the case that I test positive meaning she has cheated I honestly don’t know what to do. Half of my wardrobe has come from her. Nearly everything I own has some tie to her. I love her family and have a relationship with them. I have so many things from her and of her. I have spring break plans with her and am currently signed up to go to her sororities formal with her. And in all honesty I’m worried for her mental health if we potentially broke up. I just don’t know how I’d manage a break up. 

I do plan to wait until results to even discuss anything with her but I don’t know what to think in the meantime. I haven’t told her about my symptoms but I did tell her I got a UTI test.

1j4n5tt,Me (M19) confused about how to handle recent conversations with my gf (F18),"For context my girlfriend and I have been together for a little over a year and all has been good. Then recently since we've been a bit apart because of school I've felt like things have changed. I've become a very busy person joining new things to keep myself busy and I am also a very social outgoing type. My girlfriend on the other hand is very okay with staying in all day and what not. All of this never seemed like a problem until recently
It started about a month ago when we were just hanging out doing coupley things. We were just being stupid poking at eachother when all of the sudden she yells out ""r*pe"". This completely caught me off guard and I sorta went still... and yes I get it people can make bad jokes and I think thats okay but then noticing that im uncomfortable says ""what you cant take a joke?"" Call me crazy but thats a little wild.
The next example was only recently. We got into a huge fued over text about her being home on a week I was super busy and how we weren't able to see eachother more than once. The one part that stuck with me was she was most upset that even thought she knew i was busy she wanted me to tell her I'm really upset. Now maybe its just me but I always try to be positive and think ""glass half full"" so thats how I said it to her. That argument was the worst and has kept my head in a spiral.
It has come up a couple times because we've been trying to resolve it but anytime I bring up these points because of how much they upset me she accuses me of bringing stuff up.

Even saying I view relationships like a disney movie and that he is more of a free spirit who doesnt like to plan alot when I told him I like when men take inititive and plan. This actually really hurt me as I believe I have a pure/traditional way of thinking about relationships and love but nothing unrealistic. 

we actually had a small argument about him not wanting to plan things and that anytime I pushed for him to basically care more he would just say thats not him and he isnt like this he doesnt know what to tell me. It was hard for me to hear also made me feel like embarresed as I felt like often times it would make me sound like I was begging him or that I was just not good enough for him to want to do these things.  He is more non chalant whereas im more serious but we also arent officially dating . He does spend alot of time talking to me though which i enjoy as well

I havent had many relationships in my life and the men I have dated/been on dates with are usually a certain type men who are into showing off their wealth and not very romantic

I actually am really put off these types of men but they seem to like me since im super traditional.

I however have always prefered the more romantic type of relationships as my love language is acts of service and words of affirmation rather than tanglible material gifts. 

this man im writing about he actually is an incredibly gifted poet and writes beautifully. He 
would show me his work and then once even wrote a poem for me. It was the most meaningful gift a man gave me. I have been given material gifts from men before but  nothing special to me in the way this poem made me feel.

 He also has such an admirable job in healthcare and I can listen to him talk about his work for hours he is so smart and impresses me everytime. I honestly feel proud knowing someone that intelligent. 

as well as hes handsome and has so many cute personality traits i really love about him


 we actually met online not through dating apps but just an online forum for somthing completely unrelated and just kinda hit it off.  He has stated he would have a relationship with me but makes it seem like I should not have any expectations of him.  

just as side note he is not the type to use women he is really honest and Im not worried about him in that regard. He has even told me in the past he knows I deserve better than him.

They self-identify as having a traditional view on relationships, preferring romantic gestures and valuing acts of service and words of affirmation over tangible gifts.

Their love language is mentioned, highlighting their desire for deeper emotional connections rather than superficial displays of wealth. They are currently interested in a man who is a skilled poet and works in healthcare, describing him as intelligent, handsome, and possessing endearing personality traits that they admire. The relationship dynamic is complicated by the fact that they are not officially dating, and although he expresses a willingness to have a relationship, he suggests they should not have any expectations of each other.

The individual feels embarrassed about their needs in the relationship, perceiving their desire for planning and initiative as begging or a sign of inadequacy. They also note a contrast in personalities between themselves and the man, with him being more carefree and nonchalant compared to their serious demeanor. Overall, the individual's background reflects a desire for a romantic relationship that aligns with their traditional views, yet they struggle with the current situation and the man's attitude towards relationship dynamics.","The person is experiencing emotional conflict and uncertainty regarding their relationship with a man who has a different approach to romance and planning, leading to feelings of hurt and inadequacy.",late 20s,female,single,healthcare professional,middle class,The person has a healthy health status.,not specified,the person is likely feeling insecure and experiencing low self-esteem.,no,hurt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j4n56b/27f_the_man_i_like_m33_said_my_standards_are_too/,relationship_advice
1j4n41j,Girlfriend can't orgasm with me M30 F30,"Me M30 and my girlfriend F30 have been together for almost one year. We have a nice relationship and have good sex. However! One issue we have had since day one is that my girlfriend has never once orgasmed with me. Believe me I have tried everything under the sun except toys and things like that. What really makes me feel inadequate is that she once told me she had a squirting orgasm in the past with a previous partner, claiming that he was super aggressive but it worked!! This is just one example she told me about, I don't know about other partners she's been with. This has been weighing on my mind heavily, as I just don't feel like the best. 

We had a discussion about this months back in which she told me that she has been ""holding back on orgasms"" as not to get attached to me. But months later after we made things official it has never happened and doesn't seem any closer. 

She claims she has no issue at all with this and it doesn't bother her one bit, but for me the relationship or sex just doesn't feel complete. I'm lacking the sense of validation that I need and crave. I'm so hesitant to bring this up with her again as I hate to put pressure on her or make it a ""thing"" as I feel that won't work. I feel stuck! I would hate to end a relationship because of this issue but I don't know how long I can cope with the fact she can't orgasm with me but has done in the past with someone else. 

I feel something like this should happen naturally without the need for major and drastic interventions. Call me selfish, but no matter how hard I try to convince myself to put my ego and pride aside I just can't! I need validation. I'm a bit down and confused right now, any advice or guidance from ppl who have experienced something this in the past? 🙂","How can I approach the topic of my girlfriend not orgasming with me without putting pressure on her, while also addressing my feelings of inadequacy and need for validation?","The individual is a 30-year-old male who has been in a relationship with his 30-year-old girlfriend for almost a year.

The couple had a prior discussion where the girlfriend mentioned she has been ""holding back on orgasms"" to avoid becoming too attached, but despite their relationship becoming official, the situation has not improved. The individual feels that the sexual relationship lacks completeness and expresses a need for validation, feeling confused and unsure about how to approach the topic with his girlfriend again without applying pressure.

1j4n3jq,"My gf 25F says she doesn’t want a relationship anymore, I am 28M","My gf 25F and I, 28M have been together since April last year and over time we started liking each other and started dating too. We have had a lot of disagreements over these months that turned into fights but we always found a solution. 

She had a rough childhood and that has impacted her a lot but now everything that happens in her life or is happening she says that I don’t care about her. Some of the problems only require patience because that’s the best we can do imo. Recently, after our last fight she decided she doesn’t want to have a relationship and rather focus on herself more and not to depend on others, which to me is understandable but every time i say something sweet to her she says that i’m forcing her. “i can’t do all of this”. she doesn’t take much part in the conversation anymore either and only sends on word and time to time we have convos but in that convo if i say something small that she doesn’t like she starts lashing out on me that how can i say that or how can I not care about her life and situation. 

i feel like she just wants me to tip toe around her situation after she dumped all her trauma on me, i always say that everything is fixable and we can change how you feel but she mentions i’m forcing her. but she still gives me time, waits for my texts and basically do everything we did in our relationship but doesn’t want it to be called a relationship? she now hates when i call her cute names which isn’t understandable to me. 

i want to ask that is she getting attention from somewhere else because at some times she goes on ignoring my texts for hours and if i question her then she says how she’s working and how I should know this and that. The whole situation is that I now have to be very careful about what to say and what not to say. if I feel something that I want to share she also says that “here we go again” but I just want validation and confrontation about if she’s still willing to be with me despite whatever is going on.

The girlfriend has experienced a rough childhood, which has significantly impacted her current behavior and outlook on their relationship. Recently, she expressed a desire to focus on herself and not depend on others, indicating a potential struggle with emotional dependency. This change in her approach to the relationship has led to a decrease in communication and a feeling of emotional distance.

The poster feels that the girlfriend wants him to be overly cautious in their interactions, as she tends to react negatively to seemingly small comments or expressions of affection. He points out that while she still engages with him in some ways, she has become sensitive to terms of endearment that she previously accepted. Furthermore, he is concerned about her attention possibly being diverted elsewhere, as she sometimes takes hours to respond to his messages, citing work as an excuse.

Now he is insinuating that I should bring porporri (a spray that cancels any smell before you poop) to his house. That made me feel really ashamed.

1j4mw1h,I (19F) just found out my boyfriend (19M) uses 4chan. Is this cause for concern?,"Just recently I was looking something up on my bf's phone when I saw that one of his bookmarks was to 4chan. I admittedly have never used the site but from what I have heard it is a place full of extreme racism and misogyny. I confronted him about this and his response was basically ""I didn't think it was a big deal"". I asked why he used the site in the first place and he told me that it was a good place to talk about his hobbies and he liked the anonymity. I didn't buy that answer though since he could use twitter or reddit and been anonymous too. Plus, in hindsight, I know he was intentionally hiding it from me. I used to ask him what he was looking at on his phone and he'd often give me a vague or joke answer. He doesn't use any other social media either, which I always thought was strange until now. 

I honestly don't know what to think now. I never thought he was a racist, he has made a few *iffy* remarks, but he's generally very left leaning. I just don't know if I feel comfortable with him using that website, especially as a brown woman myself. And the fact he was hiding it from me this whole time just makes me think that he really does have some hidden beliefs and thoughts that he uses 4chan to air out.

So it started from a Reddit dm, i recently started Reddit 2months so when i was looking for someone to chat i found this girl who commented on a Nsfw post so i dmd her to chat and since i was new i was shocked to know people do nsfw stuff here so i was in heat and sent many girls dm (me being single and virgin since birth) but with this girl the chat suddenly shifted from nsfw to normal daily life chatting and we talked about our mental issues the things we like the difference im culture and our countries im from delhi india and she’s from minnesota us.. i never thought i would be talking to a girl random stuff and she actually listens and cares she told me about her toxic past and difficult childhood and her mental issues and i found her personality attractive for what she told and seemed to me i was flirting with her on daily basis then one day she said “you’re actively trying to hit on me but im not ready for any relationships rn” i was sad but Thats ok and we just talked normally but i was liking
Her more and more every day so i was flirting whenever i got chance its been close to a month 
She said she likes talking to me
Then she said im her friend she don’t mind listening to me yapping and asking questions
Then recently we chatted for fukin 12 hrs straight and things were so intense she had trust issue so was opening up little by little and she said people leave me so i was trying my best to not be like other people….  I was chatting normally but suddenly she started flirting and all i told her i don’t want her to date some other guy just cuz of the distance then she told me she likes me and would have dated me or fwb if i was there i scolded her for saying fwb that she should value herself more … i said it wont be a problem and convinced her but then she said my parents will be the problem I’ll get berated for dating and marrying girl like her (and yes i told her that I’ll date and marry one girl which is true i mean it) i said they wont and explained why then she said she’s the problem not me, she started abusing herself “I’m a white whore” i will hurt you i dont deserve you I’m too kind and nice but i said i want you and you shouldn’t call yourself a whore and you deserve me im just a average guy i am no special which is true but then we had long debate on why i want her but she kept pushing me and after some time she started telling me more about her past her dark past Thats she’s not mentally stable she’s suicidal and have anger issues.. almost killed herself once … Is scared of hurting people again cuz one of her past relationship (she said she cut her wrists artery once and almost died and the marks of
Her cutting herself over guilt are there and also said some stuff i cant talk about here) i accepted her got just a little backed up for a second and i told her that exactly what i was feeling cuz i don’t wanna lie a bit….then after that she started being quite over my confessions and been dodging my love and affection 

So what am i supposed to deduce from this

I can’t help but think that shes just scared of loosing me as a friend so she’s not rejecting me Or what i don’t wanna believe is she’s like other girls who just likes attention (i don’t think this she’s like that)


I just want to be with her and want to give her lots of love and affection and want the same in back is that too much? 
I keep saying i want her and please accept me as her man but she don’t reply to such messages and tries to dodge them now
And if i say i only want you she just said dont you have more good people and that i should have someone else to if she dies cuz of her suicidal attempts i said just don’t die think about me i worry and care for you

Then after some time she says can we be normal now i am not ready for many things
I said im okay if she wants thing slow but i cant hide my feelings


But its been so hard for me i cant keep up like this

As of last week he let me know this was because he and a mutual friend of ours have romantic feelings for each other. 

I want to be open minded towards this part of him because it genuinely has nothing to do with me or my status as a partner. Despite that, I can't help but feel insecure and angry. I am currently away for my Junior year of college and am aware that he's spending time with this person while I'm away.

My ex and I broke up like 2 months ago, we decided to end it mutually after a 5 year relationship because our vision was not matching. 

Just 6 weeks after breaking up my ex got into an accident, she broke her ankle and her strong arm, I helped her whatever way I could, assisting her with her insurance (as she had never used it before and I had experience) visited her 3 times and stayed over one night with her. 

I was feeling so confused again, because spending so much time with her reminded me of how much I love and care about her, I love her company, her voice and laughter. 

Anyway I last saw her on Sunday, the day before her discharge, I was planning on visiting her at her place on Saturday just to check on her and give her some goodies to pass the time, and also tell her that we should continue no contact, as we were before the accident as our break up is still too fresh and our context hasn’t really changed. 

Well today we were chatting and she told me that they just found out that her mom has a tumor, a cervical tumor, they don’t know if it’s malignant or benign, but obviously it’s scary as fuck. 

And I’m sitting here thinking about what to do, I love this girl, and I know how scared she is, probably her biggest fear is her mom passing away. 

I don’t know if I should try to help her as a friend, or more than a friend, or what. 

Fuck I’m so confused and want to help her but at the same time, one of the reasons I decided to break it up was because I needed more time for my projects.

I’ve been struggling with this decision for months, and I need outside perspectives to help me see if I’m being fair or delusional.

She’s supported me through my flaws, made me feel safe, and worked hard to grow alongside me. After a breakup last October, we reconciled, and they’ve improved in so many ways—less controlling, more mature, independent. But I don’t feel in love anymore. At first, I thought it was a phase. After Valentine’s Day and my birthday, I kept waiting for the spark to return. It didn’t. I care about them deeply as a person, but it feels more like empathy than love.

I feel apathy, even contempt, when they exceed expectations—which she always does. We have different goals, mindsets, and ways of processing emotions. I don’t feel understood by them, and I don’t fully understand them either. It’s not just personality differences—it feels like we’re not meant to be partners.  I strung her along, thinking my feelings would change if they “proved themselves.” That was wrong. She shouldn’t have to earn love. She deserves someone who accepts them as they are *now*, not someone waiting for a switch to flip.  She looks at me with so much love, but I don’t feel the same. She deserves someone who’s all-in - mentally, emotionally, spiritually. I’m not that person.  I’ve tried compromising on things I didn’t want to do and buying her really expensive gifts, trying and giving and honest effort and being patient with her but it’s been over a year now. I’m just reflecting on whether this is just a “rough patch” or the actual end of our relationship 

But even after all that, I feel nothing. Worse, I resent them for not being “enough,” even though she’s given everything.  She’s the first partner who’s treated me well. Am I self-sabotaging?  Am I mistaking comfort for incompatibility?  Is fair to end things when they’ve done nothing “wrong”?  Am I justified in ending things, or am I overlooking something?  Could this be fear of commitment, or is it genuine incompatibility? Please be brutally honest.

TL;DR: I’m ending a relationship with someone who’s done everything right because I don’t feel love anymore—just apathy and resentment. I think they deserve better, but I’m terrified I’m making a mistake.

I have been single for a while and she is in a friends with benefits type of deal.

My feelings for her have grown the past year of so, I did always think she was a very attractive woman but always pushed those thoughts aside as I felt the age gap was too much and the friend dynamic was complicated, my (22) daughter knows her very well too and there have been times where the 2 of them hang out and occasions when the 3 of us hang out together.

We have a few times cuddled up on the couch together with a few drinks and a movie night and I’ve stayed over at hers at the same point with both of us falling asleep together on the couch and to me it just felt right.

Any advice on how to handle these feelings? I’ve suffered through trauma so I’d appreciate some grace. 

When I have found out that the guy I’m interested in is taken or not into me, I’ll feel a little pang of jealousy or sadness, and then get over it after awhile. I’ve never been a homewrecker, nor do I tell them, I’m sad or jealous. 

But I’ve recently come to find that there is one guy in particular, that I’ve liked, but the feelings of sadness or jealousy have never been there. His name is Zack. 

Zack is a great person, but he eventually wants to move further south-to a warmer state. Ever since I’ve met him, I’ve always found myself just naturally supportive of him and anything he wants to do. I like him, but I’ve never once been sad that he wants to move away. I’ve come to the realization that I’m living my dream right now, and he has to go live his. However that looks for him. 

I don’t want to go with Zack because I want to stay close to my family. 

I’ve never had that feeling with any guy but Zack. It’s like a switch was flipped with him. And I realized that tonight while I was rejected by a different guy.

1j4mkb3,I (29M) don’t know what to do with my relationship (24F) crisis,"Hello, I would need some advice on how to act with my relationship. 
For some context, I was with my girlfriend for a few months, and then we broke up for the first time in January. At this time we broke up because we had some fight about some things we didn't like about each others (she was too controlling according to me and didn’t like me to go out on fridays with my friends untill late : fyi late is 2AM). But then I reached out to her again in February, and after talking a bit and seeing that we missed each others, we decided to see and meet again in February.

We met the first time and decided not to talk about serious things yet, because we just wanted to have some good time together for one weekend, but planned on meeting a second time the next week to discuss serious things. Then we talked again for the whole week, and the day before meeting the second time, she cancelled saying that she didn't have the confidence to see me again because she doesn't want to get hurt again, because she got hurt the first time when we broke up in January and she knows I won’t change. I reassured her by saying that I understood everything and I don’t even go out anymore because my life changed and I did too.

But because I knew that some feelings were still here, I decided to surprise her and go to near her place to pick her up. That's when she agreed to meet me and we spent the whole weekend together. Everything went well and we were happy, but when we talked about the future, she said she didn't know if she wanted to get back to me yet, that we should have met right after the first breakup and not 1 month after. Also, for information, she has been in kind of burnout from work and stressed/not happy with her life since the end of January to the point that she even stopped working for one full month, even if it's a family company.

Anyways, she told me that she was happy with me, and she really liked me, but she wanted to meet me later, maybe for Cherry Blossom in April. So I kinda told her that I could wait, but not too much, because I'm suffering also from the situation. Anyways, after the weekend, she sent me those two messages, and now I don't really know what to think :

1. I ate well at home and had a lot of fun. But still, the happiest moments for me were always when I was with you. I was always happy when I was with you. Thank you. Please wait for me just a little bit. I’m having a really hard time right now. Yesterday, I was so happy, but at the same time, I was also really sad. ㅠㅠ

2. I know that our situation is difficult for everyone. But for me, all of this feels a bit overwhelming. I need to take some time to sort things out again. I’ll reach out after that. I’m sure you can live a better life in Korea, and even if you go back to France, I believe you can live happily there too.
(For context I am a french living in Korea and my gf is Korean, those messages are translated from Korean)

The first message seems hopeful but the second one doesn’t make me optimistic at all and kinda seems like a way to end up things without saying it.. even if when we broke up the first time, she also clearly said « let’s break up » and didn’t try to make things seem sweat. So why would she do it this this time ?
I feel like her head is kinda messy right now, because she said so many things but at the same time said she liked me and doesn’t wanna lose me … i really don’t know what to think.

Since then, I tried to send her two messages, but I only had like dry answers or no answer from the last message. 

I am kinda confused right now on how to act, maybe leave some time and reach out later ? Or just give up on it, even if I really like her ..
Thank you for your advices :)

1j4mitb,I (19M) broke up with my gf (26F) and I’m scared I’ll regret it,"I’m going to start off with a request not to judge the age difference between me and my partner. She’s American, I’m European (Polish) and I’ve always found Americans my age much less mature than my peers back home so choosing to date outside my age range was perfectly comfortable with me, especially since we are both consenting adults. 
I broke up with my long distance girlfriend 6 days ago. Nobody has given and shown me as much love as she has. So far it’s been up and down; feeling good half the time and sad and guilty the other half. Feels like my heart still loves her but my brain is telling me to let go. It hasn’t been very long since it happened but I am scared it’s something I’ll regret. She loved me so much, begged me not to do it and yet I remained stone cold. I hated hurting her, and now it seems like my feelings are in a constant battle with my thoughts. I broke up with her because of our different goals, she wanted everything too quickly for me (as I am younger). I broke up with her because of her toxic traits, her outbursts whenever I would bring an issue up. But most importantly, I broke up with her due to her addiction issues. There were nights where she wouldn’t respond all night leaving me scared for her life and unable to sleep. There was no way of knowing if she was cheating or just too focused on getting fucked up and high. The day I left her she confided in me, texted me that she relapsed again, that she wants to end her life, and went to the hospital to find help. However at the moment I was tired of the stress and constant pain that I would get because of her actions. At first she was angry, then she begged me to stay. I do not know if it was genuine or if it was an attempt at manipulation. Either way it made me feel horrible about what I’ve done. I don’t know if what I did is going to bring me satisfaction from life, or if it will leave me in pain and longing for her warm embrace and beautiful body. She kept telling me she’ll change and work on herself but I didn’t buy it. But now that she is getting the help she needs, I don’t know if I was right to act so quickly. Everyone around me is telling me I did the right decision but they haven’t seen all the good things she’s done for me as well. Whenever I try to balance out the bad and the good it comes down to a 50/50 split. Could we have fixed all the bad things by communicating more effectively? Could we have pushed through this hard time? Should have I stayed committed to our love and relationship? These are the questions that stay on mind 24/7. Maybe it’s just not the right time for me, I’m a sophomore in college, and should focus on my mechanical engineering degree without the stress and dedication that a long distance relationship requires. But on the other hand, the stability of the relationship and hope for the future is what kept me focused and motivated. I am so torn and do not know what to do.

1j4mgm6,UPDATE: My (39M) now ex-wife (38F) was indeed cheating on me.,"As outlined a few years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10oartd/i_think_i_37m_need_to_divorce_my_wife_36f_but_i/

I suspected my (39M) now ex-wife (38F) was cheating with me. I was right. 

We are now divorced. As it turns out she had been cheating for a while, even before the move. The move and COVID just made it more obvious to me because we were spending much more time together. 

She was in fact having an affair with the wife of the colleague, and the colleague, but neither of them knew about the affair with the other. They're now divorced too.

But she'd been having affairs with other people long before, and despite that she's told everyone that we broke up because she realised she is gay, she had in fact been sleeping with other people too (men and women).

The straw that broke the camel's back was a call while she was back east visiting family that she had 'met someone' while she was there and wasn't coming back. What I know now is that 'met someone' actually meant she'd met them online and concocted a trip with her sister (who is on an amateur sports team with the affair partner), to see her more. I've since heard from people she knows that she only decided to end our relationship because she caught herpes from that AP, and her cheating would have become obvious if she came home. 

As I said, we're now divorced, and after a few rocky relationships I've now reconnected with a girl i first dated when we were teenagers. We have a dog and will be moving in together within the next few months, with the aim to starting a family.

I couldn't update until now while legal processes were proceeding, but happy to take any questions now if anyone has them?

1j4mfiw,How to tell my boyfriend (24M) that I (23F) am upset about him lying about his relationship with another girl (24F) in the past?,"I 23F have been dating my boyfriend 24M since June 2024. 
We started casually dating and over the time got serious. I met him when I joined the institution where he was studying at and at that time he was single.

The problem:

Incident 1: He had a classmate, 24F ""Susan"" ,whom he had a crush on for a year before he met me. She had left the institution to do a one-year project abroad and he took a gap year and their communication ceased. During this time, we started hanging out and had our first kiss in June 2024. The day after our first kiss, BF and I were having dinner ,when out of the blue he spotted her. Susan had came back to collect her degree. He just abruptly left the table mid-conversation, went to her and came back all smiling. He told me that he had asked Susan out for coffee and was planning to confess to her about his ""past feelings"", which he had no more. I felt bad because we were just having ""the talk"" about making things serious 5 minutes ago and now he had asked Susan out on a coffee. I didn't say anything at that time but it stung. They went out for a coffee date the next day and after he came back he told me that he couldn't confess to Susan. I guessed he just chickened out. After this she went back to her home and they didn't talk and we eventually got exclusive.

Incident 2: I had completely forgotten about Susan and our relationship was going better than ever. Then he went home on a break for 20 days in December 2024 and the day he came back he was showing me something on Instagram when I saw that his top search was Susan. I felt weird and confronted him. He pretended to forget why he had searched her and then gave me a half assed explanation about viewing her story. He then told me that he'll unfollow her ""if I wanted"" and I said yes. He wasn't too pleased about it.

Incident 3: In February 2025, Susan came to the campus for a day to attend a sports event. I was with him when we crossed paths with her all of a sudden. He introduced me to her as his girlfriend but was very awkward in front of us. Later he told me that he wanted to make her jealous by showing me off and this statement rubbed me the wrong way. I told him to inform me if Susan contacts him during her stay in the campus and he got angry and called me ""controlling"".

Incident 4: When I had asked him about his relationship with Susan, he told me that he had a crush on her in 2020 during the pandemic, when they had classes online and they used to text each other. When they finally met in 2022, his crush had faded away and he didn't care about her anymore. I had naively believed in him ,until I discovered their chats yesterday. He gave me his phone to play a game as mine was down and jokingly said that I can check his chats. Then he went to take shower. My curiosity got the better of me and I read his chats with Susan. 
He used to relentlessly text her till December 2023 and flirt with her. He always told me that I'm the first woman that he has asked out for walks/movie nights and I saw that it was a blatant lie. He used to ask her out for movie nights at his room, call her to have dinner together and ask her out for walks. She had ignored all his advances. 

The part that hurt the most was that he used to save food for Susan and wait for her in the dining hall even when she refused to come.  He never did these for me during our initial days. I was the one who always made plans, called him, waited for him and he used to ignore my plans. He said cheesy things to her about her smile being the most beautiful and all that although he proudly told me that I'm the first woman that he has said all these to.

Now I am hurt, not because of his past, but because of his lies and his attitude around her. Our relationship is really good now and he does everything for me but I just feel like a second option. He also doesn't talk to Susan anymore. I don't want to destroy my relationship over this seemingly insignificant thing but I can't seem to get it out of my head. And he also gets defensive and dismissive when I bring up Susan. I asked him today about Susan again and gave him a chance to set the record straight but he again lied to me about the timeline. I didn't tell him that I had read their chats.

Please advise me on how to approach this topic with him and move forward from this.",How can I approach my boyfriend about my feelings regarding his past with another girl without damaging our relationship?,"The individual in crisis is a 23-year-old female (23F) who has been dating her boyfriend, a 24-year-old male (24M), since June 2024.

She has experienced a series of incidents related to her boyfriend's past feelings for a classmate named Susan, who he had a crush on for a year before meeting her. This occurred during a time when he was single, and Susan was away for a one-year project, allowing him to start dating her. 

The timeline indicates that their relationship began to develop in June 2024, following their first kiss. The dynamics of their relationship have been complicated by his past crush on Susan, which resurfaced when he surprised her during a dinner shortly after their first kiss.

I've been trying to get in contact with her on every social possible however she just ends up blocking me. I have a lot mental issues and these past few days have been real difficult for me since I still do deeply love her. And im so used to spending every night on call and talking to eachother throughout the day watching movies etc. Im just overall not handling it very well, I feel so empty and im desperate to just talk to her or get back together. But I never have the chance to even try too. And what makes it worse 2 days ago I found out shes been talking to her shitty ex. Which just made me break down and collapse even more. I dont know how to handle this I just want it to go back to normal. I honestly don't think I'll be able to move on its something I've been so used too, and especially the fact we met at a younger age. Is there honestly any tips or advice or anything to help deal with it or distract myself no matter what I do to try and distract myself I just end up thinking about it and getting real stressed or breaking down. I just wish we at least broke up slowly or just slowly distanced ourselves, but it was just one day were fine the next blocked on everything. And with no way to communicate, the only thing I got was an email saying dont contact me or I'll call the police. And since then I haven't.

1j4mbin,"How can I (M18) manage personal goals, with time for the relationship (F19)?","Hello everyone,

So to be quick and short I have this relationship of like around a year and imma be honest, I have a lot of stuff on my life. Problematic family, I take pills for the depression and I never feel enough. All those feelings have kinda led me to being kinda obsessed with trying to at least look better so I can be worth some love. Emotional stuff aside, basically my gf thinks that I just simply go too much to the gym and I do it 4x week (Exactly the days we see each other at the university) so we basically never go out unless it’s a lucky weekend (she works on weekends so it’s rare). And I really don’t know what to do.

It’s either stop going to the gym as much and look miserable not only for myself but for her too (Because I think that physique actually matters and tbh even if I look kinda athletic I’m just not that pretty, but she is).

OR go more to the gym, look better instead of going out with her the times we have the chance because our uni schedule is kinda tight.

I know it’s a really stupid question and I’m probably on the wrong but it’s just, complicated at least from my weird perspective I guess because well, she says I look good enough but if I stop going to the gym then I’m gonna lose everything and I’ll just, suck again, even more than I already do.

Any advice is highly appreciated :), please read and sorry for the long text

1j4mb1l,Argument between me [29 F] and my partner [33 MTF] re: car sharing,"Hey Reddit, I need some outside perspectives on an issue with my partner.

My partner (33MTF) of five years and I (29F) have shared ownership of our car, and I make all the payments while she’s currently unemployed. I’ve been using the car for work since I’m the one paying for it. She’s now looking for a job and says that if she gets one that’s farther from home than mine, she deserves to have the car to commute with. She absolutely refuses to take the bus, even though I’ve done it for years and a lot of people in our city rely on public transit because it’s more affordable than owning a car.

Here’s the problem: I’m still covering 100% of the car payments and I don’t want to give up the car while still paying for it. My driving commute is about 10 minutes, but if I took the bus it would take about 35 minutes. On the other hand, if she took the bus, it would likely be a much longer commute. With her current work capacity (adapting to an ADHD diagnosis), she likely won’t make enough to even cover her rent if she starts working, so I’ll likely have to keep paying for the car. But she still insists that if she gets a job far enough away from our house, she should get the car, leaving me with the bus. I feel hurt and disrespected because it feels like she isn’t willing to sacrifice at all, while I’ve been supporting her financially and emotionally for over a year.

I don’t want to break up—I love her and want to work through this—but I’m feeling like I’ve been taken advantage of for a while. She won’t budge on her stance about the bus and seems unwilling to compromise.

Am I being unreasonable for wanting fairness and for not wanting to just give her the car? I believe in proportional bill sharing, it doesn’t all have to be 50/50. What would you do in this situation?",Am I being unreasonable for wanting fairness regarding the use of our shared car while I'm covering all the payments?,"The individual posting on Reddit is a 29-year-old female (29F) who has been in a five-year relationship with her partner, a 33-year-old male-to-female transgender individual (33MTF).

The poster has a stable job that requires her to commute for about 10 minutes by car, but using public transportation adds considerable time to her commute. She has been using the bus for years and is accustomed to public transit.

Additionally, the partner is adapting to an ADHD diagnosis, which may affect her job capacity and potential earnings.

1j4m9xy,How do I overcome emotional disconnect? (24F + 24F),"TLDR: Ever since my girlfriend moved away for school it feels like she's always too busy for me and it's making me feel resentful.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year. She's currently about an hour away for her last semester of school while I'm working full-time.

I feel like ever since she moved back for school, I've been feeling emotionally disconnected from her. I'm not sure if it's because work has been really stressing me out lately and and leading me to think negatively in general. 

Usually when I'm stressed, I like being comforted, I like hearing that things will be okay. I usually don't get that from her, usually it's another comment about how I carry my stress and how it impacts me. She's not wrong, but I was hoping for something more in tune with my emotions. I think whenever I feel sad it's always a broken record from her about how I should take better care of myself, she isn't completely wrong but I'm aware of that and do what I can for myself already.

I've told her at the beginning of the semester that I understand she has a lot going on (she's very academically and extra-curricular driven) but I'd appreciate consistent communication from her.  She's been good at it for the most part, she asks me how my day goes, she'll text first, she'll text me at least once a day (she's very off her phone so she's used to not texting back instantly). In a cruel way I feel like I try not to be so enthusiastic in my texting style to her as I just don't see my energy being matched on a casual level when I know she's trying her best. I wish my partner was more of a casual texter and I think that's where a part of my disconnect comes from. She does call me when she has time (around once every 2-3 days) but it usually feels like I'm in between things - for example I was in the middle of telling her about a bad day today and she cut me off as she was on the way to pick up something from her friend and they ended up conversing so we ended the call. 

When we hang out, I do make the effort to go see her but I feel like our hang outs always have to be fitted around her. I make the hour drive to see her, I'm scheduled in between things she has to do, when I do see her she asks for us to hang in the evening when I have a busy work day the next day or have to drive back home - it just doesn't feel time efficient on my end. However, she always has plans with her friends lined up and it makes me wonder how she has time to plan things out with them meanwhile I'm here fighting for time. I'm afraid that if I ask her for more time she'll tell me that's all she has and that we could just go longer without seeing each other so that we have a day where she's actually attentive, I think I'd have a hard time going longer without seeing her. I just wish my partner had time for me where it felt like she was present. The last time we hung out, I came over in the evening despite her being home all day and there was a certain point where she got caught up in texting her extra-curricular group about some upcoming event they had to plan. She was apologetic but it made me sad and she knew that.

I'm not sure if I'm painting a good enough picture of emotional disconnect, but overall I just feel tossed aside even though I know she tries. I wish I had a partner that was more intertwined with me. I think there's some resentment on my end and I'm not sure if this situation is truly temporary (she's moving back in less than 2 months) and how I should communicate that I know she tries but I wish she considered me more in her life. 
",How can I communicate my feelings of emotional disconnect to my girlfriend without making her feel guilty for being busy with school?,"The individual in the Reddit post has been in a relationship with their girlfriend for a little over a year. The girlfriend is currently attending school for her last semester, which is located about an hour away from where the individual works full-time. The individual is experiencing significant stress from work, which has led to feelings of emotional disconnection and resentment towards their girlfriend. 

The individual has expressed a desire for more consistent communication and emotional support from their partner, particularly during stressful times.

Recently we haven’t seen each other in two weeks, but we do call often and he’s always at home, and we scheduled to see each other yesterday, but before that day he asked for a social media break and insisted we talk somewhere else so he could delete all his apps, including the one we had to share our locations to each other. Upon checking a diff app that we shared our locations on as well (he might’ve forgotten) he was at this apartment complex away from his dorm. I confronted him yesterday and he admitted to cheating on me with some girl he met on a dating app since the two week time we didn’t see each other. I asked if there was anything wrong with me, he said no, I was perfect and made him feel loved like no other. He said he had issues with his place in the world, a deep need for validation. Which is why he always spends so much for other people, does favors without being asked twice, sleeping around prior to meeting me. It just hurts so much. I was here the entire time, waiting and open for him and his problems. He said he didn’t want me to see him as a failure/disappointment, so he poured that side of him on someone else. He’s sad and in need of help, trying to please people, away from his home and family, he’s in a diff country. He’s begging me to stay, saying he can fix it, he just needs and wants me. He’s willing to do anything for my approval and for me to not leave him. How can I make sure that I’m doing the right thing?

1j4m5g5,my boyfriend (34M) of about 4 years asked me to take a “break” (31F),"Like most relationships, ours started off great, but after a year and half , he stopped being a present and committed partner.

My partner still owes me $3K after two years, stopped taking me on dates, and contributed nothing to maintaining our apartment. Intimacy dwindled, and he would get upset when I needed him during medical emergencies. Over time, he distanced himself from my friends and family, prioritized gaming and work colleagues over quality time, forgot our anniversary twice, and didn’t acknowledge my birthday, Christmas, or Valentine’s Day this past year. 

For over a year, he relied on my car without contributing to gas or maintenance.  Then, when he got a promotion, instead of paying me back, he splurged on an Apple Watch, AirPods, and trips to Chicago and Colorado. The final betrayal was when he stated he needed space for his mental health and would stay with his friends in town, but after I found out he was partying in Tulum with friends.

After I moved out of our San Diego apartment due to job loss and family responsibilities, I held onto little hope he’d change. Despite visiting San Diego five times in five months and maintaining nightly FaceTime calls, he suddenly admitted he couldn’t do long distance. He proposed a “break” to work on himself—then confessed he was tired of rejecting other women. Knowing I don’t believe in breaks or post-breakup friendship, he still asked me to stay in his life. His words about how “amazing” I was felt empty. I told him that I repeatedly asked him to step up, change, and be a better partner by addressing what I needed and pointing out where the ball dropped. He dismissed it, claiming the past is behind him and he couldn’t change it. I told him he had the opportunity to make an effort—yesterday, last week, or before—but he never presently chose to. It felt like a cop-out, and I expressed that. It was cowardly to not wait until I was in San Diego to have this conversation. We ended the call with him saying he still loved me.

When I arrived in San Diego Thursday, I texted him that I needed to get my things. He lied, saying he wouldn’t be home until Saturday, but I knew that wasn’t true. I checked his location and saw he was at a bar near my sister’s house, so I drove over to see him. He’d left by the time I arrived and turned his location off. He was working a festival I was attending, and I knew his typical schedule. I returned to my sister’s, distraught and panicked. Since Monday, when we FaceTimed, I hadn’t been able to eat or sleep, and the way he was avoiding me triggered painful memories of my previous relationship, where similar things happened after three years. It felt like I was going through this trauma again.

The next morning, he texted saying he’d be home until 3 p.m. I drove over, and when I arrived, I informed him we needed to talk. I had written exactly what I wanted to say down on my phone and read it to him. He admitted my points were true, except for my comment about him seeking other women. I still believe he is thinking of someone else, given his behavior and statement about being tired of not entertaining other women, but he denied it, saying he needed to focus on himself and didn’t have women lined up chasing him. His response felt evasive and like he wasn’t giving me a straight answer as you why he said that then to begin with. I still felt that something was off. He had been in constant contact with me, saying he loved and missed me, so his sudden desire for a break didn’t add up. What could it achieve when we were already living 9 hours apart? 

While we spoke, he kept giving me kisses me and held me. I left with my things, and he told me he’d always love me. Later, he texted, saying he appreciated hearing my thoughts, and I responded similarly. He later checked in on me, asking if I’d eaten or felt better, but I hadn’t. He mentioned he wasn’t feeling himself. He said he was home from work if I wanted to talk, so I went over, thinking he wanted to speak in person. He was shocked I came, even though I’d told him I was on my way. We talked, but he still wasn’t fully honest with me, and when I tried to go wash a dish I had eaten from in the kitchen, he told me I couldn’t leave his room, which felt strange and like he was hiding me from his roommates. He asked me to stay the night, and I did. The next morning, he tried to give me some of his things and kissed me, saying he was happy I stayed.

That morning, we both knew we’d see each other at the festival later. When I arrived, he was distant and cold. Later on, I brought him food, but his behavior remained the same—distant and harsh. After I gave him the food, he texted me thanking me and saying he wished we had more time to talk. I did not respond. The next day, I couldn’t handle the pain and left the festival early. Later, I tried reaching out because I had forgotten a few things at his place, but he ignored me all day. When I poured my heart out in a text, his response was emotionless, offering excuses, and stating he was taxed by his own emotions about all of this. 

I asked to see him again to get closure, but he ignored me. It was Tuesday, my last day in San Diego, and I texted him asking if he didn’t care to see me. He tried to avoid the question, saying he was tired and busy with work. When I pressed him, he said he didn’t think it was a good idea and suggested a call instead. I had planned to leave San Diego, but my sister begged me to stay, so I did. So I told him I’d now be here until the 9th, but he never responded.

I’ve been watching his actions, and they don’t align with his words. I still love him, and I hoped my absence would make him realize what he lost and that it would inspire change. I still feel I’m left without closure, and I’m still drawn to him, wanting to see him again. I still want to talk and get the real answers. In my gut I don’t feel he’s being fully honest. How do I move forward and gain the closure and answers I need? And have him be direct and fully honest?

TL;DR: My relationship started great, but after 1.5 years, my partner became distant, stopped contributing to our relationship, and ignored my needs. He lied, avoided responsibilities, and prioritized himself. I tried to make things work long-distance, but he admitted he couldn’t handle it, claimed he needed space, and commented he was tired of ignoring women’s advances. After speaking with him in person and asking for closure, he was evasive and distant while also saying he still loves me and being affectionate. Despite still loving him, I feel like I’m being led on and not getting the honesty I deserve, and I don’t know what to do next.","How do I move forward and gain the closure and answers I need from my partner, and how can I encourage him to be direct and fully honest with me?","The individual in crisis has experienced a relationship that started positively but deteriorated after a year and a half.

1j4m573,Found out my (26M) girlfriend (22F) isn’t allowed to use a scale. What now?,"Basically my girlfriend told me she isn’t allowed to weigh herself. It didn’t seem like she wanted to elaborate. How do I approach this. 

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for a little over a year now and everything is going great. She recently moved in and now we live together. That’s actually how I found out about this. I keep my weight scale in the bathroom, and she said “that thing has to go”. I asked her why “she said she wasn’t allowed to weigh herself”. I thought she was joking, but she was serious. Started getting watery eyes and fell asleep. I’m usually terrible with things like this or taking hints. I know she doesn’t have a relationship with her mom at all. She’s always said that it was because she sided with her dad in her parent’s divorce, but I’m starting to think that there’s more to this. Her dad constantly checks on her during the day about making sure she’s eating. I thought her dad just really cared about her “which he obviously does”, but clearly this is a bigger thing. I still don’t exactly know the extent of this whole thing. She looks the same since when we started dating. I guess that’s a good sign in all of this. Side note she also has scars on her wrists. I asked her about them when we first started dating, and she said they were from her falling off her bike when she was little. I think there might be more to that. Yes I know I’m clearly a terrible boyfriend for not noticing or going deeper about these things earlier. She’s my first long term relationship and love. I’m learning as I go. I myself am feeling like garbage about not being open enough for her to talk to me about this.

I guess my questions would be
Do I ask her straight up about this?
Do I wait for her to tell me when she’s ready?

The emotional impact of the breakup has led the individual to withdraw from speaking to their friends, as they wish to respect their ex-partner's request to not communicate. The individual has previously experienced worse breakups but feels particularly affected by this one, stating that it is rare to feel safe with someone and they believed their ex-partner would never hurt them.","The person is experiencing emotional pain and guilt following a breakup, struggling to move on from thoughts of their ex-partner.",teenager,female,single,student,poor,not healthy,high school student,the person is experiencing emotional distress and feelings of guilt and sadness,not specified,upset,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j4m1aq/heart_broken_f19_m19_3_months/,relationship_advice
1j4m0nf,My (23F) boyfriend (23M) wants to end our relationship a year too soon.,"This is both our first serious relationship (23F and 23M), where we met and instantly bonded and moved into an apartment together at the 1.5 year mark. We had talked it through before we signed on and agreed it would be good to experience apartment life together before we commit to moving to Australia together, and work through the highs and lows of living together before we experience it in another country, and live life before we commit to engagement and marriage (both on the same page).

We have been here two months and everything has been good so far, we still haven’t had any major arguments or disagreements, until two nights ago.

I wanted to move to Australia with him to live a life of stability, with well paying jobs and a place to call home for many years. This was also his goal until he said to me two days ago that he’s been thinking of moving to Europe indefinitely to further his career as a chef, to train in culinary cities, and move around with any new opportunity that comes every few months. Of course I love him and support him in that decision, but I am still firm on wanting to ground myself, and we agreed if we have to end things around mid 2026 to live the lives we dream of then we will. This is when he will have enough money to go over, and I will graduate with my Masters degree.

Except last night, he dropped the bomb that if we are to inevitably break up in a year or more’s time, we should just do it now. I was in shock because I genuinely thought he would want to spend all his remaining time in our city together, having fun and sharing laughter and being in love, and having a mature breakup that would hurt but not as much as getting blindsided. Not now, when we are locked into a contract for the apartment until December that cannot be broken unless we find someone willing to take over the lease, and I am locked into the masters degree programme I had started literally yesterday. All our belongings are shared, I cannot afford the rent in this apartment by myself, all my friends in this city were his friends first, and of course I want to stay with him for as long as we can. We will now both be sad and miserable and missing each other until we move away in a years time, and I wish I had known this earlier so I could have planned to move to Australia instead of starting my masters here.

Is it worth trying to get him to understand why I want is to stay together in the meantime, even if he thinks we should just break up now? Or is it better if I just give up now, take all my belongings, take my name off the lease and get my share of the bond back, and try and find a place to live by myself in a city where all my friends are direct reminders of him?","Is it worth trying to get him to understand why I want us to stay together in the meantime, even if he thinks we should just break up now?","The individual in crisis is a 23-year-old female currently in her first serious relationship with a 23-year-old male.

24M here. So the other day while scrolling on grindr this random guy messaged me and we talked, we did send nudes but it was mostly flirty, he gave me his insta and we agreed to go for coffee. So that was 2 days ago, he is perfect, Law student and one of the best in his year, he is also a TA at uni. So the date was great we cuddled and kissed and just talked for 2 hours because he had class afterwards. I ended up walking with him to his uni a few blocks away and droped him off there.

So he did mention wanting to go out more and has replied to my messages, but its rather cold, I am associating this to him being too focused with uni work, because he always messages me when he gets home from uni and before bed so there is a short window where he is active.

Anyway am I overthinking things too much and giving excuses to myself or is he not into me? do you guys got any advice on this?","Am I overthinking things, or is he not into me?

I hadn’t heard from her in 8ish months and one day she emails me to see how I’m doing, turns out she just broke up with her boyfriend of 4 years due to some issues and was going to a different state for her safety. We called and talked the whole drive and once she was in a different location, I just was there for her and was emotional support for her and one night after a week or two otp she said that she loved me, we decided to try long distance and that went good for about 3 weeks, through this time I learned she has bad mental health such as bipolar and anxiety and trauma from her past. I got attached to her so fast and deep and we both felt a really deep emotional bond and we had talked about our issues and everything we had and were going through in this time, she then said that it was cruel to let me love her and she couldn’t reciprocate the love and that I should find someone else, I told her how I felt and that I would wait as long as it took and we decided to become just friends for a while, during this timeframe nothing really changed except for us not calling each other our partners, we still called and texted every day and said I love yous and all that stuff. Then about 3 weeks into this we talked and she told me she loves me more then just a friend and decided to give it another try, it was all going well until a day ago when she said that she doesn’t feel like an asset in my life and doesn’t think I can be one in hers in anyway besides emotional support. She told me that I should find someone else who can give me the love I deserve and can take care of me and that she does love me, and that she thinks I’m a great person but isn’t in love with me and couldn’t be even if she wanted to because she can’t even care for and love herself. I told her that I will wait as long as it takes for her to better her mental health and get her life on track and that I just want her to be happy even if that doesn’t include me in her life. I also told her that I am fully committed to her and being there through the good and bad because love isn’t always going to be easy.

This coworker has only worked with me for about a month, maybe two months. He has touched my ear piercings a couple times, but I never thought really anything of it. Well today, I was going to take my trash out and he says he’ll walk with me and that he needs to hit his vape.

He starts grabbing my ears and touching all my piercings, started rubbing my arm where my tattoos are, then he locks his fingers in my hair and pulls it. I jokingly tell him “don’t pull my hair” because I froze up and didn’t know what to do.
