1j6u5hj,Friend zoned after 4 months of talking... will he change his mind?,"I want to clarify that I’m not overly anxious about this situation—I’ve been through worse and have grown from it. I’m just curious about others’ perspectives. I really like this person, but I want to make sure I prioritize my own well-being moving forward.

I (F22) have known this person (M21) for 5 years, and we’ve been good friends. About a year ago, I realized I had romantic feelings for him. We had some group hangouts where I started to feel something, and he later admitted he felt the same. We went on a date in November, but I wasn’t sure how I felt since I liked someone else at the time. After that, we stayed in touch, and eventually, we kissed. We continued to hang out one-on-one and with friends.

Though he ghosted me for a week, he often initiated hangouts, texted me regularly, and was kind and caring. While sex wasn’t central, we tried a few times but he struggled with performance anxiety, which I learned was an issue for him before. I also discovered he has an avoidant attachment style, making him wary of intimacy.

This past weekend, we went on a trip with friends. One of my friends mentioned she didn’t see chemistry between us, and this got back to him. The day after the trip, he told me he wanted to talk. He expressed that the comment made him question things and wanted to resume our platonic friendship. I respected his decision, but he later reached out saying he didn’t want to lose me as a friend and still cared about me. We continued texting, and he emphasized he only wanted to remove the intimacy but still valued our bond.

I’m not angry, just unsure of how to proceed. I like him, but right now, I want more than just friendship. Maybe in a few months, I could be okay with just being friends. I’m curious about what his actions mean and whether he’s not attracted enough to pursue a relationship. How long should I stay no contact? Does my staying distant indicate I’ll always be available, and that might prevent him from wanting anything serious? I’m just trying to make sense of it all.

  
TL;DR: I (F22) have been friends with this guy (M21) for 5 years, and recently developed romantic feelings for him. We went on a date, kissed, and hung out one-on-one, but he has an avoidant attachment style and struggles with intimacy. After a comment from a friend about our lack of chemistry, he told me he wanted to return to being platonic, but later reached out to say he still cared and valued our friendship. I'm unsure how to move forward—I'm looking for more than just friendship right now, and I want to prioritize my well-being while trying to understand his actions.

1j6tvrq,Do I (26M) make one more gesture to my old high school (25F) sweetheart/old gf?,"My high school sweetheart whom I dated the summer of my senior year until the fall of our freshman year of college have been reconnecting. We grew up together and our families used to be super close now we aren’t expect her little brother and I are besties.


My struggle right now is I’ve laid it all out for her several times last year. Saying I want her and always will and forever love her. I don’t think I can get into another relationship with girl because I love my HS sweat heart  so much.
 
She currently lives 6hrs from me but visits her hometown which is where am I living at home currently so we have been hanging out more often.

March 25th I leave for military training for almost 3 months. There is so much more to this story than I can type. But I guess my big question is do I do a big gesture one more time or just let the ball be in her court? My brother and her little brother who is my best friend thinks I should either just go in for a kiss or tell her I want her and to be my gf and be aggressive. Which I’ve struggled in the past to be for her.

Or do I just let it run its course since I’ve put myself out there several times last year


TL;DR I might see her one more time before I leave for training. (Not bootcamp I’ve been in for 7 years). So I wonder if I should just grab her and kiss her if there’s a good opportunity or just let time and her do their thing, or tell her one more time I want her to be mine?",Should I do a big gesture one more time or just let the ball be in her court?,"I dated my high school sweetheart from the summer of my senior year until the fall of our freshman year of college.

1j6tu8a,27F 27M Trying to decide if I’m making the right decision about my boyfriend texting another woman,"So my boyfriend’s birthday was Thursday and I went through his computer to get some phone numbers of his friends to plan a surprise and I came across these messages about him reaching out to a woman to hang out at her house. There wasn’t any language that was just OD flirty or anything but he definitely asked when she’d be free and said “oh okay because I definitely wanna stop by fr” It’s the first time I’ve ever seen any messages like that between him and somebody else. We have a pretty trusting and open relationship. 

I questioned him and he didn’t deny anything and he seemed to genuinely understand my issues with the texts. He’s apologized, acknowledged my feelings, boundaries, and demands moving forward, and seems genuinely honest about not doing dumb stuff like this in the future. 

For reference, after really talking about it, he said he’s been battling with feeling cooped up in our relationship since we moved in with eachother last year and he’s been trying to do things outside of the relationship like hang with his guys and stuff but to no avail because their schedules rarely sync up so he went through his entire list and she was at the bottom of it. He claims he was so desperate to just have companionship outside of the relationship he was willing to even hang out with her(as they hung out before us meeting a time or two). We’ve been together for 2 years btw. 

The issue I have with this is he was sneaky about it. Had I never found these messages, he would’ve never told me. I asked if they were just friends why’d he hide it and delete the messages and he said he thought I would overreact because I knew of her reputation before. He even said he felt guilty texting her and even stepping out for companionship with her which is also part of why he didn’t respond and deleted the messages. Like he definitely agrees it was wrong to do. So I’m conflicted. 

He didn’t go through with the meetup but I just feel like if they had met up, something would’ve happened because wtf were you gonna do at somebody’s house you’ve barely spoken to(if ever) in 2 years?? A girl at that. But I could also just be being a woman and being skeptical. He swears nothing would have happened because he doesn’t see her like that and he would never cheat on me. I feel like it’s considered cheating and he accepts that and hasn’t argued with me at all. 

We’re going to stay together because I do believe he’s remorseful and will do better, we also have a baby otw, we’re on the road to marriage, and a few other reasons. But I feel like I’m betraying myself for being so forgiving. 

I’m wondering if I should continue the dinner for his bday tonight or cancel it.

What are your thoughts on the situation?

1j6tsn1,How to ask my 19M Gf 18F to dress better and take better care of herself,"Here it is short and sweet. I’ve met the love of my life, we’re great together. We’ve been a couple for almost a year now. About six months in she started to dress more and more casually on our date nights. That doesn’t bother me necessarily, I often dress what i would call casual for our little outings. The problem I’m having now is that every time we go out now, she dresses like a homeless person. I mean our nice dates as well. Last nice date we went on she wore pajama pants and unlaced hiking boots to a sit down restaurant. 
  
Now, lest someone find me vain or snobby. I love when she dresses like that around the house and even on little evenings in town or whatever. What’s bugging me is I take very good care of myself for her, (gym, skincare and grooming routine etc) even though I work a demanding construction job. 
  
I’m attentive to her preference in how I dress for dates as well as what colognes she likes and things like that. It almost feels as if she doesn’t think I’m worth dressing up or fixing her hair for. She kinda bed rots anymore and I guess I don’t know how to feel about that as a driven individual. 
     TL;DR: Gf doesn’t take care of herself anymore, does not make any effort when we go out.",How can I address my girlfriend's lack of effort in dressing for our dates?,"The person has been in a relationship for almost a year and works a demanding construction job.

1j6to54,I[19M] find my girlfriend[18F] more aesthetically attractive than sexually,"I recently started dating this girl who I have been friends with for quite a while. I didn’t have a thing for her for much of the time we were friends but once I decided I was done with dating and I was happy on my own I started to develop feelings for her that I knew were real because I was finally out of my relationship hunting phase for real this time. One thing led to another and we ended up becoming official. 

Now I want to make it clear that I do think she’s attractive. I love the way she smiles and she’s got a short, gentle and pretty figure. I think she’s cute as hell and I really do love to spend time with her. We do have sex however I realize that when I’ve been thinking about her when I’m not with her I have trouble thinking of her in any sexual manner. Whenever I think about her it’s more that I want to see her and cuddle with her and make her happy more so than I want to get it on with her as soon as possible. I don’t really value sex that much in my life so it isn’t terribly important but I do want to find her sexy because I want her to feel sexy! But I seem to have some trouble seeing her sexually rather than romantically sometimes. 

I think that it may have something to do with my own personal issues emotionally as well as potentially my skewed view of mens and women’s bodies due to social media and other things like porn and societal beauty standards. The girls I’ve dated before were also fairly different looking than she is as they were taller and a little curvier but honestly I couldn’t care less about the semantics of a girl if I believe she’s amazing. Which is why I really want to switch this mindset and develop my sexual attraction to her. 

For other context I do have some personal experiences with relationships that have made sex a difficult thing for me and something that I have had fear around for quite while now. This is the first relationship I’ve had in a couple of years so I’ve been feeling really anxious since usually I would have run away from this by now, but I don’t want to run from her. So it could be that my anxiety is clouding my emotions and making me feel tense, in turn reducing my sex drive maybe? I also quit watching porn since we’ve been dating because I would rather be with her than be looking at that stuff which could be contributing but I’m not sure. 

I just really want to develop this part of our relationship because I’m anxious that it will become a problem and hurt her feelings if I’m not turned on by her. She’s beautiful and I do believe that but I want to feel more of a sexual attraction to her so she knows and believes that I do like her. How can I work on developing and strengthening this part of our relationship? 

TL;DR I like my girlfriend a lot and think she’s beautiful aesthetically but I’d like to develop my sexual feelings toward her more because I want her to feel important and attractive and to make our sex life stronger.

How do I navigate this?","Even though I really love my grandmother, she is one of the worst people I know to spend time with. She has a huge heart and is very generous but she never thinks before she speaks, and sometimes she’s just blatantly rude and, I hate to talk down on her, incompetent. My grandfather, to the extent of my knowledge was a good father to my dad and my uncle, but is a horrible husband. He absolutely hides it outside of their house, and only a few of us (other family members) can actually see how condescending, rude, etc. he is to her. He doesn’t allow my grandmother to take trips with her friends, only with family, which leads me to my dilemma. I’m the only girl grandchild, and the only person who will ever agree to do things with her, and most of the time I want to spend time with her, help her around the house and stuff, but since I’ve been able to drive and have a very flexible school schedule I am absolutely drained. Usually I can ignore all the  annoying or offense things she says/does but I am so tired of it now. She constantly wants me to go on trips with her, and I always turn her down, and she won’t stop asking. I feel an obligation to be with her, because of my grandfather, but I don’t know the whole truth of that situation and I don’t know if she is manipulating me in anyway just to get me to spend time with her.

My (26F) partner (27M) is so indecisive about everything!!! He's basically Chidi from The Good Place. We've been dating for 6 months and there's no breaking up, so please don't suggest that. 

First theres the big things. He can't make up his mind about his career, or about what car he wants, or whether he should travel or not. It took him 2 years to DECIDE he was going to take a sabbatical from work to work on himself. He's in a secure, comfortable job that goes nowhere its obviously making him miserable. I suggested he go back to school/trades/move laterally across the company and he's been just thinking about it. No changes have been made. 

Then there's the small things! 
He can't decide how to spend his weekends so he'll end up just being in bed or going for a week...and then going back to bed. 

It takes hours for him to decide where we should go and what we should do on date nights. Somehow, I always end up planning things and making decisions BECAUSE HE CANT MAKE UP HIS MIND. He'll second-guess every decision even if I've already set a finalized plan. 

I can never ask him a question and get a straight answer. ""What's your favorite hobby?"" ""I'm not sure really, I've never thought about it."" Then proceeds to tell me the 10 different things he would like to do but never actuslly does. Like what????

Please please help me understand how to overcome this frustration and actually help him. This might be completely mental and I'd like to push him towards therapy if it is a mental health issue.
