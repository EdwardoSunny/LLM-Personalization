2025-02-27 22:15:52,1izs3zf,My (25 F) boyfriend (29 M) says that my boundary with oral sex is unfair to him,"My boyfriend tells me that it‚Äôs not fair that I will not give him oral sex due to the fact that I stopped doing that 2 years before I met him and no longer like doing it due to me constantly getting sick from doing it as well as other personal issues. He says it‚Äôs not fair to him since he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, it was the other guy. He feels as though I‚Äôm saying he is exactly like the guy who made me no longer want to do it. I don‚Äôt like oral sex, I get the absolute opposite of being turned on, I feel gross. I tell him that my trauma has nothing to do with him and he says it absolutely has something to do with him because he has a penis.

2025-02-27 22:14:50,1izs32o,"My husband has expressed regret being with me, not once, not twice but three times. Bonus: one was during our wedding.","My husband (26M) and I (24W) have been together for 3 years. Married our second year together. His favorite activity is drinking and it use to be mine too until things quickly escalated. In our own apartment prior to being married he told me ""You will never amount to anything"", that he regrets being with me, and repeated saying i will never go anywhere in life and that he will be a big success. I was infuriated and left the house. He begged me to come back and I did, this was completely out of character so I choked it up to being a bad day. I came back to find him drunk and magic üçÑ scattered on the floor. I was upset, because why would u take those when ur drunk and upset. But there was no going back for him now. I took care of him during terrible awful trip, he was incoherent nearly the entire  night and nearly hurt the dog and himself by toppling a bookcase nearly onto himself. He was definitely feeling blue the next day and I let him know how unacceptable that was. I didn't even care how depressed he had got, i was absolutely livid he had the audacity to say what he said. 

Fast forward to when we were preparing to get married, he came to me and said he wasn't sure about this. I told him it's fine, we don't have to go thru with this but obviously I was hurt to hear this news. I didn't object and he came back later saying he was just having cold feet. This should of been the first red flag. Maybe we were moving too quickly and it felt really quick and super rushed because we were technically  only getting married so i can get the medical benefits. I was suffering pretty bad from my knees. There was no proposal, no ring, no plans for a wedding. Just a paper you give to someone saying ur married now. And this was fine at first, I was in love with him and he was in love with me.

The day came around where we eventually have my brother officiate our wedding in the living room. It really wasn't a wedding, just a quick hey you're married now sort of thing. When he said you may now kiss the bride, something was off in his eyes.  He looked visibly uncomfortable.  I felt horrible kissing him quickly. It wasn't passionate, just a quick peck. We go out to our favorite restaurant, have some drinks, then buy more alcohol to take home. He gets drunker, and drunker. I know he begins to get in his own head because he turns off the lights and puts on his ""sad boi"" music. (That's what I call it when he's beginning to get in a particular mood). He turns to me, drunk as a skunk, and says he regrets marrying me and a bunch of other stuff I can barely remember. It was all really shocking.  I hadn't turned in the paper, so technically it wasn't official. But I was crushed, I was an emotional mess all night. No amount of sorry or comfort could change that. I couldn't sleep all night and I wanted to rip the paper right then and there. I should of honestly. But he begs me, when he's barely sober that he didn't mean what he said. After alot of talking, it really did seem like he got cold feet. I start to realize that it may be the alcohol, I tell him he gets way too drunk he can't handle his emotions. He gets full of himself and egotistical. He hates when I tell him that but I've started to notice it more and more over time. I tell him, he can't drink or he has to start limiting how much he drinks. That I don't think i can trust him, if he can't put it down and know when to stop. (There were times I'm cleaning up his puke, and he's passed out, trying to keep him from choking on it) One beer, turns into two, two to a few, then to 6, then to 12, and one night impressively he drank the majority of a 24 pack. 

We went to NY for his schooling. I always tried to support him as much as possible thru everything and help him chase his passions. Until one night, he gets too drunk again. He stumbles to his mom's couch, and begins to tell me how I'm holding him back from meeting better women. How I'm holding him back from being great. How he regrets marrying me. He is barely coherent, slurring his words. I then get embarrassed. He's telling me these things while his mother is in the next room, while is siblings room is right there. Everyone can hear everything in this tiny apartment. I'm frustrated telling him how can he say this in his own mother's house. No response. I eventually get him back to the room, he sleeps, and wake up not realizing all the damage was done so I have to tell him.

I tried to get him to quit drinking again, in which he did but only for a short amount of time. 3 months later we were back at my home state to stay with my parents. I finally felt a sigh of relief to be back home because it meant I can finally have a place I can depend on if shit hits the fan again.  As soon as we got home, my family home is not the greatest of places to stay sober. A few peer pressures a week and he's back to his old habits despite me protesting. So far nothing has happened. There are moments where I see he gets sad and in his head. Moments where he boasts about himself the next moment. Sometimes I look forward to when he passes out because that means the night is over and he will be sober the next day. I feel guilty for feeling like this. He deserves to enjoy drinking without someone scowling at him. He technically hasn't acted up in a really long time. Now the smell of alcohol has put me off. I haven't done üçÑ since and I don't drink anymore. I only smoke weed. 

I don't know how to feel after everything. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice sort of thing. I don't know if I ever came back from the wedding night. I think I still live in that moment everytime I see alcohol in his hand. My wedding wasn't something I ever want my kids to know if I stay with him. It was awful and the worst night of my life. I don't know if I'm doing more harm by staying and I don't think I'll ever truly be past it. But I love him. And he hasn't done anything recently that would make me think he still feels that way. 

I look at my life and what I want it to be and I don't think I'll ever find peace with him. It's annoying because I've grown resentment for alcohol. I hate it. I would love to drink but everytime I do it just reminds me of that time. I look at him fondly but deep down I don't really know if I feel the same. I use to be hopelessly in love but now it feels muted. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to move forward like he wants me to. It's crazy to think so much has happened in just a year. 

Any advice? 

Tl:dr - husband has expressed regret over being with me before after and during our wedding. I wanna blame the alcohol and him but idk what to do. I'm at a loss. Girls just wanna have fun and not be worried about the futu",What should I do about my husband's expressed regret over our marriage and his drinking problem?,"The individual in crisis is a 24-year-old woman who has been married to her husband, aged 26, for about a year after dating for three years. They moved in together before getting married, during which her husband made disparaging comments about her potential and future, expressing regret over their relationship. She has shown support for her husband, particularly during his alcohol-induced crises, and has experienced significant emotional distress due to his drinking habits and the way he speaks to her while under the influence.

The couple has faced challenges related to her husband's drinking, which escalates to the point of incoherence and aggressive behavior. The woman's background includes a recent relocation back to her home state, where she had hoped for a more stable environment, but peer pressure led to her husband's return to alcohol use. Despite these challenges, she has also taken on the role of caretaker during her husband's episodes of heavy drinking.

Health issues have also been a factor in her life, notably problems with her knees that contributed to the decision to marry her husband primarily for medical benefits. She reflects on her wedding experience as profoundly negative, noting that it felt rushed and lacked traditional elements like a proposal or rings, which might hint at her desire for a more stable and supportive environment in her personal life. She has distanced herself from alcohol and recreational drug use in response to her husband's behaviors and her feelings associated with them.

Overall, her situation reflects a complex interplay of personal health issues, familial dynamics, and her husband's struggles with alcohol, leading to a fraught emotional landscape that she is currently navigating.",4,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1izs32o/my_husband_has_expressed_regret_being_with_me_not/,relationships

2025-02-27 22:08:10,1izrxka,Can I (20F) trust my bf (22M) again?,"I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for 10 months. Two months ago, I found hundreds of explicit/sexual social media posts saved across multiple platforms on his phone. When I confronted him, he admitted to having an addiction for years, which had also affected his previous relationship. He had been lying to me and going behind my back for months, despite us practically living together and being together all the time.

This was especially painful because, at the very beginning of our relationship, I made it clear that I was extremely uncomfortable with him consuming porn or sexual content. I even told him that I had ended a past relationship over this exact issue because of how much the betrayal hurt me and how much it amplified my insecurities.

After discovering everything, I broke up with him, but we got back together a few weeks later. Since then, things have been really good-he agreed to therapy, put content restrictions on his phone, and always gives me open access to it. He's reassured me multiple times that he wants to change and doesn't want to be that person anymore, not only for me but also for his personal health and well-being.
We even just got back from a week-long vacation with his family and are looking at places to properly move in together. I really felt like we were in a great place.

I'm not the type to go through my partner's phone (which is why I didn't notice the saved posts for so long, despite them being right there), but I had feeling yesterday and decided to check. In his saved posts, I found three explicit posts (all from the same creator) which weren't there a few days ago.

At first when I confronted him, he said that he didn't mean to save them, and then said his social media algorithm was still pushing sexual content on his explore page, so he was trying to figure out what was causing it. He claimed he saved some explicit posts to unsave them later to see if that would help reset the algorithm since the ""not interested"" button wasn't working (which, to be fair, l've also noticed doesn't always work).

He insists that he wouldn't be dumb enough to do the exact same thing again after everything that happened last time. But honestly, I find the whole story hard to believe and am unsure on how to proceed. I don't want to be naive, but I also don't want to assume the worst if he really is trying.

Things have been great and I love him so much.
Thanks in advance, this is driving me crazy

2025-02-27 22:01:01,1izrrii,I (19gf) need advise on how to move forward with my friend (18f) of a couple of years who takes time to respond and is back and forth with her actions,"I (19 genderfluid) have been friends with a girl (18f) for a couple of years. We met online (both in the US) and dated a few months into our friendship. She was in a poly relationship and her girlfriend (18f) asked me out so we all dated. I later broke up with them both but stayed with a person (19m) I was seeing in person (ended it with them too). I was asked to stop texting her and delete my account by my parentals. I did and left her a text before leaving.

She texted me a month later on WhatsApp and we spoke again. She texted me once saying ""I love you so much"" then after I told  her it's the wrong person she said ""sorry that was meant for my partner"" which confused me since she usually talks to people on discord not WhatsApp. She explained to me that she wasn't good at making friends so we made the plan that I'd try to help. In the end I ghosted (horrible act on my part) because I couldn't stand how she would go days without texting back, even when she started the conversation. 

A few months later, I unblocked her and texted her to apologize for ghosting her. At first she didn't know who I was but when she realized we started to talk again. She of course brought up her current partner (18m) a few times which I don't mind and talked through the whole ghosting thing. She said it was okay and that she isn't mad or hurt, she was just worried about me. She explained that she has a hectic schedule so she hasn't been available to talk much. She also said that she doesn't use WhatsApp much which is what I talk to her on.

It's been a week or so since that conversation and she has talked to me a bit more but still takes a few days to respond. She started a conversation a couple days ago, took a day to respond and left me on read when I responded. I don't really understand what her side of this friendship is. I don't get how she feels or how I can fix our friendship.

I moved our converstions to discord and the first day we spoke for a few hours at night about my favorite band, she asked a lot of questions about it but then after that she went back to taking days to answer. She does use more emojis and exclimation marks than before. I'm not really sure what to make of it all. I just want to understand her side and know how to move forward. The last time we spoke she didn't respond for a week after she started the coversation. When she did respond, she texted me late at night (she usually sleeps early but had an energy drink) and then we spoke for an hour or two the next day. She asked about how college was going and talked about our classes. Should I just wait it out and hope something changes or should I try to give her space? How can I fix our friendship?

She is very dear to me despite everything so any advice is appreciated, I apologize for the long post. I hope y'all have a nice day! 

TL;DR: I (19f) met a friend (18f) online, we dated for a few months but I broke it off. We have been friends on and off (I ghosted the second time), I apologized and we started speaking again. She takes long to answer so I switched to discord (her main app) and not much has changed but she does ask a few more questions than before. I asked how to be a better friend and she said I'm fine, she is just busy with school (which I completely understand).

2025-02-27 21:38:24,1izr8p5,Parent [59M] in financial trouble asking me [31F] for more money again,"We had a comfortable lifestyle growing up, solidly upper-middle class, and I never thought I would be in this position. 

My dad \[59M\] recently went all in on a business that ended up being a scam. The scam is not his fault, what I can't wrap my head around is why he invested all of their liquid savings into this. He is barely able to stay afloat right now so he's asking me and my brother \[29M\] to help the family get by.

Not only is he nearing retirement age, but he also has 1 more kid to raise. He remarried later in life and I have 1 half sister who is still in middle school. She has learning disabilities so she goes to a specialized school. There is a cheaper school for her learning disabilities in another city, but my dad can't move his business so the family would live apart if they did that. My stepmother has been a SAHM for all of their marriage, she's looking for a job now but it's been tough. They are planning to sell their nice house and down-size. This will finally give them some cash, but they're strapped until the house sells.

He already asked me for money a few years ago when we were in the depths of COVID and his own business suffered. I recently learned from my stepmother that while that was true in the beginning, he also kept spending money on poorly executed business ideas that failed. I gave him close to $25K aggregated over those years. At that time I gave without hesitation, he was my dad, an astute businessman I looked up to all my life, and I had no doubt he was a good for it. I still haven't seen a cent of that money back and also feel like I was scammed by my own dad.

My brother and I split 15K recently so my sister could finish out the rest of her school year. At this point I know I should assume I'll never see any of my money back. Because of that, I don't feel comfortable giving away any more. My brother is trying to convince me to split tuition fees with him again for the next school year so the family can stay together instead of moving her to another school in another city. I said no. 

I feel so torn, pressured, selfish, resentful... so many emotions. No one is pressuring me, but I'm from a culture where family is very important and I feel a sense of obligation even though I don't want to. I want to help my family, especially my sister who is innocent in all this. At the same time I don't want to keep enabling my dad and his poor business decisions. My brother wasn't involved with the first request for money so I feel like he doesn't know what I went through over the last few years. I make 6 figures, no debt, and I have been saving/investing since my first job, so I do have the means and my family knows it, which makes this even harder. But I'm not a millionaire and would start to feel financially insecure if I keep giving more.

This has also affected me psychologically. Even though I've been financially independent from my dad since college, it was always nice to have a financial safety net in the background. We've never had to worry about money. Now the safety net is gone and it has f\*cked with my psyche a lot. Most people I grew up with have had their parents help them with down payments and weddings. I now know that will not be in my future. I worry about my sister's future. I know that's a very privileged thing to say, people had to go through the Great Recession and most people in this country will never find financial security, but it's something I'm personally still trying to come around to.

I don't know how to navigate this, and I worry how my relationship with my dad and my brother will change going forward, and with my sister once she's older.

**TL;DR** Family is in financial trouble due to poor investment decisions, and I have already given money that was never returned and probably never will be. Feel a sense of obligation to help, especially innocent younger sister who still needs to finish school, but also worried about my own financial security and how this will affect my relationship with family going forward.",How can I balance my obligation to help my family with my own financial security and emotional wellbeing?,"The individual grew up in a comfortable, upper-middle-class lifestyle.

2025-02-27 19:58:22,1izow4c,Me (27f) and my partner (26m) had an argument again and I'm not sure if I should apologize,"Little backstory: Spending time together was always an issue on my part in the sense that I wanted more. I want to feel like that we are a couple and not just roommates. I talked to him about it many times and the last time he told me that I need to figure out what I want to do and tell him and it's gonna be fine. I had a hard time to believe him, because that same conversation happened before and if I asked for time together after it was never okay anyway.

Last weekend he spent roughly 10 hours playing with the boys (daily average is about 5-7 hours) and I felt a bit alone so on monday I asked him if he wants to watch a movie with me. He said it's fine.

2 hours later when we were in bed, I asked him if he has a wish or an idea of what he wants to watch. He said that he forgot that we agreed on doing something together and took out his contact lenses already. I got a bit upest and thought that ""Yep. Once again it won't happen what I asked for"". He immediately realized that I got irritated and put lenses back and we watched something. He was huffin' and puffin' the whole way through it and I wasn't happy either.

I told him the next day that I felt hurt by his behaviour and told him that I thought it is a bit unfair that he can spend so much time with others in front of the screen, but if I ask for time that's just a source of annoyance. He didn't apologize, just smiled at me and said that a person (who he already played for 4  hours that day) expressed a need to play more, so he is gonna do that.

This week I took a step back and I was a bit more distant than usual, because I was trying to process what happened and how much it hurt. Not just this one particular time, but the pattern of how these situations usually go. He indirectly called me depressive.

Today after dinner he asked me if I want to watch a movie together in the weekend. I hesitated with my answer and told him that maybe. And told him that I still have a hard time letting go of the previous weekend. He got upset and told me to have it my own way and it's up to me and he stormed into his computer room. I went after him and asked what can I do, because I feel like if I request time that's not good, if I feel hurt and don't immediately accept his offer, that's not good either. He said it's just be up to me.

I don't know if I did something wrong with hesitating and bringing last weekend up again. I just feel like things are fine to do if they happen on his terms. I felt like as if he is saying that even if I feel hurt I should accept time happily when he is offering it.

It is gonna be tension for a few days between us again, because he will be upset. I won't be able to talk to him because he gonna be even more upset if I bring it up.

Is it my fault? Was it his attempt of apologizing and I blew it? Should I apologize now?

2025-02-27 19:46:13,1izolub,I (25M) have become increasingly frustrated with my fianc√©e (22F) about finding a job and helping with financial matters.,"

My (22) wife and I (25) graduated last year with criminal justice degrees, after some security gigs, I got into law enforcement, all the while, she struggled to find employment, and still has, her and I have sat down and applied for countless jobs together and she‚Äôs just not getting a response. Anyways, today, she got a call back for a job at our local hospital, it‚Äôs not glamorous, it‚Äôs a patient transport and nurse aide position, it‚Äôs days, full time, 16.50 an hour, only 10 minutes from our house, and she got an interview, they want to interview her next week but she doesn‚Äôt want to go, she doesn‚Äôt want to do the job. 

I calmly told her we needed the money and I am already working overtime to makeup from where she hasn‚Äôt been working, I‚Äôm ok with this and I told her I‚Äôd do it for some time but it‚Äôs honestly wearing on me, we do 12s in my department and working 5-6 12s in a row is killing me, I still make time to get us out on date nights and hit the gym together and spend time together, and I know she‚Äôs been trying, I‚Äôve filled out the applications with her, but the part I‚Äôm frustrated with is after months, she finally gets a call back and interview set up and now she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt want to work, I told her it‚Äôd simply be a for the time type job and it could help with having some decent income from her side and I wouldn‚Äôt have to work so much extra. 

But now she‚Äôs not wanting to even go to the interview, despite us drowning financially and me working so much extra, I feel disrespected and frustrated and I‚Äôm unsure of what to do next. 

TL;DR, fianc√©e says she wants to help with the finances but once she got a job interview after months she doesn‚Äôt want to pursue it.

He just mentioned to me yesterday that this person is his good female friend. He also called me ""a friend"" in front of a guy he knew and did some more stuff that irritates me, like cancelling meet ups shortly and not explaining why. Any advice is very much appreciated!!!!

Apologies in advance for the length of this post.

So I (f18) have been crushing over this guy (m23) 
for half a year now and he asked me out in december of the past year. I met him at his workplace where we started talking and exchanging our insta. At first we were just polite with each other and I didn't ask him out because I was shy, so we kind of lost contact after a while. I should also mention that he is the first guy I'm romantically interested in, so it's pretty confusing and new to me dating a guy.

We went on our first official date in early january and we hit it off quite well. My mind was constantly occupied with him from that moment on, always checking my phone to see if he messaged me, talking about him to people close to me, all of that stuff, yk. 

Right from the start, he clarified to me that he'd want to take it slow and just get to meet me fully, which I agreed to. 

It always took him a long tine to respond to messages, which irritated me quite a bit, but I didn't mention it to him out of fear of starting a fuss. We hung out a couple more times and he told me about this 12 day trip he was going on to South Korea in March, right around the time when he turns 24. At that time, he always mentioned he was going with a ""person"" but never elaborated any further. One time I tried to dig a bit further and asked him if it was a family member or friend of his, and his response was something along the lines of ""I would just call them a person.""

That irked me right from the getgo, but I didn't pry any further and just let it be. We continued to meet each other and he'd always take a long time responding me, making me overthink things time and time again. Sometimes he'd say we could meet up on a certain day, then just cancel it by saying he was busy, never explaining what exactly he was doing.

I invited him over to my house on the 13th of february because my mom wasn't home and, yk, I wanted to show him how I live and explore things a bit further with him, if you catch my drift. We had discussed doing something on the 14th, but he told me that he'd be busy and couldn't meet up after all, when I asked him if he was meeting his friends he just... didn't respond. He took my virginity that night, then left at 1 AM, apologizing and saying that we'd meet again soon. I'm ususally not a great fan of holidays, but it still hurt me he suddenly couldn't meet on valentines day despite making plans then not explaining why.

Mind you, we still didn't have any label on our relationship and were still ""meeting each other"" one month into seeing each other. 

He came over to my house two more times (he slept over on both occasions), had intercourse both times (mind you, he's alway very respectful and never pressures me into anything). He even met my mother twoce and had lengthy discussions about politics with her and cuddled around with my two dogs. When I asked him if I could go over to his house, he'd always say things like ""no, not yet"" or ""I don't feel comfortable with that"", which I fully understand and no one should be pressured into inviting someone over and they should take the time they need. But with the context of everything else, I sort of have this suspicion that he might live with someone he doesn't want me to meet.

All of these things that happened have led me to feeling insecure and overthink everything, always keeping my stress level pretty high. I messaged him yesterday and told him I could come meet him at his workplace, as we usually do. I arrived 2 hours beofre his shift ended and normally he'd just tell me to sit down next to him so we could talk. This time, though, he said he'd rather like it if I came back later because he'd be busy with clients, which I 100% understand. So I just hung around town for a while. After I came back, a dude was sitting next to him, chatting him up and whatnot, and when he saw me he gave sort of ignored me at first. I was just waiting patiently, looking at stuff in the store when I sort of picked up what they were saying. 

He told that guy ""sorry, I have to go, my FRIEND is waiting for me."" That really irked me once again, and confused me, becuase we are surely not just FRIENDS, not boyfriend and girlfriend I guess, but I would certainly say that we're not just FRIENDS. 

The guy went on his way and the two of us started waling through town to get something to eat, and I was already a bit agitated at this point. So I decided it was finally time to ask him about his trip to south Korea, and that's where he finally revealed that this mystery ""person"" was actually his ""good female friend"" whose dog he had already shown me photographs of. And look, I have absolutely no problem with having friends of the opposite gender, one of my best friends is a guy who I love to hang out with a lot. I usually am a very non jealous person, but this time something about it just irks me.

And I'm sorry, but if he calls me his friend in front of a random dude, then I don't know how much of the ""good female friend"" part is true. Plus, this trip is 12 days long just when it's his birthday and he for some reason didn't want to mention who exactly he was going with TWO WEEKS before the trip when we've been ""meeting"" for TWO MONTHS.

We discussed our relationship a bit further as well, him always buttering me up with pickup lines and saying that the way it's going 1-10 for him was a 12, but it just felt very insincere after all of the previous stuff. I asked him again what he'd label our relationship because I was confused, and he couldn't give me a straight answer. ""I'd say we're still meeting each other, we're dating because we're going out on dates but we're not ACTUALLY dating, once the time comes I'll ask you out properly. When? Uh. I don't know?""

And when we continued talking and I mentioned he was the chillest person I've dated yet (which is true). He said ""WHOA so we are dating now???"" and when I responded ""well I guess not then, you know what I mean, uh, a person you go on dates with"", he said ""oooof so I mean nothing to you then???"" I guess he meant it in a playful way, but it just annoyed me. He also mentioned that he was really just interested in me and didn't have the time to see anyone else, but I honestly sort of have my doubts about that.

When we walked back to the station to go on our spereate trains he told me he couldn't meet on saturday as we had previously discussed a bit,  once again didn't clarify why and didn't say anything when I asked him if he was seeing his buddies. He told me he liked me a lot and we could meet up on sunday, but honestly I'm not sure if I wanna do this any longer. He messaged me shortly after, sending a kissy emoji and mentioning that he'd like to watch lord of the rings with me soon... and I really wasn't in the mood to text him back, so I left him on delivered until this morning when I responded sweetly but in a much colder tone that I usually do, without any kissy emoji. And, to be fair, he left me on delivered for almost a whole day a couple of times, but I still feel kinda bad. He read the message but didn't respond. Dunno if that's a sign that he's hurt it took me long to respond, but I honestly don't care that much anymore. Sonetines we just don't text for days and then reach out to meet on a certain day that we'd discussed perviously. I don't know if it's the same situation this time, though.

I really don't know what to do and if I'm just overreacting over everything, if you have any advice or wisdom you are willing to share, I'd be beyond grateful. What do you think of the situation? Should I still continue seeing him? Is his friend really just a friend? If I should text him, what should I say?

Thank you so much if you've read till here, I'm not really good at getting to the point when I'm telling stories and very much aware that this post might seem chaotically structured.

2025-02-27 19:16:07,1iznwb6,How can I (30F) move on from a bad conflict with my sister-in-law (38F)?,"Hello. My husband (40M) and I have been married for a year and a half. The day after Christmas, it came out in a nasty way that my sister-in-law (husband's sister) has been holding resentments and grudges about weird, random things for the past 7 years (long story). I had no clue about it as she‚Äôs never brought anything up before. We finally talked it out on the phone the other day (2 months after the fact). People have been telling me what an unpleasant and mean person she is for years now but I always got along with her so I would defend her. It‚Äôs clear now that she is. Turns out she is quite cold, harsh, grossly judgmental, and super uptight and has been fake towards me this whole time.

An example that I think paints a picture of her pretty well is from the night I left my husband's surprise 40th bday party a¬†*little*¬†early in December 2023 (she and I planned it together). I said I was going to go because I was ""tired"". Backstory: I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and released from the ICU 3 days prior and was overwhelmed at the party and wanted to leave so I could sob in peace lol. When I gave her those details the other day, she responded, ""Look, you're not going to change my mind. That's my perception. The optics are bad. You should have just said you were leaving because you were overwhelmed and wanted to cry."" Like ok....I guess?? The majority of the people at the party knew that I just got out of the ICU and that I was having a hard time adjusting. She's just not a very understanding or empathetic person.

Anyways, our phone conversation was an exhausting 50 minutes and though she offered some concessions and forced, light apologies, the conversation left a lot to be desired. I also apologized for some things that I felt she rightfully criticized. We did get to a place of some mutual understanding but I'm still having a hard time moving on from it all. She said so many awful things 2 months ago, including how she feels bad for my husband for having to ""deal with me"", she complained about the fact that people were ""singing my praises"" at my wedding, accused me of faking illnesses for attention (literally not true at all), and other strange shit.

How can I forgive and forget?? I really want to get to that place. I can tell my negative feelings are poisoning me and it's not great for my marriage.

**TL;DR:**¬†OP (F) has been married for 1.5 years and recently discovered that her sister-in-law (husband‚Äôs sister) has secretly held grudges against her for seven years. This came out in a hurtful way after Christmas. Despite always defending her, OP now sees her SIL as judgmental and unempathetic. A recent phone call (after two months of tension) led to some mutual understanding but was exhausting and unsatisfying. SIL made harsh comments, including accusations of faking illnesses for attention and feeling bad for OP‚Äôs husband.

2025-02-27 18:46:26,1izn67k,I think my (26f) boyfriend (32m) might be addicted to porn??,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 2 years, living together for almost 1 year. 

Around 1 year into the relationship I found out that he was video chatting with cam girls online and hiding it for several moths before I found out. He created a fake email and was making cam site accounts to talk to them (Chaturbate). He had previously told me he watched cam girls, which I learned to accept, but actually having a 2 way video is crossing the line for me. I ended up confronting him about it and he initially was denying/downplaying, but I had proof so he eventually caved. I consider this cheating, and he agreed that it would be cheating if I was the one who did it. He was pissed at me because I found out by going through his phone, which I know is a breach of trust, but I would have never known.

He agreed to not even look at cam sites anymore, only pre recorded porn. He also agreed to do therapy (only ChatGPT therapy though), but that didn't last long. 

Our relationship was ROUGH after I moved in, I was really shitty to live with because I had a lot of anxiety even before finding out about this. He kind of blamed the cheating on this. 

I have been trying SO HARD to be a better person, for myself and the relationship. I went on anxiety meds which have helped tremendously. He even agreed that things have been much better. He lets me look through his phone upon request, so I've been trying to trust him. 

I did the shitty thing again and went through his iPad. He deletes everything now, emails, search history, everything. BUUUT I saw in his private browser that he accessed cam sites 2 weeks ago. 

I'm conflicted about this. I don't know how to proceed. I know its just porn and he wasn't on video with them, but he promised me he wouldn't go on cam sites anymore. And I also promised him I would ask permission to go through his stuff, so I am also in the wrong.

Should I ask to see his phone and then all of a sudden ""figure out that he was on those sites"", then confront him about it? I'm thinking about asking him for his phone, then straight up asking him if he still goes on cam sites, then when he lies asking him if he likes our relationship. I'd give him an ultimatum saying he has to go to therapy and stick with it, and tell him I think he has a porn addiction.

2025-02-27 17:54:28,1izlwcm,My (31F) bf (39M) says things to intentionally hurt me and then denies it,"
TL;DR my boyfriend intentionally says things to get a rise out of me and then denies doing it. 

We (31F and 39M) have been seeing each other for a year. He has some mental health issues including BPD, ADHD, depression, and anxiety. He was also in the military and has PTSD from that. I also think he has some narcissistic traits, but as far as I know he hasn‚Äôt been officially diagnosed with NPD.

Sometimes, especially when drinking, he says things that seem to be intentionally meant to upset me or get a strong emotional reaction out of me. For example, he‚Äôll try to make me jealous by making comments about other women from his past, or he‚Äôll give me backhanded compliments. Sometimes he will also insult/belittle me. (He claims that‚Äôs his love language and says it‚Äôs just ‚Äúplayful roasting‚Äù and that I should get a thicker skin, but it‚Äôs still hurtful.)
 He gets extremely jealous over me having male friends/talking to other guys in any capacity, and he has some insecurity issues. He tries to ‚Äútalk himself up‚Äù a lot, if that makes sense. For example: He frequently brags about performing psychological warfare on people when he was in the military, being an excellent marksman, how he has tortured and hurt people in the military, etc. 

He‚Äôll also make comments about how he thinks I deserve better than him, how I‚Äôm ‚Äúout of his league‚Äù and that he doesn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm with him. 
I try to reassure him that I love him and I‚Äôm extremely attracted to him, but nothing seems to help. 

If I try to bring any of this up and talk to him, he gets angry with me. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm posting here. There are also a lot of times when he‚Äôll deny saying/doing all of these things. Or he‚Äôll try to twist it and say it didn‚Äôt happen that way, etc. I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind.

All this makes him sound like a monster. I really don‚Äôt think he is. He just has a lot of baggage and trauma. But I‚Äôm not sure how to deal with this. 
Any advice is much appreciated.

2025-02-27 16:43:01,1izk5qz,I 30f found suspicious chats on my 30m phone,"How should I bring this up to him? And would this be grounds to leave?

We both allow each other access to our phones and share the same password. He was in the shower the other day and I needed to retrieve a verification code that was sent to his phone so I went onto it and got the code. Out of genuine curiosity I had a look at his messenger and saw that he has chats with multiple women, I recognised multiple names..two are his ex's and there are a few women he's spoken about to me that he went to school with and said he had crushes on (he's very open to me about his past so we casually will talk about things like this). There were also women that I didn't recognise. I found the same on his instagram chats..just so many women that he chats with sexually.

The main thing that stood out to me was one chat in particular. Every single message that he has ever sent her has been deleted by him and she's on disappearing mode. They message almost daily, so he must be deleting his messages right after their conversation for the day. It was right after Valentine's Day and the chat history said the chat background had been changed to Valentine's Day theme by my husband then the day after he changed it to a shooting star theme. It seems extremely obvious to me what the contents of the chat are..and he clearly doesn't want me to see it.

I also found a chat with a female friend of his where he said a few things that hurt me badly. For example my husband and I were intimate and he was on his phone, turns out he had been messaging this friend to say that his wife was giving him head but he's imagining that it's her instead. He also said at a later date to her that if she was ever in town he'd cheat to sleep with her, then he said no wait, I'll get the seal of approval from my wife like a good boy.

Its hard to read the stuff that he writes to these women. He is the one initiating sexual conversations with them and they just barely reciprocate..he is constantly asking them for nudes and videos and has sent mirror selfies of himself in tight spandex to them. He sounds extremely hypersexual in these chats.

I'm just unsure how to initiate this conversation with my husband because I feel guilty that I was indeed on his phone looking at his chats. But he has my full permission to do the same with my phone when I'm not in the room. And he changed his phone password to match mine on his own accord so we'd both easily be able to access each others phones if needed. So please help, how should I bring this up with him?

Tl;dr my husband gave numerous suspicious chats on his phone and I'm now contemplating leaving over it amongst other issues

2025-02-27 16:26:52,1izjrhi,My (27F) boyfriend (28M) makes me feel bad for being sick.,"My boyfriend and i have been together for 3 years. I‚Äôve been having some health problems recently, nothing serious, but it causes me to feel extremely fatigued 80% of the time. I‚Äôm taking medication but the doctor says its gonna take about a year for me to be healthy again. 

Because of my health problems I‚Äôm only able to work part time at the moment. I only work 4 hours a day mon-fri. Some days i come home from work feeling okay, but other times i feel exhausted. Whenever i do feel tired my boyfriend gets annoyed and asks me why my medication hasn‚Äôt been working, even though he knows its going to take time for me to start feeling better. 

Here‚Äôs the thing though, my boyfriend works a remote job where he only has to send emails and attend 1-2 meetings a day, which only last about an hour or two, and the rest of the time he‚Äôs either napping, watching Netflix or playing video games, and yet he‚Äôs always complaining about how tired he is. I never say anything to him about why he‚Äôs feeling tired despite hardly ever working because i don‚Äôt want to make him feel bad. 

I‚Äôll also mention this because i think its relevant and might explain why he‚Äôs behaving like this towards me, but he thinks that my job is super easy (i work at a daycare) and doesn‚Äôt require hard work or skill so i shouldn‚Äôt be feeling this tired. But he literally rots in his bed 80% of the time, has no physical or mental health issues and is still somehow tired??

How should i handle this situation?

Tldr: my boyfriend gets annoyed at me for being tired all the time despite only working part time (i have a medical condition that causes extreme fatigue so i cant work full time at the moment), yet he‚Äôs also extremely tired all the time despite having a remote job and only working for around 2 hours per day and spending the rest of his day napping, gaming or watching tv. 

Ps: we don‚Äôt live together and when we go out on dates we split everything 50/50 so i don‚Äôt rely on him financially.

2025-02-27 16:24:16,1izjpa3,Is my BF (36M) to critical of me (25M)?,"    **TL;DR;** : 
    I've been considering breaking up with my bf for a couple months now due to his harsh words and constant criticism.

I've been thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend for a couple of months now. The main issue is that when he's frustrated or angry with me, I don‚Äôt feel seen or heard. I also struggle to understand why some of these situations make him so upset in the first place.

For context, I‚Äôm 25, he‚Äôs 36, and we‚Äôve been together for 2.5 years. I love him a lot, and he does a lot for me, but when he‚Äôs frustrated, he doesn‚Äôt speak to me kindly. Meanwhile, when I‚Äôm upset about something, I try to be calm, considerate, and constructive with my words.

For example, if I were to accidentally lock my keys in my car, making us late to something, he‚Äôd help me get back in‚Äîbut then spend 10‚Äì20 minutes angrily berating me for making such a mistake, sometimes cursing in the process. Even when I apologize and tell him I‚Äôll try not to repeat it, it still turns into me getting chewed out because he feels inconvenienced.

This happens in all kinds of ways. He has a low tolerance for things not being done exactly as he expects‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs how we clean the apartment or how I handle day-to-day tasks. Making an effort isn‚Äôt enough in his eyes; it has to be done the ""right"" way (his way). At this point, I feel like I get a ‚Äútalking to‚Äù at least once a week.

He acknowledges that external stressors make him more irritable and has agreed to try speaking to me more kindly. But at the same time, he also says I‚Äôm the cause of his frustration and thinks it‚Äôs unfair for me to ask him to be nicer when, in his view, he already set the expectation and I just didn‚Äôt meet it.

At this point, I don‚Äôt know if this is something that therapy could actually help with, or if he even sees this as a real issue‚Äîversus just a problem I‚Äôm making up. Should I keep trying, or call it quits now and save my self-worth for someone who speaks to me as an equal and with more respect?","Should I keep trying to make my relationship work, or should I break up with my boyfriend to protect my self-worth?","The individual is 25 years old and has been in a relationship with her boyfriend, who is 36, for 2.5 years. She describes feeling unseen and unheard during conflicts, particularly when her boyfriend expresses frustration or criticism.

2025-02-27 16:05:26,1izj8ob,Geographical incompatibility (?) between me 33F and boyfriend 33M. Do I try harder or go away?,"We‚Äôve been in a relationship for 3 years already, 2 of these years we spent living and working abroad in a country we met in - we both knew living in this country is going to be temporary. From the beginning he was transparent he wants to live in his hometown which is tiny village in a country neighbouring with mine. I agreed to that even though I was apprehensive since I‚Äôm not a fan of the countryside. I love nature and outdoor activities but I prefer to live in a big city because I thrive much better in busy and fast environment. 1 year ago we moved to his house in the countryside, first problem I noticed was work since there are basically no jobs here, especially not for someone who doesn‚Äôt know the language fluently. Thankfully I was able to land corporate job in finance with possibility of working remotely for most of the time with only 4 days a month in the office in the city. I didn‚Äôt get even one 100% remote offer so I had to accept hybrid job even though my boyfriend wasn‚Äôt happy that I‚Äôm going to spend few days a month there. Other problems started to appear. I found out it‚Äôs super hard to find friends in a tiny village in a foreign country, especially when you‚Äôre 30 and most of the women your age around you already have children and groups of friends they‚Äôve had since they were kids. Another thing is that I find village really boring. I am aware there are hundreds things to do around here, hiking, mountains, sports of all kind etc. but I miss just being able to go out of my house, jump onto the metro and go to a pub, cafe, theatre etc. Most of our free time here in the winter we spend on our phones or watching movies. I finish work at 5 when it‚Äôs already dark so outdoor activities are for weekends only. I feel suffocated, I am becoming depressed (I started SSRI which helps a bit) and I pick fights with my boyfriend because of it and I‚Äôm not proud of that. I love him a lot but I‚Äôm slowly losing my mind. He is trying to be understanding but as he hates the city, he can‚Äôt comprehend why do I prefer tiny flat in the city from huge house with garden in a countryside‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs also telling me that it‚Äôs not boring here because there‚Äôs always something to do around the house, some outdoor activity etc. and if I wanna go for coffee I can drive to nearby town. I know he is right but for some reason I feel unmotivated to do anything at all and I am starting to wonder, should I try much harder to like it here or just have serious conversation with him about how I feel living in this place? We spoke about it several times and he told me I need to make the decision to stay or go by myself because he will not move from here and he was transparent about it from the beginning (I am aware of it and I obviously understand why he wants to live here and nowhere else). I am not sure about what my next steps should be. Should I let go or try hard to fall in love with the place even though my heart doesn‚Äôt feel it (yet)? 

TLDR: we live in my boyfriends hometown in a countryside, I struggle here and keep wondering if I can make it since I am definitely a city person. I am slowly starting going crazy. Should I try harder or my gut is telling me this place is not a good fit? ","Should I try harder to love living in the countryside, or is my gut right in telling me it's not a good fit for me?","The individual has been in a relationship for 3 years, spending 2 of those years living and working abroad in a country where they initially met their boyfriend.

A year ago, they moved to the boyfriend's house in the countryside, where the individual faced difficulties finding work due to a lack of job opportunities and language barriers.

Socially, the individual struggles to find friends in the village, particularly at the age of 30, where most nearby women have established families and friendships.

I was hooking up with someone, and after we had sex for the first time, they asked if they could use their vibrator to finish. I said yes, but it ended up taking an hour, and the whole situation felt really awkward. I eventually picked up on the tension and left the room (and they continued while I was kind of feeling anxious/weird/uncomfortable/slightly triggered in their living room/bathroom). I don‚Äôt know why, but the whole thing unsettled me.

I saw them again last weekend, and they‚Äôve also told me that making the first move makes them feel pressured when I‚Äôm nervous around them and that they feel pressure to orgasm‚Äîeven when we were just sexting. That‚Äôs been sticking with me because I never want someone to feel pressured with me, and I don‚Äôt know if I should bring it up. Is this worth acknowledging, or should let it go?

2025-02-27 15:36:12,1izij3k,Jealous of my Gf talking to this guy,"Tldr: my(26m) gf(26f) went on a trip with office colleagues to attend someone's marriage. They were talking to each other alone on roof of the hotel late in the night. She broke down due to office pressure and told him how she feels unappreciated at work and started crying. This guy kissed her on top of her head to comfort her. She told him she was not comfortable with it and that's all for the night. She told this to me and we had a fight. I told her to stop talking to him. She agreed, we discussed it will be awkward to fully ignore him at work as they were in same team. We agreed it was the guys fault and not her's. We agreed that she will talk to him for work related stuff. The guy apologized to her. We agreed she stays friends with him.

This all happened 2yrs ago.

The guy changed company 1/1.5yrs ago. They still talk to each other and it makes me uncomfortable.

I've told her I'm fine with her talking to him but tbh I'm not.

I've observed him call and text her at multiple occasions.

Once my gf and I were on a trip and this guy called her at 11pm at night, he also called her on new year(she was out with me and told him that she'll call back once she's home, didn't mention who she was out with)

I was fine with it but in both scenarios my gf did not mention she was with me(maybe it wasn't required but still)

The guy already knew that she's visiting City x when he had called but didn't know she was visiting to meet me.

I don't think she hides this from me but I feel uncomfortable due to the one unfortunate night.

I'm wrong in all this? Should I just ignore or should I talk to her that this is making me uncomfortable.

Please advise. I'm happy to know if I'm wrong in all this. We plan to get married in another year but whenever I see this guy contacting her it bugs me.

My boyfriend is 23, also studying, and he takes care of himself fully. My parents are very involved in my life, to the point where they want to know what I‚Äôm doing every single day. They‚Äôre Slavic, which means they have their own quirks, can be quite mean, and are extremely judgmental and perfectionist. Because of this, I already hide a lot of my life from them.

They don‚Äôt even know we‚Äôre together, but they already dislike my boyfriend. The issue started because of a misunderstanding about where he lives. He never actually told me either, but I kind of knew. He always told me it took him 10 to 20 minutes to get home from my place, when in reality, it was more like 25 to 30 minutes. The reason? He wanted to drive me home every day to spend more time with me, and he didn‚Äôt want me to worry that it was an inconvenience for him to get home.

When my parents found out, they blew it way out of proportion. In their eyes, he‚Äôs some kind of criminal, a liar with bad intentions, and someone who‚Äôs going to hurt me. They believe ‚Äúpeople like him‚Äù should only be just friends and that I should never even think of dating him. They think the whole situation is completely messed up, that he ""lied"" about where he lives because he actually lives on the other side of the city, and that he was using me because I have a car.
But I keep telling them‚Äîit isn‚Äôt like that. He‚Äôs a good guy. He genuinely just wanted to spend more time with me and didn‚Äôt want to inconvenience me. But they refuse to see it that way. And the truth is, even if this whole misunderstanding about his location never happened, I know they still wouldn‚Äôt approve‚Äîmainly because he‚Äôs Black, and I‚Äôm white and Eastern European. They want me to date a white guy, but the reality is, I only find my boyfriend attractive, I love him deeply, and I want to make this work.

Since I live away from them, I‚Äôve been trying to subtly bring up the good things he does for me‚Äîhelping me with apartment stuff, government-related things I don‚Äôt understand, taking me to a concert, buying me flowers and chocolates, and supporting me in tough moments without expecting anything in return. My hope is that, over time, they‚Äôll see that he‚Äôs a great person and won‚Äôt change their negative perception of him.

But I don‚Äôt know if this is the right approach. Should I just keep giving them time? Is there any way to shift their mindset, or am I stuck with their disapproval forever? If anyone has dealt with something similar, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

Recently my girlfriend (of a year and 2 months) and I have been in a cycle of her telling me she wants to break up. We‚Äôve been having problems with intimacy for 4 months. We haven‚Äôt had sex but we are still affectionate. We kiss and snuggle all the time. She‚Äôs very depressed and tells me she just wants to retreat, that she feels an insane amount of guilt. That she doesn‚Äôt know how to be the partner I deserve. We talk things out and end up coming to a conclusion that we just need to create more space for ourselves. This ends up helping things, at least I think they help because I will feel better and more secure about the relationship, and she will have more energy for us. 

She is an amazing person, and we‚Äôve always gotten along well, even when we are sad we show each other love and compassion. This week felt different, though. I think it‚Äôs all coming to a breaking point. We had a talk the other day, cried in each other‚Äôs arms, pondered what we could do. We decided to make space again. 

I am left confused and sad. She told me she feels better when she‚Äôs alone, but she doesn‚Äôt want to lose me. She said I am someone she‚Äôd like to be with, that she can‚Äôt imagine someone else. The thing that confuses me is that she tells me these things like they are mutually exclusive. I believe we can be together while she works through her depression, that she can have more alone time to focus on herself and her family but I‚Äôm not sure what she truly wants. There‚Äôs no clear problem when we talk about this, just that she is sad and doesn‚Äôt know what else to do besides break up. 

How do we navigate this? I don‚Äôt want to break up with her, but I have been filled with so much guilt and doubt. I feel like a failure of a partner though I am doing my best to support her. I just want to hang out with her, to hold her, to share my life with her.

2025-02-27 12:22:46,1izehzz,I am considering leaving my almost perfect relationship and am afraid i will hate myself for it,"I (31 F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (32 M) for 6 years now. We had a rocky start but since then we have been inseparable. I grew a lot in this relationship but i feel like he had such a growth. When we started he was this jealous type, always shitting down when we were fighting, never did any digging into himself and his past traumas/experiences. Now, after long talks and numerous fights about it, he is a changed man. He regularly sees a psichologist, is such a good communicator and knows himself better. I am so proud of him. The problem we have is his difficulty in expressing his feelings in a physical way. He was never the touchy type, his love language being more acts of service and i was generally fine with that but lately its been taking a toll on me. We also moved to Switzerland recently (we changed 3-4 countries since dating) and the higher stress of our jobs (the need to perform here is higher compared to other countries), combined with his general lack of physical closeness and the very poor social life here turned us into roommates. I do not feel a physical attraction to him anymore, don‚Äôt feel like having sex with him and am generally bored. Also, as it always happen when i have relationship issues, i started thinking about an old flame i had great sexual chemistry with and end up asking myself what if. Tried talking to him about it but i feel like the problem now is with me. All throughout our relationship, i had the higher libido and there were long periods of time where i wanted to have sex and he didnt and we would often fight about it and i would get frustrated. Now it‚Äôs the other way around only for me now its literally a lack of attraction. I love him, i know i do, i am just not into him anymore. Since i feel that this country is also not made for me, i have often considered moving to a sunnier country, a place that often comes to my mind is Barcelona, after having visited it twice last year. I was honest w him about it and with the fact i cant really put my finger on the actual issue: me, us or the country but that i feel i will regret it not trying to live in a big vibrant city as i had always wanted to. He told me he doesnt wanna live in a big city and he doesnt want to move out of here for the next 4 years at least. He wants to make more money and work experience so he can get a good salary in other countries. I dont want to wait that long here, i feel it would drive me crazy. The question is, do i leave a safe relationship w a great guy with whom maybe i can bring bach the passion if we work on it or do i leave to live the life i believe i want, with all the risks that come with? And with the knowledge i will lose my relationship

A few weeks ago my fiance who I‚Äôve been with for 7 years came to me and said he thinks he has a problem with lying and manipulating. 

This was the first I was hearing about this. Apparently he regularly lies to those closest to him to keep up appearances. Whether it‚Äôs exaggerating accomplishments, lying about going to the gym or bigger lies like having cheated on a partner in the past. 

He‚Äôs admitted all of this to me and said he wants to seek help. He‚Äôs since organised to see a therapist.

During this time I asked that he go stay somewhere else because I needed time to process. He ended up staying with his parents who enabled his behavior and tried to convince him that this was not that serious. 

Even worse, they then started placing the blame on me saying they were concerned about his well being because I‚Äôve exhibited controlling behaviours. He claims to have refuted their claims and made it clear that I am very loving and supportive but I do occasionally get upset with him because he constantly fails to deliver on promises (which he acknowledged was in part due to his lying)

Please also keep in mind that he‚Äôs closer with his family since I came along and his family have on multiple occasions acknowledged this and thanked me. An abusive person would isolate you, not push you closer to your family. Also, I‚Äôve done so much for them and have treated them like my own parents/siblings and asked for nothing in return. 

I am at a loss for words and feel so hurt by his family. I‚Äôm also hurt that they‚Äôve refused to check in on me and said they‚Äôre concerned about him. He‚Äôs now back with me but they are now making plans without me. This seems to signal they‚Äôre concerned about him around me but I genuinely do not understand where this is coming from. 

I feel so lost and betrayed by a family that I thought I was a part of.  I want to be on good terms with his family but I feel like that isn‚Äôt possible given they seem to hate me. What can I do to move forward with his family?

2025-02-27 11:34:12,1izdpb6,Do I push my progress in my relationship or slow down for my mum? How do I navigate those boundaries?,"TL;DR: My relationship with my partner has been going well since my parents finally loosened up, but we‚Äôre at the stage now where it‚Äôs figuring out where those boundaries are. I wonder if it‚Äôs right or not to ask if I can stay at my partner‚Äôs for a week or two when his parents aren‚Äôt there. Or at least how to go about that.

Hey everyone! I hope you‚Äôre doing well!!

Things have been going alright between me (21F) and my parents (Mum 45F and Dad 54M) when it comes to my relationship with my partner (20M). 

Despite me being 20 when my relationship began it was always hard to spend time with my partner without the restrictions of a 16 year old girl. But after a year and a half of pushing that I was capable of handling my own relationship and so on, they started to relax on me going out with my partner longer than  6PM, sleeping over at his and so on and so forth.

I can tell my mum still feels uncomfortable from time to time, she‚Äôs understandably overprotective, but she rarely fights back anymore about it. I gained my own independence and control in my relationship, and I‚Äôm really happy about it!

The advice I need on is figuring out how slow I should take the progress of my relationship for my mum. 

My partner asked me last November that he‚Äôll be alone in April since his parents are away, he suggested that maybe I could live with him during that time so we can get a feel on what it‚Äôs like to live together. I agreed as well, however, he been hesitant to ask since things have always been rocky with me and my parents when it comes to these things.

I‚Äôve seen couples spend time together like that for a week or more, so I think it would be fine. But my mum is overprotective and won‚Äôt see it as normal.

I want to do this, even for a week would be fine, but I‚Äôm worried that she won‚Äôt take it well or assume I‚Äôll just do something horrible during that time. I also don‚Äôt want to push the boundaries, I know they‚Äôre finally trying to let loose and I don‚Äôt want to take a mile when I‚Äôve been given an inch (if that phrasing is right lol).

It‚Äôs really hard to talk to my parents, they can be stubborn and while I‚Äôm usually calm around others it‚Äôs hard to keep my cool around them.

How do I go about this? Do I just ask her advice on it? Im thinking I‚Äôll say his parents are gone for two weeks and just hopefully land on two weeks‚Äîthen if an argument does come out and I lose at least I‚Äôll be able to sleepover at his for that one weekend his parents are ‚Äòat home‚Äô. 

I feel bad for wanting it to be honest, a part of me doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right since they‚Äôve actually been trying this time but I also don‚Äôt want to keep this cycle of slowing down my relationship to make my mum comfortable. 

And there‚Äôs also the fact that if I don‚Äôt do this I‚Äôll disappoint my partner, he‚Äôs always been there for me and is very understanding but I know he looks forward to spending that time with me and it would be nice to see a glimpse of what our future could be like together.

Any perspective is well appreciated, I hope I‚Äôll be able to navigate this on my own soon. I wish everyone the best of luck and a good day/night, thank you for taking the time to read my troubles :‚Äô). 

Edit: I realise a bit after making this post it‚Äôs a bit childish to ask how to figure out boundaries with my parents. While I can communicate with a lot of people in my life me and my parents never really created that relationship where we can communicate we need boundaries. We‚Äôre all stubborn and butt heads a lot‚Äîand I know I‚Äôm at fault for some of our arguments. So it‚Äôs difficult to communicate really, especially without me caving in as usual because I feel bad.",How can I ask my overprotective mother if I can stay at my partner's house for a week when his parents are away without causing conflict?,"The individual is a 21-year-old female who has been navigating a relationship with her 20-year-old partner. She has experienced significant restrictions from her parents, a 45-year-old mother and a 54-year-old father, particularly during her teenage years, making it challenging to spend time alone with her partner. 

The relationship began when she was 20, but due to her parents' overprotective nature, particularly her mother's, she faced limits on how late she could be out and whether she could stay over at her partner's place. However, after about a year and a half of advocating for her independence, her parents have started to relax their restrictions, although her mother still feels uncomfortable at times.

The individual acknowledges that communication with her parents is challenging, as they tend to be stubborn and often butt heads. She recognizes her own role in some of the conflict and finds it difficult to express her needs for boundaries without feeling guilty. Despite these struggles, she is happy with the progress in her relationship, but she is currently uncertain about how to approach discussing spending a week or two at her partner's home when his parents are away.

2025-02-27 10:56:54,1izd520,Deal breaker?,"Hi Community, me (27F) and my 4 month old bf (28M) are struggling with some issues.
A few days before he came to my house and told me that he was concerned he can't speak freely about Sex with me, and that sometimes feels that he ""lacks"" me sending him nude photos, or maybe recording us during Sex.

He also has a past of experiencing Cuckolding, which I tried to ignore. I mentioned it and he said that it has nothing to do with it but as I'm a Latina and he German, was schocked that I was impressed by the idea of going to a Sauna (naked in front of other naked people), or that once we watched a horror movie and the first half an hour was about naked woman so I decided to change it.

I also bought Sex toys and things to experiment with him, but he someway overthough how open I can be, mentioning ridiculous things as he might feel uncomfortable offering me doing 69 which we already did and that I do things for him only, which I clearly denied because it was my decision.  I'm also into some BSDM stuff so doesn't make sense at all.

Something about this feels off, I don't really know how to react, it someway feels wicked how he says that he is lacking that from my side, and at the same time he understood that i'm not ok with it. Why would he bring it to the table when he know how I am and if it was not that relevant? He told me that he only wanted to be sincere with me and that that's the way he is.

I was insecure and told him that now I feel that we'll look for that in other people, he denied it and told me that before that our relationship will be ended. 

I'm focusing on knowing him more as a person and he already feels that lack? I don't know

TL;DR: My recent boyfriend mentioned feeling some kind of lack in our relationship because I don't send him nudes, or that I'm not that ""open"" to his mind sexually, when I don't think I'm that terrible.","Why does my boyfriend feel a lack in our relationship because I don't send him nudes or consider his sexual preferences, and how should I address this?","The individual posting is a 27-year-old female (27F) who is currently in a relationship with her boyfriend, who is 28 years old.

2025-02-27 10:44:15,1izcymn,Need Advice: Am I Overreacting or Seeing a Major Red Flag?,"Hey everyone, I (35M) need some perspective on a situation with my fianc√©e (25F).

We‚Äôre both Christians, and we made the mistake of having premarital sex. We recognized it was wrong, repented, and wanted to move forward. But after we did, she made some hurtful statements comparing me to her past lovers‚Äîinsinuating that she‚Äôs had better experiences. She even said it made her ‚Äúfeel like going back‚Äù (to them).

That cut deep. I felt dishonored as a man, disrespected, and like I‚Äôm second best to the woman I plan to spend my life with. I‚Äôve never had a woman say something like that to me, even when I was still out in the world. And to be clear, I‚Äôm not naive‚ÄîI don‚Äôt expect to be the best partner she‚Äôs ever had. But what bothers me most is that she said it. It‚Äôs one thing to think something privately, but to voice it so casually? The Bible says, ‚ÄúOut of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.‚Äù

Ironically, she‚Äôs also not the best partner I‚Äôve had, but I‚Äôd never say that to her. At this stage in life, for me, sex is about connection and bonding, not just performance. And now, no matter how much she apologizes or tries to backtrack, the damage is done. I can‚Äôt shake the thought that this is how she truly sees me. The sanctity and exclusivity of our relationship feel tainted, and she‚Äôs introduced insecurities that I never had before.

At this point, I don‚Äôt feel like moving forward with the marriage. Am I overthinking this? Being insecure or immature? Or is this a valid reason to walk away and save myself future heartbreak? Because right now, I feel like this is a red flag I can‚Äôt ignore.

TL;DR: My fianc√©e and I had premarital sex (we‚Äôve repented), but afterward, she made comments comparing me unfavorably to past lovers and even said it made her ‚Äúfeel like going back‚Äù to them.

Will me M 20 and my girlfriend F 20 ever recover from this? Or is it too late?


My girlfriend and I have been dating for a year and 3 months now and we both are each others first serious relationship. I love her so much and I know she loves and cares for me a lot. She is in college right now and recently something happened that has made both of us want to give up on each other but we can‚Äôt. This situation is honestly so shitty it honestly feels worse than being cheated on. Here‚Äôs the story. About three weeks ago I went up to my girlfriend‚Äôs college about an hour 30 minutes away. It was a big party day at her college and I was excited to go up there and have fun. It was also my birthday weekend. Saturday was the big party day and I went up there Friday after work. I have never really had a problem with her friends before I didn‚Äôt really like them but also I could stand them. Friday was fun we didn‚Äôt drink or anything and just stayed in the hotel and chilled because we had to be up early on Saturday. Saturday comes around and we start drinking fairly early. See we do argue a lot when we drink and she does text her friends in the middle of the argument and I have told her not to do that and that in the past and it‚Äôs just not gonna end well. during the day we were completely fine and and actually enjoyed our time together it actually felt like it‚Äôs was gonna be a good day. 

Until we went to the bars later in the night. We both were drinking all day and were both really drunk by like 9-10 pm I don‚Äôt really remember the bar but I remember her being mad at me abt something or just being mad for no reason. So we agree to get an Uber back too the hotel around 9:30. In the Uber we get into a really bad argument I don‚Äôt even know abt what. It leads to us fighting in the hotel it was probably our worst fight yet. I was trying to kick her out of the hotel I paid for and take the vape that I bought for her back bc I was just so pissed. I was going off on her and I caught her recording me talking shit to her which just set me off. I would never hit her but I did try to grab her phone too delete the video and that led to her texting her friends saying she is scared for her life and saying that she needs helps. Her friends took this seriously and started freaking out. We ended up calming down and she texted her friends about 2 hours later saying she was fine and that she was overreacting then we fell asleep. This is where the part that makes me so confused and upset comes in. In the morning her friends are threatening to drop her bc of what she said last night and how worried she made them. 

They said that our relationship is so unhealthy and that she needs to leave me if she wants to be friends with her. They started telling her how she just isn‚Äôt a good friend anymore and she barely spends time with them anymore. Or how she is just always on her phone not talking but even around me sometimes she‚Äôs just on her phone not listening and I have to repeat myself that‚Äôs just her and I‚Äôve accepted that. My girlfriend promised me she is not gonna give up on us and we both agreed that we need to change and I have been I really have. I‚Äôve been managing my emotions better and focusing on myself more. So she had 3 friends that were mad at her. Her roommate ( 1 of the 3 friends) understands the situation and has even agreed that the other 2 friends are being harsh. There saying that if she wants to live in the apartment next year with them that she cannot be in a relationship with me and we‚Äôre telling her how bad I am even though they don‚Äôt even know us or our relationship they just know it off of a few arguments. Me and my girlfriend are still together and we refuse to give up on each other. I just feel like since then it hasn‚Äôt felt the same I‚Äôm not allowed to go up to her school anymore bc I have to respect her friends. I feel like she has been acting 

differently and pulling away. This situation I can tell is really hard on her and making her so confused. She constantly reassures me that she still loves me a lot and is not going to give up and that‚Äôs she‚Äôs just acting like this bc of the situation and how much of a toll it‚Äôs taking on her. We love each other and I will always love her no matter what but i just feel so confused about this whole situation and just think it is so unfair we are being put thru this. I have never felt this confused before and it‚Äôs taken such a toll on me. We are seeing each other this weekend and next weekend she is gonna come home and see me so I‚Äôm hoping that all we needed was to just spend time together. I think it‚Äôs just harder with being away from each other bc when we‚Äôre together everything feels so peaceful and comfortable. It‚Äôs like when we‚Äôre together all of our problems go away until she goes back to college. 

TL;DR
My girlfriend‚Äôs friends are tearing us apart and making her choose between me or living in the apartment with them next year at college. They don‚Äôt understand how much we love each other and how much we need each other.

Things were pretty good in the beginning, we had some issues but we worked past them so nothing crazy. 

However after about 9 months of dating, I noticed the intimacy level start to drop and every month it got lower and lower until it got to the point of where it‚Äôs at now which is us having sex 2-3 times a month. For me that‚Äôs low and I had sit down conversations with her easily over 30 times at this point.

She says she doesn‚Äôt know what changed and then every time she‚Äôll say it‚Äôs because of something else or she says she‚Äôll work on it which she never does. I‚Äôm a very physical touchy person (that‚Äôs my love language) so I feel incredibly frustrated and nowadays she refuses to talk about it. The other thing that is an issue is she doesint want kids ever but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs entirely true cause she‚Äôs said very subtle things that may hint to her wanting one in the future. I used to not want kids either but last year my mindset changed.

The issue is she doesint have license, can‚Äôt travel outside the country, and can‚Äôt really get a real job. We‚Äôve been renewing the marriage license over the last 2.5 years and she‚Äôs tired of it which I understand because she wants to live her life. The only way she can stay would be to get married which our appointment is set for 2/28/25 and if it doesint happen that day she‚Äôll get the ticket to leave the US on Saturday. 

Other than those 2 issues, in every other aspect she‚Äôs the best person I‚Äôve ever met, and I‚Äôve met A LOT of people, she has everything I want in a partner and I really don‚Äôt want her to leave but those 2 issues I mentioned earlier (mainly the intimacy issue) is killing me. Either decision I‚Äôll be stressed but I really don‚Äôt know what to do. 

TD;LR!-should I get married or let my girlfriend go
",Should I get married or let my girlfriend go?,"The individual (M24) has been in a relationship with his girlfriend (F23) for a little over three years. His girlfriend came to the U.S. as an au pair, which indicates that she was initially involved in a cultural exchange program as a live-in nanny. After two months of dating, they officially became a couple, and she moved in with him 2.5 years ago after leaving the au pair program due to host family issues.

The poster has expressed significant concerns regarding intimacy in their relationship, noting a drastic decline in sexual activity which has dropped to 2-3 times a month. He identifies physical affection as his primary love language and has engaged in numerous conversations (over 30) with her about their intimacy issues, which appear to stem from her uncertainty and lack of initiative to address the situation.

Additionally, the girlfriend does not possess a driver's license, cannot travel outside the U.S., and struggles to secure a traditional job. They have been renewing her marriage license for the past 2.5 years, but she is feeling fatigued by this process, desiring more autonomy in her life. A significant deadline looms as they have a marriage appointment set for 2/28/25; if the marriage does not happen on that date, she will have to leave the country. The poster has also undergone a change in his perspective on having children, which has become a point of potential conflict, as she claims not to want kids, though he perceives hints that she may reconsider in the future.",0,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iz8zvs/should_i_get_married_on_22825_or_let_my/,relationships
2025-02-27 05:09:57,1iz88w9,I‚Äôm Tired of People Misinterpreting My Actions‚ÄîHow Do I Stop This?,"
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the problem or if people just love making ridiculous assumptions, but I‚Äôm so tired of this happening to me. No matter what I do, people around me‚Äîfamily, classmates, or even friends‚Äîalways assume I have a crush on any guy I talk to, and it‚Äôs exhausting.


Just the other day, my mum refused to let me take a language class this semester. I had already attended once, but my parents were never supportive of it and always made comments that sounded like bullying. This time, the excuse was beyond absurd‚Äîshe said she wouldn‚Äôt let me go because I was ""just using it as an excuse to mess around the streets."" Like, what?? It made no sense. But honestly, this kind of nonsense isn‚Äôt new in my life.


It all started when I was 15 and had a private math tutor. My parents, for some reason, became convinced that I had a crush on him. Their reasoning? Apparently, the way I spoke seemed like I was trying to flirt. This disturbed me so much because the guy was way older than me, and the idea itself made me uncomfortable. But it didn‚Äôt stop there‚Äîsince I was often under surveillance with my mum during lessons (that's for the best actually) , I started feeling paranoid about my own gestures and words, making sure nothing I did could be ""misinterpreted"" again. Even my brother joined in with this so I felt truly hopeless. The truth is, I actually disliked him because he always looked down on me for struggling with numbers. I was so relieved when my parents stopped the tutoring sessions, not because they realized how weird their assumption was, but because they didn‚Äôt see any improvement.


My brother was just as bad. One time, he randomly claimed I had a crush on our cousin. Like‚Ä¶ eww, how did his brain even come up with that? He gave some vague explanation, but I couldn‚Äôt even process it because it was so gross and absurd.


And it didn‚Äôt stop at home. In school, anytime I so much as greeted a guy, my classmates would immediately say I liked him. If I had a small conversation? That was proof to them. And it got even worse‚Äîthey would physically push me toward the guy so we could ""be alone."" I hated it. If I avoided him, they‚Äôd say I was just shy. If I didn‚Äôt, they‚Äôd assume I was enjoying it. There was no way to win, and I had no clue how to handle it.


Now, in university, it‚Äôs happening again. I was hanging out with a girl, let‚Äôs call her A, and her friend group, which included both guys and another girl, B. One of the guys, C, had a voice that sounded strikingly similar to a boy I was in the same class with in high school. It gave me goosebumps, so I casually asked A if he had any siblings in case they were related. She told me to ask him myself, so I did while we were walking home one day. He said no, and I jokingly told him he should try singing since the boy from high school was a good singer and was in a choir. That was it.


Later, C asked me to send him a file from another class. I sent it, and he replied with a ""thanks"" and a ‚ô•Ô∏è emoji. I didn‚Äôt think much of it and just reacted with an üëåüèª. But then, a few days later, A asked for my phone during class. I gave it to her without thinking, but later, while we were walking home, she randomly asked what I thought of C. I was confused, but she kept pushing, asking if I thought he was ""fine."" That‚Äôs when it clicked‚Äîshe must have gone through my messages and now assumed something was going on. To shut it down, I quickly said I didn‚Äôt see him that way and even threw in a half-truth about having a crush on someone else just to get her off my back.

But yesterday, things got worse. As we were leaving class, A and B told me it was C‚Äôs birthday. I casually said, ""Really?"" and tried to walk away, but then both of them rushed up and literally pushed me toward him to ""wish him a happy birthday."" I was pissed but held it in, wished him a happy birthday, patted him on the shoulder, and walked away.


Now, I can tell A and B think there‚Äôs something going on between me and C when there isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt see him that way at all, and I don‚Äôt want things to get awkward between us. But I don‚Äôt know how to fix this now. Should I just ignore it and hope they drop it? Or should I say something directly?


And more importantly, how do I handle things from now on so people don‚Äôt keep misinterpreting my actions? I don‚Äôt want to have to constantly change how I act just to avoid this, but I also don‚Äôt want to deal with this over and over again. Any advice would be appreciated.


TL;DR: People have constantly assumed I like every guy I talk to, starting from my parents thinking I had a crush on my math tutor when I was 15, to my brother saying I liked our cousin, to classmates pushing me into awkward situations. Now it‚Äôs happening in university too, and I don‚Äôt know how to handle the misinterpretations. How do I stop people from assuming things and handle situations where they‚Äôre pushing me to interact with guys I‚Äôm not interested in?
",How do I stop people from assuming things and handle situations where they're pushing me to interact with guys I'm not interested in?,"The individual in the Reddit post is experiencing a prolonged crisis stemming from a variety of personal background factors:

- **Family Dynamics**: The person has a complicated relationship with their family, particularly with their parents and brother. Their parents have been unsupportive, particularly regarding extracurricular activities like a language class, which they accused the individual of using as an excuse to ""mess around."" Additionally, their parents developed an unfounded belief that the individual had a crush on a math tutor when they were 15 years old. This belief caused significant discomfort and paranoia for the individual during the tutoring sessions, as they felt constantly surveilled by their mom. Even their brother joined in on this narrative, further complicating family relationships.

- **Education Background**: The individual has attended high school and is now in university. Their experiences in school were marred by classmates who similarly misinterpreted their interactions with male peers, leading to unwarranted assumptions about romantic interest. These experiences resulted in social pressure that made it difficult for them to navigate friendships and interactions with guys, leading to feelings of frustration and helplessness.

- **Social Interactions**: The individual has faced consistent misinterpretation of their social interactions, both in familial settings and with peers. This has caused them to feel uncomfortable and defensive about their behavior, as they have been subjected to relentless speculation regarding their relationships with male classmates and acquaintances.

Overall, the individual's background is characterized by a lack of support from their family, peer pressure in educational environments, and a pervasive issue with how their social interactions are misconstrued, contributing to their current crisis.",1,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iz88w9/im_tired_of_people_misinterpreting_my_actionshow/,relationships
2025-02-27 04:46:00,1iz7u6f,How do I overcome the betrayal of what I believe to be emotional cheating?,"I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for about two years. We get along so well, have the same sense of humor, and often talk about our plans for marriage. I've never suspected him of disloyalty or dishonesty.

That being said, there has been a woman's name that has been popping up on his phone a lot (like when he's showing me a video or I happen to see his phone get a notification) and I can't explain why, but I got a little pit in my stomach. A little seed of doubt. I asked who she was, stating that I'd seen her name come up a lot recently, and he said she was an old friend who he connected with on Tumblr when the site was still popular and they are still friends now. Okay, fine. But something seemed off, so I did something I swore I would never do and went through his messages while he was asleep. A part of me wishes I hadn't. He was complimenting this woman constantly, telling her how beautiful she was, asking her what it would be like if they were together, and telling her how he was planning to move out of the country soon. (We live together and have at no point discussed moving out of the country, lol). I took a peak at some of his conversations with other women while I was at it and many of them were along the same lines.

Obviously I confronted him about this, confessing that I had done something deplorable and invaded his privacy by going through his phone. I lead with mentioning the woman I had originally asked him about, and he tried to tell me that what I saw wasn't flirting/cheating but rather him doing a thought experiment to see if she had the same responses to things that I did (i.e. do all women act the same/follow the same emotional patterns). I couldn't even ask him about the weird shit about moving out of the country or the other women because I was so taken aback by his answer. (He was not mad at all that I had gone through his phone which was also weird. I fully expected him to be and would be deserving of his feelings of betrayal/hurt/etc. because it truly is a terrible thing to invade someone's privacy like that).

Ever since we started dating he has always been very active on Snapchat and has a ton (like 10+) of women he's friends with who he Snapchats and sends selfies to on a daily basis. I definitely saw this as a red flag but talked myself off the ledge because I was worried that I was just being insecure. Now I wish I would have just listened to my gut because a lot of the weird stuff I read/saw was, in fact, on Snapchat.

Anyway, would you describe what I saw in his phone as...emotional cheating? Has anything like this happened to you before, and if so, how did you move on from it? I personally don't think our relationship can ever recover from this but I am so shattered and just hoping for advice. I don't ever want to put myself in a situation again where I feel the need to go through my partner's phone. It made me feel so slimy and awful. I feel like I'm going to have a really hard time trusting in the future and I hate that this has happened to me.

TLDR: My (28F) boyfriend (30M) has been entertaining weird friendships with a bunch of women online and I found out because I went through his phone. How do I move on from this?",How do I move on from finding out my boyfriend has been emotionally cheating with women online?,"The individual writing the Reddit post is a 28-year-old female who has been in a two-year relationship with her 30-year-old boyfriend.

2025-02-27 04:03:17,1iz72nk,My [28f] partner [30NB] is friends with my ex who was abusive. How do I talk to him about it?,"I \[28F\] have been with my partner \[30NB\] just a short time of 2 months. We went to college together but we were each in relationships at the time so we didn‚Äôt get very close, but we recently reconnected and hit it off really well. Since we went to college together there is a lot of overlap in friends/people we know, so as we have started spending time together and then dating I also have reconnected with a lot of old friends/acquaintances.¬†

One of his friends (not a super close friend, but a friend nonetheless) is my ex \[28M\] from college. I‚Äôll call my partner Noah and my ex Trevor to help keep this easy to read.¬†

Trevor and I were toxic together and dated for about 9 months. We were both college kids with depression and PTSD and were trying to find meaning in life in each other. I definitely wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù in our relationship dynamic, I was caught up in my overwhelming feelings and dumped them on him way more than I should have and expected him to basically be my therapist. However in actual therapy recently I have realized that some of the things Trevor did when we were together follow common abuse patterns.¬†

\- He got jealous and upset when I spent time with anyone besides him, so over time I stopped hanging out with friends and became isolated. 

\- He would talk about our relationship like I was the only thing he was living for, which made me afraid that if I broke up with him he would harm himself. 

\- He would be supportive and loving regarding my mental health sometimes but then other times get angry with me when my anxiety was an inconvenience to him- I distinctly remember one time I was having a panic attack and he told me I needed to hurry up and calm down because he was going to miss the bus back to his dorm. Another time he just walked away when I started having a panic attack and left me alone in my dorm room, despite knowing that abruptly leaving without explanation was in itself a trigger for me. 

\- He would touch me in ways I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with, without asking first, knowing that I had a history of abuse and was very particular about what kind of touch felt safe. For example, one time we were riding on a city bus and he had his arm around me and then started brushing his fingers against my breast. (We were not having sex and I was not ok with intimate touch like that). 

\- Also, I have sensory sensitivities with sound but he could not always hear the sounds that bothered me (like the buzzing of the toaster oven when it was plugged in) and would tell me I was imagining things.¬†

Fast forward to present day, just seeing a picture of him or hearing his name or catching a whiff of the same laundry detergent he used is enough to at the very least send my anxiety levels skyrocketing if not trigger a panic attack. I am working on this in therapy. However I feel like this history is something that I need to talk about with my partner, because I honestly am not in a place where I can be in a room with Trevor and I don‚Äôt want to end up in a situation where I go with Noah to hang out with his friends and Trevor is there. Plus I feel like I need to explain myself for why I freeze up when someone mentions Trevor.¬†

The individual has reconnected with many old friends and acquaintances due to this renewed relationship.

Her previous relationship was with a male ex-partner named Trevor, whom she dated for about nine months during college. Both she and Trevor struggled with mental health issues, including depression and PTSD.

I (27f) am 7 months pregnant and desperately want him by my side all the time. He has been a constant support throughout this pregnancy (and throughout our relationship) and I have been very comfortable and happy all this time. I can't fall asleep without him rubbing my belly and I need hugs and kisses all the time. I can't eat or sleep without him and my emotions are all over the place. I am currently not working (starting from this month) and plan to go back to work once the baby is six months old. 
I love work. When he was away for six months training (thanks to which he got this oppertunity in the biggest hospital of the state and moved us to the capital) I had forgotten how to smile. I just threw myself into work and that kept me sane. But I don't have the luxury to do that now. Sitting idle, doing nothing productive is driving me insane. I also feel like I am wasting almost a year and setting my career back. I always wanted to work here and waited more than two years for him to catch up and move here togather. Now at this juncture everything seems uncertain as I am off work and he is moving up. I am really happy for him and definitely I wouldn't have moved without him. But I moved here to be with him as much as I wanted to thrive in my career. But now I can't pursue either of them and I am all alone in this house going crazy. For the foreseeable future I am also limited by my situation. I can't even bend down and wash my feet in the shower or ride around the city aimlessly or meet up friends or visit some hotspots. I am always hungry and always want to eat random stuff. But I am also always full after one or two bites. I pee more than I drink water. Even for a little while that I am out shopping, I fart or I have to pee. Sometimes my feet are swelling up and I have to spend the day in bed. And I terribly miss my husband. I just need to feel his skin against mine.

2025-02-27 02:33:11,1iz5d5k,my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt listen and we end up in huge fights because of it,"

i‚Äôm f20 and i‚Äôve been with a m20 for two years now. i know this is pretty young and most people will prob call this childish stuff but we plan on having a future together because we are very compatible (we share the same views, dream about same lifestyle, same opinions and hobbies, and we r overall attracted to each other).

he‚Äôs also the type of guy who‚Äôs good at arguing with logic. i‚Äôve told him many times that i‚Äôm not interested in arguing or having small debates over simple matters. i have my moments where i just don‚Äôt want to think at all or have to come up with something i can use to argue against him. i don‚Äôt believe these small debates is healthy for us because it just makes me mentally exhausted. he still doesn‚Äôt listen.   

he‚Äôs a type of person who‚Äôs very paranoid especially about my safety. i live in norway and it‚Äôs fairly safe here but we‚Äôve had higher crime rates due to immigration, especially in my city. my boyfriend would always warn me about being careful and staying safe (i appreciate that he‚Äôs looking out for me and stuff) but the issue starts when he frequently uses scare tactics and exaggerate consequences like me getting kidnapped if i go home after a noon shift or me witnessing a murder and potentially getting myself killed too. it‚Äôs just so emotionally exhausting having to constantly be fearful and scared that something might happen to me. especially when my hospital shifts include day, noon and night shifts. like what‚Äôs the point of scaring me so much that i need to be paranoid and fearful whenever i have to go work? it just drives me crazy on top of other things.  

 the issue we‚Äôve had for a while now is how he uses logical and reasonable arguments whenever i express myself feelings or emotions. i‚Äôve told him clearly that when im in emotional state, i just want to rant and vent about it, i don‚Äôt want arguing or back and fourth with logic. but he still does this and it drives me crazy. it just feels like he doesn‚Äôt listen to me at all or is aware that his behaviour is affecting my mental state. 

i work a lot in hospitals due to my internship in nursing and i have a messy shift schedule. i can have a night shift and then a day shift the day after and it‚Äôs challenging for me because i don‚Äôt get a lot of free time or rest. the times i do have free time (often only a few hours) i will play video games with my boyfriend and my best friend. but this time my boyfriend would state something about an account ban that very well might be true, but i said i didnt believe it (because he‚Äôs paranoid and exaggerate consequences a lot, and i just grew so tired of it and mistrustful about it). instead of accepting that i don‚Äôt believe a thing, he would try to argue for and about how he‚Äôs right. it threw me over the edge considering how i only had 1.5 hours to play before i had to go to sleep but instead i had to deal with him trying to argue about how he‚Äôs correct. like sure it might be correct but if i don‚Äôt believe it, then so be it. 

TLDR: my boyfriend is paranoid and therefore scares me frequently and makes me paranoid and stressed. he has these small debates with me although ive told him i don‚Äôt want to partake in it. he often argues that he‚Äôs right. i‚Äôve talked to him about all this but he doesn‚Äôt listen and we end up in big unnecessary fights about it.

2025-02-27 01:00:47,1iz3j03,My husband has been lashing out because of his body issues.,"Me '28M' and my husband '30M' have been been together for 10 years and married for 5. For the longest time we've had very few bumps in our relationship, but as of recent he's been very depressed specifically about his weight. For some context I regularly work out so in pretty muscular. My husband didn't work out much if at all throughout our relationship and we were fine with this dynamic. ( My husband wasn't unhealthy, just more on the skinny side).  

But as of recent he's lost his job, I'm not going into the specifics for personal reasons but just know the company had to cut cost. He started showing signs of depression and I did my best to comfort him, for months but it was hard for me to give him my full attention since I had to support the both of us with extra work hours. I guess because of the depression and lack of work to keep him busy he started eating more than he normally did. This of course meant that he put on weight. 

His appearance didn't drastically change but he did gain a prominent gut. I really care about his weight gain I just wanted him to get better. But I was obvious he cared. Before we had no problem seeing each other naked of course, but as of recent he's been more secretive about his body. When he walked out of the bathroom he would cover his entire body in at least two towels, like he was cautious of me seeing him naked.

 I also sometimes see him intentionally avoiding looking at his own reflection. He would also make comments about his body and mine. These comments came off as degrading he would make it seem like I lived at the gym or something. When I confronted him about these things he denied them, when I suggested he gets therapy he refused and got offended and we argued. He's been like this for months and I don't know what to do to help him. 
 
 Tldr;
My husband lost his job and had been depressed for a while. He started gaining weight and started feeling ashamed about his apperance. He's been lashing out at me and my efforts to support him.

The individual regularly works out and has a muscular physique, while the husband has not been active in exercising during their relationship and is described as more on the skinny side rather than unhealthy.

2025-02-27 00:05:56,1iz2do4,how to know if you want to live with your partner?,"hi! first time writing here. honestly just hoping writing it out will make me understand it more. 

i (21f) spent a couple of years as a teenager and then young adult living in very very unstable housing situations that have left me a bit traumatised lol, therefore feeling safe in the home and privacy feel very important to me. my partner (20m) has had a similar experience and we met last year. we were both moving to the same city that is infamous for its housing crisis and after months of trying to find somewhere we ended up moving in together before the relationship got to that level. i made peace with that and i even am having a nice time! however‚Ä¶ our lease is coming up  and we‚Äôre moving again because our rent is going up‚Ä¶ the question is do i want to keep living with them now that i have an option not to? 

i dont like who i am when im living with just one other person, let alone a romantic partner. i really hate organising my life and my private moments around a romantic partner and it makes me feel like one of those people who are seen as a couple first then a person second (especially when im the woman‚Ä¶) i often really crave my own space and distance but also don‚Äôt know if this is just my brain being weird and traumatised hahaha. the pros of moving out to live without them would be my own space and control over how much my relationship takes over my life without me realising or being able to do anything about it.

however i absolutely adore them! they totally get me and we have a very smooth nice relationship. im aware of our avoidant anxious dynamic and we try to do what we can about it. i love coming home to just be completely weird with them and myself! it feels very freeing and i feel very at home! 

i dont know if me wanting space and privacy by moving out without them now that i have that option would put the relationship through unnecessary turmoil but also i really want control over my life back!!!!!! and also to not be seen as JUST an extension of them because im feminine!!!!! i also dont know if im being avoidant because its my instinct and it feels safe or because its something i genuinely want to do‚Ä¶ HELP?!?! 

TLDR:
I am trying to decide whether i want to continue living with my partner now that i have the option not to! 

pros of moving out alone: 
more control over my life, my life doesnt revolve around another person, more privacy and space to be ugly and human, we are both in our early 20s and it shouldnt be that deep! more freedom to develop

cons of moving out alone:
going to miss the conveniency of them always being around! theyre my best friend! scared it will put the relationship through unnecessary bumps ",Do I want to continue living with my partner now that I have the option not to?,"The individual is a 21-year-old female who has experienced significant instability in their living situations during their teenage and early adult years, which has left them feeling traumatized and has shaped their views on safety and privacy in a home environment.

don‚Äôt live, sleep or cook/eat together mainly because the last few months he has withdrawn from me and is always ‚Äú‚Äú or stressed about work.

The quality of a serious and committed relationship that seemed to go on great, has much deteriorated as I feel that we don‚Äôt share any parts of our lives together and that we don‚Äôt spend any quality time together any more.

I have been expressing those feelings for months with no actionable, long term change and I‚Äôm in a turning point in my life where I have to make up my mind about work, taking a mortgage on a house etc. 

I feel like i‚Äôm in this alone but my partner swears that wants me in his life and wants us to be together. This is not the first time that this has happened. It just feels like an ever deteriorating situation.


Anyway, the thing that bothers me most and i‚Äôm trying to figure out how to change that every time so hit my limit and get fed up by the situation, my partner shuts down emotionally, is unable to communicate, speak up his mind  or reach out. He just withdraws for days until I make the effort to reach out him. Even I set a meet up to talk things out he keeps his cool with an attitude of ‚Äústaying together or breaking up, i‚Äôll be ok either-way‚Äù.  He never stopped me from leaving but I hold on to us.

During these days/ weeks of him deactivated i feel panicky and abandoned. I talked to him about it and he promised that it won‚Äôt happen again but here we are on another round after 4 or 5 months. I feel betrayed because he told me many times he was not going to put me through that again. 

How do I make him more open about communication and conflict resolution without pushing him to withdraw and feel bad about himself? I find this whole dynamic quite unbalanced while ir feeds my insecurities and fear of being worthless to fight for and our relationship to work on.

At the beginning, we used to flirt regularly and she seemed to be really into it. About a month ago, she started seeming distant and responds with ""wow"" to anything affectionate, I'm not sure if I did something wrong but I feel like it's because I flirted or said I love you so much that it lost meaning??

Also, I feel like she doesn't prioritize me the way that I prioritize her, it's like she would rather hang out with her friends then me. I don't want to be an asshole because I think hanging out with her friends is great, but is it so bad that I want some quality time to hang out because we don't get to see each other regularly?

This is my first ever relationship so I have no clue how to navigate this, I'm really happy when I'm with her but I feel really sad when I'm not, and it feels like she doesn't feel the same way. I want to talk to her about this, but I'm afraid she will confirm my fears and break up with me. But at the same time, for her sake I think if she doesn't like me anymore she should break up with me because there's no point being in a relationship you don't like

2025-02-26 23:43:10,1iz1w7k,How do I (26F) tell my partner (26M) to cut down on the amount of work information he is sharing with me?,"My partner (26M) and I (26F) have been together for almost 3 years. We don't live together but do talk most nights on the phone when we aren't together and the conversation (both in-person/over the phone) is always dominated by **at least** an hours worth of him going into immense detail about his job and I can't take it anymore.

 He will go into so much detail that he is **LITERALLY** telling me the step by step process of how he created some automation, coded something, created huge reporting stuff, etc. It gets to the point where I feel as though he is just talking at me so I totally check out of the conversation. I do care about his day and what he is doing at work but I don't care about every little step it took to get there. Especially because the programs/systems/fields we work with/in are completely different. So I have absolutely no point of reference for any of the things he is talking about and frankly have no interest in being talked at about programs I will never use. 

Though, I have let this continue because I do not know the right way to tell him I don't need the extended version of events without sounding like I am completely uninterested in his work. Honestly, I have become extremely disinterested because I don't feel like he actually values me being a part of the conversation; he just is happy that he has a body to talk at about this stuff. I am not proud of it but one time I set the phone down and walked away for a bit just to see if he would notice. When I came back to the phone he was still talking as if I had never left. 

I am really good at pretending that I am listening and that has worked until now. Though, now it is actually starting to ruin my mood whenever we are together and I don't want to spend our weekly date nights so annoyed at him. That's not fair to either of us.

So any thoughts, ideas, or words of wisdom on how to broach this topic with him (without totally crushing his feelings) would be much appreciated.

The relationship has been great and whilst we‚Äôve had challenges we have always overcome them together. At the end of 2023 I had bought a ring and was preparing to propose.

Last year was an incredibly tough year for us, we had a miscarriage early in the year and almost immediately afterwards before having time to grieve I was unexpectedly diagnosed with stage 3 lymphoma and had to start treatment, 6 months of chemotherapy. The treatment hit me extremely hard but she was extremely supportive. 

Fast forward to November and I was just about to finish my treatment, she came to me and said that she felt we had grown apart with no clear way for us to get back how we were, she also admitted that on her Christmas Work celebration she had cheated on me with a colleague (they no longer work together or see each other). She said she was unsure of her feelings and needed time to think but given my weakened state from the treatment I was insistent that she made a decision about how she felt and we seperated. 

The break up has hit me extremely hard, I‚Äôm upset for me and for my son living with seperated parents. I‚Äôve finished treatment and am in remission slowly starting to feel physically better. I‚Äôve been on a couple of coffee dates but nobody compares to her and I just feel empty.

We‚Äôve spoken today and both tried to put our cards on the table, she has said she still isn‚Äôt sure how she feels and doesn‚Äôt want to give me any false hope, but we have decided we will go out, as friends with no child to talk and establish exactly where we‚Äôre at.

2025-02-26 21:00:02,1iyy4qz,"How can I 32F be fair to my best friend, my partner 35M and myself?","
I (32F) have been in a relationship (35M) for more than half a year. This relationship is important to me and I am very much invested as my partner has his way of seeing through my issues and allowing me to heal without being overbearing, and in many cases he stayed committed despite seeing the worst of me. 

I have a male best friend who lives on the other side of the world and haven‚Äôt seen in many years despite fairly frequent calls. We met while doing our masters abroad and then each moved back to their country. Our friendship is really genuine in that we harbor the best intentions for one another, and we were there through the thick and thin and all of life‚Äôs existential terrors either asking the really big questions together or enjoying that terror through some good comic relief. 
When we met, we fell in love, however, it was not possible to have a relationship because of a radical conflict in core belief systems (I‚Äôm not going to say religion, because, the connotation of this word is one of the things we often discussed that it made people more deterred and confused). We continued to care about each other deeply through a friendship that will now have lasted almost 10 years. I let myself move on in the meantime and dated other people but nothing was really serious or long term. He was seeing other people too. 
I sometimes had a sneaking suspicion that he still had romantic feelings for me, because he always showered me with affirmations, which my other male friends don‚Äôt do. I always dismissed this concern as a character thing, as it would be egoistic to assume otherwise. 
I confronted him about it as this became more alarming for me after being in this serious relationship, and he said some very beautiful but scary things that made me believe I was right in having that intuition. I felt so heartbroken because all this time I was being unfair to both of us for believing in the friendship, and that I was being more unfair to him than to me, because I was perhaps denying him of an experience by continuing to be there, relying on him emotionally and seeking others romantically.

I care so deeply about this friend. He means the world to me. He really is the beam of hope in a world of desperate corruption. He is the kindest, most respectful, most supportive, incredibly earnest person. He is all those things while being ridiculously intelligent and hilarious. 
But now after learning how he truly feels, every time we talk, while it‚Äôs so great as it always has been, I do believe I am still being unfair to him, to my partner and to myself. I don‚Äôt know how to address this issue and to prioritize my partner and his trust in me without jeopardizing such a rare find of a friendship. 

TL;DR - my best friend may have feelings for me and I think it‚Äôs unfair for him. I don‚Äôt want to betray my partner‚Äôs trust and respect, but I also don‚Äôt want to hurt my friend or ever lose him. Is there an ethical solution? 

EDIT:
I really appreciate the time and effort you have taken to read my post and make a thoughtful and well-written comment, which I may not respond to each individually but will address major points: 

1. This post is not about making a case for why I want to be with my partner, which is why I don‚Äôt mention him except to say in a sentence why he has become really important to me. I could go in great, great lengths but I think it is irrelevant to this topic. There is no doubt I don‚Äôt want to lose him. 

2. Despite the lengthy description, I do love my friend, but I‚Äôm not in love with him. I don‚Äôt feel any romantic attraction towards him or have a desire to be with him. I don‚Äôt think about him in a non-friendship way. I may describe some of my female friendships in a similar manner. I‚Äôm someone who feels and appreciates very deeply and enjoys expressing it. 

3. I think the issue is that the situation with the friend is problematic regardless of the relationship status. Since we talked about it and I knew about his feelings, I asked for some space, and our friendship did start to change. I think I would like even more space for both of our sakes, but I‚Äôm really scared it will hurt him to cut off consistent communication.

What should I do? How should I move forward?,"I am 26F, and my friend is 28F. We have been friends since September 2022. We are batchmates and both doctors.

# The Beginning of Our Friendship

When we first became friends, everything was good. I actually admired her and wanted to be friends with her, so I pursued her. At the time, I knew she had just come out of a three-year-long relationship with a guy from our batch. He was pathetic, but that‚Äôs another story.

As we got closer, she opened up to me about her relationship, how she got over it, and how her other friends left her. From what she told me, when she had first gotten into her relationship, she ghosted all her friends. Then, when she broke up with her boyfriend the first time, her friends were there for her, consoled her, and advised her not to go back to him. However, she got angry, said, *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my life,‚Äù* and went back to him, ghosting her friends again. When she finally broke up with him for good, this time, her friends weren‚Äôt there for her. As far as I remember, though, she still used to hang out with them after that final breakup.

# How Our Friendship Evolved

I was very fond of her, and I was there for her every step of the way. I didn‚Äôt care much about my other friends and always included her in everything, even in hangouts with them. My other friends didn‚Äôt like her‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know why, and I never asked. I used to go out of my way for her.

But then things started getting a little weird. It felt like she was trying to control me. She would say things like:

* *‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt tell me when and where you go with your other friends.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúWhy do you post deep quotes on Facebook?‚Äù*‚ÄîShe thought they were about her, and even after I reassured her they weren‚Äôt, she still disliked it.
* *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say anything negative about my political views.‚Äù*‚ÄîShe would fight with me over every little thing.
* She would start arguments out of nowhere or say things she knew wouldn‚Äôt sit right with me.

At the same time, she constantly complained that:

* *‚ÄúWe never have deep conversations.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúI can never talk to you about anything.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not girly enough.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt care about makeup, guys, fashion, or trends.‚Äù*

Ironically, when I did ask for her opinion on these things (to make her comfortable), she would shut me down by saying, *‚ÄúGo check YouTube.‚Äù* I was trying to accommodate her concerns, but she dismissed my efforts.

I had also told her that I don‚Äôt engage in religious or serious political discussions with people. I only post or share things about them, but I never discuss them because I know they‚Äôre sensitive topics. I explained that on Facebook, I don‚Äôt have to answer anyone, and if someone tries to engage, I just delete their comment. Despite this, she still pushed me into a conversation, got offended when I put my points forward, and became disrespectful. In the end, I had to apologize *so much*.

I always found myself apologizing and chasing after her. She never acknowledged anything I did for her. In fact, she said it *burdened* her and constantly dismissed me.

# The Turning Point ‚Äì Her Residency Exam

By the time her residency exam was approaching, we were fighting every day over mundane things. I was getting tired and frustrated.

One time, things got out of hand, and in a moment of impulsivity, I blocked her. But I unblocked her immediately and apologized. That‚Äôs when she told me I had *triggered her relationship PTSD*. I was shocked, but I realized I might have, so I apologized again.

After that, she started making comments about me and my husband:

* *‚ÄúYou never tell me if you miss him. I tell you everything.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you miss him? Are you guys even in love? Because if I were in a long-distance relationship with my husband, I would talk about him all day.‚Äù*

When I explained my perspective, she got frustrated and said, *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fucking me up.‚Äù* She then asked for space.

She didn‚Äôt end that *space* even after her exam. Eventually, I messaged her and asked for another chance. She gave me one, but she was still indifferent toward me. I gave her time, but we still had fights and hot-and-cold behavior. She then said, *‚ÄúI can‚Äôt forgive you for what you did to me.‚Äù*

At that point, I told her:  
*""Okay, fair enough. I won‚Äôt bother you anymore.""*  
I apologized again, said I wouldn‚Äôt force anything, and we ended things.

# The Cycle Continues

Then, *just one day* after we ended things, she came back and said:  
*""I‚Äôm sorry. Help me be your friend and understand your love language.""*

I was surprised at her sudden change of heart, but I was happy we were friends again.

Fast forward to her residency‚Äîshe started neglecting me, giving cold and late replies. When I asked her about it, she said:  
*""Right now, this is all I can give.""*

I accepted it because at least I was getting *something*. But I also wanted to protect myself, so I started mirroring her effort. She noticed the change, felt something was off, and we argued again.

# Now, I Don‚Äôt Know What to Do.

I can provide more details if something seems confusing 



TL;DR I pursued a friendship with my batchmate, supported her through her breakup, and prioritized her over my other friends, but over time, she became controlling, dismissive, and argumentative. No matter how much I apologized or adjusted, she remained hot and cold, often neglecting me while expecting me to always be there for her. I feel exhausted and confused because she keeps shifting between wanting my friendship and pushing me away. What should I do? How should I move forward? I need advice. 

",What should I do about my friendship with someone who keeps pushing me away yet also wants to be close? How should I move forward? I need advice.,"The individual in crisis is a 26-year-old female who is a doctor and a batchmate of the friend she is discussing. She has been friends with this person since September 2022. The friend she pursued a relationship with had recently come out of a three-year-long relationship prior to their friendship and experienced a cycle of ghosting her friends during and after this relationship. 

The individual appears to have a history of prioritizing her friend over her other relationships, often including her in social situations and neglecting her other friends who did not approve of this friendship. She describes her friend as becoming controlling and argumentative, expressing dissatisfaction with their interactions while simultaneously neglecting her needs. 

The individual has been involved in a long-distance relationship with her husband, which her friend has commented on, suggesting a contrast in how they express love and connection. Throughout their friendship, the individual has made efforts to accommodate her friend's concerns, but she feels dismissed and unacknowledged for her efforts. The current crisis stems from the emotional turmoil and confusion resulting from this up-and-down friendship dynamic, particularly as it became strained during her friend's residency exam period.",1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iyvu8k/my_friend_28f_of_25_years_have_been_causing_alot/,relationships
2025-02-26 19:05:23,1iyvdm8,Spending money on each other in a relationship,"TLDR at bottom!

I (24F) just helped my boyfriend (22M) pay his mechanic bills. He‚Äôs been struggling with money lately since he‚Äôs finishing up college and working at the same time. He‚Äôs missed a few days of work recently because he‚Äôs been needing more time to focus on school, understandably. His car recently had an issue and he needed to take it to the mechanic. He said he really didn‚Äôt have any money, and he didn‚Äôt directly ask me for help but I told him I would be there for him to help him take care of it. He said it would probably be around $400 so I sent him $450 to be safe. Then he finds out it‚Äôs going to cost way more due to labor, totaling to $900 instead.

I work a full time job but I don‚Äôt make the best salary. I sent him the $900 and let him know that he could maybe send me half back when he has the money, I originally was going to cover all the costs as I don‚Äôt want him to stress more than he already is. But that‚Äôs almost $1,000 and i‚Äôm also still working towards being financially stable. 

I guess I would just like a better understanding of how money works in a relationship. Part of me wants some of my money back, but I know he is really struggling right now and if I am able to pay for things that will take his financial stressors away, I will gladly do so. I know he‚Äôs not taking advantage of me, he‚Äôs definitely just in a bad place with money right now and really needs the help. 

(This last part is kinda irrelevant, so skip if you‚Äôd like), but I also am just a little upset because I got my federal refund already, and I deposited two checks (that were gifts), so I felt like I got rewarded some money. But basically my entire refund and check money just went to my boyfriend‚Äôs car. Again, I love him and I am happy to help, but it just sucks when I‚Äôm also struggling w money and I don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôll get that money back. 

TLDR: I (24F) gave my boyfriend (22M) $900 for his mechanic bill but i‚Äôm not exactly sure how money works in a relationship. I kind of want him to pay me some of it back, but at the same time he is really struggling financially and I‚Äôd be happy to take some of that pressure off of him. I hate to see him stressing knowing I can make things better for him. At the same time, though, I‚Äôm not totally financially stable yet either. ",How can I navigate financial help in a relationship when I'm also struggling financially?,"The individual is a 24-year-old female who works a full-time job but does not earn a high salary. She is experiencing financial instability herself while also trying to support her boyfriend, who is 22 years old and currently finishing college while working.

2025-02-26 17:16:34,1iysowv,"Is my guy friend pushing boundaries, or is he just oblivious?","I (21F) am in my 3rd year at uni and have a very close guy friend (21M), we will call him John. We both have mixed gender friend groups so I don't think it's weird for a man and a woman to be close friends. We have been friends for about a year and he has always been a really great guy, kind and respectful, he is the kind of person who will walk all the way across campus (we are at a large uni) to walk a friend home who feels unsafe walking alone in the dark or pick up a friend from a date going sideways. 

Some background info about me is that I have an anxiety disorder and PTSD and I occasionally have panic attacks out of the blue. I'm used to them so I usually will just sit in a quiet spot and wait for it to pass. John knows about this and has sat with me through a couple of them which is nice because having a trusted person nearby keeping watch so to speak helps me feel safer. He will also count out loud which is helpful for getting my breathing back under control. Sometimes he will hug me which I asked him to do as I find the pressure helps me calm down, like a form of deep pressure therapy. After I calm down I ask him to describe to me what happened since I don't usually remember all the details and the feedback is helpful for continuing to figure out triggers and what helps calm me down and what doesn't. 

About a month ago I had a panic attack while over at John's apartment. I curled up on his couch with a blanket and did the usual trying to breathe through it. John sat down next to me and started counting calmly like normal. But then he reached out and started rubbing my back and then after a minute of that rested his hand on my hip in such a way that his fingers were also a bit touching my butt. 

I didn't say anything about that after because I thought, maybe he was just trying to be comforting by rubbing my back, and maybe he just wasn't thinking about his hand placement. However a couple of days ago I had a panic attack and John hugged me which was fine, but then he kissed the top of my head a couple of times. Afterwards when I asked for a recap of the panic attack from his perspective he didn't say anything about kissing my head. 

I am feeling uncomfortable and can't help wondering if he is doing these things intentionally while I'm having panic attacks because he thinks I won't remember. I feel like I can write off the rubbing my back as him just trying to be helpful but it's a lot harder to come up with a reasonable explanation for kissing my head. I feel like he should know better given how he talks about other guys crossing boundaries and how he prides himself on being someone who defends his female friends. 

I'm not sure what to do, or if I'm overreacting and it's all innocent. 

TL;DR - my guy friend has been initiating physical contact without permission, is he just trying to be nice or do you think he is intentionally pushing boundaries? How do I handle this?","Is my guy friend intentionally pushing boundaries by initiating physical contact without my permission during my panic attacks, or is he just trying to be nice?

2025-02-26 17:00:47,1iysas3,27f / 31m - no intimacy - how do you end it !?,"Context: we have been dating since Dec 2021 , we live together now , it is my apartment. I am his first girlfriend. We met on tinder and hooked up and then just kind of progressed from there.

TO BE FAIR, I feel guilty. He told me when we started talking that he wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship and I told him I could help him with like getting a job, for instance.

He has a job. A part time work from home $500 a week job. I am in the corporate world bringing home 70k and pay for the fun in our relationship. He does pay his half of rent but that is it. I mean, he pays when we go out and stuff but like only dinners - he doesn‚Äôt always pay the expensive things.

Anyways, we haven‚Äôt had sex since like November. And before that it was May. And before that it was January. Our sex life used to be so fun, and it randomly all stopped. He stopped trying so I stopped trying. I‚Äôve always been a pretty promiscuous person.. I like to have sex. It makes me feel wanted, and it‚Äôs fun, and healthy - etc. 

He says he loves me and he‚Äôll never date anyone else even if we split because this has been ‚Äútoo much effort.‚Äù To be fair, he is the NICEST person I‚Äôve ever met. He cleans the house, does the laundry, he will help my nieces if they need him, he will go and do stuff for my mom. But he isn‚Äôt like.. handy. He is a little lazy. He likes to just smoke weed and lounge.

I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. I genuinely feel terrible breaking up with him and I‚Äôve tried to push him away. It just.. doesn‚Äôt seem to work. Us not sleeping together and him not getting a real job is just NOT okay anymore. 

TL;DR - in a relationship for 3 years, he‚Äôs a little lazy, it isn‚Äôt working anymore, what do I do even though he is the nicest person I‚Äôve ever met?

2025-02-26 16:30:37,1iyrkrj,"I need some advice, I think he has lost interest (LDR, 22F, 21M)","I (22F) have been with my bf (21M) for a little over one year. We were best friends before dating and have been long distance the whole time (we live in different countries). We have met in-person multiple times and it‚Äôs always been absolutely amazing. 

Our relationship started off great, very verbally affectionate. We spent every spare second talking to each other about the most random things over message and we‚Äôve always called/video called once per week. In-person together couldn‚Äôt have been any better, he makes me laugh and truly has made me so happy. We spent a lot of time together while I was studying abroad in his country, but after I returned home a lot of things changed due to the time difference and the fact that he had just graduated and started a new job. That‚Äôs been six months ago now.

Anyway, over time 100+ messages each day has turned into a couple, sometimes he falls asleep after work and I don‚Äôt hear from him at all. It‚Äôs been over a month since he‚Äôs said I love you first, and he hasn‚Äôt really flirted since September. But he does call and listen to me when I‚Äôm having a hard time, makes me laugh, and shares his hobbies with me. In my heart I believe he cares about me, but I‚Äôm not convinced he ‚Äúloves‚Äù me or that I‚Äôm his person.   He is definitely more avoidant and I‚Äôm definitely anxious, we have a cycle where he gets distant, I talk to him about it because I get worried, some things change and then later on something happens in his personal life and he pulls away again then it repeats. During my outbursts I‚Äôve been very clingy and regrettably very hard to deal with. I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes and I‚Äôm trying to work on it. I‚Äôm worried this has happened so much now that he‚Äôs just done with me. Over our last call I was telling him about how I felt again in a lighthearted and joking way. I gave him an example of the questions my brain comes up with. He replied ‚ÄúThat gives me a headache! For a minute I thought‚Ä¶ oh there she goes again, it‚Äôs about time isn‚Äôt it üòÇ.‚Äù It made us both laugh, and we had a great call overall. But near the end he got tired and stopped engaging with me, I thought that maybe I overwhelmed him with my emotions again. The this morning I messaged him but he didn‚Äôt reply. Of course he could‚Äôve fallen asleep (14 hour time difference) but I still felt like maybe it was because I did something wrong. 

The worst part is, I miss him and I truly do love him, more than I‚Äôve ever loved anyone. I don‚Äôt want to give up but I also know I can‚Äôt stay with someone who doesn‚Äôt feel the same way. Deep down I really want those romantic things. I‚Äôd like random calls just to say sweet things, a flirty message every once in a while or a love letter. People always say ‚ÄúIf he wanted to he would.‚Äù Any advice? 

EDIT: I should add a couple details. First, this is a first relationship for both of us. It happened unexpectedly because we were best friends for so long and it‚Äôs unfortunate we have been in different countries for most of it. This is also my first time working through anxious attachment (and I have gotten better since the beginning, but I do have emotional outbursts every couple months). I have a lot of abandonment trauma, and I say that not as an excuse but because I genuinely am trying to overcome it. Second, whether we stay together or not I am planning to move to his country in October as I have a really great opportunity there. 

TL:DR

He as been by my side throughout some of the most difficult times in my life. Which is what makes writing this so hard.
He has always been the most gentle sweetest man, he has supported me throughout everything since I met him and we really had no problems. He had an argument with his parents, who kicked him out of the house. My parents offered him a place to stay and he has been living in the apartment at the back of our house for almost a year. My parents love him, which makes this situation even harder for me.
I have a best friend 22M whom I have known for more than 10 years, we have never been interested in one another romantically, I have never even given him a hug, so definitely our relationship is purely plutonic. My boyfriend and him never really liked each others, but the got along for my sake. (Just to clarify, my boyfriend has always been okay with me being friends with him ) My best friend is important to me since he is pretty much my only friend aside from my boyfriend.

My boyfriend and him had arguments but the would always make up, the last few months it was almost like the 2 of them had become great friends.

My boyfriend and I try avoiding alcohol as far as we can because he does not know his limit, he always does something hurtfull when he is drunk, i can elaborate more on that if anyone wants be to. But there has been many occasions where we have fought about the things he did while drunk. He never really appologises but shows his remorse.
Last week after he had been drinking. I was sick and walked into his room to get medicine, he had been drinking way to much that night, as i came in I caught him watching p*rn, which really hurt me because I had expressed to him that I am not okay with that (I cought him thos Christmas watching it and told him that I am not okay with it ). I grabbed my boyfriends phone to confirm that he was watching it and my boyfriend grabbed me and pushed me to the couch I yelled for my best friend immediately who was ons his way to go home. He came running in and immediately tried helpping me as I was having a anxiety attack (I struggle from severe anxiety) As that happened my boyfriend grabbed me, and I started freaking out, my best friend then stepped in and pushed him off me, I ran away instantly (still having my boyfriend phone in my hand, I wanted to be sure what he was watching before I took it further)
I then heard a loud bang and turned around, I saw my boyfriend and best friend beating each other up, I screamed hysterically for my mom who was asleep in the other room to come help. She was able to break them up and my friend went home. my friend has huge bruses on his shoulders, while my boyfriend has none. That night my boyfriend told me that everything that happened is my fault.
Long story short my boyfriend blames me, as he says I didn't give him time to explain, when I told him I know everything he just went quiet and ignored me.

Yesterday he apologised half heartedly but told me that If I had s*x with him het wouldn‚Äôt have to watch p*rn (We are both religious and agreed to wait until marriage) He also had a huge argument with me and told me that I am not allowed to be friends with my best friend anymore as it is our fault this happened. I think he might have a drinking problem, but that is a wild accusation I don‚Äôt want to make. He told me that the last few months he doesn‚Äôt want to open up to me.

I have noticed that we have been drifting apart lately, but I still love him with my whole heart. I think I know what the solution is, but I am too scared, what do I do?

2025-02-26 14:54:22,1iypbac,My (22f) boyfriend (26m) gets upset with me when I don‚Äôt feel the same way as him; how do i navigate this?,"**please don‚Äôt repost anywhere or use for content, thank you

So as the title says, my (22f) boyfriend (26m) of three years seems to get upset with me when I have different feelings on a situation than he would, if the roles were reversed. It‚Äôs important to note here that he‚Äôs upset with me for simply feeling that way, it does not matter how I handle the feelings, positively or negatively.

An example of this kind of came up recently we were trying to coordinate making plans with some friends for the long weekend. He ended up making plans for the one day I was working, the friends already had these plans pre-booked and the activity was something that I wanted to do for a while with him so I was disappointed to miss out.
So where things get murky is I was disappointed. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs unnatural or unfair of me. I approached him when I got home from work and I approached him super calmly and nicely and just said ‚Äúhey honey i‚Äôm disappointed I‚Äôm gonna miss out, are there any alternatives so I can be included too?‚Äùand he got upset with me that I was disappointed in the first place. If I came at him yelling and screaming, and all wound out, I could understand that, but it seems like even if I didn‚Äôt talk to him, and he found out later that I was disappointed, he would still be annoyed because he just simply doesn‚Äôt agree that I should be disappointed with that all and it annoys him that I was. And then I guess that annoyed him more that as he would put it, I had the audacity to bring up my disappointment. 

So I‚Äôm kind of out of loss here because to me I can‚Äôt help how I feel about something and my feelings don‚Äôt have to be in line with what he thinks I should feel or how he would feel in the same situation. What matters is how I deal with those feelings. And I‚Äôm willing to concede that maybe I should not have brought up my disappointment because there was nothing that really could be done about it and it‚Äôs not fair to ask him to miss out on plans so I can be included. But at the same time, I‚Äôm very confident that had he just found out after the fact that I was disappointed he still would‚Äôve been upset. And I don‚Äôt know how to explain to him that that‚Äôs unrealistic, you can‚Äôt expect me to feel only how you would feel about something. 

I‚Äôve even noticed this is a trend when he‚Äôs confronted with something where he may have been in the wrong. Like if I said to him, hey I didn‚Äôt like when you did x, it always seems like the first thing out of his mouth is ‚Äúoh well I would want to be told if that was me‚Äù, or ‚Äú I wouldn‚Äôt make a big deal out of that‚Äù or ‚Äú I wouldn‚Äôt make you do what you‚Äôre asking me‚Äù. And it‚Äôs really validating to hear that all the time when I‚Äôm trying to explain to him that I didn‚Äôt like something he did and he just immediately relates it back to his own opinion and his own world view. 

My question is kind of two fold, is his behaviour actually incorrect or is this me getting upset because I‚Äôm not being validated or getting my own way? And if in fact, his behaviour is incorrect, how do I explain to him nicely that this is affecting our relationship?

TLDR: my (22f) boyfriend (26m) seems to struggle with seeing the world from someone else‚Äôs perspective. He gets upset when I don‚Äôt feel the way that he would feel in the same situation, and when confronted with criticism, he consistently relates it back to his own worldview instead of taking accountability

My boyfriend told me early on that he was afraid he didn‚Äôt know how to love someone properly, but I overlooked it because things felt great at first. He was loving and attentive, and since we were long-distance for a year, we bonded deeply through communication.

During that time, I later found out he was liking other women‚Äôs posts and stories behind my back. I tried to brush it off, but the moment that really broke my trust was when I saw he had liked a mutual friend‚Äôs lingerie photo on Instagram. I confronted him, telling him I saw him differently and didn‚Äôt like that behavior. His following ratio was already mostly women, which made me uncomfortable.

After that, our relationship changed. I struggled with trust, and instead of reassuring me, he got defensive and angry. For almost two years, we‚Äôve had constant fights‚Äîmostly about my jealousy, which stems from feeling like he never gave me the security I needed. He shuts down, withdraws, and avoids real conversations. Now, he barely even tries to be affectionate, even though he knows how important physical touch and emotional connection are to me. He‚Äôs hot and cold‚Äîsometimes he acts like he cares, but mostly it feels like he doesn‚Äôt.

We live together now, and every time we get into a serious discussion, he either shuts down completely or sleeps on the couch. He‚Äôs become increasingly angry, has called me names, and has even threatened to kick me out‚Äîeven though when he moved to my state, he initially moved in with me. He blames me for turning him into a ‚Äúshell of a person‚Äù because he can‚Äôt ‚Äúinnocently flirt‚Äù with women.

2025-02-26 13:21:59,1iyndnj,"I (27f) am bi, and uncomfortable with my boyfriend's(28m) disgust for gay men","I'm a bisexual woman who is now in my first het-partnered relationship. We've been dating for 2 years and we're about to move in together this weekend. I am very happy and he treats me extremely well. He is funny, honest and quite loving. Our interests and views are quite aligned for the most part and we vibe so much with each other. I really love him. 

However recently I've noticed that he is quite uncomfortable with seeing gay men being romantic with each other. There have been a few comments over the years but it has become more obvious now. For example, there is that a certain video game he likes a lot. This year this game got a sequel and the main character now has homosexual romance options and he seemed... disgusted? Mind you, he is quite leftist, there is no angry or violent homophobia at play, he even supports gay's right to marry and whatnot. 

But there is an edge of something that upsets me. Like there is no real acceptance just tolerance. Like he knows according to his politics he should support it, but he finds it really gross.

I wouldn't care if he was just anyone, he is allowed to feel how he feels of course. But I have only ever been in same-sex relationships and i have interacted with people like this a lot at the time (women mostly). Surface level support that conceals a primal disgust, that they are maybe not even to blame for. I find it triggering and upsetting. I doesn't help that he doesn't keep that energy for lesbian relationships, he told me he finds it hot and told me half-jokingly, that I can see other women but only if he gets to watch. That makes his distaste for gay male affection even worse for me though.  It feels gross and it makes me feel gross, and while I love him dearly, I can't ignore this feeling. I know it will fester into resentment one day, and i don't want that.  But I get that he can't get over the way he feels, and having supportive politics is perhaps the best he can do. I don't want to leave him at all, but I'd like some pointers on how I could start a productive conversation about this. I don't want to be all accusatory and I don't want to get upset with him, but I want to communicate why it's bothering me and hear his side.  So a neutral way of approaching it would be best but I'd love to hear your thoughts!

So, I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over 2 years. It was miracle and we felt like we're so special, getting to know each other a lot in a short period of time. And we're really happy in it, like really really happy. She's always telling me what I really mean to her and how much she loves the way I treat her. And I really love her deeply and got plans for a future with her. We never really had to try much to get the best of us.

Anyway, it's a relationship, so we sometimes had small conflicts and we always managed to figure things out in a couple days. But, a couple weeks ago, we had a really big problem, which includes me being always emotionally dependent on her, never being initiative to go out (because I thought I am prioritizing where she wanna go or what she wanna do but I was wrong), being annoying, my emotions and stress impacting on her and our relationship. Now, she said she can't really count on me and she's unsure about her love and feelings for me.

As soon as I realized, I tried to fix, I changed and worked on myself, I gave as much space as she needed, and I tried to get better. Then, I planned a drink night and we went out, talked, went to a karaoke and had a lot of fun and seemed like things were getting better. But, after that, we were having snacks at a restaurant and talked, and we kinda got into another argument. It wasn't a fight but we were arguing. I didnt' know I was messing things up again and I thought I was just explaining. But then, she got frustrated and decided to go home. I tried to stop her but, it made things worse.

I've been trying to talk to her in the meantime, but she needs some space right now. So, this time, I really wanna fix everything and work on myself to change my behaviours to be more mature and more logical. And I really wanna have a future with her. I really wanna make her love me back again.

2025-02-26 11:33:09,1iylgxl,My (23M) girlfriend (20F) is stopping me from contacting my close friend (24F) and resents me for disliking that,"tl;dr My (23M) polyamorous friend (24F) offended my new girlfriend (20F, 10 months) by not inviting her to a hang out. My girlfriend has stopped me from contacting or seeing my friend and blames me for being uncomfortable when my friend texts me.

I am worried my (23M) girlfriend's (20F) emotional immaturity is going to be an ongoing problem in our relationship. The problem I talk about in this post has been ongoing for a while and neither of us have dealt with it well, but it's reached a point where it makes me feel so bad that I'm considering breaking up.

When I met my girlfriend 10 months ago, I thought she was mature and independent, having done some self improvement after a bad breakup. Now I'm starting to doubt whether my impression was right and whether she's right for me, despite us loving each other so strongly and imagining spending the rest of our lives together.

I have a female friend and past coworker (24F) who I have known for a few years. I worked with her and have gone to uni with her. She is married and I am confident there has never been any desire for anything more than friends from either side.

My friend is bisexual and would probably call herself polyamorous. She used to have a female partner whilst she was with her boyfriend (now husband), but is now only with her husband. My girlfriend is strongly against polyamory on ethical grounds, so she has never had a good impression of my friend for this reason. When I told her my friend was polyamorous about one month into our relationship, she was horrified and couldn't believe I would hang out with her. I had previously suggested the three of us should hang out and my friend was eager to meet my new girlfriend, but obviously this wasn't going to happen now.

About two months into the relationship, my friend texted me asking if we could hang out. At this point she knew I had a girlfriend but didn't explicitly invite her in the text. This really offended my girlfriend. She told me she didn't want me to see my friend or talk to her ever again. There were two occasions in the last few months where I replied to my friend's texts without consulting my girlfriend which made her very upset (understandably as I broke her trust). I apologised and we moved on.

Last week my friend texted me again asking if I wanted to hang out. I told my girlfriend about the text and she got upset as I expected, but I didn't reply because I knew she would hate that. In the last few days my friend texted me again asking if I was okay and telling me she was worried. This made my girlfriend even more upset, and she has said some horrible things about her, implying that she is selfish, malicious and even asking if I wanted to have sex with her.

From the start of this issue I've been very uncomfortable with the way my girlfriend has dealt with it. She gets very defensive and heated and tries to position me and my friend against her and make the issue into a conflict. The whole time I've been clear that I'm not comfortable with ending my friendship over this but I know it's the best option because I love my girlfriend and I don't want to lose her, so I have come to terms with it. I have a bigger problem with not telling my friend about the situation and ignoring her which feels completely wrong to me, but I was prepared to accept that to satisfy my girlfriend.

I am seriously wondering whether this is an irreconcilable issue. I don't know whether I can just end a close friendship without telling my friend why, yet my girlfriend isn't giving me any options. If I even suggest contacting the friend my girlfriend will blow up, as she has done before. Even without that, whenever my friend texts me or is brought up for any reason, my girlfriend becomes very hostile to me and I feel that she'll never be satisfied even though I'm doing exactly what she wanted.

My bigger concern is that this sort of thing will happen again. My girlfriend is easily offended and very emotionally volatile. I can imagine this sort of thing happening again, and I don't know if I should just put up with the situation for the moment and see what happens, or cut my losses and break up with her. We love each other so much so breaking up would be horrible for both of us.

How do I handle this?","**TL;DR:**¬†My boyfriend of 10 years wants a break but still wants to see me. He says he‚Äôs mentally unwell and needs space. I want to be with someone who genuinely wants to be with me, so I‚Äôm struggling with how to handle this situation. How do I navigate this while making sure my needs are met?

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 10 years, though we haven‚Äôt always lived together due to work. We had finally planned to move in together, so I gave up my apartment. However, over the past year, he has seemed less and less interested in me and our relationship.

I was away for three months for work, and while he supported my decision to go, he barely made an effort to stay in touch. He never really asked how I was doing, and when I returned home, he wasn‚Äôt even there‚Äîhe had booked a random weekend trip instead. Yesterday, we had a serious conversation, and he admitted that he‚Äôs not interested in my life.

He then told me he wants a break. When I asked him to clarify, he was vague but mentioned that he:

* Wants to try being completely alone.
* Feels mentally unwell and wants to talk to someone.
* Sometimes thinks about ending his life.
* Wants to move to another country.
* Wants to sleep with someone else.

He also said he doesn‚Äôt like how rude he is to me (which is true‚ÄîI‚Äôve put up with a lot), and that he needs space to ""pull his life together."" He‚Äôs lived in his apartment for three years and still doesn‚Äôt have a bed, so I do believe he‚Äôs struggling.

At the same time, he says he still wants to see me, but do more ‚Äúwholesome things.‚Äù Ideally, he‚Äôd like us to get back together this summer. He‚Äôs going out with work friends this Friday, and when I asked if he‚Äôd be staying over there, he said,¬†*""I‚Äôll check it out, and if not, maybe I can sleep at your place?""*¬†This confuses me‚Äîwhat does a break actually mean to him if he still wants to spend time together like normal? He did say that he just wants no expectations.

I‚Äôm struggling to figure out the best way to handle this. I‚Äôm 26 and want a relationship with someone who actively wants to be with me, but I also don‚Äôt want to completely shut the door on a decade-long relationship without thinking it through.

**My question:**¬†How do I set boundaries and navigate this situation in a way that prioritizes my well-being while also acknowledging his struggles?

2025-02-26 07:43:41,1iyiarw,Is there a future for me (25F) and my (24M) partner,"
TLDR: should I try convincing my boyfriend‚Äôs mother to let us be together or finish it sooner than later

I‚Äôm posting this to have different opinions and views on this difficult situation I‚Äôm going through.

I‚Äôve been dating my Muslim boyfriend for almost 4 years now.
Although we realize our relationship itself is not ideal as it‚Äôs against the religion to date , we do work with it and are as abstinent as we can (we basically only hold hands and hug here and there, no kissing, sexual relationships, not even a peck on the lips) as he really wants to be the best he can and properly wait for marriage, which I 100% respect and understand.
I myself am currently reading the Quran and learning about Islam, which has really brought us closer and opened my eyes. 



The issue we‚Äôre currently going through is his mom does not approve of me. 

Two years ago, she found my Facebook account and assumed I was bisexual because of a profile picture I had used years prior meeting my boyfriend (a picture of a fist with multiple skin tones, with the lgbtq flag in the background).
The point of me using this picture as a profile picture was to support the Black Lives matter movement, as I believe that no person should be discriminated against and killed because of their skin colour, no matter the religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.


Unfortunately, his mother was against it and even tried forcing him to end the relationship as she didn‚Äôt want to hear anything about it, no matter how much my boyfriend and even his brother tried to 
explain and tried to change her mind.
This was two years ago. 


When this happened, we actually almost broke up but my boyfriend decided to pray and ask god for guidance. 
The answer he had received was for us to stay together, so he unfortunately lied to his mother and told her we had broken up but we kept the relationship going, both understanding that we might be forced to end it at some point because I could never ask him to choose me over his family. 
I myself wouldn‚Äôt be able to choose him over my family if my parent was really against it and just wouldn‚Äôt budge.


We agreed we would try talking to his mother face to face when they would be able to come visit him.
The moment is coming FAST. 


His family will be visiting him from Algeria this summer and we both want to use this opportunity to talk with her and try to make her understand and hopefully give us her blessing so we can get married. 
My boyfriend is truly worried that his mother will still refuse, maybe even not talk at all about it and make him choose between his family or me. 
I could never ask him to choose me and I don‚Äôt want him to choose me if it means losing his whole family. 

Im at a loss at what I can really do and have been crying non stop for the past days, slowly realizing that I‚Äôll most likely lose the love of my life in the next couple months.

It‚Äôs worth noting that his mother is in her 60‚Äôs, really religious and has lived her whole life in Algeria, not really being aware of what happens outside of her home country like the Black Lives Matter movement.


Is there really anything we can do except pray and hope she‚Äôll at least try talking to me and meeting me face to face at least once? 
",Should I try convincing my boyfriend‚Äôs mother to let us be together or should we end the relationship sooner than later?,"The individual has been dating her boyfriend for almost four years. Her boyfriend is Muslim, and their relationship is considered against his religion, as dating is not typically accepted in Islam. They have chosen to maintain their relationship in a way that respects his beliefs, being abstinent and only engaging in minimal physical affection like holding hands and hugging. 

The woman is currently reading the Quran and learning about Islam to better understand her boyfriend's faith, which has brought them closer together. 

A significant issue has arisen due to her boyfriend's mother disapproving of their relationship, largely stemming from a misunderstanding about her sexuality. Two years prior, the mother's disapproval intensified after she discovered a profile picture on Facebook that she interpreted as a sign of her being bisexual, due to the picture being supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement. 

This misunderstanding led to the mother attempting to force her son to end the relationship, resulting in a period where they nearly broke up. However, the boyfriend sought guidance through prayer, which led him to continue the relationship but under the pretense that they had broken up with respect to his mother's wishes. 

Both individuals acknowledge the potential consequences of their relationship on family dynamics, demonstrating a willingness to prioritize family over their romance if it comes to that. The situation is further complicated by the impending visit from his family from Algeria, where his mother has lived her whole life and carries strong religious convictions, potentially limiting her awareness of contemporary social movements.",6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iyiarw/is_there_a_future_for_me_25f_and_my_24m_partner/,relationships

We had moved into my mothers to save and my mum asked her that we do not have sex under her roof whilst living there (thanks mum) 2. she felt like God was telling her to refrain from sex and to get closer to her faith - she had been saying this for a while 3. she's been through some things and wanted to give her body time to heal properly, cant write it on here.

I chose to support her choice, I love her and want to marry her soon and I genuinely don't want that with anyone else I'm a homebody and a 1 woman man, but it went on and on and has been the toughest 3 years for me mentally, at times its been mental torture, we've communicated and she's always listened to how I feel.

We moved into our own place 5 months ago and nothing has changed, but she said she's trying to get there. I've been communicating I'm really really struggling and ititss taken me to some low places and even affected my self worth and confidence. I reached my breaking point a few weeks ago & decided to search for local escorts online, I contacted one  but the more I spoke the more I felt conflicted. I didn't want to have sex with anyone else, but I was so tired of waiting I just wanted the option to actually have what I wanted, it felt unfair. HOWEVER, I ultimately decided NOT to go through with it, I knew if I did this there was no going back from this path and I came home to her.

A week and a half later, she saw my deleted texts and was livid, she cried and said she doesn't wanna be with me anymore. since then we're amicable, but tonight she's asked me to move out for a while so she can have space to think. I haven't been begging or pressuring her but I've explained what brought me to that point and that I'd like to move forward with her together. however I think once I move out she'll likely decide to stay single.

TL;DR I can't help but think all of this would have been avoided if I had what I needed, but although I feel like a piece of shit I'm trying to give myself grace as its been a rough 3 years and I really tried.

How do I fix this? I would like to have relationship with her",How do I fix this? I would like to have a relationship with her.,"The individual in the Reddit post is in a committed relationship with a woman they have been with for almost three years. Their relationship has faced challenges, particularly because the woman decided to stop having sex for a period, which was influenced by various factors:

1. **Living Situation**: They moved into the individual's mother's house to save money, during which the mother requested that they refrain from having sex in her home.
2. **Personal Beliefs**: The woman expressed that she felt a spiritual call to abstain from sex to deepen her faith and focus on her healing.
3. **Health Reasons**: The woman has had past experiences that she did not elaborate on, but which contributed to her decision to heal and take a break from sexual intimacy.

The individual identifies as a homebody and a one-woman man, expressing a strong commitment to their partner and a desire to marry her. However, the prolonged lack of intimacy has led to significant mental distress for them over the past three years, affecting their self-worth and confidence.

They recently moved into their own place five months ago, yet the situation has not improved. Feeling desperate due to ongoing struggles, the individual sought out local escorts but ultimately chose not to pursue this option, instead returning to their partner. However, this action was discovered, leading to conflict in their relationship and the woman's request for space to reflect on their future together.",0,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iyhjyv/36m_ive_upset_my_girlfriend_34f_how_do_i_fix_it/,relationships
2025-02-26 06:04:05,1iygus9,I [19F] feel like I‚Äôm slowly losing attraction to my bf [19M] and don‚Äôt know if I should stay,"So basically my bf and I started dating about a year ago when we are seniors in high school. He was in my class and I was initially drawn to him for his good looks but also the fact he seemed smart and just a tiny nerdy. Honestly our relationship started out pretty rocky and occasionally gave me doubts. I didn‚Äôt always feel like I was getting along hat I wanted emotionally, but after many long conversations we always seemed to work through whatever problem came up. It was always small things and often had to do with a lack of communication which has gotten much better over time. I‚Äôm his first serious gf so it‚Äôs clear he hasn‚Äôt had a lot of experience and doesn‚Äôt always know to do certain things, but has always listened when I‚Äôd tell him what I need/expect from him. We have been doing long distance for quite a few months now as we go to colleges over 7 hours away, but I feel like our relationship has become even stronger. He‚Äôs gotten so much better at communication and expressing his love for me. However there‚Äôs been a bunch of thing‚Äôs about him on my mind that make me unsure about our future together. To start off, he seems to have zero career aspirations. We are both freshmen in college, so I absolutely don‚Äôt expect him to have everything figured out, but I wish her at least give it a little more thought. He‚Äôs only at college cause that‚Äôs just what his parents told him  and are paying for him to do, but he hasn‚Äôt really done much there. He‚Äôs done alright in most of his classes but puts as little effort in as necessary and doesn‚Äôt participate in literally any club or organization. He doesn‚Äôt even know what to major in, so I‚Äôve encouraged him to go to some club or job fairs his school has or to seek out some of the many other resources and opportunities provided to help him get exposed to different careers, but he‚Äôs done none of that and just plays video games with his friends all day. He rarely goes out, doesn‚Äôt do any clubs or sports, and pretty much no other hobbies, and I just feel like he could be doing so much more withhis abundance of time. On the other hand, I consider myself to be a highly ambitious person, and also find that an important quality in the person I‚Äôm with. I have currently been working extremely hard in school to get the degree I want and to eventually attend graduate school, have joined every organization and opportunity related to my future career, am looking for internships, and still find time to go out and work on my many hobbies. I find his lack of ambition and drive extremely unattractive and can help but thinking he‚Äôs lazy. I am working towards a good high paying job so I can have the future I dream of but I don‚Äôt see him doing the same. But I want someone who can match or surpass me in this aspect as I don‚Äôt want to be the breadwinner of my future family. I have a hard time imagining that will be him. 

But on a slightly lesser note, it also kinda bothers me how he barely takes care of himself. He‚Äôll let his hair grow out into his eyes and sometimes wait till it gets greasy to wash it. He doesn‚Äôt work out whatsoever so doesn‚Äôt have a very muscular body, and could do a better job brushing his teeth and his breath often smells bad. He wears the same clothes for days straight and pretty much never cleans anything. He joked about how he hasn‚Äôt washed his sheets once since he moved into his dorm. He thought it was hilarious but I was disgusted. 
 
He also has pretty much no hobbies other than video games, and as someone with many hobbies, it aways felt kinda strange to to. I‚Äôve always enjoyed working out, cooking, different types of art, learning languages, and playing instruments, but he‚Äôs never really cared about a single one of those. This sound kinda mean but he kinda just feels a little lame and uninteresting sometimes.

But on the other hand he‚Äôs learned to treat me so well, and it‚Äôs become clear how important I am to him and how much he loves me. It feels like he‚Äôd do almost anything for me. I feel so comfortable and happy when I am around him and he makes me laugh all the time. He‚Äôs a great listener and always manages to comfort me when I am down. He also has a really good heart and strong morals which is something I love about him. Not to mention I‚Äôve always found him physically attractive since the beginning with his strong facial features and tall height. I can‚Äôt imagine losing him, but also struggle to imagine a future with him. Is it worth staying and hoping he‚Äôll change and mature? Should I encourage him further to get his life figured out and to develop some passions? Or without that aspect of the attraction, is the relationship even worth saving?

TL;DR: my bf has no passions or gold for the future and spends his days playing video games. This has been causing me to lose attraction for him over time and I am not sure if I should stay with him at this point","Should I stay with my boyfriend who has no passions or goals for the future and spends his days playing video games, even though I feel my attraction to him diminishing?","The individual in the Reddit post provides the following background information and context about their situation:

- They and their boyfriend started dating as seniors in high school.
- The initial attraction to the boyfriend was due to his appearance and perceived intelligence.
- The relationship experienced early challenges due to communication issues, but these were largely resolved over time, and they have been in a long-distance relationship for several months as they attend colleges over 7 hours apart.
- The girlfriend considers herself highly ambitious, actively working hard in school to earn a desired degree and aims to attend graduate school.
- She has joined various organizations, is seeking internships, and remains engaged in multiple hobbies, such as working out, cooking, art, learning languages, and playing instruments.
- In contrast, her boyfriend has shown little interest in his college experience, lacks career aspirations, and has not participated in any clubs or organizations. He is in college due to parental encouragement and support but does not put much effort into his academics or personal interests beyond playing video games.
- The girlfriend finds her boyfriend's lack of ambition and poor self-care (such as hygiene and personal grooming) unattractive, which has started to affect her feelings for him.
- Despite these concerns, she acknowledges that he treats her well, is supportive, and makes her feel comfortable and happy, indicating a strong emotional connection. 

This background paints a picture of a relationship whose dynamics are challenged by differing levels of ambition and self-care between the partners.",0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iygus9/i_19f_feel_like_im_slowly_losing_attraction_to_my/,relationships
2025-02-26 05:28:59,1iyg9yu,"BF (28m) of 8 months hasn‚Äôt said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù but verbally commits via talks about moving in, marriage, and kids. Any advice on how to cope with a lack of ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù?","
Hi all! Just as the title says to start - my (27f) boyfriend (28m) of 8 months hasn‚Äôt said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù yet. He‚Äôs relayed to me that he‚Äôs never really been in a serious relationship as an adult, and has never been close to saying I Love You in an adult relationship. He stated the closest he got was dating a friend of several years in high school for a few weeks, and even then, it was more or less puppy love. 

He is an incredible guy. I‚Äôve been in long term relationships (2, 4, 5 years) and I have NEVER felt so appreciated, seen, valued, and fulfilled in my life - which is why I feel like such an asshole that I feel such heartache at the fact he hasn‚Äôt said I Love You yet. He‚Äôs said I make him feel incredible, he‚Äôs never felt such intense emotions for anyone before. He‚Äôs initiated conversations about moving in together (timelines, where, budgeting, combined finances), getting engaged/married (timelines, our wedding dance song, what a marriage would look like for us), raising children together (how many, parenting styles, financial capabilities, mom/dad roles), and every other aspect you would expect from someone who is *in love* to discuss. I recently told him I couldn‚Äôt move in with him until we met ‚Äúcertain goals‚Äù, and when he realized I meant saying I Love You, he just goes, ‚Äú‚Ä¶..ah‚Äù

I‚Äôm absolutely in love with him so I find myself naturally thinking about these things (I haven‚Äôt said I Love You either, but with intention to not accidentally pressure him, which we‚Äôve discussed and agreed on). 

My need for advice/venting comes in because I feel so conflicted - I feel like the luckiest person in the world to have his affection and care, but I feel heartbroken that he has confirmed he still does not love me. I thought he was 9/10ths the way there about 4 months ago, just to find out he was just started to think he might have those feelings brewing. We used to dance and look into each other‚Äôs eyes and I *swore* I could nearly feel the love coming from his chest, just for him to say he never felt that. I cried myself to sleep that night, yet I feel like such a baby for doing so!!

We recently spoke about what he views love to be and what he needs to feel comfortable saying it, and he stated he won‚Äôt say it until he ‚Äúfeels his chest bursting with love and adoration towards [me] 24/7. Not just in moments or in circumstances, but in absolute 24/7 settings.‚Äù I feel disappointed and nervous - it almost seems unrealistic in a sense, and makes me worry if he‚Äôll ever get there? 

For context to my anxieties - In my first relationship, I waited a year to tell my partner I loved him, just for him to say he didn‚Äôt love me and didn‚Äôt see himself loving me ever. In my most recent (4 year) relationship, I was with a man who felt horrendously uncomfortable saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, and maybe said it 10 times total through those 4 years. I cannot do it. I can‚Äôt do that again. I need to hear it in a relationship. It provides such a reassurance like no other. The waiting makes me worry one of these two scenarios will happen again, which I‚Äôve voiced to my current partner, but it made him feel like I was trying to subconsciously pressure him. I assured him that wasn‚Äôt it, but I felt I needed to explain why sometimes when we‚Äôre looking in each others eyes, he can see how sad I become but refuse to talk to him about why - because all I want to do is tell him I love him, knowing he doesn‚Äôt feel that about me. 

I feel very frustrated and whiney - this is someone who treats me SO WELL in every other regard and no one is perfect. I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to ground myself in reality when I‚Äôm feeling this sadness and disappointment - no one is perfect, but he is DAMN close. He‚Äôs not saying never - just not yet - but it still feels like a rejection! Every moment I feel like he could potentially say it and he doesn‚Äôt feels like an overt rejection. 

Any advice on how to stop whining to myself about the lack of ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù? Trying to avoid making him feel pressured/uncomfortable when those moments of disappointment at the timeline/pacing surface. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

TL;DR - my boyfriend of 8 months refuses to say I Love You until he feels sparks flying from his chest 24/7, despite initiating plans to live together, get married, have kids, etc. I thought he was much closer to it than he is in reality, and in what used to be moments of love I felt towards him, I now feel sadness, confusion, and disappointment knowing he doesn‚Äôt feel the same. On top of it all, I feel guilty and frustrated with my own internal emotional response. I feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills - HELP!","How can I manage my feelings of sadness and disappointment about my boyfriend not saying ""I love you"" while trying to avoid pressuring him?","The individual in the Reddit post is a 27-year-old woman who has been in long-term relationships in the past, including one lasting 2 years, another 4 years, and a third lasting 5 years. In her previous relationships, she has experienced heartache related to the expression of love, specifically waiting a year in her first relationship only to be told by her partner that he did not love her and did not see himself ever loving her. In her most recent 4-year relationship, the partner was uncomfortable saying ""I love you"" and only said it about 10 times throughout the entire duration of the relationship.

Currently, she has been dating her boyfriend, who is 28 years old, for 8 months.

The woman feels deeply conflicted, as she has never felt as valued and appreciated as she does in this relationship but is also struggling with her emotional needs for reassurance expressed through the words ""I love you."" The tension between her feelings of unconditional love and heartache about his reluctance to reciprocate verbally is contributing to her current emotional crisis.",11,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iyg9yu/bf_28m_of_8_months_hasnt_said_i_love_you_but/,relationships
2025-02-26 05:15:08,1iyg1su,How to know when to move on when you‚Äôre both still in love? 25F and 26M,"

Hi all. Really appreciate any advice, shared experiences, etc. My (25f) boyfriend (26m) and I have been together for 2 years. We have lived together for a year now. We have always been open about how we are planning to get married and have children together. I thought he was the one. 

We have been rocky for a while now, and constantly get into blowout fights about external things not related to our actions to each other. It is so overwhelming to me because what we fight about is not things that we can inherently fix, it is differences in some values. I am noticing how anxious I am to talk openly, how I worry about things he might say, how different he is from me and my community of people I surround myself with. But I am so so in love with him. We live together and have built a beautiful life. He listens and cares so much about my wellbeing in a way no one ever has. However we are just realizing we might not be compatible life partners, especially when it comes to values we want to instill into our children. 

I am really struggling with this. I lost my mom at 23 and don‚Äôt have the best family life, and the thought of not having my person makes me want to crawl into a hole and hibernate for the rest of my life. But bottom line, I don‚Äôt want to have any doubts at all about the person I marry and build a family with. How do you make the leap when you are both so in love with each other but realizing it might not be right?

Tldr: Together for two years, live together, have always talked about marriage, super in love with each other but worried about our lifetime compatibility and when to know what is best/ is this saveable?

2025-02-26 04:44:42,1iyfilj,U-Hauled in my first lesbian relationship across the country and feeling defeated,"My girlfriend (25F) and I (21F) met off of a dating site about 8 months ago. She was in my state for grad school, and after about a month of dating, she let me know she was moving across the country to her home state. I said fuck it, I really like this person and I would hate to not give this a fair shot. 

 The first month of living together was a lot of fun! We bought furniture and made a nice place for ourselves. The process wasn‚Äôt without struggles and arguments but I assume that is normal. After about 2 months living there, I realized that I might have fucked up. 
So here is the issues we have been experiencing.

We both struggle with ADHD but are total opposites. She is extremely Type-A, needs structure, routine, very particular and a homebody. She is also a pessimist, judgmental of others, and overall just sort of negative. I am Type-B, go where the wind blows, forgetful, naive, head in the clouds, excitable and love to spend time exploring. I can be negative on my bad days and have a bad sense of self esteem, but i‚Äôm generally very positive towards the world. 

She‚Äôs a great person and brings out a more goal oriented side of me. I admire so much about her. She‚Äôs so beautiful. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still here. 

The main issue is the way she speaks to me. When i‚Äôm struggling with myself or my career, she tells me what I could‚Äôve done better and why I‚Äôm failing. She laughs at my feelings and thoughts about my struggles. She is very blunt when I forget to clean up or make a mistake. She has made fun of my appearance on a few occasions. She is so exhausted at the end of her day that she doesn‚Äôt want to do anything with me, which I don‚Äôt blame her for but it sucks. She is unwilling to try and understand my hobbies or show interest in what I‚Äôm passionate about. Even watching a tv show or movie I like. I recently lost my job and had to beg her to show anything other than criticism. 

We grew up completely different. Her parents are immigrants and abused her in multiple ways growing up. They are also extremely religious and homophobic. I feel so much sympathy for her and try to make our home a safe and inviting place to be. I want to help her but I‚Äôm unable to do so effectively. My parents were helicopters who watched my every move, but were overall very kind and supportive people. 

We hardly have sex anymore. She almost never initiates, and when she does, i‚Äôm not turned on because there was no flirting, cuddling or foreplay. We don‚Äôt make out outside of sex. I‚Äôm tired of feeling so undesirable. She thinks she compliments me enough, but the harsh words tube out the compliments thrown my way every few days. 

I am not perfect. I‚Äôve never lived with someone else, and I am not used to her standard of cleanliness. I‚Äôm not a slob but I do struggle to pick up after my clothes every day. I can be snarky, defensive and ignorant. But the lack of kindness when she speaks to me hurts. I just don‚Äôt see this getting any better. There are other factors that complicate the relationship more, but this is the important stuff.

2025-02-26 02:53:32,1iydgf5,"My ""best friends"" Messaged me 2 months after they were blocked and I don't know what to do","I (F19) have been friends with these two girls (both 20) one since high school and one since middle school. Its been a very come and go friendship and there were times that it felt like they cared and other times they didn't, we'd go months without talking and then talk a lot for a little bit and that cycle was constant. 

My Junior Year of High school I got a girlfriend (F19) (at this point we were long distance) they've been great I love them with all of my heart. Toward the end of my Senior year, they had a problem with the friend since High school, but I couldn't totally get a reason out of them so I tried to make both sides happy, and through my graduation party the two friends helped a lot with set up and such and it was fun, my girlfriend didn't like it so much but we dealt and it was fine. 

I moved a good while away for college (We are in person for college), and a couple days in my father past away, and I had to come back home, I tried not to make a big deal about it because I didn't want the attention on myself so I didn't really talk to anyone but my girlfriend and family about it because how do you really just go to someone and be like ""my dad died give me attention"" they found out over social media and messaged me condolences I said thank you and that was it, they didn't come to the funeral nor ""Check"" on me, as I did with one of there grandparents. 

 Anyways I went back to college and then I came home for winter break, we mutually messaged like hey, we should hang out, and that never happened due to my mom, and they just were like ""meh whatever"" and eventually my partner convinced me these friends really didn't care unless they needed me for something and eventually I blocked them, or I would've held onto it.

 I had missed an account because 1 of them has like 6 accounts and just didn't think about it and they messaged me two months later ""Hey this is childish, were you're friends, this isn't the You we know, I Hope you're happy"" (It was longer than that, but that was the gist of the message) my instant reaction was to block the account because I was panicked. I told my partner and I mean they weren't upset but they weren't sure of anything either and told me what to do what I thought was right. 

 now I'm second guessing myself and if that was the right thing to do, I'm not really sure what I would've messaged back, If I should unblock and message them back or If I should Just leave it alone and let it go away. 

TL;DR: My decently long time friends (Both F20) seemed to just stop caring about me (f19) and I blocked them so I could just let go of the situation instead of holding onto it, I missed an account and they figured it out and messaged me on it, and I don't know if I should leave it alone or respond. ","Should I unblock my friends and respond to their message, or should I just leave it alone and let the situation go?","The individual in the Reddit post is a 19-year-old female (F19) who has a complicated friendship history with two girls, both 20 years old. She has been friends with one of them since high school and with the other since middle school, describing the friendship as inconsistent with periods of close contact followed by long stretches of silence.

In terms of education, she is currently attending college, having moved away for this purpose. She experienced a significant personal tragedy when her father passed away shortly after she began her college journey, prompting her to return home for the funeral. This loss seems to have affected her interactions with her friends as she felt uncomfortable seeking attention or support from others regarding her father‚Äôs death, choosing only to share this with her girlfriend and family.

She has a girlfriend who she describes as someone she loves deeply, although their relationship is long-distance during her time in college. The individual's relationship with her friends became strained, particularly when her girlfriend had issues with one of the friends near the end of her senior year of high school. This strain seems to have contributed to her feeling that the friends did not care about her well-being, especially as they did not reach out after her father's death.

The individual also mentions her mother and suggests that family dynamics may play a role in her situation, particularly regarding the difficulties in maintaining her friendships during emotionally challenging times. She ultimately decided to block her friends out of a sense that they were not genuinely invested in their friendship.",0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iydgf5/my_best_friends_messaged_me_2_months_after_they/,relationships
2025-02-26 00:53:25,1iyb0y2,"I don't think I can continue enabling my friend, or being around her drunk","Me (27f) and my friend (25f) have been friends for a while. She was my highschool sweetheart, and we sooner or later realized we couldn't continue dating, and decided to stay friends. Right now, and in the past, her drinking has severely impacted our relationship. As soon as she drinks, her ""true colors"" come out, she starts repeatedly saying the same unhinged and very offensive, demeaning, and just not true views. She struggles with anxiety, so it makes sense.

When she's sober, she's more mindful of what she says, but I'm trans, and when she drinks, she pretty much says that she's struggling waaay more severely than I am, and pretty much takes the term ""cis"" as a slur.

I'm at her place right now, and currently she's drunk and she's pretty much abusing me by blasting her music extremely loud after she saw me go and hide in her kitchen with my headphones in because I genuinely have reached my limit with her. She's on her couch, repeatedly saying the same point/sentence, and it's honestly scaring me and making her insufferable. She gets like this every single time she drinks. She's very passive aggressive, and doesn't listen to almost anything I tell her. She's now angry with me because I have a different spirituality faith than her. She fights people and gets into petty arguments with them. I am currently homeless, and because my memory is fragmented (DID/C-PTSD) and I really needed the shelter and a good night's rest, that I'd be dealing with this yet again.

TL;DR: highschool sweetheart that a dating relationship never worked out within a few months with is currently my friend, and her drinking makes me almost completely unable to tolerate her. She constantly criticizes my own struggles with certain chemicals, too, so I'm pretty much asking if it would be a better choice to maybe show distance, or explain why I can't be her friend right now or any more. We've been friends since 2014 or so so, 11 years total. Our relationship in general is kinda based on trauma bonding, anyway, which I find doesn't typically work.

2025-02-26 00:47:47,1iyawv4,I (22m) constantly have the feeling I‚Äôm walking on eggshells to not make my girlfriend (20f) upset,"(Sorry for any grammatical errors, English is not my first language) Me and my girlfriend are in a relationship for 1.5 years, she lives an hour away from me. We see each other almost every weekend (the whole weekend we stay over at our places) On the weekdays we call and text each other to maintain our relationship. 

The last couple of months we have been having big arguments almost every week, the arguments almost always start because i hurt her emotionally, i will give you an example that happened today.

I came home from a 9,5 hour workday, when i got home i immediately got a text from her asking if we could call. I told her i‚Äôd rather not call for a bit because i just wanted to be by myself for a quick hour and not talk to anyone, some personal space. She texts ‚Äòok‚Äô back, i immediately knew something was wrong because of that text, that is something that always happens. So i asked her what‚Äôs up, she explained to me that she didn‚Äôt get where i was coming from, why i didn‚Äôt want to speak to her. 

So i rang her up and explained that i was tired because of a long workday and i just needed some personal space to destress. She answered by saying she still doesn‚Äôt get it and asked how i am going to do that when we live together in the future. She says if she is in the same situation she‚Äôd rather destress with me on the phone than alone. I explained that i just wanted an hour alone and after that we could call. This made her upset and emotional, after a very long conversation she still didn‚Äôt get why i didn‚Äôt want to destress with her. She said that i‚Äôd rather choose doing nothing over talking to her. I tried explaining that is absolutely not the case and i love her dearly, this did not help.

I feel like every time i cant call her when she wants to call i don‚Äôt meet her expectations and she gets upset, i get the feeling that i cant speak my mind about what i need in live sometimes because it might upset her, it feels like i am walking on eggshells all the time because she might get upset.

Every time we get in an argument she always says i don‚Äôt care about her, when in reality i do, i care so much that i am texting her deep in the night about an argument when i have to wake up early the next morning, i have changed countless things about my behavior towards her even though i feel like i cant be myself but i don‚Äôt want to make her feel upset. And those changes never feel like I‚Äôm doing enough because there is always another ‚Äòissue‚Äô around the corner.

I really do love this girl, and I realize this whole post is negative about her but when we are together in the weekends we never get into big arguments. But when we are separated i feel like i am walking on eggshells, literally everything else i love about her, i hope some of you have some advice for me, or maybe i am the problem after all. Thanks in advance

Health issues keep me pretty limited, but I try to purchase and cook meals where I can. 

  
This is where it gets chaotic though. 

  
Neither of us have a lot of money, and she's INCREDIBLY paranoid of a doctor's bill/medicine costs. So much so, that she'll toss food  that I'd made for myself/planned on eating myself (that she'd NEVER eat due to ingredients) despite asking her to please please please just let me handle it. 

  
She'll get up early just to go into the fridge and clear out the ""expired"" things. Now, while that sounds helpful....She SPECIFICALLY gets up before I will to do this because quote ""well, yeah I do that, you pitch an absolute temper tantrum and scream at me"" if she does it when I'm around. 

  
‚Ä¢ These ""expired"" things are often meals that I'd planned on eating for dinner, didn't want to risk having too much food/food waste & didn't make a back up dinner. They're usually at day 3-4 in the fridge, or are nonperishables like spices or meal components in the freezer.

‚Ä¢ I don't scream, and I don't throw tantrums though? I've tried to be more assertive and tried to talk to her like we're both adults, but her opinion of me since moving back in is that I'm a child/irresponsible/etc. 

I genuinely cannot afford to keep replacing the same thing over and over and over again, but I also can't currently afford to move out (or buy a separate fridge, as much as I'd love to). 

Is there anything I can do that'll appease both sids? Any options for middle ground? (\*Preferably that doesn't just end in letting her throw everything away constantly)

  
Tl;Dr! My mother (60f) and I (30f) have different views on what counts as ""expired"" food, but it's always my meals that magically are toxic despite her having absolutely ZERO plans on eating them. Neither of us have a large pool of resources to cover food poisoning doc visits \*or\* constant replacement goods. Is there any options, conversations, or actions that can work towards a middle ground here?

She describes having health issues that limit her capabilities, which affects her daily functioning and may contribute to her current crisis. 

Both she and her mother have financial constraints, as they do not have a lot of money to work with, which exacerbates their living situation. The daughter attempts to manage her diet by purchasing and cooking her own meals, although her mother is overly cautious about food safety and tends to dispose of items she deems expired, especially foods that the daughter has prepared for herself. 

The daughter feels that her mother treats her as though she is irresponsible and lacks maturity, leading to conflicts over food storage and decision-making. The mother‚Äôs behavior seems to stem from a longstanding pattern of concern about health costs, particularly associated with doctor bills and medicine, impacting their interaction and causing further tension in their living arrangements. 

Overall, this background sets the stage for their current crisis, characterized by health limitations, financial struggles, and strained family dynamics.

I‚Äôm (25F) still not over it and don‚Äôt want them to hang out.,"I asked my boyfriend multiple times throughout our 2 year relationship if he had hooked up with his friend from home in the past. He said no each time. We moved back to his home town and hung out with her a few times. I always had my suspicions and deep down knew. It wasn‚Äôt until his dad got really drunk and mentioned something and the truth came out. They had a causal hook up relationship on and off for years. He said he initially lied because he didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd ever meet and didn‚Äôt want to upset me and then the lie just spiraled. This was a huge betrayal of my trust and morals. We almost broke up when I found out and it was very difficult for months. 

That was 8 months ago and it still makes me seethe that he would lie to me. I have a problem with obsessive ruminating and still get so upset about it. We agreed he would no longer hang out with this girl. I am not threatened by her but having a casual on and off again thing with a friend is very unsettling to me. He stopped hanging out with her or reaching out from that day until recently. He recently went to their other friends birthday gathering (12 or so people) and she was there. He told me ahead of time and I was upset but said it was fine for him to go but I would not be joining. 

We now have another invite to a gathering she will be at. I will not be going and frankly don‚Äôt want him going as it is not what we agreed to when I wanted to make it work after his lie and feel like it is crossing a boundary that we made. I don‚Äôt want to sacrifice my comfort and boundaries when he was the one that fucked up.

We met in college, and he‚Äôs graduated since, so now we live a 30 minute drive apart from one another. So, about 6 months ago, we started having frequent arguments because my partner was anxious about me partying with my friends since he‚Äôs no longer around our college campus . I understood his point of view, and he proposed for us to share locations with one another on Life360 so he could know where I was at all times. I was hesitant about this since I lean more avoidant attachment in this relationship, but agreed nonetheless.

Fast forward to now, our relationship is mostly smooth, we‚Äôve met each others families, there‚Äôs been no cheating at all through our relationship. However, I‚Äôve been getting frustrated because my boyfriend still has his moments of paranoia. For example, last night, before going to sleep, he messages me: ‚ÄúHey, where were you today from 1-4 pm?‚Äù I responded: ‚Äúat home, why?‚Äù He replied ‚ÄúSo you weren‚Äôt across the street?‚Äù I responded: ‚Äúcorrect, I was at home‚Äù

He then sent me a screenshot from Life360 that my location was roaming to right across the street from my apartment. Immediately, I got a bad feeling in my gut that he was accusing me of something. I told him I didn‚Äôt appreciate his accusation and he replied ‚ÄúIt makes me more suspicious when you respond badly to these questions.‚Äù

Naturally, his response made me even more frustrated. This is a pretty frequent occurrence, even when I honestly tell him what I was doing, he asks me for pictures or some sort of proof. Am I overreacting at this incident? Should I have handled it better? Or is this a sign that we aren‚Äôt compatible?

2025-02-25 19:54:14,1iy43l5,I (m29) think im falling out of love with my gf (f29) and I dont know what to do,"Hi everyone!

So backstory, I (29m) have been dating my gf (29f) for 5 years now, living together for 3 of those years. We are the stereotypical 'fell in love at university' couple.

Most of our time spent together has been great. We share alot of common values and some common interests and fancy the heck out of each other, physically (I also have some kinks that she is very supporting of). Even the last 3 years of living together has been pretty good (save for the occasional few days where we fight and argue).

However, recently, I've been feeling very...hollow. There are many reasons for this, mostly due to increasing work stress and my friend group growing more distant (some have moved out of the area). With the latter in particular, I am finding that I need to get out and find a community and grow as a person. Admittedly, I feel I have leant on this friend group too much and have neglected finding my own interests and, dare I say, personality. I am trying to focus more on myself now, but I'm seeing that it is coming at a cost of my relationship as my gf and I are spending significantly less time together. And when we are spending time together I'm still focused on my own personal development. We have talked about this and she is OK with us focusing on ourselves, but I feel like it's coming at a cost of my feelings for her.

In addition, I am concerned about doing things together with her as she has a pretty big problem with people pleasing, particularly in front of new people. She comes on way too hard and it puts people off alot of the time. She knows that it comes from a deep-seated need for attention which she agrees she could benefit with therapy. But it means that her social group is very small and makes me concerned about building joint connections with others.

This points me to thinking that the relationship is coming to an end. I don't want to hold her into a relationship that is lacking in feelings, and waste her time. But at the same time, I am terrified of losing her. We share so many common values and we understand each other pretty well. I'm pretty sure I can marry this woman, but I just feel like I'm not fully developed as a person yet. I keep thinking about raising children and I just don't see how they can look up to a man who still has so much to achieve and struggles to demonstrate personality (I'm seeing a therapist about the latter issue).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

I don't know what to do.",What should I do about my relationship if I'm feeling hollow and fear I'm losing feelings for my girlfriend while trying to focus on my personal development?,"The individual (29m) has been in a relationship with his girlfriend (29f) for five years and they have been living together for three of those years. They met and fell in love while attending university. Generally, they have enjoyed their time together, sharing many common values and interests. However, the individual is currently experiencing feelings of hollowness, primarily due to increasing work stress and a growing distance from his friend group, which has become less active as some friends have moved away.

He acknowledges that he has leaned on his friend group and has neglected to develop his own interests and personal identity. While he is now trying to focus on personal development, this is affecting the time he spends with his girlfriend, creating tension in their relationship. He is also concerned about their compatibility in social situations, particularly due to his girlfriend's tendencies toward people-pleasing, which stems from her need for attention. This has resulted in a small social circle for her, complicating efforts to build joint connections with others.

The individual is contemplating the future of their relationship, expressing fears about not being ready for commitment or parenthood while still feeling unfulfilled in personal growth. He is seeing a therapist to address these personal issues, and is torn between his desire for personal development and his attachment to his girlfriend, causing him to question the sustainability of their relationship.",2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iy43l5/i_m29_think_im_falling_out_of_love_with_my_gf_f29/,relationships
2025-02-25 19:29:42,1iy3i56,My (48) wife (43) is fine with sex once a month or less. What to do?,"Hi Everyone,

Here we go...Same old story...I have a high libido and my wife's is quite low. We have been together for seven years. She is comfortable with having sex once a month at the most, I would like it once a day which I do realize is a huge imbalance but even once a week would be a compromise. I am 48, she is 43. We have two young children which certainly contribute to us not having time for each other. We are also middle class and struggling financially, so babysitters, nannies, etc. are out of the conversation. Despite these hurdles, I still think there is time, at least once a week anyway...

Throughout my life, especially in my forties, I have waited for my libido to drop because it seems like a bit of a curse, especially at my age where it is supposed to have decreased by now.

I work two jobs. She is a stay at home mom. I also contribute to helping with the kids and the housework. I sleep very little (about six hours on average a night) but my libido is still quite strong.

Like most couples, the sex was pretty hot and heavy in the very beginning, but began to lag as time went on and the sex really dropped since having our second kid. The first big drop came the instant I moved in with her years ago. Year by year it gets worse. In the last two years we have had sex maybe 20 times.

We talk about the subject often because I am always grumpy and edgy. There is always a typical excuse on her part. Too tired, headache, etc. I just think it is two different libidos at work here which seems to be quite common.

Part of the problem is that I think she is the hottest woman alive. Just a smokeshow. I am still so attracted to her even after all this time. This contributes to my edginess.

Also, I often have stopped initiating due to rejection which leads to more resentment on my part and her feeling pressured. Ugh.

My question is should I continue to go like this? I love her, my life, etc. The only part where I am unfulfilled is in bed. Do I just suck it up and have a miserable sex life for the remainder of my years? I don't expect her to want to have sex just for me, I want her to want it too. At this point I just don't see it happening.

TL;DR My wife is fine with sex once a month or less and I am finding it difficult to cope with due to my high libido at the age of 48.","Should I just accept a sex life that is unfulfilling for me, or is there a way to address the disparity in libido with my wife?","The individual is 48 years old and has been married for seven years to a 43-year-old wife. They have two young children, which impacts their availability for intimacy. He works two jobs while his wife is a stay-at-home mom, and they are facing financial struggles, which limits their options for childcare support like babysitters or nannies. The individual experiences a high libido, which he feels has not decreased as expected with age, and this imbalance with his wife's much lower libido (approximately once a month) contributes to his feelings of frustration and unfulfillment in their sexual relationship. He helps with housework and childcare, but his sleep is limited to about six hours a night. The couple's sexual activity has declined significantly over the years, particularly after the birth of their second child, leading to resentment and communication issues regarding their differing sexual needs.",179,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iy3i56/my_48_wife_43_is_fine_with_sex_once_a_month_or/,relationships
2025-02-25 19:08:12,1iy2zj7,First relationship,"TL;DR: I (26F) keep seeing my boyfriend‚Äôs (31M) Facebook searches full of sexy girls, which makes me insecure. He denies searching for them, claiming it's accidental, but I don‚Äôt believe him. I forgave him before, even when I caught him watching porn, but it keeps happening. We‚Äôve been together for four years, live together, and even have a mortgage. He‚Äôs kind to me otherwise, but I don‚Äôt know if this is a dealbreaker. I feel stuck and don‚Äôt know what to do.


I (26F) keep seeing my boyfriend‚Äôs (31M) searches on Facebook, and they‚Äôre full of sexy girls. It‚Äôs making me feel really insecure.

We‚Äôve talked about this before because the first time I caught him, I was furious and asked why these girls were showing up in his search bar. He insisted that he didn‚Äôt search for them, claiming they just appeared in his video feed and that he ""accidentally"" clicked on their profiles. I told him there‚Äôs no such thing as accidentally clicking, and I called him a liar. But he keeps insisting that he‚Äôs not searching for these girls and that he only loves me.

I forgave him. I also forgave him when I caught him masturbating to a porn video, thinking it‚Äôs normal for guys to watch porn from time to time. But just today, I saw another new girl‚Äîa sexy girl‚Äîin his search bar, and I don‚Äôt think this is normal anymore.

It‚Äôs really hard for me because we‚Äôve been together for four years. He‚Äôs my first everything‚Äîmy first relationship‚Äîand I don‚Äôt know if this is something that warrants a breakup. He knows it hurts me whenever I see his searches, but I don‚Äôt see any real change.

I know he loves me. We‚Äôve been living together for four years, and I can feel his love. He‚Äôs kind to me, and aside from this issue (and sometimes his immaturity, like playing video games too much), I don‚Äôt have any major problems with him.

I don‚Äôt know if I should continue this relationship. It‚Äôs especially difficult because we have a mortgage together‚Äîwe decided to buy our own home‚Äîand I‚Äôve invested so much in this relationship financially, physically, and emotionally.

2025-02-25 18:48:11,1iy2hq8,I feel like my (29F) boyfriend (33M) does not want to be with me,"Throwaway because he knows my personal account and I'm just looking for input from third party people.

  
My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half at this point, been living together for the majority of it (fast I know). All has been good, we fit together well, we have the same world views, life ideologies, everything. Genuinely felt as this is the man I will spend my life with.   
He was the one pursuing me in the beginning. Now I'm left feeling sometimes, that all the pretty things (like me being his dream woman) being said at the beginning were just a play on getting the girl. 

To make a long story shorter - arguments have been more frequent. And I'm always left feeling as if I'm in the wrong and I'm trying to understand if that is the case or am I being villanised. 

Let's start off with the big one - checking out other girls. Big thing for us, trying to overcome it. He states it is because he is a man and men biologically are more likely to do so. He is trying to be better, and props to him, he is doing well. It used to be to the point where he got turned on by other girls. Summer is coming, and frankly I am worried. 

I get that it can be me being insecure, I am actively working on it. But I can't help but simply be rubbed the wrong way about my boyfriend checking out other women and being turned on by them, knowing that we maybe have sex 1-2x a week if that and for me to turn him on I have to go to the lengths of wearing pretty lingerie every time to actually get something out of him (because me in sweats is not attractive). Granted this could all be from years of porn usage (which he states he has been recovering from for the last year or so) 

Another point, whenever I mess up and say something mean or do something he doesn't like, I am automatically made to feel as if the worst person ever. It doesn't even have to be big things. Say I'm just feeling particularly sad that day, or depressed. Immediately I'm made feel as if that is how I am always. Being told how being with someone who is sad or unhappy all the time is tiring. Mind you, I try my best to be in good spirits most days knowing how much it affects him, so I am very conscious and mindful of it. 

We almost never cuddle anymore, or have quality time in the house besides us watching a show.   
Also a pattern here, as I've brought this up multiple times, but I am asking too much. I know he has a lot on his plate. He is doing a lot and I am very supportive and happy for him focusing his energy on stuff that brings him joy. However, sometimes I also want to matter? 

And another big one - he almost never says the three words. And if he does, it's a simple ""love ya"". It took him a while to finally say it to me anyway at the beginning of our relationship, which is fair and I understand fully. I'd rather a person take their time and say it, than say it just because.

However, almost never hearing it from your partner is becoming more and more hurtful. Would it kill him to just say ""I love you"" to me once in a while?   
He is incredibly scared of opening up and loving, as he puts it ""have said I love you every day in previous relationships, and for what? we still ended things?"" 

  
He has admitted he does not feel 100% committed. Maybe 90% if that. Which has left me feeling not secure fully and even more scared of other women, even though he would never be a cheater. Which I've communicated to him. I've been trying to be an individual. However, I am slowly, due to all of this, feeling as if I am pulling away and distancing myself, in hopes he realises things, bc nothing else helps any longer. 

  
Whenever there is an inconvenience, or even sometimes on good days, it feels as if he is purposely pushing me away and making me the villain, which is a trait he does have and he acknowledges it.

  
I've been actively working on myself, therapy, working out, taking care of my looks (makeup, hair the whole shebang), and in some ways I have been feeling like I've been finding and losing myself all at the same time. It's as if 90% of me is doing all this to feel confident and love myself more, but the 10% is trying to fit myself in a mold of what he would like in a woman. 

I'm constantly trying to keep the house tidy, make sure there's food ready, make sure he feels comfortable and loved and accepted. Hear him out, and offer my constructive feedback and advice on stuff he is struggling with. Have been trying to create a stress free open space for him to come to me with anything and everything without judgement.

  
I am at my wits end and starting to feel as if he does not want to be with me and am scared that this won't work in the long run. I am at an age where I want to be settled down, make a life for myself and a family. 

  
TL;DR:   
Bf of 1.5 years rarely says I love you, tends to check out other women, is constantly stressed and working and villainises me making me feel like a bad girlfriend.

2025-02-25 18:40:22,1iy2aoz,"My (23m) mother (56m) is very needy and dependent, and the origin of this behavior is problematic.","
For a little background information, my family has been somewhat struggling (mostly emotionally) since my father died of a heart attack two years ago. It was extremely hard on my mom, and as a result, her alcohol consumption increased. This would result in her feeling like sh*t in the morning, being late/calling off work, and the annoying part, being quite needy to my brother (25m) and I.
    
I had no job when my dad died, so I didn't mind doing stuff around the house and whatnot obviously, especially considering she's understanding enough not to charge me rent. While I would look for truck driving jobs(I had acquired my CDL six weeks after the death of my father), I would also do things around the house, go to the store for my mom, etc, because it makes sense obviously given my situation. 
    
However, this is where things started getting ridiculous. It's late 2023, and I had just come home after truck driving turned out to be a flop (I b*tched out after a week lol). A couple months later I decide Im gonna sign up for doordash and just drive full time. I figured I could make some money, and getting out of the house more would make me feel better. At this point, though, my moms alcoholism had worsened, going through a couple small boxes of wine DAILY. She would keep asking me to go to the store while I was working to get groceries, but I would also get wine every time I'd go to the store. Obviously, this would cut into my schedule, and affect my income due to productivity loss. All I wanted was to feel like I could support myself.
   
She would start asking my brother or myself to take her to work; My brother and I figured out she was now drinking in the morning. After a certain point I would just dread talking to her because I knew it was gonna be the same old same old. This would result in me just sneaking out and doordashing just so I can avoid having to do stuff for her. However, she would still call me, ask me why I snuck out, and then proceed to ask for more wine (and groceries, but mostly wine). The fact that she was taking advantage of me being able to work anytime I please really annoyed me. I didn't immediately tell her she was annoying me because I didn't want to feel selfish. Still loving my mother, obviously, this internal conflict just really stressed me out. 
    
I started a pest control job in late march (2024) and even during my shift she'd call me asking when I get off so I can either get her wine or pick her up from work. In June, I got fired from the job for reasons I wont get into on this thread. I decided to doordash full time again, and her annoying habits worsened. My car was also starting to give me a hard time after dashing so much, so that just added to the stress. By this point I already expressed how I felt with my mom about her being a needy alcoholic (I know it sounds mean, but it's the truth). Even though my brother and I have expressed our concerns, she's showing little to no interest in changing her ways.
    
Fastforward to January of 2025. My friends and I had recently did a bunch of work on my car and got it working better, so I was confident I could live on my own just dashing (and now instacart too). I had just saved up about 4 grand or some sh*t, and I decided I couldn't deal with this sh*t with my mom anymore, so I moved out about 20 minutes away in the country. I have three roommates so expenses are manageable. I thought, sh*t, I don't live at home anymore so maybe she will learn to finally change her habits and take care of herself. WRONG! She would call me when Im twenty minutes away doordashing, asking me to come home and show the delivery man my ID so she can get her wine (her license expired october 2024 and she wouldn't get it renewed, smh). I was furious after getting this call, but remembered my passport was still at the house so I kept my cool and told her to use that. However, she would still try to ask me to get stuff from the store even though Im 20 minutes away trying to live my own life. You'd think she wouldn't want to inconvenience someone working, but nope. 
    
I will say this though. In her defense, our basement had recently flooded with a bunch of crap after something went wrong with our plumming (idk the details), so doing some things for her was actually reasonable. For instance, I wouldn't mind being over there because she doesn't feel comfortable being around random male workers at the house, particularly at night. It still didn't change the fact that she would still ask me to get her wine and sh*t though.

Fastforward to February. My mom is deteriorating. She is weak all over her body, and is now calling me while my brother is at work to come help her in and out of bed. She also would have to have me help her get off the toilet; that's how feeble she was. My brother still lives at home so he would help her when he wasn't at work. The turning point was Superbowl Sunday. I was at my house, drinking with my friends, watching the game. My brother calls me four times, but I have a tendency to ignore him since he can also be annoying. The fifth time I finally answer, and he tells me that mom is on the way to the er. Alcoholism finally caught up to her. I was extremely worried obviously, so I ubered to the er since I was too drunk to drive. She has a wine belly, and low and behold, the nurses and doctors said what we already knew. She has quit drinking since then. It has been 15 days since the incident and her last drink, and she has regained basically all of her strength. She is becoming independent again, and is telling me she feels happier. This makes me feel great!

However, she will still call me like 4+ times per day just to check up on me, and will send several texts in between those calls. It's usually the same conversation too, like nothing ever changes with my life cause you're always calling so frequently wanting to know what I'm doing lol. However.... I love her very much and Im ultimately happy she's trying to improve herself. Thanks for reading this absolute mouthful.

At this point, does anyone know what I should do? It would be nice to get the perspective of someone my age as well as an older woman

TL;DR - Relationship with mother has gotten rocky due to alcoholism","At this point, does anyone know what I should do?","The individual in the Reddit post has experienced significant emotional and family challenges since the death of their father from a heart attack two years ago. This loss deeply affected their mother, leading to increased alcohol consumption. The individual did not have a job at the time of their father's death, which allowed them to take on responsibilities at home, such as helping their mother and looking for truck driving jobs after acquiring their commercial driver's license (CDL) six weeks post-trauma.

They initially attempted truck driving but found it unsuitable and later turned to DoorDash full-time to support themselves financially. The family's situation worsened as the mother's alcoholism escalated, complicating the individual's ability to maintain a productive work schedule. Throughout this time, they dealt with the dual responsibilities of working and caring for their mother, who was increasingly dependent on them.

In March 2024, the individual started a pest control job but was later fired. This prompted a return to DoorDash, during which the mother's needs continued to overwhelm them. They felt a growing need for personal space and moved out about 20 minutes away in January 2025, aiming to reduce the stress of their living situation and allow their mother to become more independent. However, their mother's reliance on them persisted, leading to ongoing calls for assistance with her needs.

By February, the mother's health had deteriorated significantly, requiring the individual to manage her care more directly. The mother was eventually hospitalized due to complications from alcoholism but has since stopped drinking and begun to regain her independence. 

The individual's family dynamics include a younger brother who also contributes to the mother's care when not working.

2025-02-25 18:38:35,1iy292a,My BF doesn't want me to hang out with a man who has shown interest in me,"Last week I (F24) went to a hip-hop concert with a friend. At the bar a man invited us to have a shot with him. He was friendly and we chatted a bit. It turned out that he also played classical guitar, like me. I was kind of thrilled because I don't often meet people who play guitar and even less people who play classical guitar.

Later he asked for my number so we could chat about music and maybe play together (he was also a bit tipsy when he asked for it). I immediately told him that I had a boyfriend but that we could hang out. It was pretty obvious that he was kind of disappointed and didn't want my number.

While my guyfriend was at the concert, we bought some drinks and had a really good chat about music and guitar stuff. At some point he must have changed his mind because he said he'd like to have a jam session with me (even though I have a boyfriend).

My boyfriend (M30) also plays the guitar, but he's more into jazz and bossa nova stuff (which I'm not that familiar with) and he's much better than I am. It's hard to play with him; when he pulls out his mega chords I feel insecure (and unlike him, I'm not that good at jamming either). He also has a guitar buddy with whom he jams regularly.

He encourages me to find a guitarbuddy too, because I'd benefit a lot from it. But the thing is that the people in my age group at the music school have been playing for 6-8 years and are much better than me. I know I shouldn't compare myself, but I wouldn't feel comfortable playing with someone so out of my league.

But this concert guy I met last week seems to be on my level. But when I told my boyfriend about it, he said he'd be very uncomfortable with me hanging out with a man who's clearly shown some interest in me. I said that I had made it clear to him that I wasn't single and wasn't interested in anything more than a platonic relationship. Having made that point clear, this shouldn't be a problem, right?

Concertguy knows I'm not single, so why would he hang out with me if not for guitar reasons only? Or am I just being naive? My boyfriend trusts me not to letting myself getting seduced, but he still doesn't want me to hang out with him but to blocks his contact instead.

I think it's also important to mention here that we're having a hard time right now and he just wants to avoid any potential danger to our relationship.

I'm really sad about that because I've been wanting to jam around with someone my league very long. So, should I block the contact or convince my BF? If the concert guy tries to make a move i'd obviously would cut off the contact.

Tldnr: met a man who also plays guitar. He showed interest in me,  i said I'm not single. Nevertheless we both want to hang out to play guitar but my BF would not approve this

EDIT: Just to make it clear, I'm having absolutely no interest in concert guy

EDIT 2: okay guys, thank you for your insights! I was being naive about this. I genuine believed he would have no intentions, I'm not that much around guys.  
I'm gonna block concert concert guy","Should I block the contact of a man who shares my interest in guitar, even though I have no romantic interest in him, or should I try to convince my boyfriend to let me hang out with him?","The individual is a 24-year-old female who plays classical guitar.

2025-02-25 16:29:49,1ixz2sy,My (27F) boyfriend (27M) had the realization that his concerning behavior in our relationship is about control. What now?,"Hello, I was hoping you all might be able to provide some insight on this situation with my boyfriend. I am completely baffled and a little freaked out by this. Its a long story, but I‚Äôll try to keep it brief:

We have been together for four years and live together. About one year into dating, after we started living together, I started noticing certain odd behaviors‚Äîlike an inexplicable cold shoulder or strange refusal to talk for long periods of time. When I would ask why he was being so quiet or if he was annoyed, he‚Äôd always say ‚Äúwhat? I‚Äôve been acting completely normal.‚Äù

This sort of escalated very slowly over time, to where he‚Äôd be outright condescending, critical, correct me in front of my friends, etc‚Ä¶ basically very plainly seeming annoyed with me. Then, when I would ask about it, he would deny every having done those things and insist that he was feeling completely normally towards me. He was frequently correcting my telling of events, as well, so that it seemed like I was completely misremembering situations (even just simple things, like how many times per week he does some activity). It got to where I felt really confused, and was doing a bunch of research to try and figure out what my issue was.

In the last year, he‚Äôs started doing some things that I initially attributed to anger issues. There were several things, all fairly small but definitely off putting. The biggest was an incident where we got into an argument while he was driving my car, and he pulled some aggressive driving stunt in response to something I said. Then, when I tried to ask about this event afterward and suggest that he may have some anger thing, he was completely disdainful and even laughed at me in response. 

Well, I came close to ending it with him over this. He was extremely remorseful and pleaded for another chance‚Äîhe promised to do couple‚Äôs and individual therapy to work on his issues. I agreed, with a timeline (if there‚Äôs not noticeable improvement within two months, I am done).

Fast forward to now, we have been doing couple‚Äôs therapy and he‚Äôs been a lot more emotionally available and open about his thoughts and motivations. BUT the explanations are jarring.

I thought he was dealing with anger issues, but it has come to light that he was not actually *that* angry. He said he was thinking clearly in the driving situation and the other situations‚Äîit was more about making a point. After further discussion, he said he thinks that the aggressive behaviors and the gaslighting/correcting are all sort of based on a desire to control the situation. I.e. he doesn‚Äôt like something, so he‚Äôs asserting his control over it. He has reiterated that he ‚Äújust likes us to be on the same page‚Äù‚Äîhis page?

While it‚Äôs encouraging that he‚Äôs being so much more open and self aware now, I am pretty disturbed by the explanations. Anger issues seem like a cut and dry issue that therapy could help with‚Äîaggression based in control? I‚Äôm not too sure.

We have been together for four years and live together, and have a dog. Much of our relationship has been good, and there are a lot of things I love about him. It‚Äôs also not like he treats me like crap all the time, it‚Äôs just these occasional really weird behaviors that are distressing. Still, I‚Äôm not sure if I should wait it out and see if he can turn over a new leaf (given his newfound self awareness and therapy), or if I should call it quits and move on. Any advice?

**TL;DR: My boyfriend of four years has recently had a realization that his periodic weird/intense behavior was about having control in our relationship. He says he is turning over a new leaf and is working on this in therapy. I‚Äôm not sure if I should wait it out and see if he actually can turn over a new leaf, or if I should call it quits and move on. We have been together a long time and there‚Äôs a lot of love left.

2025-02-25 15:41:03,1ixxwyj,Need advice on how to handle a difficult conversation re: moving abroad,"Hi Reddit,

I am currently a 33M living in the UK. I am a teacher and have been offered a job in New Zealand. 

My wife (35F) is also a teacher but she is the main motive for the move. Half of her family live in NZ and she has always wanted to 'end up' there. We have 2 children (aged 3 and 9). We spoke recently that if we were to move to NZ it would have to be for a dream job and improve our quality of life. We also wanted to do it before our kids grow up and are doing examinations.

I was fully prepared to reject the job as my wife would be quitting work, my salary alone wasn't enough etc etc ..and most importantly our current quality of life is good! 

However, the school in NZ is a private school and have offered to pay me more than I've ever earned, and then to sweeten the deal offered me a 'no costs attached' rent free house that the school own. Along with flights etc ... Oh, they've also offered places for my children in this very prestigious independent school..this has tipped the decision and we want to take it. It's the best time for the kids and we can't really expect to be offered any more! Needless to say it's a management role at the school.

Me and my wife are excited, we have family there who are excited, my kids are excited....but I'm terrified of my narcissistic mother.

My mother is a functioning alcoholic who will emotionally blackmail, drink to cope with emotions and will then guilt trip you to high hell and back ....now this would be fine if I had a bad relationship with my mum. Sadly, I've grown up normalising my mum's behaviour (it was only my wife that made me realise she was a narcissist).

I worry often that the fact I worry so much about her opinion is due to her successfully being a narcissist!

But the thing that I'm dreading is when she guilt trips me for taking the grandkids away from her....I know I'm going to struggle with this massively. Regardless of the fact that it's what is best for my family financially and opportunity wise.

I'm lucky that my older brother and dad will be understanding and 'know what mums like'. However, they are also enablers (maybe not enablers but definitely allow it). We've clearly developed a really unhealthy attitude where calling mum out on it is not an option we have ever taken.

My mum recently had a go as I hadn't seen her since Christmas....it's been 2 months! 

I'm dreading having the conversation and I hate how it makes me anxious and I know if I spiralled I'd talk myself out the job.

My wife is super supportive....but any advice from relationship experts or people who experience similar would be appreciated.

Thank you....


Tl;Dr: moving abroad for dream job. Don't know how to broach difficult conversation ",How can I have a difficult conversation with my narcissistic mother about moving abroad for a job without feeling guilty or anxious?,"The individual is a 33-year-old male teacher living in the UK. He is married to a 35-year-old female teacher, and they have two children aged 3 and 9. The wife has a strong desire to move to New Zealand, where half of her family resides, and has always wanted to eventually settle there. 

The couple discussed the potential move and concluded that it should be for a ‚Äúdream job‚Äù that would enhance their quality of life, ideally before their children grow up and begin their examinations. The man was initially hesitant about accepting a job offer from a private school in New Zealand, especially because it would mean his wife would be quitting her job and his salary alone would not be sufficient. However, the job offer includes a management role with a higher salary than he has ever earned, rent-free housing provided by the school, flight assistance, and places for their children in a prestigious independent school, which ultimately influenced their decision to consider the move.

The individual has a complicated relationship with his mother, who is described as a functioning alcoholic and a narcissist. He acknowledges having grown up normalizing her behavior and is concerned about her potential emotional manipulation regarding the move, particularly guilt-tripping him about taking the grandchildren away from her. His father and older brother are aware of the mother‚Äôs behavior but have not actively addressed it. The man feels anxious about discussing the move with his mother and worries that it may affect his decision to take the job, despite support from his wife.",2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ixxwyj/need_advice_on_how_to_handle_a_difficult/,relationships

He‚Äôs obsessed with me, he goes on and on about how much he loves me and can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm real and how he wants to spend his life with me. He says I saved his life and he‚Äôs never met a women who is anything like me. He constantly does little things to make me happy. He‚Äôs never been unfaithful. We‚Äôre together all the time so he wouldn‚Äôt even have time to cheat. He‚Äôs cut off friends who were mean to me (we had some issues with a female friend in the beginning but that has been resolved). There‚Äôs a bit of a porn problem but he feels horrible about it and is working on it. But I have legitimately no reason to doubt this man and yet I am jealous and anxious pretty much any time I think too much about his female friendships or we are near an attractive woman. I know I‚Äôm insane and therapy isn‚Äôt helping (been trying since about 15). I‚Äôve been in love before, got out of a nine year relationship last year, but never have I felt so almost panicky about a guy. I‚Äôve gotten jealous over an ex who fucked him over and he doesn‚Äôt even like anymore.

2025-02-25 12:55:08,1ixub37,"My (20F) boyfriend (23M) cheated, and I don‚Äôt know if I should leave or stay.","
My boyfriend and I are both in our 4th semester of law school. He‚Äôs Muslim (religious), and I‚Äôm Hindu (not religious). He‚Äôs an extrovert from this city, living with his family, while I moved here from another state and live in a PG. We have very different backgrounds‚ÄîI‚Äôm from a wealthy family and care about my education, while he struggles financially and doesn‚Äôt focus much on studies.

We started as friends but drifted apart due to drama in our group. After reconnecting, we kissed, slept together, and became romantic, though we weren‚Äôt officially dating at first. Two months later, he asked me to be his girlfriend with flowers and a ring, promising to love me forever and marry me.

Our relationship was amazing at first. He was incredibly caring‚Äîhand-feeding me, taking care of me when I was sick, always making sure I was okay. I had a traumatic childhood with neglectful parents, so I had never experienced this kind of love before. I became very attached to him because I live alone here with no friends or family. He was my safe space.

However, he has a lot of family issues‚Äîfinancial struggles, loans, and his sister secretly marrying and moving abroad. I tried to be there for him, but I admit I was sometimes selfish, wanting his attention when he was stressed. Since we had no friends, he tried making some, but they only used him for his car/bike and made degrading comments about me out of jealousy. Eventually, we were back to just the two of us.

I go home every semester break, and the first time we were apart, we both missed each other terribly. When I returned, I made him study, and for the first time in his life, he passed all his exams. I was so proud. I also gave him full access to my phone and social media after he asked, though I hesitated at first. A few days before my birthday, he saw I had Twitter and assumed I was texting guys. In reality, I only used it to watch porn. He was upset but acted normal the next day. On my birthday, despite his financial issues, he planned a dinner, invited classmates, bought me gifts, and paid for everything. I felt so loved that I even considered converting and marrying him. He made me softer, more feminine, and truly happy.

Then, things fell apart.

When I returned from my December break, I discovered he had multiple fake Instagram and Snapchat accounts to text girls. I was furious and, out of anger, added guys to my Snapchat for a few days (I told him before doing this). I removed them after he asked, and he promised never to hurt me again.

But a week later, I found out something worse. A classmate he had invited to my birthday party showed me his texts with her from December. He had been flirting, sharing personal details about me, and trying to get her to sext him. He told her he would never leave me, but the messages were shameless. She encouraged it because she‚Äôs an attention-seeker.

I was devastated. When I confronted him, I slapped him multiple times. He got pissed and told his close friend, who then called me and said, ‚ÄúHow dare you slap my friend?‚Äù At first, he tried to blame me, saying he couldn‚Äôt trust me, but then he admitted he was wrong and promised to change.

I reached out to his exes and found out he had done this to all of them. He used multiple platforms‚ÄîInstagram, Snapchat, Telegram, Discord‚Äîto text other girls. When I bring up the pain he caused, he gets defensive and annoyed, so I‚Äôve stopped talking about it. He just wants me to ‚Äúbe fine‚Äù with him. He has apologized repeatedly and says he loves me and will change, but I‚Äôm scared.

He was my first true love, treated me better than anyone in my life, but also hurt me worse than anyone ever has. I started smoking again to cope. He had made my life and studies better, but now I‚Äôm falling apart‚ÄîI‚Äôm skipping classes, not eating, not sleeping. I know I should leave, but what if he really changes? I don‚Äôt know if I can be without him.

TL;DR: My boyfriend was perfect‚Äîcaring, supportive, and helped me improve my life. But he also emotionally cheated on me, texting multiple girls. He apologized and promises to change, but I don‚Äôt know if I can trust him. Leaving him means losing my only source of love and support, but staying means risking more heartbreak. What should I do?","What should I do about my boyfriend who emotionally cheated on me, given that he promises to change but I‚Äôm worried about trusting him again?","The individual in crisis is currently in their fourth semester of law school and is living in a paying guest (PG) accommodation after moving to the city from another state.

2025-02-25 09:42:36,1ixr9v0,"I(F/16) messed up and now my bf(M/16) wants to end things, how do I fix this?","I don't know how I'm going to fix this, I've messed up bad. I figured maybe I could find some advice here. My bf, I'm just going to refer to as J from now on, is such a cool and interesting person. I love him so so much, we've been good friends for the last 4 years and have dated on and off since we've met. We met in middle school and, to be completely honest, he's my first boyfriend. I have always had trouble connecting with others, but J has always been there. We were dating in-person for the first few months of our relationship, but for reasons I won't bother typing up, we both ended up moving away to different parts of the country. Even though we were far away, we've always kept in touch, Sending memes and joking around with eachother like always. Eventually, we ended up long distant dating again and have been going steady for the last 3 months. 

I'll be honest, I'm a quiet person, or that's what people say that I'm like. I have a hard time connecting with others. I enjoy listening to other people talk about themselves, and J is a very talkative and social person, the complete opposite of me.
Recently, he's been saying that I've been distant, and that he doesn't know me at all, he had called me last night asking if anything was going on, which nothing has. 
I've always been depressed and suffered with anxiety and fatigue, wich really effects how i intract with people, and ive realized i can be very avoidative and people pleaseing at times without even realizing. He texts me all the time and if I don't reply right away he starts lovebombng me and asking if he's ever good enough. I feel so guilty because it's hard for me to resupricate the same energy. 
After yeasterday, I told him I needed a break and wanted to talk later. To be clear for the last few days, I've been sick with pneumonia so I hadn't texted him as much recently, but now i think i should have been more clear that this was the case. Yes he says he knows I was sick yes wanted to know if anything was wrong with me anyway. 
This afternoon, he called me saying we had to talk. I reluctantly picked up his call because he seemed very distraught, and when I did he was crying. So while we weren't talking (this had been only a day) he went through my message history on numerous discord servers that I was in. He found a screenshot that I had shared about 5 months ago, one of him bombarding me with a wall of about 20 texts asking why I wasn't replying to his messages, at that time I hadent had my phone so I found it quite uncomfortable on my part. I had uploaded it to the server asking what others thought and they reciprocate committing that it was odd behavior.
J was sobbing while calling me saying that I had betrayed him by sharing screen shots of our conversation to people he didn't know, and that in a million years he never thought I would hurt him in such a way. I had only talked about him twice with others, j was very offended that I referred to him as a 'friend' and that he feels sick and that he feels I had made fun of him behind his back. 
I just want to note that the messages in question had no personal information about him or me, and was him questioning me over and over about my whereabouts. J mentioned how he felt like he doesn't even know me anymore as 'every conversation we had' I had also had in that server, as in memes and art that I share with other people. J expresses how he doesn't want to talk to me right now and feels we can't even be friends anymore, and that he's sacrificed so much to talk to me evey day.
I just feel torn up and don't know what to do.

Now looking back it was a very stupid of me to vent into a public server about my relationship. Omg I've hurt him so bad I don't even know what to do. I just want to go back to how things were before, yet I know I'm just a terrible person who can never keep any relationship because I'm just stupid. How do I even salvage this??

As the title suggests, I (31f) need help regarding my boyfriend‚Äôs (31m) mental health. We‚Äôve been together for 3 years now. He is doing all the right things, seeing a therapist, reading self help books but his anxiety is at an all time high right now and it‚Äôs causing issues in our relationship. 

He is constantly worrying about money, about his career, about losing our home when I consider us very fortunate to be in comfortable jobs with our own home that we love. I don‚Äôt see us having money issues, we‚Äôre just like any 30 somethings living in an expensive city. I don‚Äôt want to be like this but it feels like I‚Äôm constantly lecturing him about gratitude and mindfulness. I‚Äôve mentioned to him that I want him to be able to share the mental load when we start having kids and right now, I don‚Äôt feel like I can. We‚Äôve been arguing the past few days about similar topics and I‚Äôm getting so sick of it. 

It‚Äôs constant. For example, sometimes when we‚Äôre grocery shopping and I‚Äôm carrying heavy bags, he‚Äôs so in his own thoughts that he doesn‚Äôt think to help me. There‚Äôs so many little things like this. He knows to help me but he‚Äôs so caught up in his thoughts. 

He hates this about himself and he‚Äôs told me he hates himself and it‚Äôs so difficult to watch him continue like this. I have suggested taking up an exercise routine and sticking to it to boost his confidence and prove his dedication to himself but he doesn‚Äôt listen. He is most comfortable watching tv, watching sports but as soon as those programs end, he is back in his thoughts. 

I love him so much and I‚Äôm excited for the rest of my life with him but I just need advice on how I can continue to support him and also help him grow stronger as a person.

I think about this guy so much, I want to say he‚Äôs the one but I also am afraid because I have so much life left to live to even call that. 

I think about silly hypothetical futures with hypothetical apartments and hypothetical dogs with hypothetical 6 figure jobs, that sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm delusional towards my own boyfriend!

2025-02-27 22:34:11,1izsiu4,"My (27F) Husband (29M) is starting to show signs of Alcoholism again, if I leave I have to leave my step-daughter behind. Advice?","There‚Äôs a lot of context to this so buckle up kids. I‚Äôve known my husband since he was 14/15 years old. He‚Äôs always had SOME sort of addiction. Whether it was LSD/Molly, Alcohol, Heroin, Coke, Girls, Fentanyl - he‚Äôs always been addicted to SOMETHING. His most recent and worst addiction was Fentanyl, which he‚Äôs now been clean from for a year now. Fentanyl is the only drug he went and got help to quit, the rest of his addictions he kind of just ends up not doing after a while usually because of personal/life reasons. He doesn‚Äôt go to NA meetings or believe in ‚Äúhelp‚Äù (therapy, NA/AA, meds, etc). 

For a while when he was unemployed he would drink a whole bottle of J√§germeister mixed with Red Bull every single night. Once he became employed he‚Äôd only drink like that on the weekends. Then he started drinking a whole 12 pack of beer a night during weekdays and the whole bottle of J√§germeister every day on the weekends. Then he started disappearing to the bar 2-3 times a week on top of all the drinking he does at home. Today I just found out he‚Äôs also drinking while at work and even when he picks our daughter (7yrs) up from school.  And remember, he WILL NOT get help and if I or his family actually bring up the problem of his drinking he starts to drink MORE.

Now children wise we have 2 kids in our family. His oldest daughter (7yrs) from another relationship and our biological daughter (18mo). He‚Äôs had full custody of his oldest daughter since she was 3yrs due to her mom being arrested for fentanyl charges. My husband leaves all ‚Äúdomestic household‚Äù stuff to me, including basically raising both children myself. I have been her mother figure since she was 3yrs old, I see her as my own but I do not have any rights over her yet. If I were to leave my husband, I would of course start to fight for some sort of agreement where she can stay with me during summer and more if possible but I would have to leave her behind at first which would be very hard on both of us.

Personally, besides the quips I have of him needing to be more involved in his children‚Äôs lives and the household chores, his and my relationship is okay currently but the slow increase of his drinking is starting to alarm me and I feel like it‚Äôs just going to get worse and worse and worse until it crashes down on our family. 

I have an opportunity to leave, I have the funds and housing available but it‚Äôs out of state so I would have to leave HIS oldest daughter behind which tears me apart and I worry he will not care for her correctly. Advice?","Should I leave my husband due to his worsening drinking problem, knowing it may hurt his oldest daughter, or is there a way to address the situation without leaving?","The individual in crisis has been in a long-term relationship with her husband, whom she has known since he was a teenager. He has a history of various addictions, including drugs such as LSD, alcohol, heroin, and Fentanyl. They have two children together: his oldest daughter (7 years old) from a previous relationship, for whom he has had full custody since she was 3 years old due to her mother‚Äôs legal issues related to Fentanyl, and their biological daughter who is 18 months old. 

The husband has struggled with alcoholism, particularly during periods of unemployment, and continues to drink heavily. The individual feels burdened with the responsibility of raising both children and managing the household, as her husband does not contribute to domestic responsibilities and has little involvement in the children's lives. The familial dynamic is further complicated by the individual‚Äôs role as a mother figure to her stepdaughter, with no legal rights over her despite their close bond. 

The individual is contemplating leaving her husband due to his increasing alcohol consumption and concerns about the potential negative impact it may have on their family, especially regarding his ability to care for his oldest daughter. She is in a position to leave, with financial resources and housing available out of state, but is torn about the prospects of leaving the stepdaughter behind.",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izsiu4/my_27f_husband_29m_is_starting_to_show_signs_of/,relationship_advice

We met 1 year and half ago and after 4 months we started dating. Insane chemistry, love being with her, and she loves being with me. We never had any arguments and so far so good. I just have this little voice in the back of my head which makes me remember something I dread ; religion.

I was never religious, I am an atheist. My girl is muslim though and this raises a lot of questions about stuff I want. First of all, I don't know if we can marry each other. I'd have to convert but this is the last thing I want. Her mother is progressive but her father is super strict about Islam. I also know about sex after marriage and I get it, I wouldn't push it down her throat but it's a subject I'd like to tackle with her. 

The reason I am thinking about all of this is that I realized that she is not super ""conservative"" if it's the right word? She told me she already ate pig, drank Vodka shots with me once and we also cuddle from time to time. All of this makes me think she isn't a serious Muslim and makes me believe we have a future together.

- she doesn't make me feel special or loved. The only nice thing she'd tell me is ""you're so beautiful"" during sex
- during recent 1-week trip with her friends she'd honestly be nicer to them than me. Throughout that week 0 physical contact in the meaning of no hugs, no hand holding, NOTHING, not even when it was just the 2 of us
- on that trip she'd also lash out at me for no reason at all, behaving as if questions I asked were stupid and making me feel small in general. When I asked what her problem was I'd hear as much as ""nothing""

At the start of our relationship we were always all over each other, kissing, touching, doing things in changing rooms and getting at it in the car as we didn‚Äôt live together and neither of us ever had an empty house. 

Things started to slow down after 3 or 4 months and we would be intimate maybe once or twice a month. 

I blamed it on the fact that we didn‚Äôt live together so we didn‚Äôt have a bed, but obviously that wasn‚Äôt strictly necessary for us having done everything without a bed during the beginning. 
I still didn‚Äôt think much of it and thought we would start doing it more often again.

Now we‚Äôve been together for over a year and I could count on one hand the times we did it since july. 

I really don‚Äôt like this since we‚Äôre 20 years old and we are supposed to be f*cking like rabbits. 

Now, she‚Äôs said that she‚Äôs been going through some family issues these last couple of months, so she‚Äôs not thinking about it a lot, which I understand.

Still, it‚Äôs been a problem since before these issues and then again, life always has challenges, and sex has nothing to do with it. 

What if in 10 years from now life still has issues? Does it mean you will never have sex ever again? 

I just don‚Äôt understand it, but I don‚Äôt know if I should try anyway and not put pressure on her and see if things change or what

I have totally stopped trying to initiate sex because she always says no, so I just don‚Äôt bother anymore. It has even impacted my attraction to her.

We've been dating for about a year and a half and the reason for this break is because he is very insecure within our relationship. I don't agree with this but he believes I am too good for him and as a result I often feel resentment from him. He's not happy with his life right now, his at home life is toxic, he carries alot of unhealed trauma from his childhood/family life and past relationships, and I know I just can't be his priority right now because I want him to heal these things if we want any chance of being together in the future.

He was a lot of my firsts, he is my first love and when we started dating I would say things moved pretty fast. Our relationship right now i feel as if i'm not being fulfilled. I want to go out and do things but due to his financial situations we cannot which I completely understand (i also feel his financial situation is another reason why he is insecure). I just feel so guilty because he was completely against this break and begged me to reconsider. He says he feels scared that I won't come back, and when we met face to face to have this conversation I felt as if he was almost in denial. He needs to heal and we can't do this together this time. We both have a very strong anxious attachment style and I know I have to break up with him fully because I cannot be with a man who resents me, but I just can't do it. I have caught him doing a lot of unhealthy stuff in our relationship (and so have l) nothing abusive or anything of that nature, just very... insecure and unhealthy.

He means so much to me but I am just not happy in this relationship right now. His insecurities and past traumas are hurting me. Right now we are on a 1 week no contact break and once the week is up I will let him know if I want to continue this relationship. My heart is telling me yes but my brain is telling me no. I love him so much, but this is just not what I want for myself and I know that if we get back together l'd be settling. I feel so devastated and guilty because I know this break has hurt someone I really love. My heart broke knowing that the last time I saw him may be the last time. He is my best friend and I know if we split we could not be friends it would hurt too much on both sides.

2025-02-27 22:17:36,1izs5ej,"I (20F) feel like my boyfriend (20M) does not respect or protect me against his father(47M) , but I am pregnant with his child. Does anybody have any advice?","A little bit of a backstory is needed .

So I (20F) am pregnant with my boyfriend Paul's (20M) child. We've been together for 4 years, and while we initially considered abortion due to our age, Paul and my father assured me that everything would be okay. Paul's mother was thrilled when we told her, but his father, Gill, reacted terribly. He immediately told me to get an abortion, saying that l'd regret having a child, that it would ruin my life, and saying he regretted having kids. (despite being financially successful and well-traveled).Gill has never liked me and has been trying to poison Paul against me since the beginning. He's compared me to Paul's ex, saying she was more beautiful, and even claimed I wasn't good enough for Paul because my parents are divorced (Gill himself is divorced as well). 

Since finding out about the pregnancy, his comments became more offensive, telling Paul that I will cheat on him, leave him with the baby, and that I ""baby-trapped"" him. He also insists that Paul shouldn't propose or marry me because paying child support would be easier than going through a divorce. Paul works for Gill's company and stayed in our hometown instead of going to university because Gill promised to give him the company down and build him a house. 

However, when he found out I was pregnant, he told Paul that if we kept our baby, he could forget all about that. Now, Paul and I are preparing to move into an apartment owned by his mother, which needs renovations. My father offered to cover the entire cost as a gesture of goodwill. When Gill heard about this, he insisted on contributing financially as well-but unlike my father, he made it clear that we would ""owe him"" for it. Paul's mom convinced him to go through with building the house, but he will only start after we move into the apartment.

Today, Paul spoke with Gill, who again said that we would owe him for his financial support. He also told Paul, ""Now that you know what's ahead of you, I'm sure you wanted to convince her to have an abortion."" Paul never stands up to him, and I argued with him about it because, while I can tolerate the things Gill says about me, I find it extremely disrespectful that he talks this way about our unborn child. I also think it's unacceptable that Paul doesn't tell him to stop.They've never had a normal father-son relationship. I've tried talking to him, but he's afraid to go against Gill, especially now that he's agreed to build us a house, which I don't even want anymore.

I feel extremely disgusted and disrespected by Paul and I don‚Äôt know if I should still try to salvage the relationship, because I still love him, break up with him or ban his father from ever seeing my child in this situation. Can I not allow Gill to see his grand baby, even though it might cost us our house? Am I entitled to break up with Paul or it‚Äôs a stupid decision?",Can I prevent my boyfriend's father from seeing my child if I feel disrespected by him and it might cost us our house? Am I justified in considering breaking up with my boyfriend over this situation?,"The individual sharing their story is a 20-year-old female (20F) who is currently pregnant with her boyfriend Paul's child. She has been in a relationship with Paul for four years. The context of her situation includes significant family dynamics, particularly concerning Paul's father, Gill, who has expressed disdain toward her and has a contentious relationship with Paul. 

The narrator notes that Gill has been critical and controlling, urging her to consider abortion and making derogatory comments about her character and worthiness as a partner for Paul. This negative influence from Gill is compounded by the fact that Paul's family environment appears to be complex, with Gill himself being divorced, yet he has disapproved of the narrator's background, including her own parents' divorce.

Paul chose not to pursue university education and instead works at his father's company under the promise that he would inherit the business and receive support in building a house. However, Gill's reaction to the pregnancy has put those promises in jeopardy. The narrator's father has offered financial help for their new apartment, contrasting with Gill's manipulative approach, insisting any financial support would come with strings attached.

Overall, the narrator is caught in a challenging situation, influenced by familial expectations, pressures, and a lack of support from Paul in standing up to his father's negativity and control.",2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izs5ej/i_20f_feel_like_my_boyfriend_20m_does_not_respect/,relationship_advice

2025-02-27 21:57:44,1izrop1,My 24F boyfriend 23M of 4 years has yet to propose. Am I being dramatic if I'm upset?,"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 4 years officially, unofficially it's been closer to 5. When we started officially dating he told me that I would have to wait 5 years for him to propose which I assumed was a joke at the time and while we haven't made it to 5 years just yet I feel like I deserved it quiet a while ago even if that meant we would have a long engagement. That's something I'd be completely okay with.

For Christmas I got so excited because he gave me a ring box. But he then told me it was just a promise ring. I told him that maybe he should just keep this promise ring and actually propose to me with it at a different time because I don't care if it wasn't expensive or anything like that and ya know 5 years is basically here. But he told me no and that he'll get a real ring eventually. I know him pretty well and I'm almost positive that he has nothing planned at all. He also knows how much a proposal means to me because I've explained it to him. Since he does not go above and beyond in our relationship a whole lot, this would really show how much effort he's willing to put into us and our relationship. 

Just one quick example about effort and going above and beyong - want to know what I got for Valentine's Day? Nothing. No cards no flowers no chocolates literally nothing. He then proceeded to ask why I was upset while I was cooking him dinner and he read a beautiful card I wrote him. I told him why and he THEN went to the store. He said he didn't get me anything because it was snowing so he just wanted to come home after work. I pointed out that he could have gone any other day of the week to pick me out something but he doesn't seem to think that far ahead. 

Anywho, we've obviously talked about marriage and having kids and all the serious stuff you talk about when you're in a relationship for a long time. We've lived together for 4 years, we bought a home together about a year ago. We're basically already a married couple without the titles or anything. But all the people around us who have been dating about half the time we have are already engaged and most of them already have dates set for weddings. 

 I'm upset. I just feel like that should be me. Not to toot my own horn, and by saying what I'm about to say it's going to discredit it, but I'm a pretty awesome girlfriend and I put up with a lot of bs. Am I being dramatic? Like if we've talked about how obviously ONE day were gonna get married am I rushing this? My family thinks it's kind of crazy that we're not engaged yet and they all say after 2 years you should know for sure or not. And we are young and obviously with buying a house and the state of the economy we're not in the greatest financial situation but we're pretty solid and like I said before I'm not one for wanting super expensive engagement rings or a big extravagant wedding. 

I guess I just want some strangers on the internet's opinion. If I'm not being dramatic how am I supposed to approach this situation? I've always been terrible at expressing my emotions especially with my own words. Even writing this has just been awful and I've already started to doubt myself reading what I've wrote. I feel like I'm asking so much.

I (40M, autistic) have been with my partner (46F, autistic, ADHD, past trauma) for a little over ten years. We have an open/poly relationship, but a few years ago, I paid for sex without telling her. When it came to light, she saw it as a major betrayal. At the time she was having problems living at my place due to noise from our neighbors, moving to her own place, which se considered private and while I had a key, I was only welcome with prior announcement.

Our relationship has always had communication struggles. I'm unable to speak about my wants and problems. She often ignores me when she's upset, saying it‚Äôs my responsibility to approach her correctly; otherwise, she might explode at me. She also doesn‚Äôt see us as equals. Our fights usually stem from misunderstandings or small issues that spiral.

We also have a very different needs for physical affection, I need hugs and closeness, she usually actively avoids this, unless she wants something (eg. sex) from me.

Lately, I‚Äôve been under a lot of stress, starting with work, then realizing how stuck and unheard I feel in our relationship. Things got worse when I was suddenly arrested for a serious charge from years ago (I was lied to and didn't know what I was doing was illegal). I was released after interrogation, but the whole experience has left me extremely shaken. I‚Äôve started counseling and meds to help manage the stress.

During this time, I‚Äôve been talking a lot with a close friend (30F). I do have a crush on her, and she may be interested, but she‚Äôs monogamous. My partner doesn‚Äôt like that I‚Äôm confiding in my friend rather than her, but honestly, I feel like I can talk freely with my friend in a way I can‚Äôt with my partner. When I'm with my friend, I feel more alive than in years. She also has said that I have seem to be down for the past few years.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel trapped, unheard, and undervalued in our relationship, but I also don‚Äôt want to make a rash decision while under stress. How do I navigate this? My friend and counsel both have questioned why we are togethere, but I just don't want to make situation worse.","How do I navigate feeling trapped, unheard, and undervalued in my relationship without making a rash decision?","The individual is a 40-year-old male who identifies as autistic.

The couple has faced ongoing communication difficulties, with the individual struggling to express his wants and problems, and the partner often ignoring him during conflicts.

I later broke up with them both but stayed with a person (19m) I was seeing in person (ended it with them too). I was asked to stop texting her and delete my account by my parentals. I did and left her a text before leaving.

She texted me a month later on WhatsApp and we spoke again. She texted me once saying ""I love you so much"" then after I told  her it's the wrong person she said ""sorry that was meant for my partner"" which confused me since she usually talks to people on discord not WhatsApp. She explained to me that she wasn't good at making friends so we made the plan that I'd try to help. In the end I ghosted (horrible act on my part) because I couldn't stand how she would go days without texting back, even when she started the conversation. 

A few months later, I unblocked her and texted her to apologize for ghosting her. At first she didn't know who I was but when she realized we started to talk again. She of course brought up her current partner (18m) a few times which I don't mind and talked through the whole ghosting thing. She said it was okay and that she isn't mad or hurt, she was just worried about me. She explained that she has a hectic schedule so she hasn't been available to talk much. She also said that she doesn't use WhatsApp much which is what I talk to her on.

It's been a week or so since that conversation and she has talked to me a bit more but still takes a few days to respond. She started a conversation a couple days ago, took a day to respond and left me on read when I responded. I don't really understand what her side of this friendship is. I don't get how she feels or how I can fix our friendship.

I moved our converstions to discord and the first day we spoke for a few hours at night about my favorite band, she asked a lot of questions about it but then after that she went back to taking days to answer. She does use more emojis and exclimation marks than before. I'm not really sure what to make of it all. I just want to understand her side and know how to move forward. The last time we spoke she didn't respond for a week after she started the coversation.

2025-02-27 21:51:56,1izrjz7,Met a guy 26M on a trip 27F recently and would love advice,"Hi Reddit

Met an Italian guy recently on a group trip to the Caribbean who‚Äôs from NYC and we hit it off really well. We‚Äôre both living in NYC. 

It was for a birthday party hosted by our mutual friend and on multiple days of events, we had really great chemistry and banter. We had a nice group dinner during the middle of the trip, and had started drinking relatively early into the night. Since it was open bar, I had gotten a bit too drunk and everyone was dancing together. He had approached me later into the night and we were talking and dancing together. Things got heated and we started to kiss. After a while, we escaped to the beach and to his villa to hookup. I had a bit too much to drink and needed to throw up mid hookup. I felt so bad but I basically was throwing up in his bathroom for the latter part and he held my hair. 

I remember him being really nice about taking care of me post throw up, undoing my heels and tucking me in. I woke up the next morning and he was incredibly sweet about it, held me and cuddled. I didn‚Äôt feel too judged. I told him I didn‚Äôt remember much of the night, and he was like ‚Äúdid you remember we had sex?‚Äù And honestly I kind of didn‚Äôt, which was so bad. I also was apparently lightly choking him and being a little aggressive which I also felt so badly about. I didn‚Äôt intend to get so drunk. 

So I was kind of avoiding him the rest of the trip after and he seemed to be kind of watching from afar. In the evening of the next day, he came over to me and said hi, and had actually asked me for my number which took me by surprise. I didn‚Äôt realize he was still interested. 

Everyone returned home the next day to NYC and he had texted two days after asking how I was. I left to go to my hometown for a few days - which he knew about and said I‚Äôd be back a few days after. He only really texts once a day which I thought was interesting. We had some conversation and then I felt he wasn‚Äôt trying to hangout or go on a date, so the conversation just kind of ended on my side. 

It‚Äôs been a few days, and he still checks my IG stories but doesn‚Äôt follow me. He‚Äôs also younger by a bit and works in consulting. I liked meeting him, but I wonder why he hasn‚Äôt asked me out or made plans? Is he no longer interested? ",Why hasn't he asked me out or made plans?

2025-02-27 21:48:11,1izrgwg,My (26F) old best friend (25F) reached out to me and I am unsure how to respond to it?,"TLDR: I have an old best friend since childhood  who really stabbed me in the back at my job. We worked together, talked about how unhappy the place made us and she told me she was leaving. Then, she told my boss a bunch of lies and talked about me behind my back and she now has my job. Is it worth it to clear the air? 

So long story, this girl (25F) and I (26F) had been friends since we were maybe 8 or 9. There was a brief time in high school where we weren‚Äôt really friends just because we had different groups and she liked to go out to party whereas I didn‚Äôt. But then we ended up working at the same job and we got really close again. Close to the point where I was in her wedding party. 

About 6 months ago though, we were talking about how our jobs just made us miserable. I was manager of a business and she was assistant manager. Our boss drove us up a wall, we couldn‚Äôt stand being in the same room as her because she was constantly belittling us, critiquing our personal lives, making snide comments towards us. If we were working on something near her she‚Äôd quite literally stand over our shoulder and breathe down our neck. It was very frustrating. Our boss made comments about our weight, she‚Äôd do something nice then throw it back in our face, she‚Äôd come in sick and then when we got sick would claim it wasn‚Äôt her and be annoyed we couldn‚Äôt work.

So my old friend was telling me how after December, she was gone. She couldn‚Äôt stand working here anymore and she was cutting back her hours after the busy season before leaving. She had another job lined up and everything. I didn‚Äôt blame her at all. Towards the end, the both of us would just play dumb games on our computer or do personal stuff. For me, because I went back to school, I‚Äôd occasionally do school work (which my boss gave me the okay for since I was still working full time, it was hard to find time outside of work for all my school work). I admit, we shouldn‚Äôt have been slacking off. That was in both of us. We‚Äôd still do our job, but when it was finished and there wasn‚Äôt much else to, we‚Äôd talk or just relax.

I called out one day (because I had gone out with another friend and we were hardheaded very hardware very badly by a group of men, was honestly traumatizing). My old friend was so mad I called out because it was starting to get busier. I had explained to her what happened, that I was throwing up from anxiety and didn‚Äôt sleep at all (going on 30 hours of no sleep). She couldn‚Äôt care less. I told her if it got so busy where our other co-worker couldn‚Äôt handle it, to let me know. She never did. I wasn‚Äôt in the day after either due to a wedding, I‚Äôd taken that day off months prior.

Suddenly I get to work and my old friend is ignoring me, barely looking me in the eye. I tried to talk to her but she would not budge.

Then I got really sick, strep throat. I let everyone at work know and they were pissed, didn‚Äôt believe me even though I had doctor proof and antibiotics to show I had strep. Even though I was dying, my boss called me saying how it was so busy she couldn‚Äôt do it without me and for the next three days I went in to work during the busiest time to help out. Not a single thank you even though I had felt so crappy. 

My old friend at this point was straight up ignoring me or giving me one word answers to everything. Unfortunately, the strep wasn‚Äôt getting better and I started to get a huge pain in my ribs that I had to go to like three different doctors for, meaning I had to take time off work.

I realize the timing was the worst since it was our busiest time, but I explained everything to my boss and again, had doctor proof for everything. 

Then my boss sits me down  in a netting and tells me how if I didn‚Äôt want to cut back my hours and step down basically, she‚Äôd be letting me go. According to her, I called out of work to really spend time with my BF (now ex). Everything I told my old friend in confidence about what I didn‚Äôt like about the job, she‚Äôd told my boss. Things only she knew. 

Now my old friend basically has my job. Months later she is still there, she‚Äôs now BFFs with my boss and all of the co-workers she used to complain about. And my old co-worker (who quit) confirmed that everything my boss had told me and talked to me about was my old friend whispering in her ear. 

So my old friend messaged me this back in November word for word 

‚Äúhey i just wanted to text to see if we're okay. i know we haven't talked i couldn't tell if you were mad at me or something. i don't want you to think i stabbed you in the back or took your job or anything like that. well probably be working together next week or at least sometime soon since (name redacted) quit and i just don't want it to be awkward or awful if you are actually mad at me‚Äù

and then messaged me this today

‚Äúi feel like i know your answer based on the last time i reached out but just in case lol if you ever want to talk things out or whatever im obviously open to it‚Äù

I have not responded to either message.

My question is, is it even worth it to clear the air? I feel very betrayed. Last I talked to her she said ‚ÄúI understand if you hate me‚Äù which to me is saying she knew what she did was wrong.

I‚Äôll admit towards the end, with how unhappy I was, I wasn‚Äôt the most happy person in the world, I did my job and tried to mind my own business that‚Äôs it. But she felt exactly the same as me, we agreed on everything about our job.

2025-02-27 21:46:05,1izrf4r,My (25m) boyfriend(25m) isn't ready to come out to his family. How do I navigate this situation?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for four years, and our relationship is almost perfect. I love him so so so deeply, and I would marry him in a heartbeat, but we haven't progressed past the 'dating' phase because he lives with his parents and has not come out to them.

For the first year of our relationship, we lived in the same city and spent a ton of time together. After that, he moved back in with his family. They live about 40 minutes away from me and 15 minutes from my work, so I typically see him for dinner somewhere around my office on weeknights. He works weekends and doesn't like driving down to my house during the week, so I see him on average once a week, and we have sex on average once a month when he has a saturday or sunday off and is willing to drive to me.

We text all day, but I still feel like we're stuck. We never sleep together, can't move in together, and can't spend significant milestones together because he spends them with his family. (I've missed two graduations, all of his birthdays, and every holiday except for one Halloween in the whole time we've been together.) He insists that he wants to come out, and that he wants a long-term future with me and to live together; we've talked about getting married someday, how many kids we want, and how we'd like to raise them. The only obstacle is that his family doesn't know he's gay.

His family seems to be pretty accepting; I know he has gay relatives who are out, and I don't get the impression that they've been ostracized from the family. They're Democrats (not to imply that Republicans are all homophobic, just that most Democrats seem to be open-minded about this stuff), they're not super religious, and I have no other reason to believe there would be any negative consequences if he comes out to them. That being said, I know exactly how hard coming out can be; my family is pretty traditional. Coming out was immensely painful for me, and 10 years later my relationship with my parents still hasn't recovered. So, I have a lot of empathy for his situation.

I feel very torn, and this is where I need advice. I firmly believe that if our relationship keeps moving forward, we'll be happy together for the rest of our lives, but we haven't moved forward in years. I'm worried that the longer we stay in this stage, the more I'll wonder what I'm missing out on and the less happy I'll be waiting for him. If I tell him any of that, he'll feel pressured to come out to his family and either do it for the wrong reason or do nothing and just feel guilty, which will make me feel like his fear of coming out is stronger than his desire to build a life with me. I also acknowledge that there's a chance I'm wrong about him, and that if I pressure him to come out and then break up with him later, he'll regret coming out, which is an awful feeling that I wouldn't wish upon anyone.

He deserves to come out if/when he's ready, and it isn't my place to expect him to do it for me. Is there any way to have this conversation with him that doesn't put unfair pressure on him? Do I have any options besides just waiting for him to get to where I am or breaking up with him because he isn't already here? Am I missing an obvious solution? I love him, and I feel crushing dread even thinking about the idea of breaking up with him, but I'm starting to feel a similar sense of dread thinking about the possibility of sticking this out for a few more years just for it to go nowhere, wasting my whole twenties in the process.

When it came to the flight ticket portion, she said ‚Äúdo you know my birthday?‚Äù And I said 11/24? Then she says no try again, I then reply 11/26, which is correct. She storms out and leaves immediately. Today, she‚Äôs texting me saying ‚Äúno matter how I am to you, you‚Äôre just like them‚Äù which really hurt. She even knows and says I‚Äôve been good to her but this thing threw everything off. She‚Äôs been having trouble sleeping lately and is also diagnosed with depression which I don‚Äôt want to agitate too and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

The other day, I was looking for gum in her purse and found an unopened condom. I did not think much of it, so I just tossed it. Since we do not use them, I figured it was old or something she did not need.

Later, she asked if I had seen it, and when I told her I threw it away, she got upset. She said it was not about the condom itself but about the fact that I threw away something that belonged to her without asking. I told her I did not see why she needed it, and she got defensive, saying she keeps one on hand just in case‚Äîa friend might need it or she might want to have one for general safety.

I told her I was not accusing her of anything, but I still did not see why she needed to carry one. She said that was not the point, that I should not have thrown it away without asking. Now she is being distant and acting frustrated with me.

How do I approach this conversation and fix things? I did not think this would be a big deal, but clearly, it was more important to her than I realized.

2025-02-27 21:40:17,1izra9i,"My (28F) girlfriend accuses me (25M) of pressuring her to talk about things, but won't initiate conversation or reconciliation herself. Help?","Hi,

My partner and I have been together for 3+ years mostly on and occasionally off, and we have an almost 2 year old child together.

Throughout the relationship, it has pretty consistently been me that has sought out reconciliation after any conflict with the interest in growing together and developing our understanding of each other further even in times of duress, rather than it being a mutual interest shown by her.

More importantly, over the past 4 months since we reconciled (I broke up with her in May of last year as I wasn't happy with the energy we were allowing around our son, and we both chose to re-enter the relationship around October with the understanding that we would focus on the health of our relationship as partners and as parents), it doesn't really feel like anything has changed from her.

I feel that she struggles to acknowledge her role in things, that by admitting any level of fault in most actions she feels like she's then to blame, and generally that she elects not to communicate because she thinks the easier thing to do is just sweep things under the rug and have them not be spoken about, and they will then eventually be forgotten.

Generally, I think this is inherently unhealthy and it isn't something I can actively do myself.

We had a conversation this evening where I queried when we were going to speak about things, something I hadn't mentioned for a few days since our last disagreement (in which she accused me of being horrible for no reason, and repeatedly told me to shut up; minor by many accounts, but something I explicitly stated I won't tolerate anymore - we can't treat each other like that).

That disagreement came about as a result of me asking her to take a little more ownership of the fact we need to share litter-tray duties r.e cats, and became something much more general with regards to the tone of how we interact and the way we fail to communicate effectively; something that bothers me massively and makes me feel rather unfulfilled / stifled.

This evening I was accused of pressuring her into speaking about things, by asking when we might speak about and deal with some of the issues we've been having. Now, she regularly stonewalls/grey-rocks me, simply ignoring me and declining to engage in reconciling, and I generally feel dejected and a bit hopeless about the situation at this point.

We have a wonderful little boy together, awe have periods of being absolutely fine together as parents and separately, as partners, even in the last few days. I am beginning to question my own sanity or reasonability somewhat, because it seems like to her I'm always being unreasonable by wanting to address things and move on from them.

I love her dearly but I'm conscious of the reasons | left the relationship in the first place. We can't be unhealthy people and let that affect our ability to be parents to our son. I've dealt with lots of trauma, I'm growing as an individual, and I can't help but feel like I'm almost regressing by engaging in this kind of behaviour with her. It feels non-sensical.

It doesn't matter whether I wait hours, days, or weeks -something I've tried before - no matter what, she hasn't approached me of her own accord.

I don't want to apply pressure to her whatsoever, because that isn't gonna generate the response or reconciliation that I'd like. It bothers me being accused of doing so, because I feel like I'm spending a lot of my days, energy and mindspace on trying to fix things with her and it feels somewhat one-sided.

I'm currently in therapy; one solo therapy I pay for privately, and two group therapies. I'm actively striving towards a brighter future for myself, my son and my family. I would like her to be part of that picture, but I'm concerned that I may be wasting my time somewhat if this is the general tone of our relationship.

I struggle to feel like we are growing when we can't even overcome minor disagreements without there being an emotional disconnect. 

Thank you for your input ",How can I address the lack of effective communication in my relationship without pressuring my partner?,"The individual is in a relationship with their partner that has lasted over three years, although it has been marked by periods of breaking up and reconciling.

They previously broke up with their partner due to unhappiness related to the environment around their child, but re-entered the relationship with the mutual agreement to prioritize both their partnership and parenting.

2025-02-27 21:39:53,1izr9ww,My (23F) boyfriend (28M) doesn‚Äôt make the first move,"Okay, so here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîI‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for three years now, and I‚Äôm always the one making the first move. Like, every single time. He never rejects me or anything, but it kinda feels like he‚Äôs just going along with it rather than actually wanting it, you know?
There was this one time, though, when he actually took the lead. It happened super late at night while I was asleep‚Äîhe just started undressing me and doing it. I was so caught off guard, I didn‚Äôt even know how to react and didn‚Äôt want to move until he finished. In that moment, I felt so overwhelmed, like I could cry. But after that night, it never happened again. And it‚Äôs not just sex‚Äîall physical affection is on me. Kisses, cuddles, literally everything. So I decided to stop for a whole month just to see if he‚Äôd notice. And guess what? He was totally fine. Like, completely unbothered. Meanwhile, I was losing my mind, and eventually, I caved.
The thing is, when we do have sex, he‚Äôs amazing. Like, super attentive and completely focused on me. But he never asks for anything in return, which honestly makes me feel kinda guilty. When I brought my issue up, he just said he wants me to decide when it‚Äôs the best time for me. And I get it, but it also puts so much pressure on me. That being said, he‚Äôs actually a great boyfriend. He‚Äôs really smart, helps me a lot financially (seriously, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without him), and he has this calm, commanding energy that somehow balances out my anxious, overthinking self. Being with him actually makes me feel calmer, which is crazy because my mind is usually all over the place. His friends and family also respect him a lot, and they treat me super well too.

We actually met on Reddit and never met in real life. We talk on and off, sometimes we wouldn't text for weeks, but when we do it's really friendly, sending funny reels, some jokes. 

Then last Sunday he ""guessed"" my last name. I was joking about how if I were to marry a guy, I'm taking his last name, and he said ""But I like [my last name]"". I don't have my last name on any social media we talk on, not even on my email, my accounts aren't linked to any source where he could've found my last name. 

Now we're sending each other those reels where they show some pic for half a second so you have to pause in the perfect moment. He said he has some trick to get it perfect on the first try, and then added ""Guess what I can make with my trick to you"". I asked if that's a threat because at this point I weirded out, he says ""trick or threat :)"". 

I've always been paranoid over getting stalked, spied on. I made my father buy me a phone with ""hidden"" front camera so that I was sure people wouldn't see me if they break into my phone. I put stickers on my laptop cameras. 

But after what the guy told me today I'm freaked out to do anything on my phone because what if the guy can see my screen?

2025-02-27 21:16:44,1izqqk4,My (28F) Boyfriend (30M) is considering long distance parenting his kid from another relationship and it‚Äôs causing issues between us,"There are a lot of details to this situation that would take a lot to share, but as the title says my current boyfriend is considering long distance parenting long term with his kid and it‚Äôs causing some tension in our relationship.

We are currently long distance as he‚Äôs across the country in a program, and I moved from our home state years ago. We have only been together 5ish months but have been friends for years previously. He has a child from a previous relationship around 3 years ago. He only stayed with her because she got pregnant very early into them casually dating and got into the relationship because she was pregnant and wanted to try and make it work, but ultimately it didn‚Äôt. Basically, staying for a kid when you are incompatible is never a good idea.

Before she got pregnant though, he got accepted into an amazing scholarship program for his career in an area where his career opportunities and earning potential are much greater than in his home state, and had planned on moving across the country right before she got pregnant. He ended up not going, but after the failed relationship and struggling financially/with his career, he decided to wait until his child was a bit older and go for the program. The initial plan as he‚Äôs told me was for it to be temporary until he finished the program (it‚Äôs like 9mos to a year commitment) and he would go back to his home state to be with his kid and co-parent with his child‚Äôs mother. In the meantime, his parents are helping his child‚Äôs mother with the kid as he stays with them half of the week, and he visits every few months, calls frequently, and sends the child‚Äôs mom money (they don‚Äôt have any court ordered custody or child support yet). Their co-parenting relationship is not the best, and not to be all ‚Äúcrazy baby mama‚Äù like but based off of what I know and have seen through proof she isn‚Äôt particularly the safest or most stable person. He let her know the choice was hers to keep the kid, but neither of them were stable or established or in a committed relationship, and he didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea as she didn‚Äôt even have stable housing at the time, but she decided to keep the child anyway so he stayed with her, but it was detrimental to his health as it wasn‚Äôt a healthy relationship so he left. He‚Äôs a good dad from what I see but understand that being unprepared for a child, dealing with the aftermath of a toxic relationship and it disrupting your career trajectory is a tough situation. I do have a lot of compassion for her given the situation, to be clear, but given what I know the entire situation is just‚Ä¶ a lot. 

Since he‚Äôs been away and the program is coming up to an end soon, he says he has healed a lot and can‚Äôt see himself going back because the opportunities are not the same, and he is much happier where he is now. His mentors think he would thrive where he is. He‚Äôs said he‚Äôs considering all possible options, including getting full custody of his kid and moving with him, but he doesn‚Äôt want to take the kid away from the child‚Äôs mom or family. He‚Äôs considered moving the child‚Äôs mom out to where he is, but given how she is he thinks that would be detrimental to his well-being and end up disastrous in some capacity. He‚Äôs been in therapy and talking to family lawyers/child psychologists, and in our recent conversations has now said he‚Äôs deeply considering just long-distance parenting long-term, and maybe when the kid older seeing how the kid feels about coming to live with him, as he feels it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for his finances and well-being, and in turn, what‚Äôs best for his kid in the long run since he will have the stability to give his kid a great life.

I‚Äôve done my research and see that long-distance parenting is possible, but as to whether that‚Äôs best for the child I am unsure. I have debated moving to where he is living currently (before we even started dating, but closing the gap has been a convo for us recently), but something in me would feel guilty that I‚Äôm with him and his kid isn‚Äôt? While there may be less opportunities in our home state, his it is definitely possible for him to figure something out just maybe in a bigger city, and I think that middle ground is what he should prioritize. He seems resistant to the idea sometimes, as I still think he is also coping with how much his life has changed and some guilt/shame/resentment around his current life situation and how he got there. But I do think figuring things out in a way he can be physically present for his kid is possible, but it‚Äôs also his life and his kid, I‚Äôm the one making a choice to be here. 

Is this something you think I‚Äôd be able to work through? Part of me feels as if he is being selfish, as I have said to him if our relationship continues to grow as it has I am also open to moving back to our home state because I‚Äôve considered that too, and we‚Äôd be able to build our life while he still can be present for his kid. I personally think he should prioritize a physical presence in his kid‚Äôs life, and he values what I have to say about that but he assures me that he‚Äôs truly trying to consider all options and be as informed as he can to do what is best, and it may not look like what I personally think is best. I feel like I‚Äôm worried about our friends judging us for ‚Äúliving our lives‚Äù across the country while his kid is left in another state, worried what would happened if we lived in another state and had a kid together and how it would affect his kid seeing us be a family without him, but maybe I have my own biases because I am a person who is a product of the type of situation his kid is in.

Are there things I should consider? Am I valid for thinking he is being selfish? Is my guilt somethig for me to work through that has nothing to do with him? I‚Äôm not even sure what specific answers I am looking for tbh, just some advice on how to handle the situation. I‚Äôve considered breaking up because of it but outside of our differing opinions about what he should do about his child, we have an amazing relationship. I would like to really sit with it all before I make that decision though and see other people‚Äôs opinions. ",Am I valid for thinking my boyfriend is being selfish about his long-distance parenting decision? What should I consider in this situation?,"The individual in crisis is currently in a long-distance relationship with their boyfriend, who has been in a program away from home for about 5 months. They have been friends for several years prior to dating. The boyfriend has a child from a previous relationship, which he entered into due to an unplanned pregnancy early on in their casual dating. The relationship was problematic, and he recognized it was detrimental to his health, leading to his eventual decision to leave.

Prior to the pregnancy, he was accepted into a scholarship program that would significantly enhance his career prospects, but he postponed this opportunity due to the circumstances of becoming a father. After the relationship ended, he struggled financially and with his career but decided to pursue the scholarship program when his child was a bit older.

His child‚Äôs mother is not perceived as particularly stable or safe, with the boyfriend‚Äôs parents currently assisting her with childcare, as the child lives with them part-time. The boyfriend maintains contact with his child and provides financial support, though their co-parenting situation is described as not ideal, lacking formal custody or support agreements.

Throughout this period, the boyfriend has engaged in therapy and sought legal advice regarding custody issues, demonstrating an active concern for his child's well-being. He has expressed a desire to explore various parenting options, including long-distance parenting, full custody, or potentially relocating the child and their mother to his current location, but he is wary of the implications of each choice.

The person writing the Reddit post expresses concern about the relationship dynamics, particularly with the boyfriend's parenting decisions and the stability of his current life compared to his child's situation. They also reflect on their own feelings of guilt about being in a relationship that may seem disconnected from the needs of his child.",2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izqqk4/my_28f_boyfriend_30m_is_considering_long_distance/,relationship_advice

The last year and a half or so I‚Äôd say there has been a change in our relationship in all aspects that I have stated above .

I may be being paranoid but I feel like he‚Äôs no longer sexually attracted / to me anymore and I‚Äôm not talking about just sex I am speaking as in I have to ask for a kiss when I believe this is the bare minimum in a relationship .

We can go weeks without sex and when we do have it it‚Äôs more on his terms than mine.

I compliment him regularly but this is not reciprocated . Recently I found him sharing half naked / naked girls to his friends on social media saying inappropriate things and since I‚Äôve felt like the ugliest Person in the world because  they look look absolutely nothing like me lol.

I‚Äôve spoken to him multiple times about how I feel sometimes and how I believe he has gotten to comfortable in the relationship it changes for 1 week then goes back to how it was the week before .

I don‚Äôt know what to do as he shows he loves me in other ways and says he loves me but what am I supposed to do if I don‚Äôt feel loved . 

We have never really argued or had a disagreement besides when I found out about the naked women comments as this really hurt my feelings ..

Am I being over dramatic . Please someone help

2025-02-27 21:10:12,1izql64,My (26M) fianc√© (29M) dislikes his job and comes home upset everyday. What to do?,"After five years of undergrad and another five years of grad school, my fianc√© has a PhD in computer science. He's been working in tech for almost two years now and recently disliking it. He doesn't like what he's work, he did not pick what he works on, he thinks his colleagues are not good and he's not learning anything after few good people left, he hates the workflow, and it's probably not going to get better any time soon. He feels far too stifled, micro managed, and not respected to get excited. He's still more or less happy at home and our relationship is doing okay. He‚Äôs a great guy but recently has started taking his frustration out on me. He is moody, irritable and doesn't tell me what's wrong. I feel the emotional barrier between us is widening and we only have surface level conversations. He spends every morning dreading the day and every evening trying to forget about work. I really wish that he got to explore his creativity and ingenuity, and just enjoyed what he spent those 40 hours a week doing.

He refuses to even hear about considering applying to new roles. He says he wants to get promoted and only then leave, but when senior roles are offered to him very relevant to his area, he refuses to interview. Stating reasons like every company is toxic and he does not want to relocate. 

He has told me out right he does not want to talk about this job switch or job. He has ""accepted it"" and there is nothing better out there. I told him if doesn't think my advice matters, he should atleast talk to others in his field and team. I fully support him joining a startup or a lower paying job, as long as it brings him more satisfaction.

I am laid off right now and taking a break from looking actively for a job. I am working on side projects and grad school but I told him I will try harder and take up a job if that's important to him. He said there is ""no hurry"". But I don't know I think he's just not communicating with me. He doesn't communicate and speak his mind about anything and it's driving me crazy.  
  
This is where my big relationship related concerns are. He‚Äôs unhappy, I‚Äôm sad that he‚Äôs unhappy. We have ideas of how to get him to a better place, but he rarely acts on them and never carries through. He tends to spend his free time going out, or watching Netflix. Which I get because I tend to do the same, and it‚Äôs hard to get motivated when he spent the last 8 hours hating life. I try to get him motivated by throwing ideas, asking him to network and talk to other people, encourages him to do work, telling him how smart I think he is, etc. But he doesn't want me to say anything and he doesn't say anything either. He says its painful to think about and talking about it reminds him of the pain. I tell him that you can't solve a problem by avoiding it, he says there is no solution. 

I want him to at least discuss it and try to look for solutions. ",How can I encourage my fianc√© to communicate about his job dissatisfaction without pushing him away?,"The individual in crisis has a background rooted in significant educational achievement and a current dissatisfaction with their work life.

2025-02-27 21:06:16,1izqhr7,i (26F) have a crush on a friend (34M) who seems depressed,"have a crush on someone who seems depressed

basically what it says. i (26F) like a recent friend (34M) i have made and in the last 2 months he has been going through something which is affecting his mental state badly, he finds it difficult to get things done or focus, he doesn't feel like stepping out or meeting people, has trouble sleeping etc. once this started, he stopped responding to me and i took it to be a social hint, especially since he said he is just staying off social media for some time. later he reached out on his own and explained his absence. he has also talked to me about his state a few times, but for the most part even when he talks about it he struggles to articulate it clearly. he believes it is not depression per se, claiming that he is familiar enough with that to know the difference. regardless of the classification, i think, he is clearly going through something serious. we mostly talk on text now only to discuss things around this, and he doesn't seem to carry other conversations much. we met a few times recently. he was also looking forward to getting out of the house. i think we enjoy each other's company but there is also a real possibility that social interactions in general might be too much for him sometimes.

my issue now is that i really like him, but he has been a bit hot and cold, and i find it hard to tell if it's because he is only interested in being around to me a certain extent or if he is genuinely not in a position to talk. for instance having me come over with the agreement that i will stay the night but then when i was there he said he might not be able to be social the next day, so it seemed best if i go. i understood his position and left. we met again after that, this time he was okay with me staying the night, and we ended up cuddling (new! i suggested it the last time we met and then he initiated it when we met this time), but then seeming a bit aloof the next morning, which left me feeling very confused and a bit upset. of course platonic cuddling is a thing but i feel like in a situation where one person puts it out there like that as a possibility, it should be read differently? is it not the best idea perhaps to have any expectations since the other person is suffering and would not be able to prioritise thinking about this? 

i was wondering if there's anything i can do to be there for him meaningfully, keeping in mind that we have only known each other for 5-6 months now, and he doesn't seem to be the one who initiates making plans much.. all this, of course keeping in mind his ongoing struggles. because i have a crush on him sometimes i think i end up projecting some of my insecurities on his lack of enthusiasm sometimes so that makes it more complicated than it should be, for instance for the most part i make plans for us to meet, and i don't know if that gets read as desperate or needy or perhaps impinging on a possible desire for solitude on his end. 

sorry, this is closer to a confused rant than a specific question. my general request is, are there things i should keep in mind when i proceed further with our friendship, as well as stuff which is important to consider if i put my feelings out there for him to consider (eg. how someone in his position might react to something like that in general). i don't want to overwhelm him or possibly contribute to further deterioration of his well being in any way at all. if anyone has been on the other side of things, how have you felt or would feel about similar situations?","What should I keep in mind when proceeding further with my friendship with someone who seems depressed, especially considering my feelings for him?","The individual in the Reddit post is a 26-year-old woman (26F) who has developed a crush on a 34-year-old man (34M) she has known for about 5-6 months as a friend.

2025-02-27 21:04:27,1izqg8k,I 28F made a bad joke and now my boyfriend 31M won‚Äôt talk to me ‚Äî did I ruin everything?,"So, I (28F, Indian, living in Canada) need advice because I think I may have really messed up my relationship. For some background, I‚Äôm here on a work permit, and my boyfriend (31M, also Indian, but a citizen) and I were introduced by our parents ‚Äî kind of like a modern arranged marriage situation.

We‚Äôve only known each other for about 3 months, but it felt like we just clicked instantly. He‚Äôs honestly everything I‚Äôve ever wanted ‚Äî kind, funny, ambitious, and we want the same things in life and marriage. The only ""flaw"" I‚Äôve ever noticed is that he‚Äôs pretty cocky. He‚Äôs super confident and isn‚Äôt shy about it. It‚Äôs not mean-spirited, but he always acts like he knows he‚Äôs a catch. Even when I compliment him, he just says ""I know."" It‚Äôs part of his personality, and honestly, I‚Äôve found it funny most of the time.

Last sunday, we were joking around like usual, and I made a joke I thought was harmless. It‚Äôs hard to remember exactly, but it was something like, ""Don‚Äôt get too cocky ‚Äî if my work permit wasn‚Äôt expiring, I wouldn‚Äôt even look at you."" I thought he‚Äôd just joke back, maybe say something cocky like ""you‚Äôre lucky to have me"" ‚Äî which is exactly how we usually banter.

But instead, he just shut down completely. All he said was, ""I see,"" and then he left.

Later, he texted me:

""This was my biggest fear. That you were too good to be true. Thank you for the confirmation and for saving me a bigger heartbreak in the future. I really appreciate you. this was an amazing experience but I guess I have to come back to reality. I‚Äôll make some excuses to my parents but I can‚Äôt think right now. Let me know in a week what you want me to say to them.""



I was (and still am) completely shocked. I don‚Äôt understand how one stupid joke could make him think everything we had was fake. We‚Äôve even talked about my work permit before ‚Äî I told him from the start that I want to marry soon, and he said as long as we like each other, timing wouldn‚Äôt matter. We were always super open and on the same page about our goals and feelings.

I can‚Äôt process how something so small could destroy everything. It‚Äôs been five days now. He‚Äôs ignoring my calls and hasn‚Äôt read any of my messages. I feel so lost. I care about him so much and I always thought I was the lucky one to have him.

Was my joke really that bad? Is there any way to fix this? I don‚Äôt even know what to say to him if he ever does talk to me again. Any advice would mean a lot. I would do anything for him. 


EDIT: UPDATE: HE SAW MY POST AND TEXTED ME.. OMGGGG


He asked me to post this: 

""I am insecure. I have only been in one relationship in my my life. It lasted 4 years, she cheated on me with a celebrity while she was traveling solo and she told me it was once a lifetime opportunity. That was 7 years ago. 

My best friend married his GF. They were together for 2 years before marriage, and she filled for divorce after she got her pr and told him she could do better. 

I thought I knew both of these women. We were so close. They were such good people, and even they broke mine and my best friends heard after such a long relationship. 

I was told, ""When people tell you who they are. Believe them. ""

2025-02-27 21:04:13,1izqg0i,My gf (f20) broke up with me (m20) because I made our friends feel uncomfortable. How do i apologise?,"Hey, sorry if its not the right format, this is my first post, I dont know if this is the right thread or not for this story.

I recently started dating my gf (f20), we've been friends for a long time and had only recently realised that the feelings are mutual. She's studying abroad in my country, and we have a fairly close knit friend group with two other girls. 

The night before yesterday, my gf had the three of us over for drinks and food, and we end up playing a question game that got very personal. My two friends gave me answers for my red flags that set me off and put me in a bad mood that i couldnt shake. I know i shouldve left, but i didnt want to spoil gfs evening because she was feeling homesick.

The evening goes on and I everytime i try go into another room they follow and try continue the conversation. I end up drinking, trying to keep a happy face, while everytime i try and deflect or change topic to something less serious, friend 2(f22) keeps talking about her trauma, asking about mine and trying to dig in. We end up alone in a room and she tries to bring it up again. She keeps pushing and asking me after i tell her to stop and i end up snapping, and asking her 'how the f*ck am i supposed to take advice from someone who doesnt listen to their own.' I knew immediately that it really hurt her, because she was talking about her past trauma with people not respecting her and belittling her. 

I end up walking her and friend 1 (f21) home, her still trying to dig in to my feelings and get me to open up, despite me asking to stop. The next day I get a message saying that we needed to call, and we had a talk discussing how that made her feel, and that it wasnt ok. 

The other thing they talked to me about on the call was my relationship with friend 1. Friend 1 is someone i thought was a really close friend, and had a very joking relationship with, where we'd talk shit and insult each other. She has a boyfriend (m22) that she really loves. 
On call, her boyfriend brought up that I make her feel uncomfortable and that he thought i was flirting with her. I swear to god i have never intentionally flirted with friend 1, she had never mentioned feeling uncomfortable with that to me and i was blindsided by this. I tried to apologise and explain but i kept getting cut off.

I end the call, i send friend 1, friend 2 and boyfriend an apology, really meaning it and the next morning i get a text from boyfriend that outlined that i hurt their feelings, made them uncomfortable and that they were cutting off contact with me. 

Later on, i call with my girlfriend, whos absolutely fucking livid and angry at me. She says she's breaking up with me and i didnt argue, i told her i understood and that i was so fucking sorry. She says that she doesnt want to talk to me or see me, and breaks up.

To be clear, I'm not looking for sympathy, i made two women feel uncomfortable around me and i broke my gfs heart. I'm asking reddit if theres any way for me to apologise or explain myself, or if that would be just pouring salt on the wound. Sorry for the long post, i just genuinely dont know what to do, i want to respect their wishes and not contact, but also these are my friends, and i love my gf and i dont want them to hurt. Any advice will help, I just dont know.

She saw month okd texts from a mutual friend nothing bad but the person was someone she asked me to cut off over a year or two ago. It broke her trust. She asked to go on my snap. In all honesty I was very tired and wanted to pray before I went to sleep. I ended up falling asleep which angered her more cuz from her pov it was like I was hiding something. Cut to the next day we meet for coffee and she says she wants to break up. I say I don‚Äôt want to and we can work this out and to give me a month to change. She says no we then go to talk to a priest who suggests we take a month tg to try and work it out. At the end of it she was conflicted on what to do then said let‚Äôs do a month apart. I was against that and she basically caved into agreeing with me. A few days later Im over at her house and she‚Äôs very cold with me and basically says cuz she didn‚Äôt want to do the one month at all. I came to the realization I can‚Äôt make her stay if she doesn‚Äôt want to and say ok that‚Äôs fine. Then give me this one last day with you. She agrees. And for the record. She said multiple times she did love me and want me but didn‚Äôt want to get hurt again by empty promises of me changing. We spend most of the day reminiscing over good memories and you can tell she was saddened by it. Later that day we start lightly talking abt our future and start talking abt it seriously.

And the rest of the day is rly rly good. Hugging. Cuddling. Kissing. It‚Äôs like it never happened. Two days later, we get coffee and all is rly rly good. Later that same day she texts me and says she doesn‚Äôt want to completely move past what happened and act like everything is fine. She went on and said she felt she jumped the gun saying we were good and she should‚Äôve instead given me the one month to see how everything goes. I tell her ok that‚Äôs completely understandable and I wouldn‚Äôt want her to move past it cuz I know it still bothered her. Since that night she‚Äôs been rly cold. Today she said she wanted to be alone and I said ok and asked if I did something wrong or anything she said no she just wanted to be alone to think abt everything and just be alone. So like.

2025-02-27 20:52:26,1izq63l,I 22F caught my bf 27M trying to jerk off in the washroom. Only to be told he ‚Äúhas to watch porn to keep up his sex drive‚Äù (?),"Woke up this morning with a weird feeling in my stomach, and I turn over and see he isn't in the room and the door is closed (it's never closed).

So I quietly get up and see the bathroom door barely open. He hears me open the bedroom door and I hear him quickly scramble and drop his phone. I open the bathroom door and he tries to just say good morning to me.
Mind you I didn't see him actively jerking off or hearing porn on his phone. 

He started stuttering which confirmed my gut feeling. He quickly left to go to the room and I walked behind him and saw he closed a tab on his phone. So I asked what he was searching up. Which led to me asking him multiple times, only to get different excuses everytime.
(""That's how my browser looks when I open it"", ""I was just looking at where Minnesota is"" we were watching love is blind, ""it's nothing"").

Until he finally answers truthfully and said ""I had a morning boner and I wanted it to go away"". While knowing it's okay for him to wake me up and have sex.
He then had to quickly leave for work without saying anything else and came back a couple hour later for his break.

He didn't speak to me for an hour until he decided to come to the couch where I was and apologize. He said he's sorry and won't to it again. But he then added his reasoning which was ""I have to watch porn and jerk off in order for me to have a sex drive with you"" verbatim.

I was already mildly upset with him, trying to be understanding of one's needs. But after he said his statement that got me upset.

We have sex 4-5 times a week and none of it feels like a chore, and it's always enjoyable. Despite him not always making an effort to make me orgasm every single time, which doesn't bother me too much.

And to add insult to injury last night I wasn't feeling the best and mentioned how I haven't felt ""pretty"" that day. So for me to wake up the next day and see that wasn't helpful lol

What I'm stumped on is wondering if his reasoning is valid. Is that something men experience or need to do to build up a sex drive? Or was he just trying to cover himself up.","Is it common for men to need to watch porn and jerk off to build up a sex drive, or is that an excuse?","The individual discussing their crisis in the Reddit post has not provided extensive background information regarding their education, family situation, or work history. However, they are in a sexual relationship where they seem to have a consistent sexual frequency of 4-5 times a week, which the person finds enjoyable overall, despite some concerns about their partner's habits. The individual also mentions having feelings of inadequacy, specifically expressing that they did not feel ""pretty"" the day before the incident. This emotional state may contribute to their current feelings regarding the relationship.

2025-02-27 20:52:06,1izq5ss,"I (30M) cut my dad (55M) off until he chooses to be a better parent, and it doesn't feel good.","I apologize, this might be rather long. I have a lot on my mind.

I (30M) grew up in an abusive household. My mother (55F) was deeply emotionally immature, and throughout my childhood was manipulative, cruel, volatile, and on rare occasions would even resort to physical violence. She once choked my brother (28M) in a restroom because of something he said. The number of abusive things that she did are either too great to list, or my mind has blocked them out. I do not remember much of my childhood, but I remember the fear, rage, and uncomfortability that my childhood self felt every single day.

Now, at 30, I have spent my entire adult life unlearning terrible behavior and deep feelings of shame. I have learned social skills, life skills, emotional intelligence, and so many other things that children are supposed to learn through their parents, all on my own (with the help of a few cherished friends). This has come at the cost of losing nearly every meaningful relationship I have ever had, losing jobs, opportunities, education, everything. I have had to dig myself out of mental and emotional shit to be where I am. I recently was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and C-PTSD, at 30 years old. It explains so much about my struggles, and with all of my life experience, therapy, and medication, I am doing quite well. I'm not at my final form yet, but I'm getting there.

Where was my dad (55M) in all of this? He was, and I will die on this hill, allowing my mother to abuse her children. If she was abusing her children, then she wasn't abusing him. He never defended us when she was terrorizing us, even though I would beg him to. He would always say ""what do you want me to do, tell her she's a bitch?"". If we did something that upset my mom (which wasn't hard to do), she would intentionally push my dad's buttons until he lost his temper and would verbally attack us. He has called us punks, assholes, and more. He did not defend his children. Furthermore, he was entirely emotionally unavailable, and still is. I could not and cannot confide in him for... anything, really, because he would either invalidate my feelings or he wouldn't understand at all.

It was like this until my brother and I moved out, and then all of the abuse went toward him. That is when he had an emotional affair with an old friend (his now fianc√©, 50'sF) and divorced my mother. He then moved two hours away, where they have built a house together. His fianc√©, and her kids, have received a better father, husband, and overall a better person than I ever did. 

It took me a long time to realize that, while my mother was far worse and while my dad is certainly a victim of my mother, his inability to defend his children, along with his emotional unavailability, was neglect. He was also an abusive parent, in a different way.

He and I had discussed this in the past, and all I ever got was ""I realize that I could have done more to protect you guys"". No, he should have protected his children. He should have been there for his children who could not defend themselves. Period. He did not. 

After I got my BPD/C-PTSD diagnoses, I immediately ripped my parents a new one. I told them both that this started with them and all of the abuse they put me through. Now, here is the thing: after a divorce and both of her kids telling her to fuck off (I did not hold back), my mother has turned a new leaf. She has learned a lot of emotional intelligence, and took a lot of initiative to earn a relationship with me. We will never be close, and the wounded child in me will never truly forgive her, but we have a relationship. I go to her house every Sunday for dinner, and her and my stepdad always send me home with a lot of food. She is trying to be a better mom, and despite what I have gone through I can accept that from her.

My dad, though. As always, his solution is to throw his hands up in the air and say ""I've already apologized, and I don't know what you want me to do"". After not protecting his children, after all of the times I couldn't rely on him, after all of the times he didn't reach out, or didn't show he cared, or after all of the times he promised he would help with money (for tuition and car payments) and had to be hunted down each month only to help with less than half of what he promised... after a lifetime of his cowardice, emotional unavailability and lack of accountability, I had had enough, especially after all of the times his now fianc√© defended him and said that he was ""trying to keep the peace"". WHOSE? Certainly not his children's, and it clearly didn't work too well for him. Also, SHE WASN'T THERE, and has no room to speak on any of this.

I told him off. I explained every hurt, every feeling of abandonment, every invalidation, all of my feelings of him not taking accountability, not considering my feelings, not doing anything to attempt to create a relationship with me. I said everything I needed to, in fact I said it several times over several texts. I made it abundantly clear how I felt, and how I did not expect him to care enough to be a better parent. I told him how disappointed in him I am both as my parent and as a person, and that it is deeply concerning that my mother, the worst of the two, has done more than he ever has to make amends for what she has done.

Of course, each and every time, after every text, I got the same fucking response: ""I'm sorry you're mad. I don't know what you want me to do. Hope to see you at Christmas, and we can have an adult talk in person"".

Needless to say, I did not see him for Christmas. There would be no talk, because I had said everything I needed and wanted to say, and he had replied with the same shit every time. So, I finally told him that I did not want to speak to him again until he decided to actually be a father, take accountability for his neglect, and choose to make decisions in order to build a relationship with me. If he didn't know what to do, he needed to LEARN, to try, to do something. It is not my responsibility to fix this, because I have had to fix the consequences of his and my mother's abusive behavior all of my life, at too great a cost.

After that, I did not hear from him for over a month, when I got this text:

""Hi OP, I just wanted to say hi, and I love you. I hope you are doing better, hopefully I will talk to you soon.""

Now, on the one hand, he did reach out, and I give him credit for that. On the other hand, this is missing... maybe a dozen things that it really needed. After pouring my heart out to him and telling him how hurt I am, this response tells me that it doesn't matter. He has made it clear that he is not going to change or seriously address what I have said. I wonder if, now that he is happy, it isn't worth the effort. I feel like I don't matter enough. I feel like I am now a problem for him to avoid, as he has avoided every other problem in his life. I feel abandoned and hurt. I don't want to care, honestly, but I do. It hurts to want a relationship with a parent when they consistently let you down.

I want to clarify a few things that make me wonder if I am being unreasonable. First, as I said before I do recognize that he was a victim of my mother's abuse. I can recognize that AND acknowledge that he, as a parent, should have done more for his children's wellbeing. Second, even if he does make attempts to be better, I don't really know what I want from him. We have never really had much of a relationship... he was just ""there"". I don't know what a relationship with him looks like, to be honest. I didn't know what one would look like with my mother either, and yet she put in the effort and, with my willingness to be open to effort, we have come a long way. Third is that, even if he does reach out and do some level of what I would like, I still find myself feeling hurt and it is difficult to not be angry with him. I recognize that this makes it difficult to connect, and I am working on that in a way that doesn't invalidate my own feelings.

I don't really know how to feel now. I have not responded to his messages, and I don't think I will to he honest. I don't think he will hear from me until I see some effort. This whole thing just really hurts, and it's been bothering me a lot. I'm working through it with my therapist, though the abandonment and invalidation are a lot to work through. 

Does anyone have any experience with stuff like this, and what I can do to start to feel better about this?

TL,DR: My dad has been neglectful all of my life, and refuses to accept responsibility and take effort to learn to be better and develop a relationship with me. It hurts and I don't know how to feel better about this.",How can I start to feel better about my relationship with my neglectful father who refuses to accept responsibility?,"The individual in the Reddit post is a 30-year-old male who grew up in an abusive household, primarily due to the emotional and physical abuse inflicted by his mother, who is currently 55 years old. He has a brother who is 28 years old. The father's role in this environment was marked by emotional unavailability and neglect, as he did not defend the children against their mother's abuse. The father, now 55, was emotionally passive and did not provide the support the children needed, leading to feelings of abandonment and resentment from the individual.

Throughout his adult life, he has been focused on unlearning the negative behaviors and feelings of shame instilled during his childhood. This process has cost him meaningful relationships, jobs, and opportunities. He has recently been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Complex PTSD (C-PTSD), which he finds explains many of his struggles. He has managed to acquire social and life skills and is currently in therapy.

While the individual has a complicated relationship with his mother, who has made some efforts to improve and earn a relationship with him, he feels deep disappointment towards his father for not taking responsibility for his actions and failing to provide the necessary parental support. The father has recently attempted to reach out but the individual feels that these attempts lack sincerity and do not address the hurt caused by years of neglect. The ongoing emotional turmoil from this family history and the dynamics between him and his parents contribute significantly to his current crisis.",6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izq5ss/i_30m_cut_my_dad_55m_off_until_he_chooses_to_be_a/,relationship_advice
2025-02-27 20:51:31,1izq5bi,"My (24m) ex girlfriend (21f) dumped me and is now mad at me because of it, how do I deal with this?","After 8 months of being involved, of which the last 3 we were official she dumped me. Said she thought she was aromantic but wasn‚Äôt sure, cared for me a lot but didn‚Äôt think she had romantic feelings for me. She initiated almost every romantic gesture we did. She made the jokes about it being a date when we got lunch after hooking up. She grabbed my hand when we were out shopping. She sat on my lap in front of all of our friends. She got upset when I didn‚Äôt see her every day. She got upset when I didn‚Äôt take her out to dinner. She was the one who woke up in the middle of the night and texted me about how she wished she could sleep in my arms or that she randomly wanted me there. I never wanted to fall in love with her. She dragged me into it kicking and screaming by being one of the most loving and sweetest people I have ever met to me. One of the first people who seemed to actually care about me. And then she dumped me because she never really liked me that much. And then proceeded to spend the next three weeks still initiating text conversations just as much if not more than before dumping me, just casually talking about her day, or telling me how she missed watching shows with me but still doesn‚Äôt want to try again and knows it cruel to keep texting me so she‚Äôll stop. But she doesn‚Äôt. For three weeks after dumping me. And then she tells me she doesn‚Äôt like how aimless she feels in her free time now, and then nothing for a week. Until I post a photo of myself in a bar. And now she‚Äôs upset with me because I said I didn‚Äôt want to lose her, but also don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs fair to either of us to be friends when I know I would just be doing so to win her back, and I haven‚Äôt put any effort into trying to be her friend because of that, and am now doing stuff without her she wanted to do with me before she left. Now she‚Äôs telling me she‚Äôs upset i can‚Äôt see her as anything except romantic right now, because it‚Äôs been a month and I should be over it apparently. And that if I ever change my mind it will probably have been to long to have a meaningful friendship. It‚Äôs hard for me to believe that her being so upset about me doing things without her isn‚Äôt because she either isn‚Äôt sure what she actually wants - she struggles with figuring out her own emotions sometimes and stopped her anti depressants cold turkey about a month and a half ago, just a few days before dumping me - or because she doesn‚Äôt actually care about how I feel and just wants all the benefits of a relationship with me without the actual commitment. And I don‚Äôt know how to find out which. It‚Äôs been a month since she dumped me and I still want her back so much. Is there any chance I can win her back.

2025-02-27 20:45:29,1izq0by,"Found my ‚Äò37 m‚Äô husband on gay dating app, and I, ‚Äò33 m‚Äô confronted him.","I‚Äôm a 33m, and my husband is 37m. We‚Äôve been together for 11 years and married for 6.

Our relationship has had its ups and downs, especially when it comes to trust. I‚Äôve caught him cheating at least twice in the past, and for the last few months, I‚Äôve found him on Grindr. At the same time, I‚Äôve noticed that he isn‚Äôt very sexual with me. I‚Äôm always the one giving, but I rarely receive the same effort in return. That said, he is very loving and sweet in other ways.

I confronted him about it and suggested that maybe we should live apart since, to me, this is a form of cheating. He insisted that he only goes on there to chat when he‚Äôs bored, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîthose chats are usually sexual in nature. Am I naive to think that‚Äôs all he‚Äôs doing? Maybe. But for some reason, I believe he isn‚Äôt acting on anything beyond the conversations.

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve dealt with something like this. A few years ago, he developed an emotional connection with a friend, which led him to temporarily break up with me. He told me he saw us more as best friends. I was in the process of moving out when he changed his mind, saying he was just ‚Äúconfused.‚Äù

Fast forward to now: We recently moved back to a state he dislikes after trying out his home state for a year. I hated living there, but I went for him. Now that we‚Äôre back, he‚Äôs unhappy again and wants to move back, but he says he‚Äôd miss me too much if he left. Meanwhile, I love my job here, and he‚Äôs about to start a new job after hating his last one.

During his struggles with work, I decided to bring up the Grindr issue. He took it well, admitted he goes on when he‚Äôs bored, and promised to stop. I suggested we take space and live apart, but when I saw how sad he looked, I backtracked and told him I was just feeling hurt.

Now, I‚Äôm at a loss. I love him, but I‚Äôm naturally a people-pleaser, and I always prioritize others over myself. I feel like I could make things work, but I‚Äôve been cheated on too many times, and it‚Äôs left me confused. I don‚Äôt want to feel silly for wanting my husband to desire me instead of seeking attention from others. The lack of intimacy is taking a toll on me, even though he reassures me with words and gifts.

The relationship has experienced significant trust issues, including at least two instances of infidelity on the husband's part. The individual has noted a decline in sexual intimacy within the marriage and feels that he is always the one giving, while not receiving equal efforts in return. 

He has previously confronted his husband about suspicious behavior on Grindr, which he interprets as a form of cheating, despite the husband's claims that he only chats on the app out of boredom. A few years prior, the husband's emotional connection with a friend led to a temporary breakup, indicating past relational instability.

Recently, they moved back to a state that the husband dislikes after trying out his home state for a year, which the individual disliked. Although he has found fulfillment in his job in the current location, the husband is about to start a new job after being dissatisfied with his previous one.

2025-02-27 20:44:39,1izpznr,I(22M) had a situationship with a good friend(22F) of mine and still miss her.,"Hey, 

I've been having a pretty hard time over this. I met this girl(22F) at my university parttime job 6 months ago. We quickly became very good friends, we'd go on walks, she'd cook for me, hang out a lot, she even shared her deeper secrets to me. Even though I was into her, I never made a move (partly because I'm inexperienced, have not been in a relationship till now and also I didn't want to ruin whatever we had). She'd tell me about the guys she was interested in and I'd listen even though I hated it. Fast forward to winterbreak, I go back home and she gets into a FWB with some other guy from work and when I come back she tells me about this and how she caught feelings for him and this was so unhealthy for her and they decided to end it and stay friends. 

Last week, we hang out and she shares her life problems and I do mine too. We start cuddling and I escalate and we end up in her room. We talk, cuddle, kiss, hold hands, oral sex (this doesn't happen till the 2nd day), etc. We hang out everday the next 3 days and it was magical. I never had this kind of emotional connection with anyone, I showed her a side of myself noone ever saw. The entire time I say no to sex, I didn't want her to make a flash decision and regret it later like she usually does. We both share our feelings about how I liked her and she was like she liked me too from the very beginning but did not think I liked her so she didn't want to ruin what we had. I say she should talk to her therapist first to make sure this is healthy for her as I did not want her to get hurt. She even told me she wants to date me seriously and cannot do casual. This led me to believe she was serious about me and I took her seriously as well. We did this for 3 days and then comes her therapist appointment. 

She talks to her therapist and then calls me and tells me how this is not a good idea considering how we both are graduating in the next few months. I confess my feelings on how I still want to spend time with her even though we have less time. She invites me over and we do what we usually do the next hour and she leaves for a club meeting. That night she calls me and tells me how she does not want to be in a serious relationship with me and how she still has feelings for her FWB which ended 2 days before we got together (I was not aware of this, I thought it ended a month ago). And she does not want me to be her rebound. She has feelings for both of us and that makes her feel guilty. I tried my best to change her mind. I said feelings are just feelings and how we can both get over that. But she made up her mind and I was devastated. She calls me the next day to say sorry and I was furious that she used me like that and lead me on. I wish her all the best and tell her that I wish to never see her again. 

On the call I ask her what was so good about her FWB that she cannot get over him and she said they were intimate like we weren't (aka sex, we never had sex). And that made me feel like shit, here I was thinking I made progress in life -- I was 120lbs skinny last year, I started going to gym and tracking my macros to put on muscle (I'm 145lbs now), joined boxing club, was socially anxious, but can freely hold conversations, funny, caring, etc, etc. And in the end it did not matter. I'm still not good enough. 


Its been over a week since the breakup and I still miss her. I miss her company, I miss her texts, I miss the cuddles, most of all I miss her friendship. We were such good friends and it is sad to see things end this way cuz she was genuinely a good person. She was one of my best friends. I high key want to reach out and talk things through. I'm confused what I'm supposed to do in this situation.

Now last week I found out she has a new relationship she was hiding from me. I called her out on it because I needed to know if that was the reason we broke up instead. I still don't know for sure. But then she said stuff about me being the closest thing to her and that we will be forever in our lives. It made me go back to a dark place, but again I held on.

I also am running on around 3 hours of sleep and this just happened last night so I'm very emotional about it all.

I, m18, have been in a relationship with my boyfriend m18 for two years. Before we began dating we were also close friends. This is important because I've had what can only be described as a really rough life, I've experienced multiple assaults, an abusive relationship, and have had multiple important figures in my life pass away. i have severe ptsd from stuff too. My boyfriend knew of this long before we began dating, and I've told him he is absolutely justified in wanting to leave if this ever becomes too much to put up with. I'm aware I can be a lot to deal with, and carry a ton of baggage with me, and he has always said he will be there for me. He's also had a rough life but I don't feel right sharing any of his story, just know that we both have mutual disorders and trauma and have always understood and supported one another. We are also long distance while I am in college, and have nights where we sleep on call together in order to make the distance easier.

Anyways, heres for the actual story. We are both in first years of college and I had one of those days where everything is stressful and exausting and theres no down time. Once I was finally free from the day i was having a rough time relaxing and was dealing with random bits of grief. Nothing new for me or my boyfriend. I let him know that i was having one of those nights, and we decided to call. the call itself was cool and all, we chatted about days and had a nice time.

When we were talking about my day and my stress he tried to make me look more realistically at what I was experiencing and focus on the right now instead of the future. I was trying to but couldnt help to think of the assignments I need to complete and haven't done enough for yet. he was talking very calmly and just wanted to help and I just couldnt process it well so we decided to move the topic to something else.

It started getting late so he talked about sleeping and I agreed that we should soon. It should be mentioned that he takes meds to help him stay asleep, and they usually take around an hour to an hour and a half to kick in. i also take melatonin to fall asleep and we kinda call those my 'meds' too to help it. anyways we both brushed teeth and stuff, and i was getting my room more cosy.

thats when i fucked up a little and said i might work on the assignment anyways. he was rightfully annoyed with me and said that i have no reason to be so stressed and it upsets him when i just refuse to listen to him and dont try to focus on myself. i started panicking and apologizing and it just sort of turned into a back and forth mess. somewhere in that time he took his meds and told me, and i was still getting everything more comfortable.

around 20 or so minutes later is when everything kind of went to shit. we were talking and trying to get back to a calm and cosy night when i just began to break down again. i started crying and apologizing and he just said that it was okay to cry and he was right there. in between sobs and stuff i apologised, and after a few minutes of crying and sobbing i realised he wasnt saying anything. don't get me wrong, he did not need to comfort or help but he was dead silent. i kind of took a minute to breathe and get my voice to sound half decent before i began talking, asking if he was there, and finally asking if he was awake. he wasnt.

i stayed up for hours after, seeing if he was just silent or distracted. i spent a lot of that time sobbing harder than i have in a while. i passed out at some time after sending some random messages to him and woke up when i heard the sound that he had ended the call. we texted for five minutes but i honestly didnt want to talk to him and just felt hurt that someone i love so dearly could just sleep to the sounds of me crying.

so here we are today. we've talked a little here and there, and i finally mustered the courage to ask what he remembered from last night before he fell asleep... and all he said was he remembered quiet. i know for a damn fact there was no quiet beside the one minute of silence i had AFTER he went crazy quiet. i also know that he could hear me cry, because i was crying kind of loudly and my microphone can pick up my whispers if i try. and the fact is he knew i was crying because he had told me it was okay to cry. so i don't know if im going insane or something but something isnt adding up.

i just need to know how on earth to address this with him, and talk about how hurt and confused i feel without making him feel too guilty and sad. i struggle a lot with communication and have been working on it, so its more of a what do i say instead of something else. i talked to my best friend and he is pissed about the situation and told me that maybe coming here is the best way to get an opinion that wont be very biased. my friends are very protective of me... lol. please let me know if theres a good way to word what i want to address, or if im being unnecesarily upset over a small situation.

TLDR: my 18m boyfriend 18m was on call with me while i was having a rough night and breaking down. he had taken sleeping meds and fallen asleep while i was very audibly crying on call. his meds shouldnt/wouldnt have kicked in for another 30-40 minutes. when asking him the next morning he said he just fell asleep to silence, but he had talked and acknowledged me crying last night. i dont know how to address this with him without raising unnecessary guilt and i feel horrible. please help if you can","How can I address my feelings of hurt and confusion with my boyfriend about him falling asleep while I was crying on the call, without making him feel too guilty?","The individual posting is an 18-year-old male who has been in a relationship with his boyfriend, also 18, for two years.

While she was in that relationship, she reached out to me 3 or 4 times wanting to talk and we went out without the knowledge of her boyfriend (I also wanted to talk because I was heavily stuck on her).
On one of these conversations (December 2024) she said that maybe she liked me and doesn‚Äôt see a future in her current relationship (at the time) and that she was searching me in everyone. We even held hands that day.

She reached out to me 1 week ago saying that she broke up with her boyfriend and that she has to stop lying to herself and wants to give us another go. I don‚Äôt give her an answer but she says she doesn‚Äôt even know how to start something with me because it‚Äôs been too long and we have all these variables in play (her friends mainly because her now ex-boyfriend is part of her main group of friends).

I text her 4 days later trying to reconnect little by little and we go out on the weekend. Things flow very naturally and we are just catching up, she comes and gives me this huge hug and I‚Äôm thinking we are having a moment and as I‚Äôm about to kiss her, she goes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad that we can still hang out as friends‚Äù
And I get a little weirded out because I‚Äôm not exactly looking for this kind of reaction, since I thought that we are slowing working towards something (it‚Äôs just a kiss in my opinion, we were always very touchy with each other and I think this is long overdue).

The rest of the afternoon goes ok but the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù comment still stays in my head because, with her, I‚Äôm tired of feeling like she might be putting me as a plan B while she goes and look for a better option (since it‚Äôs the first time she really gets to be ‚Äúsingle‚Äù after we broke up).
I ask her what‚Äôs her mental space regarding our situation.

And she goes:
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be emotionally vulnerable with you right now, I still haven‚Äôt even hung out with my friend group since me and my ex broke up. I‚Äôm still confused about us, I‚Äôm afraid I might be holding on to nostalgia and I want to see if we still have the click and the safety you are asking for at this moment, I can‚Äôt give it to you‚Äù

I told I couldn‚Äôt do that anymore because I‚Äôve been feeling like this since she was dating her ex and she was sending messages to my mother saying she couldn‚Äôt feel happy without me.

It‚Äôs not about the click. She knows we click, we have amazing chemistry together and she knows that aswell. I just think that maybe she realized she can get almost any guy she wants (she‚Äôs super kind, outgoing and extremely attractive) and now wants to explore her options and I know she takes a lot of her friends opinion in consideration, and coming back to me at this point would be destroying her ‚Äúreputation‚Äù.

The next day I realized I might‚Äôve tried to control the situation too much because I‚Äôve been wanting this for a long time and I called her saying that maybe I was ahead of myself and we can try to move much slower and try to be organic.

I‚Äôve dated a lot and also took a long time for myself but nothing feels like home like being with her, and in some way, I think she also feels the same.

I feel conflicted, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm being used as a back burner and I don‚Äôt know if I deserve this. It‚Äôs mentally draining trying to figure her out. We haven‚Äôt talked in 5 days and I don‚Äôt see her reaching out to me so easily.

2025-02-27 20:24:44,1izpirm,"I (21M) Feel Lost and Confused About This Girl(20F) in My Class (Long Post, Need advice)","

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm a 21-year-old freshman in college, and I just started my first semester this January. I met this girl in one of my classes, and at first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. But then we started talking more before and after class, and after a few weeks, I started to develop feelings for her. We have some things in common (like being into anime), and she seems really nice and enthusiastic whenever we talk. I was enjoying our conversations.

However, there was this one moment when I jokingly asked her, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my name, by the way?‚Äù and she didn‚Äôt know it. Honestly, that stung a little, but I didn‚Äôt make a big deal out of it and brushed it off.

Lately, though, something‚Äôs been bothering me. Over the past week or so, I‚Äôve noticed her talking to another guy in our class, and it‚Äôs been messing with my head. It‚Äôs honestly the first time in a while that I‚Äôve felt so bad about something. My heart physically hurt when I saw them laughing together outside the class this morning, and I started sweating and felt like I was burning up. To put it bluntly, I‚Äôve been single for almost four years now, and I‚Äôve never felt this strongly about someone in a long time.

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm looking for here. I‚Äôm just trying to process everything. Honestly, I just need to talk to someone, because I don‚Äôt really have any close friends here in the U.S. (I recently moved here). Next week is spring break, and I‚Äôm thinking about going out for a change (I rarely leave my house except for work, school, and religious activities).

For the longest time, I thought I wanted to finish college before dating, and I still kind of believe that to some degree. But recently, I‚Äôve been hit with this overwhelming feeling of emptiness. I‚Äôve always made excuses to avoid relationships, but now I find myself wanting that connection, wanting to feel loved. I hate to admit it, but I‚Äôm way more emotional than I‚Äôve allowed myself to acknowledge. Coming from a Caribbean immigrant background, we don‚Äôt talk about feelings, especially as a guy, so this is all pretty new to me.

And now, I can‚Äôt stop overthinking everything. Maybe I was moving too slow with her? I just can‚Äôt help but wonder why she‚Äôs so comfortable with this guy after only two weeks of talking, while I‚Äôve been talking to her for longer and she hasn‚Äôt seemed to get as close with me. Did they go on a date? Does she know his name? I know we‚Äôre not dating or anything, and it might be a one-sided thing, but it still hurts a lot seeing her talk to him every day.

2025-02-27 20:15:38,1izpayj,"My (33F) fianc√© (34m) and I are constantly fighting; I feel gaslit and he refuses to go to therapy, now he won‚Äôt even speak to me. How do we handle this situation?","Background: I‚Äôve been with my fianc√© for 8 years, engaged for a couple of months. We have owned our house for 2 years and prior lived together since 2018. We plan on getting married this year. 

Since we moved into our house our fighting has escalated. He says I‚Äôm too controlling and for majority of the relationship I have slowly broken him down and ‚Äúabused him‚Äù emotionally when I get upset. Examples include coming home from work and taking my frustrations out on him and being controlling with the house decor (he moved the couch into the kitchen one day and I got upset, he feels he can‚Äôt have any say on any decor or I‚Äôll get mad at him - this isn‚Äôt true, I ask his opinion on anything I purchase and if he doesn‚Äôt like it I don‚Äôt get it. If it was his way we would have nothing in the house). I admit, my tone can be a little rude when I‚Äôm frustrated and he claims I yell at him in these situations (to be fair, we have a different definition of yelling). Once he is upset about something he stonewalls me; he won‚Äôt talk to me for days until he is over it and then we never come back and address the situation. He just wants physical touch to feel better, whereas I need communication to move on (he is aware of this need). 

There is also a very clear imbalance of household duties. I feel very overwhelmed like I am constantly having to clean up after him and I do 90% of the cleaning. I have expressed this to him many many times, it‚Äôs another one of our issues especially the dishes. I have asked to please put dishes in the dishwasher, and he just leaves them in the sink. The first couple of times I ask are in a normal way. Once it hits three, four times I‚Äôm obviously frustrated at this point and my tone will not be pleasant. Come the fourth time I ask, he will get super defensive and jump up from whatever he is doing and say ‚Äúok I‚Äôll do it right now‚Äù and then it becomes a huge fight because I asked at a rude time and am ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù he do it on my terms (even though I preface me asking by saying I‚Äôm not asking for you to do this right now). 

Our most recent fight: he had just helped me with a house project. Afterwards he was making food and I came into the kitchen and once again there was all his dishes in the sink. This annoys me bc not only have I brought it up many many times, but when you put huge pots and pans in the sink now no one else can use it because it‚Äôs full. So I made a comment saying ‚Äúfyi this annoys me‚Äù out loud to let him know hey these are my feelings in this moment. At no point  did I say get up and take care of this right now nor did I say it in a rude way or yell at him. I then move on from the comment and actually put the dishes away myself. I ask him something else bc I have moved on, it was nothing to me but me expressing my frustration to him in the moment. Then moments later now he is upset and there is a clear mood shift. I ask what‚Äôs wrong and he says idk I‚Äôm just upset. I ask specifically if it was bc of my dishes comment and he says he doesn‚Äôt know.

This now escalates into our fight we are currently in. We can‚Äôt seem to communicate effectively. He eventually tells me (the next day) that he felt disrespected by the comment I made. I apologized and said it wasn‚Äôt my intention to be disrespectful (it‚Äôs not even a disrespectful thing to say, IMO it‚Äôs ridiculous to say it was) and I tried to explain im allowed to express my feelings and just bc he felt a certain way about it doesn‚Äôt mean that was my intention. Yet we are a week later and he now refuses to talk to me or interact with me, because every day since then when I try to talk about it it just keeps getting worse with the arguing. 
His thing is that I am ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù in comments I say. We disagree on this so much. I don‚Äôt feel that comment was disrespectful yet I apologized anyways. He also says I‚Äôm a hypocrite when it comes to the dishes. He justifies leaving his multiple dishes out because I will leave my one cup out. I try to explain it‚Äôs not the same thing but it‚Äôs either all or nothing with him. I try to say I‚Äôm not asking for perfection, just for simple help but it‚Äôs like the biggest deal for him. He now wants evidence of everything (so I‚Äôm literally taking pictures of everything he leaves out now just to prove a point). 

He constantly makes me feel like I‚Äôm crazy for saying he does these things like being messy and then calls me a hypocrite when I ask for help with household chores. Another example is I asked him when was the last time he cleaned the restrooms (I had just done it) and his response was ‚Äúwhen was the last time you cleaned the outdoor windows, or fixed the heater?‚Äù I literally died bc those aren‚Äôt the same thing. Those are tasks that need done every couple months whereas there are daily household chores I shouldn‚Äôt have to do alone and I shouldn‚Äôt be punished for asking for help. 

We have gone to therapy, maybe 4 sessions. After the therapist said something he didn‚Äôt agree with, he decided he didn‚Äôt want to go any more. He said as long as the sex life is good (this is another issue we have but have an agreement we are working on) and he isn‚Äôt disrespected then everything will be fine and we can work on things ourselves. I don‚Äôt agree because here we are having the same type of argument. I‚Äôm feeling so discouraged, so trapped and helpless. It‚Äôs either I give up and never say anything and do what he says or I speak up and we keep this pattern. He doesn‚Äôt respect me with the things I ask from him yet I have to never have an opinion or worry about saying something he would perceive as disrespectful then have everything fall apart. 

At this point I don‚Äôt know what to do, I literally beg for therapy because we clearly can‚Äôt talk ourselves and I need to know I‚Äôm not crazy for my point of views. How do we get through this if he won‚Äôt talk to me and won‚Äôt go to therapy?",How can we improve our communication and relationship if my fianc√© refuses to talk to me and won't go to therapy?,"The individual has been engaged to their fianc√© for a couple of months, having been together for 8 years and living together since 2018.

2025-02-27 20:04:14,1izp1dn,A M28 friend who I M29 fell for years ago has just drunkingly admitted to being interested in me?,"TW: mentions of sexuality and sexual themes.

For context i (M29 and him M28) who are bi and have known eachother for almost 10 years. He said a few things to me last night while drunk that don't sit right with me, I believe them to be accidental confessions. Problem is he currently has a gf. I'm really conflicted and confused, I'm aware he is polygamous and he has told me he is able to love multiple people at the same time. I don't know if I'd ever date him if the option were available as I am scared to loose him as a friend.

We met years ago and became close friends, I being a hopeless romantic easily developed feelings for him but I refused to act on it as I didn't want to ruin our friendship. I had the opportunity to pursue but chose against it as I felt there were too many complications at play.

Normally when I develop feelings after a few months of ignoring it, it goes away, problem is mine only got worse. It's been hard but I've done my best not to let my feelings get in the way of our friendship, I've even tried to date other people to move on with my life romantically and to avoid making a mistake and crossing a boundary. I highly respect him and the last thing I would want is to make him uncomfortable due to my feelings.

It's been years, I still feel this way but I'm now used to it, I'm fine with us purely being platonic and not being able to seek more from him. I am happy with this.

Within the past few years though it has slowly become different in our friendship, I know I haven't changed but he has. It started with the little things, the long chats at night about what we like and don't like, people we've dated, life goals ect. At the time I thought nothing of it, just my friend wanting to get to know me on a deeper level which I was more than comfortable with. I'm normally the background friend so it's rare for people to want to actually get to know me.

Then our friendship developed into a ""homiesexual"" dynamic, I found this a little challenging due to how I feel about him but it slowly became normal. Giving eachother stupid pet names like ""kitten whiskers"" and ""pookie"", yes shrek references. I am not very good with recognising when I'm being flirted with so I have no idea if looking back now what % were jokes.

I then ended up dating this guy who turned real abusive, physical and narcissistic levels. We still spoke like homiesexual stuff but then i remember it suddenly coming to a halt and my friend trying to regularly break us up. At the time I was highly confused and took it as a threat but now I understand he was actually trying to support me.

This is relevant as this ex successfully isolated me from my friends, making me a dependant on them. I ended up abandoning my friend as I had this worm of an ex in my ear telling me lies, I went no contact for almost a year.
After ending it with my ex I slowly reconnected with my old friends who happily took me back into the group. They all called me stupid for ignoring the red flags but all in all, have been really supportive of me.

My friend on the other hand, whilst also being supportive, has ramped up on the homiesexuality and deep late night talks. I took this as him wanting to reconnect as friends but last night when we were drinking he said a few things that caught me off guard. Like I said, I struggle socially with recognising when I'm being flirted with, so to pick up on this really says a lot.

We had a talk about how he would ask if I wanted to do him but was scared of the answer he'd get. Me being confused at that both joked about it as well as indirectly asking for clarification incase I mistook it for a bad drunken joke, which happens a lot with us. He never gave me a direct answer and kept skirting my questioning, not giving a yes, maybe or no. I wasn't asking to seek interest but to make sure I wasn't letting my feelings effect our friendship, I didn't want to be that guy who hears what they want to hear and then overstep. He then followed up with saying how he cannot tell what I'm thinking and that I'm a good guy as even tho we talk the way we do he knows I'm not a ""homewrecker"", which is true. He's aware of my opinion that I would never understand why people break up couples to date someone and that im repulsed by cheating. He has regularly said I am a ""good man"", which is now increasing as of late.

The convo ended not long after with him making a joke about how ""we have the type of dynamic that would end in us married in a few years"". Again, we've been drinking all night at this point so I am unsure if what I'm understanding is reality or my mind playing tricks. He said this while looking at me with a soft smile and his pupils fully dilated, he was close to me too but I was able to shrug it off as a joke and escort him to his taxi to send him home.


It made me sick to my stomach for multiple reasons, one especially being that when I returned to the group, he started dating this girl who he is currently in a relationship with. He was talking to her while I was absent so when I returned he was basically in the early stages of dates and that sort of thing. But when I came into the picture he's been wanting to hang out with me more and more.


He's implied to getting into trouble a few times for how much he wants to hangout with me from his gf. At times he is in a call with her while she falls asleep (they are long distance) but then is on a alternate account muted in a call with me while we play games. At first I took this as ""boy shit"" where u do what pleases the gf while getting some fortnite grinds in with the homies, now calling me hes gaming equivalent ""work wife"". These calls started off as group calls where it was a bunch of us from the boys chat playing with him secretly but for the past few months, it's just been me and him. Almost everyday... I didn't really think much of it until last night's comment, a lot of things go over my head easily.

Almost forgot to add so I'll write it here, but years ago he told me that he was bi poly, which is kind of what I am too. Meaning he likes both men and women and is of the dynamic of having a main partner whilst being a ""swinger"". I on the other hand have libido and sexual issues so it's more of if I'm dating someone, I'm their main partner but if they want their needs met then I'd help them find a 3rd safe person to seek it out with. He has made comments in the past about this alignment we have too but I took them as jokes.

So, that's where I'm at now in the timeline of things. Here are my current thoughts.

1 - if he does have feelings for me, as I still do for him, I am unsure if I will still accept any confession if one is made. I'm not kidding when I say I value our friendship, I made that choice years ago. I'm scared, I trust him with my life but idk if I trust him with my heart with what's currently happening.

2 - If I am right and he does have feelings for me, I don't know for how long they have been present. I have a feeling that when I abandoned him that he tried to move on and that's why he started dating this girl. Now that I have returned he's more willing to spend time with me than her from what I've noticed. Which sucks because she seems cool and we clicked but ever since he started hanging out with me more, she's spoken to me less.

3 - I don't even know if I'd want to date him at all. Sure I do love him, that I'll admit anonymously online but I'm aware that we can't control how we feel about people but that we can control our actions. If I dated this man I risk loosing a good friend if it goes wrong, that is my biggest fear. It's why I made my choice to not pursue a relationship years ago.

I don't know what to do, I'm in a weird situation. I cannot talk to anyone in my life about it either so I'm drowning in this issue. I hope I'm just overthinking and bejng stupid about it but there's too many coincidences. I have struggled to sleep all night because of it.",Should I pursue a romantic relationship with my close friend despite being fearful of losing him as a friend?,"The individual is a 29-year-old male who identifies as bisexual. He has known his close friend, a 28-year-old male, for almost 10 years. His family situation is not explicitly discussed, but he has experienced past trauma from an abusive relationship, which led him to become isolated from friends for almost a year. He has described his ex as physically and emotionally abusive, contributing to a dependency on that person. After ending this relationship, he was able to reconnect with his old friends, who have been supportive.

In terms of his work history, there are no direct mentions, but he refers to gaming and spending time with friends online, indicating possible social interactions through gaming platforms. He has struggled with feelings of romance towards his friend while prioritizing their friendship, even refraining from pursuing romantic interest to avoid complications. He describes himself as a ""hopeless romantic"" but ultimately values his friendship highly enough to maintain boundaries.

The context of their relationship includes a dynamic they've developed over the years that has had elements of deep emotional connection and flirtation, which he finds confusing due to his difficulty in recognizing social cues. He has also mentioned his own libido and sexual issues, which may affect his romantic dynamics. The ongoing situation with his friend has heightened his feelings of confusion and concern, particularly considering the friend's current relationship with another woman.",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izp1dn/a_m28_friend_who_i_m29_fell_for_years_ago_has/,relationship_advice
2025-02-27 19:51:57,1izoqpx,My boyfriend (M22) and my best friend (M25) hate each other. Is discussin the situation with my boyfriend the best option? He doesn¬¥t know I know what happened between them.,"Before we started dating, we were friends and took the same classes. One day, we realized we had this friend in common, my best friend, and started talking about it. He kept saying that he liked him a lot, etc. My best friend threw a party in October in his house and we both went (my boyf and I) there, talked for a long time and then I left late at night. Three days later, I ran into my best friend on the street and he told me there was a ""fight"" after I left. He has this other friend (M24) that used to date a girl, but recently they ended it. So to make it short, my boyfriend, in that moment just my friend, being friends with both my best friend and the other guy, kissed the girl at the party. The other guy ended up slapping him multiple times, and for what I know, he even let him because I guess he knew he deserved it (?). So after that, my boyfriend and best friend don¬¥t really get along that much; I mean, he uses to tell me like yeah I really like that guy, etc, and now, every time I tell him I went see him, o we went to the movies or something, he just answers with an ""ah"", or ""ya"". I already talked to my friend to tell him I started seeing this guy, and he said it was okay, it wouldnt ruin our friendship, but that even if the situation wasn¬¥t with him, the other guy is a really close friend of him and of course he will stand for his friends. Now he doesn¬¥t trust the guy that Im dating.  
And my boyfriend doesn¬¥t know that I know all of this happened, because I wasn¬¥t there, there were just like 3 people who saw everything; and I don¬¥t know if I should talk to him about it, or maybe just leave things as they are and pretend I don¬¥t notice he gets kinda weird everytime I mention my friend.","Should I talk to my boyfriend about the fight that happened after the party, or should I just leave things as they are?","The individual in the Reddit post has a background that includes a close friendship with their best friend and a budding romantic relationship with another individual who was previously a friend.

2025-02-27 19:38:11,1izof6c,33F Did I make the right choice dumping my 34M BF that I still love?,"Seeking advice on my current relationship (situationship?). My 34M boyfriend and myself, 33F, have been having relationship difficulties for a while now. I once gave him an ultimatum, and that seemed to shift his feelings for me significantly and for good but he never told me that it hurt him so badly. That was almost 1.5 years ago. We have since purchased a home (he purchased for me and my two kids when we were in need of a new housing situation - he‚Äôs amazing and I love him so much for what he does for us). When he finally did tell me, I apologized and admitted it was not the right way to handle the situation and I wish that I could take it back, but would refrain from ultimatums in the future. He also revealed to me that the way that I talk to him is unkind at times (I grew up in a pretty curt, sarcastic, and unhealthy emotional environment). Again, I apologized and vowed in improvement which I have upheld. I am actually so grateful for the rare times of feedback he has given me, because it makes me a better person and for the first time, I WANT to be a better person for him. I have never felt this way about anyone before. 

After the ultimatum, he pulled back from me significantly. And although it hurt badly I gave it time. Until, I had an incredibly bad feeling in my gut which I also ignored for three weeks - until I stopped one night after he‚Äôd fallen asleep and his phone was next to me. I did not want to look on it, because I knew I was going to find something. Which I did: he had been viewing TONS of FB profiles of girls that have promiscuous profile pictures. He googled a specific girls name, when I asked about that, he lied about it initially and then told me he‚Äôd met a girl at a gas station but he told her he had a GF and she backed off. But then he googled her name later because he was ‚Äúcurious‚Äù because she seemed nice. I asked and if you‚Äôd found her information? He replied he would just keep it in the back of his mind. All of this left me feeling betrayed, ugly, not-enough, etc. I cried and cried and he assured me that I was enough and I was beautiful and that he would stop. Things were rocky for a little while but I tried to move forward and little by little hoped we‚Äôd gain trust and get back to normal. 

For those of you that are going to say it‚Äôs an invasion of privacy, I had never looked at his phone prior to this. And I never did such a thing in any relationship. But I could not ignore my feeling any longer and I have the right to know who I am sleeping next to at night. He follows all sorts of promiscuous girls on all his social media accounts and I never said anything because it was all pre-relationship adds but after this I asked him to please tailor who he follows and that I wanted to be in a relationship status on FB if that is what he was going to utilize as a way to find women. He refused, said he didn‚Äôt care about FB. That went on for months - and in my mind it just indicated that he was not willing to a.commit to me and b.do something out of his norm to make me feel better about something so we could move forward - which is what you do in love - compromise. He eventually did this.

Finally, stabilization came and I was finally feeling better. Until he fell asleep watching YouTube on his phone and it was left open. The video he was watching was normal but I could see a half naked girl behind that video. So I looked at his YouTube history, and lo and behold he‚Äôd been watching all of these girls videos of her driving her car around half naked flipping her hair pretending to be a mechanic (he‚Äôs a mechanic). He tried to play it off like her dad‚Äôs a mechanic and that‚Äôs why (her dad is not in any of the videos he watched). I asked him why he doesn‚Äôt respect me or my love? I had POURED love into him, compensating for his lack of effort, trying so hard to make him love me the way I need and prove myself worthy of that love. It killed me to pour love into someone when my own heart was still in shambles - but he refused to pour back. He often told me that my emotions are not reality and that I want there to be a problem and what he did wasn‚Äôt THAT bad. Ok, I tried to forgive again but this time I told him that if I see one more slut on his phone, I‚Äôm all done. He then promises me he‚Äôs good to go, he doesn‚Äôt want anyone else, and then he actually starts putting effort in. We start rekindling - I am happy.

Until this past weekend, when he was scrolling through his email and scrolled quickly passed an open one that was from Reddit and all I could quickly read was 20F. So I typed in 20F in my Reddit.. and well I didn‚Äôt like what I found. Before I jumped to conclusions through, I went through his email to make sure because I didn‚Äôt want to mess this up if it was nothing and he was being faithful. But unfortunately, he opened every single email sent to him that was labeled with female in the title. Basically girls taking sensual selfies to be rated. Just a different way to get his fix I guess that would maybe be permitted by me because there are males on there too (not that he looked at one male). He said it‚Äôs natural to look at other people. Now, I‚Äôm a scientific person. I am FULLY aware of our animal like tendencies and would completely understand a quick in person thought of attraction with someone around. And then you move along because you are committed and have self-discipline. Constantly searching for females online while lying about it doesn‚Äôt seem too natural to me. 

When confronted - he blames me. Says that I still do things that hurt him (the things from above). I said, I know I‚Äôve gotten significantly better though and he agreed. But it still hurts and it triggers something inside of him causing him to browse. I said I do not accept that answer. I have worked on myself and I am not perfect, if I relapse then call me out and I will fix it for you. But holding it in, brewing resentment toward me that causes you to emotionally cheat on me, and then blaming me without EVER giving me an opportunity to be better is just fucked up and not something I can work with. I feel like he needs to take accountability for his short comings and make changes if he loves me the way he claims. Mind you he doesn‚Äôt claim much just says he loves me. He doesn‚Äôt believe in marriage but he maybe would get married one day if it meant that much to me. He doesn‚Äôt bring home flowers or tell me I‚Äôm beautiful, etc. I told him I‚Äôm never going to be able to be the woman that you want me to be, and the woman I want me to be, until you decide to put effort into strengthening our relationship instead of deflecting and remaining defensive. 

I subsequently told him that I can no longer be with him - that I want to, but I cannot like this any longer. I will not wait another two years like this, just to be told you found someone new. I have kids I need to provide a comfortable home to. 

I am doing zero communication because I am always the one that reaches out for repair - but I am emotionally drained and all done reaching, chasing. I do hope he decides to change and take action and tell me that he can‚Äôt live without me but I‚Äôm not sure he will be willing to get out of his comfort zone of avoidance and ego. 

My question is: did I do the right thing? It feels like it is for our situation but I HATE it. My heart aches so badly for him, us, our home, our future. But it can‚Äôt continue to be one sided, right?

2025-02-27 19:37:53,1izoexm,"My girlfriend (20F) just left me (20M), what can I do?","My girlfriend broke up with me this morning. It was my fault. I lied, some number texted me and I didn't know who it was, I had just gotten a new number and it was someone texting some vulgar stuff while I was sleeping. The night before, the number texted ""Hey *my name* can we talk? That was the only thing in the conversation thread. Didn't know who it was, thought maybe it was a friend who just got my number from another. And I said ""im busy, goodnight"". I didn't know who it was at the time, and when I woke up, all those texts were sent after the person said they were drunk. My girlfriend asked me if I knew who it was, I said no, and she asked to see the full convo. I freaked out and I made the mistake of deleting the message where she said my name. I manipulated it to look like she didn't know me. I texted her and we found out who it was, and it was an ex partner of over a year ago. I had her tell my girlfriend the last time before last night I ever said a word to her was back in may, which is way before me and my girlfriend got together.  The ex had gotten my number from a friend whom im not really that close with. I know I didn't do anything wrong from replying and that's not what she was upset about, she was upset that I lied. I messed up bad and now she has left me. Reasonably so. I feel horrible for it. I told her I lied because I didn't want her to think I was cheating on her. I let her read the entire conversation, top to bottom, with the old message recovered  but the damage was already done. She told me she didn't give a fuck anymore, wanted me gone, and I get it.

2025-02-27 19:26:27,1izo51p,my (32 f. )brother(33 m) is trying to get me fired.,"this is going to be long. so i need advice. my brother and i work at the same place. last year i got laid off. when i told my father, hoping he knew of any places that were hiring, he suggested i look into look into applying at the same place my brother works. the problem was my brother and i aren't on good terms.

long story short he walked into my home and got into a fist fight with my husband. he was drunk and feeling agressive that day. i refused to speak to him until he game my husband and i a sincere apology. instead he gave a half-assed apology and went crying to everyone about how mean i am for not speaking to him.

that was about 4 years ago, so i was hesitant to work there. but my brother was really good about helping me apply and recommending me. i was grateful and thanked him profusely for the help. i had been out of work for over a month at that point. (doing door dash but i needed a more solid means of supporting my family). the problem started when he said that my getting the job should mean i forgive him. maybe this makes me a bad person but i don't forgive him. what he did was so wildly out of line that i refuse to just let it go. he started a stupid fight with my husband five feet away from my new born son's crib, and refused to leave when asked.

one thing they emphasized when i started was that anyone who gets into any kind of altercation, verbal or otherwise, at work will instantly be fired, both parties. so i've been trying really hard to ignore him. since that conversation he's been trying to get me to talk to him at work. iv'e been ignoring him. sometimes he'll curse me out, sometimes he'll laugh and try to goad me into a fight. that was working for while, due to our shifts being so far apart. then our dad died. i told myself that for the funeral would put aside any issues and just try to be there for my family. and for the mostly part that worked. we managed to get through most of that awful day without bringing any of our issues with each other into it. after the funeral we all went back to our step mother's house. we were all doing our own thing mostly, but still talking to each other. my brother said something. i assumed to me, but i couldn't hear because he was in another room, so i asked him to say it again. he just looked at me. so i just turned away. my step brother said"" you've been complaining for months that she doesn't talk to you, and now she's trying to talk to you, whats the problem?"" he just kept looking at me with this look of hate. here i just want to say it was clear he had been drinking, before we even went to the funeral it was clear he had been drinking. nobody said anything, i mean i understood, if i hadn't been driving i would have too. my step brother kept talking to him, he said"" she could have ignored you, she's trying to talk to you."" maybe i should have just walked away but i didn't. i said "" yeai could have called you an asshole but i didn't."" that's on me. i know i should have just walked away . but honestly i was sick of his shit. and i was pissed he was starting shit the day our dad died. he got mad, obviously, and starting trying to come towards ,me. my step brother held him back. i grabbed my stuff and left. before i got in the car he tried to talk to me, with this big dumb smile on his face. but i just left. 

after that i just tried harder to avoid him.he texted me a few weeks later demanding i drop everything and go with him and our sister to sort out my dads storage. i actually have that conversation because it was over text.

brother: Aye wyd tomorrow... Needa go see \[step mom\] make sure everything going well tho Ima be expecting u. (he was talking about our dad's storage)

me: what time?

brother:Don't matter just show up... uknw yo grandparents waiting

me:Dude if you want me to come you have to give me a time. I‚Äôm a wife and a mother. I can‚Äôt just drop everything I‚Äôm doing on a moments notice.

brother:We all know \[step mom\] will take 4ever 2get ready... jus show up please

me:give me a time

brother:That's very sad my ngga... fuk u, show up or don't idgaf

me:Fuck you too. I still need a time.

brother:Na fuk that u had time, tf u been at... show tf up & make sure yo sister do 2, I need the help applying pressure 2make sure my dad's wife put my father 2rest respectfully

me: I need to know WHEN to show up. If you can‚Äôt give me a time then go by yourself.

I‚Äôm getting really sick of the way you talk to me. How you gonna ask me to do something and in the same text tell me to fuck myself. You need to learn how to speak to people. Try pulling your head out of your ass.

brother:My ngga jus show up & make sure everything is set up 4 ur father

this is how most of our conversations go, over text and in person. im jus tired of it. after this i blocked him. recently though my schedule was changed and now our shifts overlap by an hour. and he uses that hour to harass me. for example:

* screaming at me from his car in front of everyone. threatening me with HR if when i flipped him off. 
* coming up to me when i was sitting in my car and cursing me out
* coming up to me in the meeting room and trying to provoke me, and then hinting that their were cameras when i even so much as looked at him. obviously trying to provoke me so i get fired 
* when he sees me walking toward him backing up like im the one trying to fight. 
* telling coworkers he has no idea why i wont talk to him. but he's so sad i won't
* knocking on the meeting room windows when im in there to get my attention.

see at work i keep pretty much to myself and don't interact much with my coworkers. and my job is the type where i work in my area and don't interact much with other people. its kind of like an assembly line, but each station is a massive machine run by one person. so theres not much opportunity for conversation outside breaks and the meeting at the start of our shifts. and because i avoid him like the plague most people didn't know he was my brother. but since my shift change he's gone out of his way to harass me in front of others. my coworkers we concerned at first, because it was so obvious he was trying to start a fight, until i explained he was my brother. since he's been whining to our coworkers about my not talking to him i've been trying to set the record staright. but the whole thing i wearing on me. every time he does something publicly i can hear people whisper ing about us and talking about it. i hate bringing this drama to my job. i'm stressed because i'm worried i'll get fired. i just dont know what to do. i'm afraid if i go to HR they'll just fire me. our job is union and i'm worried theyll fire me before they try to do anything about him.

2025-02-27 19:21:09,1izo0l4,Why I can't just let go my toxic relationship ? 22F and 21F 1year and a half long relationship," 


When we met, I was with my ex, and at first, I didn't like her and found her quite clingy. Even though I was in a relationship, she still tried to make a move on me.
Then I distanced myself from her because she sent me a long message telling me I should leave my girlfriend, with whom I was having problems and confiding in her about them. In the same message, she admitted that she liked me. I got really angry because we had only known each other for a short time, and the message felt very attacking.
After breaking up with my ex, I went on a date with a guy, but literally, nothing happened between us. A few months later, we started hanging out with other friends, and honestly, I fell in love with her. After a few months, I confessed my feelings, and we got together.
At first, it was truly amazing. I felt so happy with her and thought I had found the love of my life.
After a month, problems started. She began suffering from anxiety and told me that I was the cause of her distress because I had told her about having an ovarian cyst. That same day, I had gone to her university apartment and skipped a class because she was feeling very anxious. There, she told me I was the reason for her anxiety.
We went to catch the bus, and I lost my ticket. She took the bus anyway and left me alone in a city far from home.
From there, things got worse. She started criticizing me for being careless and inattentive, saying really hurtful things. A few months later, she started breaking up with me once a week‚Äîliterally.
One time, she broke up with me because I bought roasted potatoes instead of something else to go with gyoza. She called me too stupid.
This pattern continued for a long time. She humiliated me in front of her relatives, whom I didn‚Äôt even know, or yelled at me in a public square, saying horrible things about me.
She got angry at my grandfather's funeral because I went to greet some close friends who had come to surprise me. She said I neglected her because I walked away for five minutes. She spent the rest of the funeral sulking.
We were constantly breaking up and getting back together. For a year, I haven't gone a single day without an argument. She hits all my weak spots, tells me I'm weird and alone.

In November, she ignored me for 24 hours and then told me she felt much better without me. I had decided to leave her, and I was starting to feel better.
Then she started begging me to take her back, saying I was her life, that she couldn't imagine life without me, and that she would love me forever.
We got back together. She promised she had changed, but soon after, she twisted everything again, blaming me for everything, saying she was only reacting to me.
I won‚Äôt deny that, after all the resentment I had built up, I started treating her badly too. I answered her harshly. I feel like I‚Äôve changed for the worse, like I have no light left in me.
One day, I checked her phone because she told me, after a long time, that before we were together, she had slept with a coworker for two nights. However, this was someone she always spoke badly about. I found messages I wish I had never seen because she had told me she was just using that person to desperately try having sex.
She found out I checked her phone and, for the first time, she hit me‚Äîpunching me and pushing me.
I now know that was wrong, and I know I‚Äôve made mistakes, but I think everything was a consequence of how I‚Äôve been treated all this time‚Ä¶
Anyway, we broke up again. She blocked me everywhere, and this time, I was truly devastated‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt even eat.
We got back together.
Before our last breakup, she wished cancer upon my bunny, whom I deeply care about. Shortly after, my bunny started having serious health issues, and I had to take care of her 24/7. Instead of being there for me, she told me I was neglecting her and that I cared more about a rabbit than about her. She was jealous because I got this rabbit when I was with my ex, so she hated her.
One time, after a fight, she brought back all the gifts I had given her, completely destroyed‚Äîplush toys with their heads ripped off.
Despite all this, while I was already anxious and worried about my bunny, instead of supporting me, she checked my phone and read my chat with my best friend. In it, I had confided in my friend after our last breakup, and my friend told me I should leave her because she had mental health issues.

She forced me to send my best friend a message to cut her off, and she still keeps pressuring me to stay away from her forever.

I no longer know if I‚Äôm really the problem, as she says. Most of all, I just can‚Äôt seem to leave her.

2025-02-27 19:19:00,1iznyqy,Why does my partner (24F) keep escalating fights? What can I do (27M) to minimize this?,"I‚Äôve been with this person for a little over two years now. But things have started to get a little petty since we started doing long distance (almost a year ago now). It seems like every time we get into a disagreement my partner connects something small with something big which leads to a massive fight. 

An example is during Valentine‚Äôs Day weekend I flew to see her and spend time with her. I flew right after working a full day, spent over 5 hours traveling (getting to the airport, flying, and getting to her from the airport) all without getting a meal in the whole day. When I landed, she called excited to see me wondering how long I had been waiting for my bus. I was understandably tired and hungry so my response was, ‚Äúlike 30 mins.‚Äù She then proceeded to fact check me stating that my flight had landed 36 mins ago so how could I have waited 30 mins. My response was that I was tired which led to the exaggeration and that it was closer to 15 mins but waiting out in the cold made it feel like 30. She then proceeded to escalate the fight by calling me a liar and using this exaggeration to justify that since I could ‚Äúlie‚Äù about 15 mins maybe I could be lying about my feeling a for her. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond to that as I didn‚Äôt know how she could get from point A to point W with nothing connecting the two. Especially when I had just spent a full day of travel and nearly a month of rent money to see her. 

Almost all of our fights end up this way. Something small and insignificant leads to a massive argument that could take days of space to mend. How do I fix this? Is it even fixable? I really do like this girl but I can‚Äôt help but feeling she‚Äôs trying to find an excuse to leave the relationship.

2025-02-27 19:15:09,1iznvi1,Difficulties between me (19F) and my boyfriend (19M),"Me (19F) and my boyfriend (19M) have been together around a year now. We were previously in the same friend group for a year, then the group split up. One year after that we got close again. We have now been living together 3 months (yea I know, it‚Äôs really stupid to move in after such a short time) and our different personalities clash. Most of the time we can come up with solutions for our problems. For example, we used to prepare breakfast for each other. However, he is not a morning person so I had to wake him up and basically kick him out of the bed. Our solution: I cook breakfast, he fixes evening snack. 

However, whilst I am from a family where we rarely expresses our feelings by words or physical touch, he does. I prefer to do stuff for people instead. He is always close to crying och being upset whilst I handle things in my own which is what I have been taught. Even though we are different I try to not hurt his feelings; I do care a lot about him and I treat him the way he treats me (words of affection and cuddles) when he is upset. I, as the youngest child with bigger sibling who teased me (as most siblings do), does rarely take things to heart. I therefore start to feel indifferent and annoyed because I have to walk on eggshells around him simply because he can become upset by small things multiple times a day. 

I feel as if my feelings towards him becomes cold simply because I have to act as a mother who has to tell him to clean, help him look and apply for work, check up on his e-mails because otherwise he misses very important ones. And on top of that I have to pause my life, which is a quite stressful one, to console him. 

I would just like to point out that he has had a somewhat difficult life (not awful, it just could have been better) and I do feel that he should talk and cry about it if needed. He does not however need to cry or be upset when I come home tired from university and has to cook food for the evening and he feels as if I‚Äôm not as ‚Äúexcited or happy‚Äù as I should be just because he is.

2025-02-27 19:12:06,1iznswl,How to detach and breakup with my (25F) partner (25M),"I know this is a long post but I really wanted to vent it out - 

I am dating my partner for roughly 2 years now. It was initially very good for the first 3-4 months, but slowly I just started realising that he is not the person he showed to be, when I fell for him. I have also become super anxious in the past one year and I think this relationship is a big reason for it.

I have to constantly beg for his emotional availability. But I am always there for him when he needs me. I have continuously fought with him for the same and tried to convey that he treats me like shit - for example - I literally have to beg him to talk to me at least once in a day, if I call him out for being an ass to me - he just says that talking on phone call is not his thing and he cannot talk so much like everyday.
He would literally treat me like a carpet when he is busy, has any interviews or is out with his friends too. He treats me like I don‚Äôt exist. And the bad part is, i feel that he does not even get bothered that i would be hurt or I would be crying.

He ruined my promotion day at work by not calling me, i was waiting for him to call me in the night so i could tell him and he would be so proud of me, but he didn‚Äôt. When I called him out, he again angrily put the blame on me and we cut the call.

Yesterday again we had a fight. I had a very bad day at work. When he called I didn‚Äôt see it but i called him back few mins. I really wanted to talk because I had a bad day. My eyes were closing out of sleep and tiredness.
Within those 10 mins, he had already made a plan to go out with a friend, and when I called he told me that X (his friend) is coming to pick him. i asked him to ask X to leave in like 10 mins. So that I can talk to him for 10 mins.
Turns out X had already left. He didn‚Äôt even care to ask him to wait for barely 5-10 mins so that we could talk. Instead he just left and said he will call me when he is back.
I was so sleepy but then I again got so much hurt I couldn‚Äôt sleep and I yelled at him later in the night for behaving like a piece of shit every time I need him.

Then he calls me super late - and what he wants to talk about is something that happened with his stupid work assignment and how he fucked up. I felt like I am just used as a dumping bag for all his stress. I immediately asked him to drop off because i had to sleep.

These things happen very regularly. I feel so alone whenever there is anything important happening in my life. I want him to be there for me. I literally spend my nights crying and hurting. I hate myself for being attached to him. For him, his things are always more important than mine.
 
I don‚Äôt know I just feel that we are not compatible, but i have tried to accept this so many times but somehow I am not able to, i am so attached to him. But I also know I don‚Äôt want to spend the rest of my life crying after someone who does not even care about me. It is like my head knows what is the right thing to do, but my heart is too weak.

How do I practice detachment? How do I end this relationship? I really want to because I know this is not good for me. Please give suggestions.

I just feel that going no contact immediately and breaking up will hurt me too much, I just want to detach myself and then get out of this. I want to focus more on myself and my career and my friends and my family, who actually give a damn about me.

I (F31) have been with my partner (M32) for 8 years, of engaged for six months. We‚Äôre due to marry summer of 2026.

We have a fantastic relationship in every way and I have zero complaints. I‚Äôm very much in love.

A few months ago, another team at work got a new manager (M, ?late 30‚Äôs?),. I‚Äôd had few dealing with him, but I had seen him around. He is quite handsome, but I never though much about it as I‚Äôm happily in a relationship.

Last month though, I had to ask his team for assistance. He was kind, helpful, funny, reassuring, and generally a good guy. But again I never though much about it.

Since then, we seem to end up interacting once or twice a week, just for a few minutes, as we‚Äôre both busy. We typically end up chatting a little. He‚Äôs charming, charismatic, and funny. Every time I end up smiling and laughing so much that my face hurts.

Now, I find myself daydreaming about life with him, rather than with my partner. I catch myself stealing glances at him when he‚Äôs passing my desk.

I‚Äôve never experience this since I got together with my partner. I‚Äôm hoping this is just a silly crush that will pass. I don‚Äôt even know if he‚Äôs single!

2025-02-27 19:05:47,1iznndp,just found out my m30 boyfriend cheated on me f26,"so basically as the title says. i'm t a total loss and i don't know what to do. we have been together for about 6 years and our relationship is great, we were planning on getting engaged soon. we were long distance for a very long time and could only see each other about twice a year, but we've since closed the distance and have been living together for about a year which has been amazing. 

today i randomly saw a text on his phone from a girl i didn't recognise and immediately got a bad feeling. the text was fairly innocent but my intuition just told me something was wrong so i confronted him. eventually he confessed.

he had a one night stand with said girl over a year ago before we closed the distance. apparently she was in town and reached out to him to meet up again but he had turned her down. he admitted it was all his fault and he made an honest mistake, he said they met at a bar when he was on vacation, she came onto him pretty strongly, he was very drunk and one thing just led to another, but according to him he felt extremely guilty after and didn't keep in touch with her until she randomly reached out a couple of days ago. 

he is telling me he takes full responsibility and completely respects every decision i will make now. but im at such a loss. i always thought girls who forgive their bfs for cheating are losers but now im not so sure. he has promised me that if i can forgive him, he will do anything to earn back my trust and he still intends to marry me. 

would i be dumb to forgive him? i feel like if i break up with him over what might have really been a one-time mistake while we were long distance i would possibly throw away a good future with a good man. on the other hand im worried if i take him back he'll cheat on me again or even if not i just won't have the same trust i had. but i genuinely love him, and i do think he loves me, however this is a huge breach of trust.

has anyone been in a similar situation? please give me some compassion, i know there'll be a lot of ""just dump him"" comments, which would've been me if i was reading this post too, but now that im in the situation i really don't know.","Should I forgive my boyfriend for a past one-night stand and risk my trust, or break up with him and potentially lose our future together?","The individual in crisis has been in a long-term relationship for about six years, which was initially long-distance, allowing them to see each other only about twice a year.

Hello, me ‚Äú23-F‚Äù and my boyfriend ‚Äú23-M‚Äù have been in a long distance relationship for 3 years. Recently we got into an argument that wasn‚Äôt serious but I did yell out of anger which I apologized for but I was upset that he could not remember that I received this certification for this program. And before asking me about it, he decided to repeatedly ask me questions if I knew this girl that was dating his best-friend cousin.

But it‚Äôs like we are already long distance and don‚Äôt talk throughout the day to each other let alone see each other as much.

2025-02-27 19:03:57,1iznlru,My wife (27F) broke up with me (30M) and now wants to get back together?,"Relationship of 4 years, 1 year married, immigrated to Europe, wanting to start a new life. We had a lot of fights and disrispects, but the last couple of months it was unbearable, the amount of impatience, arguments and lack of empathy towards each other. Last big fight she told me she regreted she married me for not folding her clothes, so I mentioned ''x would't have told me this over that'' (refering to a girl she was jealous previously, I know, it was mean, but at that moment I thought we would end it). 

3 months after that, she went on a trip to other country by herself for a week with a friend group she met on facebook and the last day before coming to me, she confessed she downloaded bumble (she had bumble bff to meet friends) and met a guy, with whom she had a ''date'' and later on slept in his appartment he shares with a friend, she went to stay the night to save a hotel night as she didn't have any more money. 

She tells me she didn't do anything, not even a kiss, but she slept in the same bed as him, giving their backs at each other. 

After she came back from the trip, she told me about this guy and we were breaking up, and was going to try to get to know better this guy and 1 month later, went back to that country through workaway. 

According to her, she felt guilty as she landed and never met in person again since, she still wanted to have the chance to get back together but wasn't sure, as she felt too much disrespect by me and had resentment accumulated throughout the relationship. They texted but nothing too compromising according to her. 

2 months after being in that country, she asks me if we could get back together to try and have a healthy relationship/marriage, that she made a terrible mistake and didn't want to get a divorce. 

She also texted with other guys, wanting to have ''options'' i guess, which is understandable being ''single''. Told me it was to replace the feeling of attention and being wanted as we were not going to come back. 

  
As of now we are trying to reconcile but I don't know if it's the right choice.

  
I feel pretty insecure and betrayed at how fast she wanted to move on, mostly because of being married, even though she came and was upfront about wanting to breakup and her intentions of moving on, but I love her still. 



TLDR: Wife after breakup went to a trip to another country, met a guy through dating app, after coming back broke with me and went back to said country. 3 months later regrets it and wants to come back.

Have any of you experienced something similar and, in that case, what did you do?

2025-02-27 19:00:00,1izni0w,"My (M35) girlfriend (F40) said she needs time because i got high, is it over and how much have i messed up?","I've been in a committed relationship for three years with my girlfriend (F40), who has two kids from a previous marriage. Me(35M), have a steady job with good pay, work out regularly. However, I do have an addiction to leafy greens, which I‚Äôm actively working on and mental health issues that I still need officially diagnosed.

At the start, I was her lover while she was still married. I knew her marriage was toxic, which made it easier for me to pursue her without feeling guilty. After her divorce was finalized, we went steady, but we kept the relationship low-key for the first two years to avoid confusing her kids. I wanted to be considerate since I come from a broken family myself. During this time, I took her on vacations, paid for many things, and bought nice presents for her and the children.

When we started dating, I was straight edge and had managed to control my addiction for a long time, but it resurfaced with occasional binges. Although I fell off the wagon a couple of times, I always bounced back with work or fitness goals. She initially didn‚Äôt mind me smoking, when we were in the low-key phase of our relationship but after a couple of recent binges, she gave me an ultimatum. I acknowledged this was draining for her, but assured her I was working on it.

The house situation became significant when she received a house as part of her divorce settlement. We didn't move in together right away because the house needed renovations. I  contributed financially to the renovations to help her make ends meet, occassionally helping with house chores and little things. However, because I needed a home office, I continued renting my flat and kept my work separate. Few parts of the house‚Äîthe bedroom and second bathroom‚Äîwere not finished, so when I stayed over, we slept on the couch.

She wanted everything completed ASAP, and although I helped with what I could, I didn‚Äôt take on the responsibility of providing for a house I didn‚Äôt live in yet. I reassured her that I was in it for the long run, but had my own career and living situation to maintain. And that renovating a house will take time and a lot of resources. So she needs to think realistically and realize that it will be a difficult time if we are going to move in together in the future. Despite this, I could sense her dissatisfaction growing with our relationship, which I think was linked to the unfinished house.

Over the past couple of months, I tried suggesting ways to spend more time together in the house like me moving my home office into a free corner of the house, she shut that down, because when her ex-husband had home office, her and the kids were barred from ever interrupting him. Which I didn't feel was a fair comparison as I enjoyed her presence.

I felt her becoming distant, and last weekend, I had a smoke-binge after a month-long break. I spent time with a friend, binge-watching Netflix and taking some ‚Äúme‚Äù time while she was at her friends party. I still had a bit of weed left on monday so after work I got high and visited her in the evening, even though I knew she hated it, but I would still rather spend time with her doing nothing or having a movie night just to be in her presence. I could sense her coldness, and after she saw me high, she became visibly upset. We didn‚Äôt kiss goodnight, and the following morning she didn‚Äôt speak to me much. When I asked if I should come by tomorrow or pick up my things, she said she needed time.

Last month she was grieving her stepdads passing, which I was emotionally unequipped to handle as I haven't lost somebody so close to me. So the best thing I came up with was to try and play a game to take her mind of things(I am still very geeky).

I have struggled with severe seasonal depression during the most of fall/winter, when i spiraled. Because I was still recovering from an injury and could not work out and left me unable to drive. Which contributed to me being moody and overbearing, oversharing my feelings with her. I think she now sees me as less of a man because I haven‚Äôt been able to provide what she needs, didn't keep my addiction and emotions in check. She even said it felt like she was taking care of another child, me not being a proper partner and accused me that I didn't really want to move in with her and only wanting her for sex. I assured her that if I only wanted sex, I wouldn‚Äôt be in a long-term relationship with her and always recognized that her kids have to come first, nonetheless I loved her and her kids and took it as part of the deal.

While I know my addiction and mental health struggles are my responsibility, I feel like I‚Äôve been more than just a typical boyfriend to her, especially with the kids, supporting her independence and contributing financially to the renovations. I‚Äôve been trusting and respectful of her need for time away and never questioned her when she had occassional night outs with her friends as I realize how rare free time is for a mom of two.

On Sunday, I‚Äôm meeting her to talk about our relationship. I sense that a breakup is imminent, and my heart aches as I process this. I also feel betrayed‚Äîif she‚Äôs been feeling like this for some time, why didn‚Äôt she bring it up sooner instead of stringing me along and took me being high on the last occassion as a breaking point for our relationship? I know I have crossed a previously set boundary, so this part is on me. But to try and throwaway a 3 year relationship because of it and after all I have done for her.

I feel like the relationship was strong when everything was going well, we were a friends with benefits situation and I was happily spoiling her, but when things got serious and tough and I became vulnerable and weak with, but even when I stood my ground on some decisions in our relationship, it seemed like she started distancing herself. 

  
I believe that we both need to humble ourselves in order for our relationship to have a chance,   
but also feel that unless I become Bob the builder, finish the house for her and be there for the chores I will not be appreciated and respected no more.

I think I just needed to vent but I welcome any opinions about our situation you might have.   
Will post an update next week.",How can I approach the conversation with my girlfriend about our relationship when I feel a breakup is imminent?,"The individual posting is a 35-year-old male who has been in a committed relationship for three years with a 40-year-old female partner who has two children from a previous marriage.

2025-02-27 18:59:45,1iznhsa,Is something off with my ( F21) neighbor ( M50's) ?,"Hello,   


I am a young woman in my 20's and three weeks ago, I moved into my own apartment for the first time. Everything was really good, I really love it and I'm close to work. The neighborhood is quiet, the other residents seem friendly, and my apartment, though a little cramped, is bright and welcoming. But there's something that's been bothering me for the past few days... my upstairs neighbor.  
I first met him few days after i moved in. He said hello to me. he was in the lobby getting ready to leave. 

He asked me if I was ‚Äúthe new girl on the ground floor‚Äù. i said yes. He welcomed me and that was it. I didn't try to make conversation as I'm rather a loner.  


A few days later, I had lunch at my sister's so I went out and there he was, looking through his letterbox. We said hello again, this time he struck up a conversation and asked me what I did for a living, he asked me if it was hard being a student and then he congratulated me. I thanked him and  I left.   


The next day, I was leaving for college (it must have been 7:30 a.m.). He was still in the in the entrance. He said : ""You work hard, that's good, but you should take care of yourself"". I thought it was weird, but I thought he was just trying to be nice.   


A few days passed, it was Friday night. There was a knock at my door, it was him. He had a zucchini gratin. I didn't dare refuse so I took it but honestly it made me feel uncomfortable. i don't know why, just something feels off.   


Another day, he asked me about my love life, if i had someone at the moment. when i told him no, he smiled and said: 'that's good, you have time.' i found it weird, but i didn't know what to say. the problem was that it was a weird smile. i don't know how to describe it.   
Other times he comments on the way I dress (like ""I really like those pants on you"").  
it's later that it gets really weird. i was at a restaurant with a friend and he was there, eating at the restaurant alone. he was positioned so that i could see him he didn't seem to be looking at me but i don't know, it creeped me out.

Thanks for reading.

But basically he didn't do anything wrong, i mean everything he did was legal. i don't know if i'm the paranoid one or if he's the one with a problem. i posted this here to get opinions on my situation. you think i'm too paranoid?",Do you think I'm too paranoid about my upstairs neighbor's behavior?,"The individual in the Reddit post is a young woman in her 20s who recently moved into her own apartment for the first time.

2025-02-27 18:56:23,1iznevi,My 21F boyfriend 21M lied to me about quitting nicotine. How can I help him?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and a half. In this time he has been consistently doing ZYNS. I didn't have a huge issue with nicotine, I occasionally smoke a cigarette and we used to smoke weed (it's legal in our state) but for the last 6 months I have been sober from all substances.  He has been ramping up in the department of drugs and alcohol a LOT. It started when we were long distance and I noticed a lot more drinking and a considerably more Zyn intake. He would drink 3-4 beers each night and started putting bourbon in his coffee each morning, which has continued to before classes now. It got to the point where I reached out to a trusted friend of his, and they had a conversation to make sure he was okay.  This was around November.

On to the issues now. I made it clear I wanted him to quit a vice. I struggle with my own issues of hurting myself and have come a long way with his help, so I wanted to try and do the same for him. I asked him to quit his ZYN habit. He has an addictive personality, and I figured the extra money from no longer buying two packs a week would be a good addition. He told me he quit. I helped him through awful withdrawals, he yelled at me and cried in my arms, and we had a solution. Used the same flavor gum to get the 'Mouth feeling' he was missing, and I had to babysit him to make sure he wouldn't go to the gas station to buy more. It's been about 3 weeks since that point and today I found his stash, ON HIS PERSON. He had these for over a week, and in this time we had talked, and I told him so many times how proud I was of him. I know that if he told me the day he bought them it would have been ok, but the lying is what makes it so bad. 

I don't know how to help him, or even if I can. I want to marry this man and I just want to support him through this addiction. Because that is absolutely what it is, he even calls himself an addict. I have had friends quit vaping, but never ZYN, so if anyone has any tips to give him or how I can support him, please let me know.

How can I support him through this?",How can I support my boyfriend through his nicotine addiction after he lied to me about quitting?,"The individual in crisis has been in a relationship with their boyfriend for almost a year and a half.

When I say money stuff (Thats her term she uses) but its in reference to some home reno debt we have, big bills I get it. These were necessary expenses as we bought an older house. These things will probably take years to pay off although I'm trying to expedite it as much as possible. Well I don't think intimacy is the only important thing in a relationship I do think of it as a key part and I like to think I am a good partner to her buying her flowers, going on dates etc. Anytime I try to bring it up it just results in a very defensive ""Im stressed about money stuff"" and like I said I get it and I'm trying to be understanding but this has been the reason for 12ish months now we aren't any worse off then when it started I have actually received several promotions at my job and used my contacts to help get her out of her entry level job and into a career that she got a degree for. If anything  we are far better off. 

It probably sounds stupid but I just want to feel wanted and im trying to be patient but I dont know that I can wait years for these renos to be paid off to see things get back to normal. She comes from a well off family and well I wouldn't call her spoiled by any means I do think this is the first time she has had to deal with any financial adversity without that support where I am somewhat used to it coming from a lower middle class family and working my ass off to be, what I consider to be pretty successful.

The first time was 7 months into our relationship he made out with a girl he knew that used to bar tend at this bar by his apartment. He was very drunk and on a bachelor party in New Orleans. He initiated this and said he was immature and unsure of our relationship at the time. We also were fighting at this time and it was a bad fight about him not leaving me a key to his apartment so I could go out for a friend‚Äôs going away party and not have to order an expensive uber. I almost broke up with him over this fight because I felt he was not taking me serious enough but we talked when he got back from his trip and he agreed he will give me keys in the future and apologized so we moved on. The other time he cheated was a year ago and he fully had sex with a girl that moved away but used to be a very close friend of his. He never was attracted to her or hooked up with her when they were both single. She was also in a relationship at the time that they had sex. They were both very drunk and he had just moved his dad close to a hospital out of state for cancer treatment. He said he was not in a good place mentally dealing with his father‚Äôs health and she initiated it and he had instant regret. He told me all of this because he wants a future with me now and he was unsure of that before but him keeping these secrets from me was preventing him from progressing our relationship. He did not prioritize me much in the beginning of our relationship, drinking and his not great quality friendships came before me and I voiced this to him. He would communicate with me and work through my concerns so I never saw anything like this coming. I have never felt so secure before in a relationship so I am so blind sided. I never believed people could truly be blind sided like this until it has happened to me. He said he will pay for counseling for us to work though this and he will communicate more to me about his feelings in the relationship which I tried to do a lot over the years but I just got short responses of ‚ÄúI like where things are now, I want to make sure I do not repeat the type of relationship that my parents have so I move slower‚Äù. I always thought this response meant he needs therapy for moving past his childhood trauma as it did impact his view on relationships. He is willing to work through this as well in therapy. I want to know if anyone has any advice or has been in this situation before. If you stayed, how did your relationship work out? Did they cheat again, lie, do you have regrets about staying? Or did you feel great and confident moving on knowing you‚Äôre not with a liar/ cheater. If I knew at the time I would have broken up with him but he really opened up and seems self aware of his mistakes and why it happened. But we‚Äôre young and life is hard, do I want to be with someone that acts like that when there are rough patches and family health struggles? Thank you for your input. 

TLDR: my boyfriend of almost 3 years cheated on me 2 years ago and 1 year ago when he was going through a hard time and unsure of our relationship, now he wants to come clean and start a future.

We have fun together doing the most simple things, groceries, chores, etc. For the record she has her own place and I hangout there and sleepover a few times a week. 

The issue is that on our first date, I mentioned to her that I do not drive because it gives me terrible anxiety. It's something I've never been able to wrap my head around, and the only thing that gives me ongoing stress. I also told her though that this is something I wanted to actively work on cause I felt like even though it's really hard for me, I knew it could be beneficial for my future. So I got my beginners license finally, and practiced once a week, just doing parking lot driving to get comfortable etc. One week though I went on the road with my friend it didn't go that great. I sort of panicked during a turn and crossed up my arms and ended up in the snow bank. Since then I haven't been out cause now my already bad anxiety about it is even worse. I mentioned to her that because of how bad that was, I could not promise that I would eventually become a full time driver if it kept going badly, but that I wanted to keep trying. She essentially told me that if I didn't get it, she would break up and consider this all a waste of time.

Her friends have told her that she should just let this one thing slide since I'm apparently great to her in other ways. For example she wants 4 kids, I only wanted two initially but because of how I feel about her I was okay with 4 in the future. I never ask her/expect her to take birth control or plan B etc, I told her I'd probably take her last name in the future cause she really likes her last name. 

I know it's only been 4 or 5 months depending on how you define length of relationships, but I do really like this girl. She said she was re evaluating things based off my comment about how I could not promise I'd end up getting my license. Things have been okay since that comment as I've tried to assure her I'm not giving up on the license right away because of one bad incident. How do I navigate this when she seems so all or nothing about the license despite most people telling her she should maybe let this slide. 6",How can I navigate my relationship when my girlfriend seems all or nothing about my driving anxiety and insists on me getting my license?,"The individual in the post has been in a relationship for about 4 months and has been open about their struggle with driving due to severe anxiety, which is a significant source of stress for them.

We spent a long time separated as he moved out of state and married and is now divorced. We reconnected in January of last year, he moved back to the state I am in mid-July, and we got an apartment together in October. He also proposed to me in May, so he is technically my fiance. Nobody in his family knows though. 

**There have been so many incidents that make me question my sanity and what tf I'm doing in this relationship, but I still don't know if I should leave.** 

We argue a lot. Whenever I try to express my feelings, he becomes angry and it becomes a three-day argument. He never apologizes or corrects the behavior. 

My cat died the day after Christmas, and he didn't even say ""I'm sorry for your loss"", or have any sympathy, because he hates cats. Now that my cat passed, I am never allowed to get another cat, as he says they smell bad and ""have shitty paws"". 

Soon after, the first person I befriended in Community college passed away suddenly. He said people die every day, and If I didn't check Facebook I wouldn't have known, therefore I wouldn't have been sad. 

Saturday, I was unboxing my ninja foodi, and dropped the box onto its side, he said ""you know we have neighbors right?"" And I got an attitude, he then said there was no need for me to have an attitude. 

He knew before we got together I like to drink wine and cocktails occasionally. Since he doesn't drink, he says I am disrespecting him if I drink.

I cook him dinner 5 nights a week as he does not cook. He never says thank you when I bring him his dinner. I also make him smoothies and breakfast sandwiches every day to take to work. I never get any appreciation for this. 

I am starting to get extremely burnt out. I am really torn on whether I should try to talk to him about my feelings, or if I should just pack my stuff and leave. I feel like I would probably be happier if I left, but I also feel like a failure. He was married for 10 years before me, so I feel like it is all my fault. Idk, I would really appreciate advice and insights.

They are struggling with feelings of failure and self-doubt, particularly given their fianc√©'s previous decade-long marriage and their own concern that they must bear some responsibility for the difficulties in their current partnership.",3,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izmvuh/i_27f_feel_unhappy_but_i_still_love_him_34m_do_i/,relationship_advice
2025-02-27 18:27:46,1izmply,My 35/m bf is mad that (25f) is  may be giving birth without him how to i deal with this?,"me and my boyfriend have been together since July and we moved to another state (his homestate) for a job he used to work (he no longer works at and is now jobless) i found out i was pregnant back in October. I‚Äôm due on May 31st and since i found out i was pregnant and til this day me and him do not have a stable place since we were living in a car, a hotel, then his brothers and we had moved from there and now we are living under his moms place who happens to have roommates who brings sketchy (drug addicted) people in and out there house and we sleep in the living room..

Because of this we have been having tension and nonstop arguments because im no longer happy living here and comfortable moving place to place and plus the environment we are in now isn‚Äôt safe for me to bring a child into because we don‚Äôt even have our place since we moved to this state and i think its best i move back with my family to my homestate to give birth that way I wont have any trouble dealing with instability and that we‚Äôre in a safe environment meanwhile he stays behind and find a stable job/place for us so we can move back because he doesn‚Äôt want to move.

Until then i will have to give birth where its more stable for me and our upcoming child. Couple days ago I reached my breaking point because he still hasn‚Äôt found a job and has been slacking more since we moved to his mom. he only applied at one job and they weren‚Äôt hiring and that made him not want to attempt for other jobs and plus his mom and roommates were stressing me out they would be up all night even til the next day causing commotion keeping me from sleeping.

 I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore and my bf will get defensive with me and told me if i dont like it then this place isnt for me then i should move back instead of understanding and seeing my point, i even asked him just move with me and he says he doesn‚Äôt want to leave and he rather stay put. I listened to him but mainly my gut instincts and the following next day i contacted my mom and told her what happened and she was willing to pick me up and take me back to live with her next week. 

I broke the news to my boyfriend that i would be leaving without him and at first he started breaking down crying then he empathized with me apologizing for everything i been thru and that he is sorry for bringing me along with him. and i told him i still want us together for our child but me temporarily leaving is the better choice.

 Then he came up with a plan saying how first thing when i move away and while he stays behind he will find a job and work hard and have a home for me and the baby before i give birth. once he does he will get me and the baby from my home-state so he is able to participate in the delivery and have our home ready. I didn‚Äôt fall for it because all these months we‚Äôve been here we have not had a place and for him to get a job and find a place will take some time for him to get done especially alone. I shared that concern with him and he doubted everything i said and told him it would be better off if i just wait until it works.

Well here‚Äôs the kicker, last night while i was able to sleep and he read messages between me and my moms conversation and he read the part that i told my mom that i have plans giving birth in my home state because it will be easier on me and plus it would be nice for my family to see the baby because after that i planned on moving back with him and begin raising our family. He woke me up and started cussing me out cause he didn‚Äôt like the fact i plan on giving birth in a whole other state where he could possibly miss the birth and felt like i was going against his original plan to ‚Äúplease my family‚Äù.

He started calling me EVIL and CONNIVING and NARCISSISTIC cause i plan on taking his child away from him and he will miss the delivery experience as a first time dad and that its my fault for going against his plan. and mind you im a first time mother just trying to do whats best because this first pregnancy has been STRESSFUL for me. i told him he can still very much see our newborn even after he misses it but thats not enough for him.  

i reassured him that‚Äôs not what it is at all‚Ä¶ its the fact that i cant really trust his plan based off how we have been living since we moved in his home state and if his plan DOES go accordingly then thats great we will figure it out from there but im more worried about our child being born in a better circumstance. 

I told him he can still come down and visit and still see his newborn son then he clapped back and told me that‚Äôs unnecessary because i shouldnt have to leave in the first place and he will miss the birth. we been up arguing til 4am and told me not to speak to him and he is breaking up with me then he slept on a different couch from me. 
Now i feel like absolute shit but at the same time im so used to us arguing it doesnt even phase me anymore cause i know it‚Äôs whats best. Am in the bad that im doing this?

2025-02-27 18:23:42,1izmm18,Has the guy I‚Äôm seeing (29F) lost interest in me (26F)?,"I have been dating this guy for 3 months (not exclusive). Initially, we were heavy with the phone calls‚Äîsome lasting 4 hours or more and super affectionate over text.  Perhaps too early to be acting that way, but it felt nice. Our first 3 dates were incredible. He told me our second date was the best he‚Äôs ever had. Our third was even a double date with his friends.

Our 4th date ended with some tension, as I didn‚Äôt feel like he wasn‚Äôt as affectionate as previously and I got cold on him. Admittedly, I was kind of distant throughout due to discovering he was talking to someone else (although we aren‚Äôt official and I had no place to be upset about it). While we still texted everyday and he was engaged, he wasn‚Äôt being as cutesy as before. 

Our 5th date felt like full recovery. We had an amazing time together, spent a lot of time talking and learning more about each other. We were super affectionate and things felt secure. He resumed being affectionate through text and we got back to having playful banter. 

Our last date was a week ago. We planned to go to the gym, but ended up laying in bed talking for hours. We got into finances, career, goals and talked about things we can do for self improvement. We talked about things we want to do together over summer and he even suggested taking some sort of class together. He offered to make me dinner, and as soon as we went to do that, my energy shifted and I became passive aggressive and critical towards him. He called me out for it and asked why. I told him that I felt like I was getting attached and feared that the feeling wasn‚Äôt reciprocated. He told me that it was. We continued to talk, I apologized and we spent some more time together before leaving. 

Since then, we haven‚Äôt made further plans. We‚Äôve texted consistently since then and he is always engaged in the conversation, but has again stopped being affectionate. I tried to call him (which we do every so often, so not out of the norm) and he didn‚Äôt pick up, as he was busy. I told him I was at the driving range the other day, and he suggested that we go together sometime out by him. He referred to me by my pet as well, and that felt nice but the conversation feels very friendly otherwise. 

I‚Äôve been in my head about the texting energy shift, him not calling me back and now not having any plans on the books. He comes off as very secure and I tend to be on the anxious side. I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm trying to mirror the energy and distance myself, rather than be authentic. I‚Äôve made the assumption he‚Äôs over it and am trying to keep myself from being hurt. I know I created tension and inconsistency with how I show up, and that is just me displacing my own internal frustration onto him, which isn‚Äôt cool. 

Other thing to note is that despite the above, he has consistently offered to help me with things: resume, setting up electronics with new software and various tasks to help me out. He is very caring and shows it clearly. He always opens my doors for me, cooks for me, and compliments non-physical traits of mine. 

I perceive rejection, but also think I‚Äôm super in my head and pushing the narrative that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot good enough.‚Äù Obviously, I do have a bit of internal work to be done in healing the anxiousness. Going to Reddit to seek validation isn‚Äôt really a great sign either. I want to propose another date, but feel that if he‚Äôs interested, he will do it. I don‚Äôt want to come off as needy or desperate, but the ambiguity kinda sucks.

tldr; Guy I‚Äôm seeing pulls back on affection through text after having moments of tension. Despite this, is still engaged and nshowing signs that he cares. No next date planned and I am overthinking whether or not to initiate. I feel like I‚Äôve turned him off and he is disinterested/done with me. ","Should I initiate another date with him, or should I wait to see if he expresses interest instead?","The individual writing the Reddit post is currently in a dating situation with a man they have been seeing for three months, during which they have experienced fluctuations in affection and communication. They initially had a positive connection marked by lengthy phone calls and engaging in deep conversations, but recent tensions arose due to feelings of insecurity and anxiety about the relationship. 

The person acknowledges that they tend to have an anxious disposition, which has led them to feel distant and critical at times, particularly when they sensed a shift in their partner's behavior. They also recognize their own internal struggles, noting a fear of not being ""good enough"" and a tendency to overthink situations. Despite this, they have received support from the man they are dating, who has offered help with practical tasks and displayed caring behaviors.

The individual is aware of the need for personal work on their anxious tendencies, suggesting that they may be at a point of self-reflection and growth. They have sought validation from the Reddit community, indicating that they may be dealing with feelings of uncertainty and vulnerability related to their dating experience. 

Overall, their current emotional state appears to be influenced by their inclination toward anxiety in relationships, perceived rejection, and the complexities of navigating intimacy and communication with their partner.",1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izmm18/has_the_guy_im_seeing_29f_lost_interest_in_me_26f/,relationship_advice
2025-02-27 18:17:28,1izmgjg,My (24NB) Cat was exposed to lilies so he is in the ER. It‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs (63F) fault and she doesn‚Äôt care.,"tldr: mom brought lilies in the house without telling anyone. cat rubbed his face in them. now he‚Äôs in the ER (day 3) and might come home later today. parents do not care 
:( looking for any advice !! 

Hi reddit. Throwaway account cause my og account has my name in it. I originally posted this on r/AskVet but the post was locked and I was told to post here instead. (Some context: me (24NB), my sister (28F), and our 9 y/o cat are currently living with our parents (63F, 59M) until we can afford to move out‚Ä¶which will hopefully be later this year) 

On Tuesday, my dad told us he noticed our cat rubbing his face in some lilies. For those who don‚Äôt know, lilies are incredibly toxic to cats. We saw pollen on his nose and fur, so we immediately called poison control and soon after took him to the ER vet. (We are unsure if anything was ingested.) While I‚Äôm glad we caught it ASAP, it is incredibly frustrating being that this was 100% preventable. 

Our mom really likes flowers/plants. Which is fine. but we already told her about how dangerous lilies are to cats. She could not care less. 

She thought we were overreacting and told us to *take him out of the ER*‚Ä¶ she was only concerned about how expensive it was going to be (my sister and I will be splitting the bill‚Ä¶ she will not be paying a cent mind you) 

My parent‚Äôs behavior in this situation alone could be a completely different post by itself, but just know that they are (and have always been) incredibly narcissistic and selfish people. 

It‚Äôs now Thursday. They are going to do more blood testing and depending on those results, he will either be able to come home, or have to stay one more night. 

So far things seem good, but I got a call yesterday telling me that his creatine levels increased, and that made me really sad.  (can‚Äôt remember the exact number. maybe 1.6? not sure how it‚Äôs measured. but if there are any vets that can explain this, that‚Äôd be great!) 

Apparently he didn‚Äôt eat dinner last night, but the vet tech said not to worry too much about that since he ate twice earlier in the day and he‚Äôs *very* grumpy about not being at home. 

I‚Äôm currently typing this at work because it‚Äôs the only thing I can think about. I miss him so so much and I want him to come home today so bad. 

Idk. I‚Äôm so sad. I miss him a lot and just want to give him a hug. I really really hope he can come home today. and if not today, then tomorrow at least. 

tbh I did genuinely want advice from veterinarians so if you‚Äôre a vet or have experience with this, I‚Äôd appreciate any input!! Especially when it comes for next steps and what to after he comes home. 

As for parental advice, I‚Äôve accepted they‚Äôre a lost cause, and basically my only solution to keep my sanity is to move out. But advice is appreciated. 

I will post an update once I have one, but if anyone has any comforting words, advice, anything, I‚Äôll take it. 

Sorry for the long post.

ok so my story is very complicated this guy and me been my best friend for a year and a half now(long distance btw) and he always hinted about how he liked me or wtv then we started to get so close like around august we started spending legit every minute of the day together and playing video games and watching movies..ect and we always jokingly flirted and he made me feel extremely special and i was always his number one priority and everyone was like shipping us and yk these stuff .but i always said it will never happen i will never fall for him cuz he was such a girls whore if yk what i mean , then one random night we spoke about how we have weird feelings for each other but never really talked about it but anyways we started flirtingggg and he literally treated me like HIS GF and the love of his life annnnnd unfortunately it got to the point where i let him talk to me in a sexual way and how he wanted me sexually so bad and how he want me and wanna kiss me and gets jealous when i mention dating or anything w anyone else and even asked me to give him primission to do that ‚Äúthing‚Äù while thinking of me. he even asked for pics‚Ä¶..but at the time i was SO OKAY with it cuz he was so perfect and good to me like legit GOOD A WHOLE GREEN FLAG i said he could never hurt me or anything ü§° anyways and then one day he started talking about how he wanna marry me ‚Ä¶and we should get married ‚Ä¶i obviously got so happy and we talked in details about everything and how hard is it gonna be , and cuz i know we always joke i said r u serious like FR? why do u wanna marry a person u dont love ( i wanted him to talk) he kept saying yes i promise i want u and im in love w u and blah blah anyways days later then i realized‚Ä¶ i should ask‚Ä¶ what are we‚Ä¶.like even my friend said this is stupid he keeps following and talking to girls and acting single on his streams u should ask sooo

okay so i asked and then he said ur my best friend and i was like what? wdym we r just friends after every fucking thing we did and then he said yeah we r not dating nor lover even tho he said im in love w u LMAO then he said stuff about how he has feelings but he doesn‚Äôt know if it real and that he say stuff that he doesn‚Äôt know if he mean it or notüòç and how he doesnt see us as a lovers bcz he doesnt see himself with anyone and i went CRAZY about the sexual part and how u saw me as a sexual thing cus i knew he had a past and i dont and its a big thing for me so why would u just do these things casually and u fucking said u wanna marry me but u dont know what u want with me ur a player and a lier u treated me like ur gf and gave mixed signals even tho im ur best friend and ur fav person and blaaah blah then he kept apologizing and then was mad about the ‚Äúplayer part‚Äù and the ‚Äúi never saw u as a sexual thing‚Äù cuz apparently i knew him good enough :/and about the marriage he said oh so what friends do get married and its just assumptions for the future and i got so mad i blocked him everywhere for a week

then we talked again and i cried my heart eyes cuz obv it was so hard he was my everything i couldnt sleep or eat for the whole week i also lost my grandma that week so i was at my lowest and he kept saying how a bad person he is and talked shit about him self and kept apologizing and how hes just confused and says everything on his mind to me and i forgave him and we stayed friends 

its been a month since we made up, at the beginning we were like we used to be and nothing changed it was so good but then suddenly he started acting weird as if theres another girl ‚Äúi just trust my gut‚Äùhe didnt text me as he used to and never calls randomly or facetime as we used to :/ and even trying to not stay alone w me in vc (we use discord) and always invite his friends or mine and his behavior changed w me so i ignored him for 2 days then he went crazy and like i said ur acting weird he said ‚Äúi told u im having a mental breakdown‚Ä¶‚Äù basically opened up about having hard time cuz i know him (he‚Äôs bipolar) and begged me to never change on him and i said the same thing . but the thing is hes acting as if what we had was nothing. IM LYING to myself saying wer still friends but it still hurts so bad like it was real and im not over what happened im still holding a grudge but i didnt say anything‚Ä¶

anyways. one of the reason i stayed is because he apparently has confusing feelings right? but what he has been doing? following more girls on ig and saying stuff in vc with his friends like ‚Äúoh ive been using tinder, oh i wanna get to know this girl‚Äù (one thing about him hes very insecure and always needs females attention and ik hes a lustful man) so i thought wow thats like very disrespectful right‚Ä¶..and i saw him liking a reel saying (whoever makes me fall in love again is the goat‚Äù and other reels thats so shitty and hurtful i feel like he always want new girls in his life (back to his old ways) while keeping me on the side waiting for him.

so ive been connecting the dots and reliazed he just doesn‚Äôt want me even tho 2 days before our fight he was saying stuff like how he wants me  i dont get it i even told him u might have a personality split cuz wtf r u doing to me. and he never changed and never will and will always look for something new (girls hes a sag btw aha yeah ive been reading) so i thought about removing him from my life (im ghosting him for 3 days now saying im just tired and i wanna be alone) but its so so so freaking hard like i want u guys to understand how insanely attached i am to him and how i see him my everything and how hes been w me throughout everything and helped me so much i even see him as my souldmate cuz imagine we saw each other once at a wedding when we were 17 ( we r 23-24 now ) cuz HIS AUNT WHOS MY AGE WAS MY HIGH SCHOOL BESTIE ( he used to live where i live but moved away 4 years ago) 

anyways but even my friend who always said hes a good person for u? shes been saying hes the worst and a liar and a minuplator and i should respect myself and leave him cuz honestly its been so fucking draining even tho im the happiest when im with him:( idk what to do now ive been cold with him like IKKKK I SHOULD WALK AWAY but i need him and i need him in my life but i need to have self respect too soo yeah and ik hes gonna ask whats wrong and i cant just say what i feel like he KNOWS what hes doing right? i wrote a long paragraph in my notes and thinking of either sending it or not idk.

2025-02-27 18:13:04,1izmcuo,"How to handle minor differences in opinion? 25F, 29M","TL;DR at the bottom.

I, 25F, have been dating my partner, 29M, for almost 3 yrs. A recurrent problem is that I get defensive when there's even the slightest difference in opinions between us. This isn't a problem exclusive to the relationship. I struggle with this in general. However, it comes up more often with him because he's who I talk to the most. These aren't major opinions like politics, children, or financials. More like, 'I like the design of this one character as it makes sense for what they're trying to symbolize.' I think I know why I have this problem. Growing up, I started developing opinions different from the majority of my family members which lead to many fights where I had to defend my opinions tooth and nail and was often talked down to for them. Before anyone asks, I am in therapy and this is one of the things I work on with my therapist. My partner also knows that this is something I struggle with. This doesn't happen all the time either and more often than not, my partner and I agree on things. However, when it does happen and my defenses are triggered, I stop having fun. My mind goes into damage control mode, where I need to constantly remind myself that he's not my enemy. I love debate, I love in-depth discussions, but this makes it where I don't want to have them with him. As far as I can tell, it isn't his tone or his demeanor that causes this to happen. Anyone experience this kind of thing? What do you do? It is exhausting trying to control this.

How do I handle this?",How do I handle getting defensive during minor differences of opinion with my partner?,"The individual is a 25-year-old female who has been in a relationship with her partner, a 29-year-old male, for almost three years. She has a history of developing opinions that differ from those of her family members, which led to conflicts during her upbringing where she felt the need to defend her viewpoints vigorously and was often talked down to. This background contributes to her defensiveness in discussions, especially with her partner, as he is the person she communicates with the most. She is currently in therapy, where she is actively working on this issue. Despite the challenges she faces, she notes that she and her partner generally agree on many topics, and the defensiveness arises more intensely during minor disagreements, not stemming from his tone or demeanor.",1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izmcuo/how_to_handle_minor_differences_in_opinion_25f_29m/,relationship_advice

I was deep down inside laughing but trying to show care. I could honestly see through the BS, anyways as I am leaving she is trying to get a reaction from me saying some guy dm‚Äôd her and I didn‚Äôt really care.

During the breakup she was crying and hugging me, and saying how we can‚Äôt work out etc! 

I was never upset about the breakup, but after reading others post I am relieved but scared of the aftermath! 

I am afraid that I was devalued and she will start idealizing me again.

During our 1st year being together, he already had the guts to talk bad to me infront of his fam and friends telling me to get out of their house but I still stayed (stupid yeah?) .He loves hanging out with his friends before and will come home drunk or sometimes, he doesn't even thinking home at all and spend the night at his friends place knowing that I am living at their house .



 I actually attempted to end the relationship multiple times but my values are stopping me to do so because my parents told us that if we decided to give our virginity to a guy then he should be the first and last to get it . Fast forward, I got pregnant unexpectedly because I thought that I wont be able to have a baby since that I have a PCOS. I had a miscarriage 2 times because the first time that we did it,I got pregnant but due to severe stress, the  pregnancy didn't push through, same with the 2nd preganncy that we had.



 During my pregnancy with our daughter right now, I experienced unending stress because of him. It was Christmas when I was 4 months preggy that timeand after 12 am, he already went staright to his friends and stayed their for 3 days without even giving me updates and that caused my bleeding. Yes, I bleed due to severe stress of what he did but thank God! the baby was saved but the doctor said that it could have led me to another miscarriage if I didn't went to the E.R immediately  . Then when I gave birth, I went for maternity leave for 3 months. He was the only one providing for us both and the babyduring that time but there wasn't a day where he did not complain of taking care of the baby and always letting me feel that he is the one providing for us financially . Then they terminated him at work  (as a security guard) since that his attendance is not good because he will go to work and absent whenever he wants to. So I decided to go back to work. 



He does have part time jobs that time either in construction or as a taxi driver . Everytime that I try to open up my thoughts sa kanya, he always feels like I'm attacking him that's why he gets mad and would throw hurtful words to me while shouting. Right now, he already have a stable job but there's one time when he came home from work, he was suddenly losing his temper just because I kept telling him to come home since that it's already 1 am and his time out should be 6 pm and when he got home,He was so mad at me that he is already losing his temper, he even punch the door. He also got to shout at our kid who is already crying because she is already scared of his dad's actions during that night.



 Then he suddenly utter to me that he is just staying in the relationship because of the baby . After hearing that I didn't know how to react. I came to realize that the disrespect was too loud for me to talk (because FYI, his mother is racist to me because I gained a lot of weight and she keeps on making jokes about it since when I gave birth that made me felt so ugly ). 



At the moment, he only drinks alcohol once a week but his attitude got even worse because he always asks me if where did I spent his salary in a loud voice even in public places when he knows that we have a lot of bills to pay. Everytime that his salary arrives, he's being so arrogant making me feel as if I am  not making money. (He's a driver at a company and I am actually making money twice or thrice than his salary lol! ).He is getting mad when I am asking for his help on paying the bills but actually, I am the one who pays most of our loans and bills and even got to save money for his allowance. Even during birthdays of his family, I am the one who's giving the money to buy food so we can celebrate even if his family is slapping with so much disrespect. I even surprised his mother during her birthday but not even a thankyou I heard.



Just last night, when we were on our way home from his parents house, he suddenly left  me with no flashlight knowing that our way home is very steep . I needed to shout and call his name just so he can remember that I am behind him and I need a flashlight. When we got home, he was so mad at me for not replying to him during the day knowing that I was with his family because he told me to assist them for chek up.He took my phone when he went to work since that his phone wasn't working so how will I reply to him? Nonsense right? Then he kept on bragging about the loan that he used during their outing . Maybe he was expecting me to use my salary to pay it. I don't know but I think my bomb suddenly blowed up that I finally had the courage to shout at him that time after being silence and demure for a very long time . Now that I am writing this confession, I feel like I need to let go of him because I don't want my baby to witness everything. I don't want her to feel that having a complete family needs to be toxic . I don't want her to make that as her standard of love but I would like your opinions about this.",Should I let go of my partner to prevent my child from witnessing our toxic relationship?,"The individual in the Reddit post identifies as a Virtual Assistant and has been in a relationship with their live-in partner for four years.

So i‚Äôve ‚Äò19M‚Äô been friends with this one girl ‚Äò19F‚Äô for i‚Äôd say a little over 8 months. She liked me originally but I didn‚Äôt have the same feelings back towards her, and overall just wasn‚Äôt really attracted to her. 

Fast forward about 4 weeks ago, I noticed some feelings were developing towards her, and I also noticed that she started to like me again. We both talked about it and realized that we would give it a shot. But we both agreed that like if things never worked out between us, that we were able to just remain friends. I told her that i‚Äôm still not sure where my head is at with everything, but want to give it a shot to see what happens. 

So we‚Äôve been hangin out a lot, texting, did some things (won‚Äôt get into that), etc. 

The issue is that I definitely feel a lot closer to her now, and definitely have developed more interest. The only problem, is I just still don‚Äôt feel that FEELING of wanting a relationship with her. I cannot put it into words and that‚Äôs where I want some help. I don‚Äôt want her to think I just used her, and genuinely want her to know i‚Äôm just not in the proper head space. She REALLY REALLY likes me as well. She has said a lot of things about me that she likes and legit tells me to my face how attractive I am.

But now he says that actually he doesn‚Äôt believe in marriage. He has a whole list of reasons ‚Äî he‚Äôs not religious (but neither am I), his parents had a bad marriage, he feels it‚Äôs archaic, etc. But I do believe in marriage because I find it romantic and a symbol of a deeper commitment.

2025-02-27 18:06:00,1izm6pl,My (29M) Girlfriend (28F) doesn't like that our mutual friend (28F) texted me even though we've been friends for years.,"My (29M) girlfriend (28F) is upset that our mutual friend who introduced us to each other (28F) texted me instead of her. How have people dealt with this situation?

For context, I've been friends with our mutual (lets call her Sandy) for about 5 years now. Sandy and I went to the same university, although we weren't friends just yet. The entire time I've known her she's been in serious relationships. I met Sandy in a group of friends we used to game with. In 2022, I offered a job to Sandy and she relocated to my city, along with those same friends in our gaming group. Essentially, I relocated all my friends to come take a much better opportunity than anything they would have in our small hometown. When Sandy moved, her boyfriend (29M) also came with her. Lets call him Daryl.

Daryl and I are close friends too, I'm basically his only friend in this new city. We occasionally chat and game, but not nearly as much as I do with Sandy. Since we work together, Sandy and I would frequently eat lunch at work or talk around the office. I've never gone out or hung out with her 1 on 1, and Daryl has never given me any reason to believe he's uncomfortable with Sandy and I talking as much as we do.

Fast forward to last year. Sandy introduced me to my now girlfriend and we hit it off. At first, My communication with Sandy become pretty much non-existent. Sandy also got a new job around that time so I haven't worked with her for 8+ months. Any communication went mostly through Sandy and my GF. Like with most relationships, the level of communication with Sandy has naturally decreased over time, we all have our lives and situations going on so I don't think its weird that we don't hear from her as frequently anymore.

Yesterday Sandy messaged me and said that our friends are hosting a function at their house. I said my girlfriend and I would be there and that was that. Later, I asked my GF if she had heard about the plans from Sandy. She looked bothered, and said she hadn't heard from sandy in weeks. When I asked her about it, she confessed it made her feel a bit bothered that Sandy would text me and not her, or even told her she had sent me a message. She said that she wouldn't just text Daryl out of the blue, but I think that's different because her and Daryl were never friends. I actually have talked to Sandy our entire friendship, years before I even met my GF.

How have others dealt with this sort of thing? Would anyone consider this a red flag? I think I know how I feel, but I'd love to hear what others think and am happy to provide any clarifications.",How have others dealt with situations where a mutual friend texts one partner instead of the other?

2025-02-27 17:57:59,1izlzen,I (25M) feel trapped in my relationship with my gf (24F)?,"This post is going to be long. First I want to say that every relationship is different, I have my limits in my relationship, and everyone else has theirs, they don't have to be the same. If in your relationship, certain things are ok to do that I don't agree with, that's fine, it's your relationship, not mine, I am more on the conservative side but that's just me, I'm not saying everyone should be like that or every relationship should be like mine. 

I (25M) met my gf (24F) 3 years ago. We were both at the same university, she's from the country where that university is and I am from another country. Even though I'm a year older than her, she was 2 years ahead of me in university because I enrolled years after graduating high school (I had been in another university before), so when I met her she was in her last year and I was in my second year, it was at the beginning of the school year. When I first saw her and thought she was gorgeous, I asked around about her and then I ended up messaging her in instagram. At that time neither of us were searching for something serious so we just hung out and made out and texted a lot, however we both started to catch feelings for each other. She wasn't the type of girl I was looking for in a relationship, she seemed all cute and innocent (which is in part why I liked her so much), but she wasn't, she dressed in a way that was too revealing for my taste and she partied. At first I didn't care because I wasn't planning on having a relationship with her, it was just to have fun. But about a month after we started hanging out she told me she liked me and I told her I also did, we were both going on spring break vacation and she said she wanted to make things clear before we went out on that week vacation to know if we were going to be exclusive or not and so that she wouldn't feel disillusioned if I were to do something, but we agreed to be exclusive but not in a relationship yet. I honestly thought that I could change and be ok with her dressing a certain way and her going out to party, I said to myself that that's normal today and that I should be ok with that, but in the end I wasn't, but we'll get to that later. Around mid or late April, she told me that she was going on a 3 month internship overseas (Europe) and that she wanted me to think if I wanted to keep being together even though she was leaving for 3 months, I told her yes and she was happy. About a month after that I asked her to be my girlfriend. About two months later, she left for her internship so we were now in a long distance relationship. This is when the problems started. She went out like 4 times over there to different countries with other students from her year that also went there, and she went to clubs 3 of those 4 times. I didn't like it, and we fought. We broke up a couple of times but got back together. Those weren't the only problems, this is when I realized that we didn't agree on a lot of things. I also found out something about her past that I didn't like, but I could stomach it. I found out because someone had told me about that before we started talking, but I asked her about it until she was overseas. She confirmed if, I didn't like it but I could tolerate it. This was also a rough time for me because I was in the process of fighting getting kicked out of the university because of a disciplinary issue, in the end I did get kicked out. She graduated at the end of the year and I got kicked out, I couldn't go to her graduation because I had to go back to my country. We agreed to stay together because our countries are next to each other. We kept going in a long distance relationship, still to this day. She went back to her city, this was a rough time for both of us, I was depressed because I got expelled and she was depressed because she felt like she didn't know what to do with her life. This was 2023. I enrolled in a university in my country. During this year we fought a lot, because of things she did that I didn't agree and she did them because in her mine, they weren't wrong. I didn't break up with her because I was madly in love with her and I didn't want to let her go, partly because of everything we had gone through together and also because it made my stomach sick imagining her with someone else. We fought a lot but we worked on the issues and she stopped doing the things I didn't like her doing. At the beginning of 2023 I told her that we should have one night a week which was only for us, a day for us to do something together whether warching a movie through teleparty or having a drink through FaceTime, and that this was a fixed day in which we wouldn't make any other plans that would interfere with our plan together (unless it was a family plan or a special occasion like a friend's birthday or something), this day was Saturday of every week. On this year I didn't go out almost at all because I was depressed. Fast forward to 2024, she started another major in another university in another country (that's also next to my country but on the other side). On this year I also found out (because she told me) something about her past that made me very uncomfortable, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to make her feel bad. She started a new major because this was her dream career since she was a child but her mom didn't let her go abroad to university before, so she had to stay in her country. She decided to go to that country because I am also going to that country to get my MBA in a prestigious business school that's supposed to be the best in the region, and that had been my plan since I graduated high school. The thing is that she started school in that country on 2024 and I am probably starting my MBA in 2026, so it's 2 more years long distance. Anyways, We fought a lot because I felt that she was putting her new friends before me, for example, there was 2 occasions in which we had plans (not on Saturday) and she ditched me to be with her friends. This was at the beginning of the year and we broke up both times but got back together because I loved her so much and wanted to be with her. The thing is that she only saw her friends mostly during the weekdays because they all went to their cities on the weekends, so she stayed alone during the weekends. Time went through and I started going out more. I didn't go to clubs or partying, I started going out (on Fridays) to a bar in a club (I mean club as in country club in which you have to be a member to enter or be a member's guest) because I'm a member because of my dad and that's the place where most people I know go out. I started going out there because I like going out to places where I know people, but also because the people that go there are probably the people that I am going to interact the most with in terms of work and business, so it is in part for networking. She started to notice this and she doesn't like it because she tells me that I don't spend time with her and that I just go out drinking. The thing is that I wasn't going out on Saturdays, I was going out on Fridays. This was also a time in which a 2 soccer international tournaments were going on so I was also going out during the weekdays to watch the games with friends. She felt as if I wasn't giving her enough attention, I told her that we still had our day for only us (Saturdays) and she said that I was saying that she only had a right to my attention one night a week, and that I hadn't spend one whole weekend with her in a long time. And to me it was absurd because I was the one who suggested having that day for only us in the first place, a day in which our plan with each other was priority. Also, I think that having at least one night a week to be with friends or do something we like on our own is ok. She says that I wasn't like this, that in 2023 I barely went out and now I go out almost every Friday. And people have told me that this was my own making for changing her and not wanting her to go out. The thing is that I never told her to not go out because I was never against that, I told her to not go to clubs, but I didn't mind her going out with her friends to eat or drink something at a chill bar, which is what I started doing. I also explained to her why I went out to that place specifically and she told me that I'm a shitty person because I am trying to see how I can use people for my own benefit. It is frustrating to me that she doesn't understand how the world works, it is normal to build connections and relationships being an adult with certain purposes, and everyone in that place and in my social circle does the same, everyone is thinking about their career. This doesn't mean that real friendship doesn't exist, of course it does, but there's also certain relationships that are symbiotic. The point is that it feels like I have a limit on how many days I can go out in a month. And I'm a social person, I've always been, I like meeting up with friends, making new friends, being in places where I know people. For example, I love december because it's a month when a lot of my friends and people I know come to my country to visit for Christmas so I know I'm going to go to several social gatherings. She's not like that, she has like a social battery life (her words). That's one problem. Throughout 2023 and 2024, we broke up and got back together countless times, too many to count or remember. It was breaking up and getting back together the same day or the next day, no longer than that.

Another problem is I can see that when I go to study my Master's in the same country she's in, we're going to have a lot of problems. My dad went to that same business school and got his MBA there. He tells me that half of the value of that school is the classes and the learning, and the other half is the connections and friends one makes with other students from one's own country and other countries, and that his success is in part due to those connections he made that have been useful to him throughout his career and still are. He also says that those friendships and connections are made by socializing outside of the classroom, going out with the other students there, either inside campus or outside. Since that school only offers Masters degrees, every student that goes there already has a college degree, so everyone is an adult, so alcohol and drinking is permitted inside campus. The problem is that girlfriend expects that my life will be my classes and her, she expects me to see her every weekend, whether me going to visit her or her going to visit me. My dad told me that if I plan to spend all the weekends with her, that I'm going to miss out on half of the benefits of that school. I am focused on my future and I will do what I must to be successful.

Another problem is the gym. Since returning to my country, I've been going on and off to the gym because of a shoulder and knee injury I have. I am working through that, and I committed this year to go to the gym and be disciplined about it. I want to eat right for the gym to be able to add muscle mass and also lose fat, and I also want to sleep enough for that. She's coming to visit next week for a week and I know that when I tell her that I will keep going to the gym, she won't like it because she will say that we are not going to have a lot of time together because it's only a week and also I work (I'm doing an internship). I plan on going in the morning before work so I can have the afternoon free to be with her, that means that I have to go at 5 ams, which means that I need to go to sleep not too late to be able to sleep at least 6 hours. I know that she won't like it and she will say that I am going to sleep when we could spend more time together. I want to commit to this goal of mine, and I feel that it's unfair for her to tell me that it conflicts with our relationship, when it doesn't have to.

Another problem is that she says I'm not romantic enough. She says that when I talk to her I just talk to her like she's a friend and not my girlfriend. Apparently she wants to me to greet her saying things like ""Hi honey, how was your day"" and constantly say romantic things and call her cute nicknames. I'm not like that, I've never been like that. I feel as if she thinks that we live in a Hallmark movie or a romcom. And we have recently fought a lot because of this. She says that she deserves someone that treats her the way she deserves, like a princess, and that I don't do that.

Another problem is our different religions. We're both Christians, however, I'm catholic and she's evangelical. My whole family is catholic, on both sides. I'm not really a catholic, I'm agnostic (I don't know if God exists or not, and I don't have enough evidence or information to neither deny nor confirm his existence). But as I said, my whole family is Catholic, most people I know are Catholics, in fact, the biggest religion in my country is Catholicism. As I said, she is evangelical. Her mom didn't really have a religion (although she has always believed in God) and converted when she was an adult, her dad (RIP) was Catholic. She was a Catholic when she was a kid, she was baptized and did her first communion. She converted to Evangelical when she was a late teen, because she says she doesn't agree with a lot of things of the Catholic religion. When talking about marriage, she says she doesn't want to get married under Catholicism, that she wants a pastor to officiate the ceremony. I told her I want to get married under Catholicism. She says that it's not fair because I don't believe in God and she does. I told her that to me, it's not a matter of faith, it's because of tradition, which is very important to me, I want to be married under the same religion as every member of my family on both sides. I also want to raise my kids Catholic because I want them to be raised under the same values and traditions that I was, and I also don't want them to feel different to most kids if I end up living in my country. And if what really matters to her is to get married under a Christian ceremony, that she shouldn't have a problem because Catholicism is a Christian religion. In my case, it's not because of faith, it's because of a tradition that involves a specific religion so it's not interchangeable.

I've noticed that before (in 2022, 2023 and the first months of 2024), I didn't want to be without her and even when she did something that made me feel betrayed by her, I felt like I couldn't let her go. Now, whenever we have broken up, I don't feel that bad, I don't feel as if my world is ending. Also when we have broker up and gotten back together the next day or until the next couple of days, I feel my nights are peaceful without her, I am able to watch YouTube and shows, when before I used to feel horrible when we broke up and I wasn't with her. I feel peace on the nights which we don't talk over the phone because she has to study with friends or alone. I feel in peace alone. 

There are two reasons why I haven't broken up with her on my own or told her that I don't want to get back together when we have broken up. The first one is that I don't want her to feel as if she's not enough for me. I know that if I break up with her, she will cry a lot, we will stop talking, and hours later or a day later, she will either text me or call me and ask me if this is what I really want, if I tell her yes she will cry, and insist. She will feel devastated and she will feel like I don't want her or she's not enough for me. And honestly, I know how it feels that the person you've spent in a relationship with for so long now doesn't want to be with you anymore, it is devastating, it feels like your whole world is ending. The fact that the person who was your safe space now wants to get rid of you, it's such a horrible feeling. And I love my girlfriend and I don't want her to feel that way, but I know that we have too many problems and disagree on too many things. Also, she's not what I want in a wife, partly because of what I know about her past and partly because of how she's acted in the relationship. I also resent her for a lot of things she has done. 
The other reason is that when I remember everything we have been through together, I feel that I want to be with her and that she's my person. For example, my dog of 12 years died in 2023 and she supported me and was there for me the whole time and still is (it's something that still affects me to this day). She is an animal lover and so am I, last year when I visited her in her home city, we bought a huge bag of dog food and went driving through the city looking for homeless dogs to feed. We recorded that and she edited the videos and I recently thought of that and I almost teared up, the fact that we did that together was so special. I don't want to let go of those memories, if we break up, they will basically disappear because it's not something I can talk about with her anymore, it's now something I did and shared with an ex. I also don't want to do something to hurt her and make her break up with me because I don't want to hurt her and betray her. I honestly wish she would just cheat on me or do something that would justify me breaking up with her and telling her that this is too much to be able to get back together and leave it at that. Or I wish that she would just lose feelings for me or come to the conclusion that it is best for both of us to not be together.

And I also want to make things clear, I know that this post makes her seem as the bad one and I'm a victim. This isn't the whole picture. In my opinion she has been a bad girlfriend in the sense that she hasn't always respected my limits (because in her mind she wasn't doing anything wrong at the moment), however she is an amazing girlfriend in making me feel special. She has given me a lot of thoughtful and special gifts (I don't care about money value of gifts). For example, after my dog died, she paid someone to make a painting of a photo of me with my dog the day I got him when I was twelve and he was just a puppy, but with a halo over his head. And she had it framed so I could have it on my nightstand. That was the most special gift anyone has ever given me. And also I'm not a saint, I have done things that have hurt her a lot (not cheating, neither of us has cheated), and we have broken up because of those things as well. And I'm no walk in the park as well, I have a lot of limits that maybe today are not common in most relationships, and that has been the reason of most of our fights at least the first 2 years.

I am torn. I don't know what to do or what I should do.

2025-02-27 17:56:13,1izlxvt,25F breaking up with my 26M boyfriend over these reasons valid?,"I am a 25 years old. He is 26m years old. We have been together two months only, but within these two months I was diagnosed with endometrioses. My pain leaves me in agony most days and was prescribed doses of naproxen and morphine to control the pain until I am scheduled for my surgery (god knows when). It is painful to have sex. It always leave me in agony the following morning so I have lessened the amount of times we sleep together but he is young and very sexual charged which I would have no problem with if I wasn't dealing with this. I am also bi-polar and take medication for that (have been diagnosed for years), and on top of it all, I was diagnosed with another condition that leaves the walls around my heart to become inflamed leaving me with high blood pressure, headaches and chest pain. I am juggling all these inside as I do not want to be burden to him or anyone for that matter. He is extremely supportive and I love him. He is understanding but sometimes I feel terrible for his kindness and patience. I was also told I was infertile because of the endometrioses and he has now changed his mind because of this that he's okay with not having children when we initially spoke about it and he wanted them (i was always on edge about it but was not a strict no), now we don't even have the choice. I don't have the choice is a better way to put it. But he does, and I don't want 5 years from now when we're 30 he looks back and wishes he left. I want him to have the best life and I'm scared I am not able to give it to him at the moment. There are days I want to be alone in bed and I feel terrible for leaving him alone. At the moment, the thought of being alone and dealing with my issues makes me feel better. Yet, I'm scared I'll regret it later on when I do feel A1, IF I ever do. What are your thoughts?",How can I balance my relationship while dealing with my health issues without feeling like I'm burdening my partner?,"The individual is a 25-year-old diagnosed with endometriosis, a condition causing significant pain and infertility.
