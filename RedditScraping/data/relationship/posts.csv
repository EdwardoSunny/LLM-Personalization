2025-02-26 00:53:25,1iyb0y2,"I don't think I can continue enabling my friend, or being around her drunk","Me (27f) and my friend (25f) have been friends for a while. She was my highschool sweetheart, and we sooner or later realized we couldn't continue dating, and decided to stay friends. Right now, and in the past, her drinking has severely impacted our relationship. As soon as she drinks, her ""true colors"" come out, she starts repeatedly saying the same unhinged and very offensive, demeaning, and just not true views. She struggles with anxiety, so it makes sense.

When she's sober, she's more mindful of what she says, but I'm trans, and when she drinks, she pretty much says that she's struggling waaay more severely than I am, and pretty much takes the term ""cis"" as a slur.

TL;DR: highschool sweetheart that a dating relationship never worked out within a few months with is currently my friend, and her drinking makes me almost completely unable to tolerate her. She constantly criticizes my own struggles with certain chemicals, too, so I'm pretty much asking if it would be a better choice to maybe show distance, or explain why I can't be her friend right now or any more. We've been friends since 2014 or so so, 11 years total.","Should I distance myself from my friend due to her offensive behavior when she drinks, or should I explain why I can't be her friend right now?","The individual is a 27-year-old female (27f) who has been friends with her current friend, who is also a female (25f), since around 2014, making their friendship about 11 years long.

2025-02-26 00:47:47,1iyawv4,I (22m) constantly have the feeling I’m walking on eggshells to not make my girlfriend (20f) upset,"(Sorry for any grammatical errors, English is not my first language) Me and my girlfriend are in a relationship for 1.5 years, she lives an hour away from me. We see each other almost every weekend (the whole weekend we stay over at our places) On the weekdays we call and text each other to maintain our relationship. 

The last couple of months we have been having big arguments almost every week, the arguments almost always start because i hurt her emotionally, i will give you an example that happened today.

I came home from a 9,5 hour workday, when i got home i immediately got a text from her asking if we could call. I told her i’d rather not call for a bit because i just wanted to be by myself for a quick hour and not talk to anyone, some personal space. She texts ‘ok’ back, i immediately knew something was wrong because of that text, that is something that always happens. So i asked her what’s up, she explained to me that she didn’t get where i was coming from, why i didn’t want to speak to her. 

So i rang her up and explained that i was tired because of a long workday and i just needed some personal space to destress. She answered by saying she still doesn’t get it and asked how i am going to do that when we live together in the future. She says if she is in the same situation she’d rather destress with me on the phone than alone. I explained that i just wanted an hour alone and after that we could call. This made her upset and emotional, after a very long conversation she still didn’t get why i didn’t want to destress with her. She said that i’d rather choose doing nothing over talking to her. I tried explaining that is absolutely not the case and i love her dearly, this did not help.

I feel like every time i cant call her when she wants to call i don’t meet her expectations and she gets upset, i get the feeling that i cant speak my mind about what i need in live sometimes because it might upset her, it feels like i am walking on eggshells all the time because she might get upset.

Every time we get in an argument she always says i don’t care about her, when in reality i do, i care so much that i am texting her deep in the night about an argument when i have to wake up early the next morning, i have changed countless things about my behavior towards her even though i feel like i cant be myself but i don’t want to make her feel upset. And those changes never feel like I’m doing enough because there is always another ‘issue’ around the corner.

I really do love this girl, and I realize this whole post is negative about her but when we are together in the weekends we never get into big arguments. But when we are separated i feel like i am walking on eggshells, literally everything else i love about her, i hope some of you have some advice for me, or maybe i am the problem after all. Thanks in advance

TL;DR:

I am in a 1.5-year relationship with my girlfriend, who lives an hour away. We spend weekends together without issues, but during the week, we often argue mostly because she feels hurt emotionally. A recent argument started when i, after a long workday, asked for an hour alone before calling, which upset her. She didn’t understand why i needed space and worried about our future living together. I feel like i’m constantly walking on eggshells, as she often claims i don’t care about her when i do. I have changed aspects of my behavior to avoid upsetting her but it feels like it’s never enough. I love her deeply but i am unsure if i am the problem or if something needs to change. Looking for advice.","Am I the problem in my relationship, or is there something that needs to change?","The individual in the Reddit post has been in a relationship with their girlfriend for 1.5 years; she lives an hour away, and they see each other almost every weekend.

They feel a sense of emotional conflict in the relationship, particularly regarding communication and expectations during times of stress.

They express a deep love for her and have modified their behavior in attempts to ease tensions, yet feel these changes are insufficient to meet her expectations.

2025-02-26 00:32:50,1iyalak,Marry or breakup?,"
Me (24f) and my boyfriend (25m) have been together since we were 15. He was my first boyfriend and he had one other girlfriend before he met me. I love him and can envision a future with him but I'm scared of marriage. My parents had a nasty divorce when I was young and I've had a tainted view of marriage ever since.

He's funny and sweet, and not sexist or gross like most other guys my age, but my family doesn't think I should marry him mostly because he was my first and they think I need to have more experiences. We've always fantasized about spending our lives together and talked about marriage seriously on our 9th anniversary, and agreed that after 10 years we should get married. It's been a few months and I just feel very unsure about everything and scared of the future. I get that after 10 years of dating marriage seems obvious but we started dating young and we're still so young and I'm going back to school in the fall. He is talking about going to school across the country and wants me to come with him. 

I told him how I feel and he's quite steadfast in marriage, but I don't think it's fair to either of us to get married if I'm not sure. I also don't think it's fair to keep dating if he wants marriage that badly. I feel so guilty that I'm not as sure about him as he is about me. Even if we do get married I'm not sure he'll ever really forgive me for being unsure. Divorce is not an option for me so it puts a lot of pressure on my decision. Everything just feels like too much right now, I don't want to lose him. 

TL;DR I don't think things can stay as they are, I need to break up with him or agree to marry him. ",Should I break up with my boyfriend or agree to marry him despite my doubts about marriage?,"The individual is a 24-year-old female (24f) who has been in a relationship with her boyfriend, who is 25 years old (25m), since they were both 15. She has experienced family issues, particularly a traumatic perspective on marriage due to her parents' nasty divorce when she was young. She is planning to go back to school in the fall and has discussed future plans with her boyfriend, which has led to her current uncertainty about marriage. She feels pressure regarding her relationship and the idea of marriage, as she is unsure if she is ready for that commitment, especially given her young age and lack of experience with relationships.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iyalak/marry_or_breakup/,relationships
2025-02-26 00:23:10,1iyae2b,"I (30f) am struggling with coming to any sort of eye-to-eye with the parent I live with (60f). I currently can't afford to leave, but I can't afford to keep buying replacing what they throw out either. What options, if any, do I have?","Due to uncontrollable circumstances I've (30f) been forced to move back in with my mother (60f) of thirty years. Health issues keep me pretty limited, but I try to purchase and cook meals where I can. 

  
This is where it gets chaotic though. 

  
Neither of us have a lot of money, and she's INCREDIBLY paranoid of a doctor's bill/medicine costs. So much so, that she'll toss food  that I'd made for myself/planned on eating myself (that she'd NEVER eat due to ingredients) despite asking her to please please please just let me handle it. 

  
She'll get up early just to go into the fridge and clear out the ""expired"" things. Now, while that sounds helpful....She SPECIFICALLY gets up before I will to do this because quote ""well, yeah I do that, you pitch an absolute temper tantrum and scream at me"" if she does it when I'm around. 

  
• These ""expired"" things are often meals that I'd planned on eating for dinner, didn't want to risk having too much food/food waste & didn't make a back up dinner. They're usually at day 3-4 in the fridge, or are nonperishables like spices or meal components in the freezer.

• I don't scream, and I don't throw tantrums though? I've tried to be more assertive and tried to talk to her like we're both adults, but her opinion of me since moving back in is that I'm a child/irresponsible/etc. 

I genuinely cannot afford to keep replacing the same thing over and over and over again, but I also can't currently afford to move out (or buy a separate fridge, as much as I'd love to). 

Is there anything I can do that'll appease both sids? Any options for middle ground? (\*Preferably that doesn't just end in letting her throw everything away constantly)

  
Tl;Dr! My mother (60f) and I (30f) have different views on what counts as ""expired"" food, but it's always my meals that magically are toxic despite her having absolutely ZERO plans on eating them. Neither of us have a large pool of resources to cover food poisoning doc visits \*or\* constant replacement goods. Is there any options, conversations, or actions that can work towards a middle ground here?

2025-02-25 23:24:21,1iy9427,Girlfriend says I am not good at expressing emotions - M33 and F33.,"M33 and F33 are both in our early 30s. We have been dating for around 3 years. She stated that our relationship wasn't what it used to be, and there was no longer excitement. She has realized that she needs more emotion/words of affirmation expressed towards her. She said she loves me but doesn't feel ""in love."" I feel like this has always been a trait of mine where I cannot express any emotions(when asked) in any relationship. I have started seeing a therapist to seek guidance on why I am like this. We decided to give each other a week of space and just had a talk a couple days ago. In that talk, I identified what may have caused me to be a certain way in our relationship and not open up to her. She stated that she was glad I was able to identify why I never gave her emotion and was happy that I am seeing a therapist. However, she said she feels that I need to go on this journey on my own. She said she wouldn't be giving me her 100% if we just continued our relationship. We both agreed that it will take time for me to be able to learn to express emotions. So if there was ever a chance of our relationship happening again, it would have to happen organically; otherwise it's like we are just putting a band-aid to the wound.

That's how the conversation ended and then I took all my belongings at her place and left.

I am trying to figure out if there is still a chance. Our pictures are still on social media and we still follow our locations. It wasn't a bad breakup. I just wasn't able to fill something that she realized she needed in a relationship.

If I get the help I need to learn to express emotions, can our relationship rekindle? Do I just leave her alone for now, while I continue to seek therapy?

2025-02-25 23:15:04,1iy8wab,I (F20) feel like i’m not important to my (M22) bf.,"
I’ve never done this before but I am really looking for some advice from anyone. 

So, me and my bf have been talking for about 2 years and officially dating about 4 months and we cannot seem to get on the same page. I love this man, he’s met my whole fam and everyone ik knows about him and I’m not shy about being in a relationship and he knows that i’m looking to build a relationship into a future and that i’m very dedicated to us. I personally have never had a long term serious partner before and neither has he really. The main thing that bothers me is the females he allows in his life. He’s in his early 20’s and plays in an adult night sports league for “fun” and these events he will go to for up too 5 hours and be with a mix of females and males but he always gravitates towards women (which he says is just bc he was raised by them and that’s who he connects with more) which makes me very uncomfortable and also goes to bars or smokes with these people after. One night he was out till 3Am… NO TEXTS TO ME and then the next day I see on his phone one of his female teammates was blowing his phone up and texted and he sent her a pic he “didn’t remember sending” and told her he was home n safe n shit …. BUT NOT ME NOT ONE TEXT. SHADY if you ask me. He tells me he’ll NEVER drop any of his “friends” for ANYONE. and why does a MAN need to have solely female friends and on top of that put them over your gf who you know DOES NOT LIKE IT. He’s invited me a handful of times to just watch the games itself, never to any of his other activities or outings. He is very very friendly and will openly show affection to others but not his gf. his “best friends” a girl also let me add and he’ll defend these women till his last breathe if i ever say anything about them. Another thing is social media.. the following and liking of females. He already had followed more women then men by a long shot, ofc but even sense talking to me he continuously will follow new females on insta and like their posts… and a good chunck of the new ones are girls he’s MEETING IRL at volley ball, his BOARDING campus and he’s on EVERY social platform. From disc to the new stupid lemon app. He says he doesn’t care about it but removes me from his platforms, instead of these females i’m telling him are not appreciated. and when I bring it up all it does is cause fights. I give him options like post me, bring me out to things, show me off, appreciate what HE HAS yk. and he refuses to do any of them. He tells me that I shouldn’t feel threatened and upset with these situations and that I need to get over it and it’s not his fault/ problem. But the thing is he’ll NEVER show me proof. Like he’s told me i’m not allowed on his phone and he doesn’t show me any receipts to back up his words that i should “just trust” is what he states. I once took his phone to look through his memories and he FLIPPED out- he hasn’t let on it ever sense. It’s so hard because I feel like i’m fighting for a spot in his life that I should already have or shouldn’t have to fight for and i’ve told him this. He tells me i need to re evaluate myself and that i’m the crazy one. As a women it’s embarrassing too because other ppl know he has a gf and HE KNOWS DUHHH but to him it’s not a big deal. I tell him to put himself in my shoes and give him hypotheticals if I was hanging out and texting and talking about other men all the time and he says it wouldn’t bother him. I’m running out of options on what to do and say to this man for him to understand i’m tryna be a team w him and work on us not all these extra ppl. He’s starting to make me really second guess if this is normal things for a man in a long term relationship to be doing and like i’m a shitty partner and person. I just want to feel wanted and respected and not have to ask all the time. He didn’t even get me a bday gift or a gift a week later for vday either :// which in itself doesn’t matter but ITS THE THOUGHT.  a note, flowers???!!! it’s so easy to woo a woman i think, especially if you know her well. 
So He has told me things he doesn’t feel comfortable with also, like me posting my body in certain ways which i think is understandable for being in a couple now and he has seen a pic on my phones from an old talking stage, that i DID NOT know i had from 4 years before now. He asked about it and i deleted it infront of him and told him just that ^. He was still angry with me, but when it’s situations like this from my side, I’m in the wrong and have to just get over it. Im willing to change myself to better this relationship and PROVE IT TOO but i feel i’m not getting the same reciprocation. I really don’t want to just throw away all the experiences we have w good situations and the time we’ve spent already together. 
All the people I talk to give me not the best advice as it’s usually negative towards him which isn’t always helpful lol. If anyone read this whole thing, please kindly help me out and give me some advice on what’s something’s you would try or do in my shoes for this relationship?? 

TL;DR - My boyfriend has too many females he allows in his life and spends time with people that are not really the greatest seeming “friends” to be with when your in a long term relationship. I feel as if they are a higher priority than me and our relationship.

2025-02-25 22:59:29,1iy8j5h,My girlfriend (F23) told me (M23) that I have to choose either my best friend (M24) or her,"I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a little over 5 years. This is my first serious relationship, I’ve talked to girls in the past but nothing past a few months. We started dating when I was a freshman in college and have been together since. I have a friend who I’ve known since high school, him and my girlfriend used to go to high school together and were friendly back then. When I started dating her, my friends (specifically the friend I am talking about) began to make comments about my girlfriend. They said a lot of terrible things about her appearance that she eventually found out about from a mutual friend and it upset her a lot. I don’t know why they suddenly all started to mock me about my relationship, but I didn’t do anything about it. I know I should’ve stood up for her, I just didn’t really have a lot of confidence about myself and didn’t like causing more conflict. It’s something I’ve regretted for so long and has sat in the back of my relationship since. 

For obvious reasons, she does not like my friend because of this. There were a handful of times they interacted at parties or trips, but for the most part they didn’t talk. We kept in touch during college, saw each other from time to time, but for the most part we weren’t hanging out a lot. I never addressed any of the comments he said about her.  

In college, I had other friends she didn’t like that I’ve since cut off. These were girls (F23) that I had classes with and I actually lived with two of them in my junior-senior years. The fall semester of my first year, before I started talking to my girlfriend in the winter, i took a snapchat of me with a clown filter and a caption asking which of the two girls I was friends with I should ask out. I sent this to my friend groupchat from home, it was saved in my groupchat and eventually seen years later by my girlfriend. I wanna be clear— I never pursued anything with these girls. Genuinely, I did not want to mess up my relationship with my girlfriend or my friendship with them, so any feeling I had for them were lost. 

I honestly should’ve stopped being friends with them after this, but I went to a small college and was a science major, so we shared a lot of the same classes together. Also, I didn’t like starting any conflict or drama— I just wanted to keep things friendly. Anyway fast-forward to my junior year when I was living with them and two other guys. Initially, my girlfriend was friends with them, she didn’t have any issues. One day she went through my phone while I was sleeping and saw the picture from my freshman year. She did not initially tell me this, but eventually we got into a big fight and she told me about the picture and about how she felt insecure about me spending time with them. Now I’m in a huge pile of shit because I’m literally living with these girls, the rent we have is super cheap and it’s a nice place not far from campus, but I did agree with her and started to pull away from them. A couple weeks go by and they start to notice, one of them approaches me and I tell her that I thought I was too involved with them. They blame my girlfriend and it starts a fight within the house, now they don’t like her. I spent my senior year trying to play middle ground with my girlfriend and my roommates. 

The summer after I graduated and moved out, I blocked my roommates and have not talked to them since. The two years I’ve been out of college our relationship has been on and off. Since I’ve been home and back in my hometown, I’ve been hanging out a lot with my old group of friends from highschool, specifically my best friend she doesn’t like. While she never flat out told me to stop hanging out with him until know, overtime we began to argue more and more about my friends and what they said in the past. This summer, we got into a fight about my friends and so I decided to just go talk to my best friend and finally address it. We talked, and he apologized, but he told me he did not remember making the comment that really upset her. Honestly, I knew it was bullshit, but I just let it slide. 

This past January we got into a fight and she told me that I have to choose either my best friend or her if I still want to see her. I chose her, and for a month I completely cut off my friends and just disappeared. She only does not like my best friend, but the problem is that he’s always around, so I can’t really hang out with my other friends without him around. I know this was not the right decision, but I couldn’t see my life without her. After a few weeks, my best friend comes to my house to check on me. I don’t really tell him what’s going on, just that I was taking a break from things. I didn’t really want to have the conversation start up again with my friends blaming her, so I started talking a little in the groupchat, but still not really hanging out.

This past week my one friend got a new job, so I decided to go out to celebrate with them. While together, my best friend asks me if I want to go to a race him and my other friend are running in. I decide to go, but I don’t tell my girlfriend. She found out through an Instagram post he made and now I’m back where I was a month ago. 

TL;DR: my girlfriend wants me to choose between my best friend and her. I do love her a lot and see a future with her, but I don’t really know if I can keep living like this. I already nuked the connections with my roommates in college, but I don’t want to do that again with my friends from home. Really, I’m just looking for suggestions on what to do or if I’m just being stupidly blind.

2025-02-25 22:51:04,1iy8cfo,My boyfriend (29M) lied about having hooked up with his friend. I’m (25F) still not over it and don’t want them to hang out.,"I asked my boyfriend multiple times throughout our 2 year relationship if he had hooked up with his friend from home in the past. He said no each time. We moved back to his home town and hung out with her a few times. I always had my suspicions and deep down knew. It wasn’t until his dad got really drunk and mentioned something and the truth came out. They had a causal hook up relationship on and off for years. He said he initially lied because he didn’t think we’d ever meet and didn’t want to upset me and then the lie just spiraled. This was a huge betrayal of my trust and morals. We almost broke up when I found out and it was very difficult for months. 

That was 8 months ago and it still makes me seethe that he would lie to me. I have a problem with obsessive ruminating and still get so upset about it. We agreed he would no longer hang out with this girl. I am not threatened by her but having a casual on and off again thing with a friend is very unsettling to me. He stopped hanging out with her or reaching out from that day until recently. He recently went to their other friends birthday gathering (12 or so people) and she was there.

We now have another invite to a gathering she will be at.

2025-02-25 21:46:08,1iy6t3z,I (21F) am frustrated at my boyfriend’s (24M) occasional paranoia. Am I overreacting?,"I (21F) have been dating my bf (24M) for about 2 years. We met in college, and he’s graduated since, so now we live a 30 minute drive apart from one another. So, about 6 months ago, we started having frequent arguments because my partner was anxious about me partying with my friends since he’s no longer around our college campus . I understood his point of view, and he proposed for us to share locations with one another on Life360 so he could know where I was at all times. I was hesitant about this since I lean more avoidant attachment in this relationship, but agreed nonetheless.

Fast forward to now, our relationship is mostly smooth, we’ve met each others families, there’s been no cheating at all through our relationship. However, I’ve been getting frustrated because my boyfriend still has his moments of paranoia. For example, last night, before going to sleep, he messages me: “Hey, where were you today from 1-4 pm?” I responded: “at home, why?” He replied “So you weren’t across the street?” I responded: “correct, I was at home”

He then sent me a screenshot from Life360 that my location was roaming to right across the street from my apartment. Immediately, I got a bad feeling in my gut that he was accusing me of something. I told him I didn’t appreciate his accusation and he replied “It makes me more suspicious when you respond badly to these questions.”

Naturally, his response made me even more frustrated. This is a pretty frequent occurrence, even when I honestly tell him what I was doing, he asks me for pictures or some sort of proof. Am I overreacting at this incident? Should I have handled it better? Or is this a sign that we aren’t compatible?

2025-02-25 21:17:10,1iy63ql,Girlfriends friend doesn't like me,"TL;DR One of my (M25) girlfriends (F34) good male friends dislikes me and she doesn't see it at all.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 7 months. The relationship is pretty perfect aside from this one issue. A good male friend of hers quite obviously wants nothing to do with me.

The guy in question told my partner, before we got together that he had a crush on her and ""Couldn't stop thinking about her"". It's worth mentioning that I trust my partner fully, she was in an abusive relationship prior to us getting together where she was cheated on (among other things) for years. 

However, this friend still spends a fair bit of time with her but won't even reply to my messages. I recently did him a big favour and he didn't even send me a quick text thanking me for helping him out. 

In my mind there is only one reason why he would dislike me and want nothing to do with me. I've bought this up with my girlfriend but she just says ""He has no reason to dislike you, he's just pretty busy"". Funnily enough he will message her a chat but doesn't have time to send me a quick message after I really went out my way to help him out. 

How do i navigate this situation. I don't trust him at all but I also don't want to seem controlling by telling my partner that she can't hang out with him. 

If I was in her position and she was made to feel uncomfortable by a friend of mine I would either speak to them sternly about the situation or would cut off contact out of respect for her.

We both work full time and do housework. It’s not just a time thing. She just has completely let go of these things and it makes it feel like she’s, well, a zombie. All she wants to do is sit around on her phone on social media and the only things she wants to talk about are ‘topic of the day’ social media outrage. She doesn’t really have any friends independent of me, or do much of anything besides be with me. Seriously. I think the only thing she does when she’s home and I’m not is clean compulsively or sit on her phone. What do I do about this? It’s depressing me. I fell in love with her because she was so dynamic and interesting to talk to and adventurous. And now she’s just not.

2025-02-25 19:54:14,1iy43l5,I (m29) think im falling out of love with my gf (f29) and I dont know what to do,"Hi everyone!

So backstory, I (29m) have been dating my gf (29f) for 5 years now, living together for 3 of those years. We are the stereotypical 'fell in love at university' couple.

Most of our time spent together has been great. We share alot of common values and some common interests and fancy the heck out of each other, physically (I also have some kinks that she is very supporting of). Even the last 3 years of living together has been pretty good (save for the occasional few days where we fight and argue).

However, recently, I've been feeling very...hollow. There are many reasons for this, mostly due to increasing work stress and my friend group growing more distant (some have moved out of the area). With the latter in particular, I am finding that I need to get out and find a community and grow as a person. Admittedly, I feel I have leant on this friend group too much and have neglected finding my own interests and, dare I say, personality. I am trying to focus more on myself now, but I'm seeing that it is coming at a cost of my relationship as my gf and I are spending significantly less time together. And when we are spending time together I'm still focused on my own personal development. We have talked about this and she is OK with us focusing on ourselves, but I feel like it's coming at a cost of my feelings for her.

In addition, I am concerned about doing things together with her as she has a pretty big problem with people pleasing, particularly in front of new people. She comes on way too hard and it puts people off alot of the time. She knows that it comes from a deep-seated need for attention which she agrees she could benefit with therapy. But it means that her social group is very small and makes me concerned about building joint connections with others.

This points me to thinking that the relationship is coming to an end. I don't want to hold her into a relationship that is lacking in feelings, and waste her time. But at the same time, I am terrified of losing her. We share so many common values and we understand each other pretty well. I'm pretty sure I can marry this woman, but I just feel like I'm not fully developed as a person yet. I keep thinking about raising children and I just don't see how they can look up to a man who still has so much to achieve and struggles to demonstrate personality (I'm seeing a therapist about the latter issue).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

2025-02-25 19:29:42,1iy3i56,My (48) wife (43) is fine with sex once a month or less. What to do?,"Hi Everyone,

Here we go...Same old story...I have a high libido and my wife's is quite low. We have been together for seven years. She is comfortable with having sex once a month at the most, I would like it once a day which I do realize is a huge imbalance but even once a week would be a compromise. I am 48, she is 43. We have two young children which certainly contribute to us not having time for each other. We are also middle class and struggling financially, so babysitters, nannies, etc. are out of the conversation. Despite these hurdles, I still think there is time, at least once a week anyway...

Throughout my life, especially in my forties, I have waited for my libido to drop because it seems like a bit of a curse, especially at my age where it is supposed to have decreased by now.

I work two jobs. She is a stay at home mom. I also contribute to helping with the kids and the housework. I sleep very little (about six hours on average a night) but my libido is still quite strong.

Like most couples, the sex was pretty hot and heavy in the very beginning, but began to lag as time went on and the sex really dropped since having our second kid. The first big drop came the instant I moved in with her years ago. Year by year it gets worse. In the last two years we have had sex maybe 20 times.

We talk about the subject often because I am always grumpy and edgy. There is always a typical excuse on her part. Too tired, headache, etc. I just think it is two different libidos at work here which seems to be quite common.

Part of the problem is that I think she is the hottest woman alive. Just a smokeshow. I am still so attracted to her even after all this time. This contributes to my edginess.

Also, I often have stopped initiating due to rejection which leads to more resentment on my part and her feeling pressured. Ugh.

My question is should I continue to go like this? I love her, my life, etc. The only part where I am unfulfilled is in bed. Do I just suck it up and have a miserable sex life for the remainder of my years? I don't expect her to want to have sex just for me, I want her to want it too. At this point I just don't see it happening.

2025-02-25 19:08:12,1iy2zj7,First relationship,"TL;DR: I (26F) keep seeing my boyfriend’s (31M) Facebook searches full of sexy girls, which makes me insecure. He denies searching for them, claiming it's accidental, but I don’t believe him. I forgave him before, even when I caught him watching porn, but it keeps happening. We’ve been together for four years, live together, and even have a mortgage. He’s kind to me otherwise, but I don’t know if this is a dealbreaker. I feel stuck and don’t know what to do.


I (26F) keep seeing my boyfriend’s (31M) searches on Facebook, and they’re full of sexy girls. It’s making me feel really insecure.

We’ve talked about this before because the first time I caught him, I was furious and asked why these girls were showing up in his search bar. He insisted that he didn’t search for them, claiming they just appeared in his video feed and that he ""accidentally"" clicked on their profiles. I told him there’s no such thing as accidentally clicking, and I called him a liar. But he keeps insisting that he’s not searching for these girls and that he only loves me.

I forgave him. I also forgave him when I caught him masturbating to a porn video, thinking it’s normal for guys to watch porn from time to time. But just today, I saw another new girl—a sexy girl—in his search bar, and I don’t think this is normal anymore.

It’s really hard for me because we’ve been together for four years. He’s my first everything—my first relationship—and I don’t know if this is something that warrants a breakup. He knows it hurts me whenever I see his searches, but I don’t see any real change.

I know he loves me. We’ve been living together for four years, and I can feel his love. He’s kind to me, and aside from this issue (and sometimes his immaturity, like playing video games too much), I don’t have any major problems with him.

I don’t know if I should continue this relationship. It’s especially difficult because we have a mortgage together—we decided to buy our own home—and I’ve invested so much in this relationship financially, physically, and emotionally.

I don't really know if I should continue this relationship. I don't have friends that I could talk to about this so hopefully I could get some advice here.

2025-02-25 18:48:11,1iy2hq8,I feel like my (29F) boyfriend (33M) does not want to be with me,"Throwaway because he knows my personal account and I'm just looking for input from third party people.

  
My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half at this point, been living together for the majority of it (fast I know). All has been good, we fit together well, we have the same world views, life ideologies, everything. Genuinely felt as this is the man I will spend my life with.   
He was the one pursuing me in the beginning. Now I'm left feeling sometimes, that all the pretty things (like me being his dream woman) being said at the beginning were just a play on getting the girl. 

To make a long story shorter - arguments have been more frequent. And I'm always left feeling as if I'm in the wrong and I'm trying to understand if that is the case or am I being villanised. 

Let's start off with the big one - checking out other girls. Big thing for us, trying to overcome it. He states it is because he is a man and men biologically are more likely to do so. He is trying to be better, and props to him, he is doing well. It used to be to the point where he got turned on by other girls. Summer is coming, and frankly I am worried. 

I get that it can be me being insecure, I am actively working on it. But I can't help but simply be rubbed the wrong way about my boyfriend checking out other women and being turned on by them, knowing that we maybe have sex 1-2x a week if that and for me to turn him on I have to go to the lengths of wearing pretty lingerie every time to actually get something out of him (because me in sweats is not attractive). Granted this could all be from years of porn usage (which he states he has been recovering from for the last year or so) 

Another point, whenever I mess up and say something mean or do something he doesn't like, I am automatically made to feel as if the worst person ever. It doesn't even have to be big things. Say I'm just feeling particularly sad that day, or depressed. Immediately I'm made feel as if that is how I am always. Being told how being with someone who is sad or unhappy all the time is tiring. Mind you, I try my best to be in good spirits most days knowing how much it affects him, so I am very conscious and mindful of it. 

We almost never cuddle anymore, or have quality time in the house besides us watching a show.   
Also a pattern here, as I've brought this up multiple times, but I am asking too much. I know he has a lot on his plate. He is doing a lot and I am very supportive and happy for him focusing his energy on stuff that brings him joy. However, sometimes I also want to matter? 

And another big one - he almost never says the three words. And if he does, it's a simple ""love ya"". It took him a while to finally say it to me anyway at the beginning of our relationship, which is fair and I understand fully. I'd rather a person take their time and say it, than say it just because.

However, almost never hearing it from your partner is becoming more and more hurtful. Would it kill him to just say ""I love you"" to me once in a while?   
He is incredibly scared of opening up and loving, as he puts it ""have said I love you every day in previous relationships, and for what? we still ended things?"" 

  
He has admitted he does not feel 100% committed. Maybe 90% if that. Which has left me feeling not secure fully and even more scared of other women, even though he would never be a cheater. Which I've communicated to him. I've been trying to be an individual. However, I am slowly, due to all of this, feeling as if I am pulling away and distancing myself, in hopes he realises things, bc nothing else helps any longer. 

  
Whenever there is an inconvenience, or even sometimes on good days, it feels as if he is purposely pushing me away and making me the villain, which is a trait he does have and he acknowledges it.

  
I've been actively working on myself, therapy, working out, taking care of my looks (makeup, hair the whole shebang), and in some ways I have been feeling like I've been finding and losing myself all at the same time. It's as if 90% of me is doing all this to feel confident and love myself more, but the 10% is trying to fit myself in a mold of what he would like in a woman. 

I'm constantly trying to keep the house tidy, make sure there's food ready, make sure he feels comfortable and loved and accepted. Hear him out, and offer my constructive feedback and advice on stuff he is struggling with. Have been trying to create a stress free open space for him to come to me with anything and everything without judgement.

  
I am at my wits end and starting to feel as if he does not want to be with me and am scared that this won't work in the long run. I am at an age where I want to be settled down, make a life for myself and a family. 

  
TL;DR:   
Bf of 1.5 years rarely says I love you, tends to check out other women, is constantly stressed and working and villainises me making me feel like a bad girlfriend. 

","Am I overreacting about my boyfriend checking out other women and rarely saying ""I love you,"" or should I be concerned about our relationship?","The individual is currently in a romantic relationship with their boyfriend for about a year and a half, during which they have been living together for the majority of the time.

I love her dearly, and in general she is a very kind and caring person.  But recently her mental health issues have been very draining.

For some background I am quite an anxious person, I get stressed and overwhelmed easily.  It seems to run in my family, but I also suffered some bad physical bullying when I was in school, to the point where I ended up in hospital and I ended up being home schooled.

I did this for two reason, one of them being for myself to improve my quality of life and the other being so that I can be a better partner for my girlfriend.

She has always suffered with anxiety and major insecurity issues, to the point where in our first year of dating she would regularly try and go through my phone in my sleep, or repeatedly look through my instagram followers and questioning me about certain people.  It got to the point where this almost broke us up, and once I made my boundaries clear she stopped this behaviour.

Anyway I am starting to find her difficult to be around and draining.  She lets her insecurities and anxiety make up most of her personality these days, struggles to keep friends and always seems to struggle to hold down jobs.  She is extremely negative about everything whether that be her job, her studies, her parents, how she doesn’t like this and so on.  It is literally everything.

90% of the texts I now receive from her throughout the day are her complaining about something.  This can range from how she woke up earlier than she wanted to which has now “ruined her day”, how the barista in the coffee shop is too slow for her liking, or the tone of voice a text from her parents came across in.  She is very sensitive and cries about a lot, so I find it hard to approach how to help her.

I have suggested therapy for the past 2 years now, explaining how there is no shame and I even did a long intensive course myself (which she knows obviously).  She has the means of funding it, I even offered to pay, but she just won’t do it.

She says she will to keep me quiet, but nothing ever changes.  I don’t know if it is laziness, not wanting to change, or just being scared.

I really am at a loss, as her negativity and constant downer is becoming very draining.  I don’t know how many times I can try and help her, because if she doesn’t want to make any changes herself then why should I bother.

I do love her and I really don’t want our relationship to end, because there have been several good bits.  But I don’t know how long I can carry on living in her permanent misery.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you.

2025-02-25 18:40:22,1iy2aoz,"My (23m) mother (56m) is very needy and dependent, and the origin of this behavior is problematic.","
For a little background information, my family has been somewhat struggling (mostly emotionally) since my father died of a heart attack two years ago. It was extremely hard on my mom, and as a result, her alcohol consumption increased. This would result in her feeling like sh*t in the morning, being late/calling off work, and the annoying part, being quite needy to my brother (25m) and I.
    
I had no job when my dad died, so I didn't mind doing stuff around the house and whatnot obviously, especially considering she's understanding enough not to charge me rent. While I would look for truck driving jobs(I had acquired my CDL six weeks after the death of my father), I would also do things around the house, go to the store for my mom, etc, because it makes sense obviously given my situation. 
    
However, this is where things started getting ridiculous. It's late 2023, and I had just come home after truck driving turned out to be a flop (I b*tched out after a week lol). A couple months later I decide Im gonna sign up for doordash and just drive full time. I figured I could make some money, and getting out of the house more would make me feel better. At this point, though, my moms alcoholism had worsened, going through a couple small boxes of wine DAILY. She would keep asking me to go to the store while I was working to get groceries, but I would also get wine every time I'd go to the store. Obviously, this would cut into my schedule, and affect my income due to productivity loss. All I wanted was to feel like I could support myself.
   
She would start asking my brother or myself to take her to work; My brother and I figured out she was now drinking in the morning. After a certain point I would just dread talking to her because I knew it was gonna be the same old same old. This would result in me just sneaking out and doordashing just so I can avoid having to do stuff for her. However, she would still call me, ask me why I snuck out, and then proceed to ask for more wine (and groceries, but mostly wine). The fact that she was taking advantage of me being able to work anytime I please really annoyed me. I didn't immediately tell her she was annoying me because I didn't want to feel selfish. Still loving my mother, obviously, this internal conflict just really stressed me out. 
    
I started a pest control job in late march (2024) and even during my shift she'd call me asking when I get off so I can either get her wine or pick her up from work. In June, I got fired from the job for reasons I wont get into on this thread. I decided to doordash full time again, and her annoying habits worsened. My car was also starting to give me a hard time after dashing so much, so that just added to the stress. By this point I already expressed how I felt with my mom about her being a needy alcoholic (I know it sounds mean, but it's the truth). Even though my brother and I have expressed our concerns, she's showing little to no interest in changing her ways.
    
Fastforward to January of 2025. My friends and I had recently did a bunch of work on my car and got it working better, so I was confident I could live on my own just dashing (and now instacart too). I had just saved up about 4 grand or some sh*t, and I decided I couldn't deal with this sh*t with my mom anymore, so I moved out about 20 minutes away in the country. I have three roommates so expenses are manageable. I thought, sh*t, I don't live at home anymore so maybe she will learn to finally change her habits and take care of herself. WRONG! She would call me when Im twenty minutes away doordashing, asking me to come home and show the delivery man my ID so she can get her wine (her license expired october 2024 and she wouldn't get it renewed, smh). I was furious after getting this call, but remembered my passport was still at the house so I kept my cool and told her to use that. However, she would still try to ask me to get stuff from the store even though Im 20 minutes away trying to live my own life. You'd think she wouldn't want to inconvenience someone working, but nope. 
    
I will say this though. In her defense, our basement had recently flooded with a bunch of crap after something went wrong with our plumming (idk the details), so doing some things for her was actually reasonable. For instance, I wouldn't mind being over there because she doesn't feel comfortable being around random male workers at the house, particularly at night. It still didn't change the fact that she would still ask me to get her wine and sh*t though.

Fastforward to February. My mom is deteriorating. She is weak all over her body, and is now calling me while my brother is at work to come help her in and out of bed. She also would have to have me help her get off the toilet; that's how feeble she was. My brother still lives at home so he would help her when he wasn't at work. The turning point was Superbowl Sunday. I was at my house, drinking with my friends, watching the game. My brother calls me four times, but I have a tendency to ignore him since he can also be annoying. The fifth time I finally answer, and he tells me that mom is on the way to the er. Alcoholism finally caught up to her. I was extremely worried obviously, so I ubered to the er since I was too drunk to drive. She has a wine belly, and low and behold, the nurses and doctors said what we already knew. She has quit drinking since then. It has been 15 days since the incident and her last drink, and she has regained basically all of her strength. She is becoming independent again, and is telling me she feels happier. This makes me feel great!

However, she will still call me like 4+ times per day just to check up on me, and will send several texts in between those calls. It's usually the same conversation too, like nothing ever changes with my life cause you're always calling so frequently wanting to know what I'm doing lol. However.... I love her very much and Im ultimately happy she's trying to improve herself. Thanks for reading this absolute mouthful.

At this point, does anyone know what I should do? It would be nice to get the perspective of someone my age as well as an older woman

2025-02-25 18:38:35,1iy292a,My BF doesn't want me to hang out with a man who has shown interest in me,"Last week I (F24) went to a hip-hop concert with a friend. At the bar a man invited us to have a shot with him. He was friendly and we chatted a bit. It turned out that he also played classical guitar, like me. I was kind of thrilled because I don't often meet people who play guitar and even less people who play classical guitar.

Later he asked for my number so we could chat about music and maybe play together (he was also a bit tipsy when he asked for it). I immediately told him that I had a boyfriend but that we could hang out. It was pretty obvious that he was kind of disappointed and didn't want my number.

While my guyfriend was at the concert, we bought some drinks and had a really good chat about music and guitar stuff. At some point he must have changed his mind because he said he'd like to have a jam session with me (even though I have a boyfriend).

My boyfriend (M30) also plays the guitar, but he's more into jazz and bossa nova stuff (which I'm not that familiar with) and he's much better than I am. It's hard to play with him; when he pulls out his mega chords I feel insecure (and unlike him, I'm not that good at jamming either). He also has a guitar buddy with whom he jams regularly.

He encourages me to find a guitarbuddy too, because I'd benefit a lot from it. But the thing is that the people in my age group at the music school have been playing for 6-8 years and are much better than me. I know I shouldn't compare myself, but I wouldn't feel comfortable playing with someone so out of my league.

But this concert guy I met last week seems to be on my level. But when I told my boyfriend about it, he said he'd be very uncomfortable with me hanging out with a man who's clearly shown some interest in me. I said that I had made it clear to him that I wasn't single and wasn't interested in anything more than a platonic relationship. Having made that point clear, this shouldn't be a problem, right?

Concertguy knows I'm not single, so why would he hang out with me if not for guitar reasons only? Or am I just being naive? My boyfriend trusts me not to letting myself getting seduced, but he still doesn't want me to hang out with him but to blocks his contact instead.

I think it's also important to mention here that we're having a hard time right now and he just wants to avoid any potential danger to our relationship.

I'm really sad about that because I've been wanting to jam around with someone my league very long. So, should I block the contact or convince my BF? If the concert guy tries to make a move i'd obviously would cut off the contact.

Tldnr: met a man who also plays guitar. He showed interest in me,  i said I'm not single. Nevertheless we both want to hang out to play guitar but my BF would not approve this

EDIT: Just to make it clear, I'm having absolutely no interest in concert guy

EDIT 2: okay guys, thank you for your insights! I was being naive about this. I genuine believed he would have no intentions, I'm not that much around guys.

2025-02-25 16:29:49,1ixz2sy,My (27F) boyfriend (27M) had the realization that his concerning behavior in our relationship is about control. What now?,"Hello, I was hoping you all might be able to provide some insight on this situation with my boyfriend. I am completely baffled and a little freaked out by this. Its a long story, but I’ll try to keep it brief:

We have been together for four years and live together. About one year into dating, after we started living together, I started noticing certain odd behaviors—like an inexplicable cold shoulder or strange refusal to talk for long periods of time. When I would ask why he was being so quiet or if he was annoyed, he’d always say “what? I’ve been acting completely normal.”

This sort of escalated very slowly over time, to where he’d be outright condescending, critical, correct me in front of my friends, etc… basically very plainly seeming annoyed with me. Then, when I would ask about it, he would deny every having done those things and insist that he was feeling completely normally towards me. He was frequently correcting my telling of events, as well, so that it seemed like I was completely misremembering situations (even just simple things, like how many times per week he does some activity). It got to where I felt really confused, and was doing a bunch of research to try and figure out what my issue was.

In the last year, he’s started doing some things that I initially attributed to anger issues. There were several things, all fairly small but definitely off putting. The biggest was an incident where we got into an argument while he was driving my car, and he pulled some aggressive driving stunt in response to something I said. Then, when I tried to ask about this event afterward and suggest that he may have some anger thing, he was completely disdainful and even laughed at me in response. 

Well, I came close to ending it with him over this. He was extremely remorseful and pleaded for another chance—he promised to do couple’s and individual therapy to work on his issues. I agreed, with a timeline (if there’s not noticeable improvement within two months, I am done).

Fast forward to now, we have been doing couple’s therapy and he’s been a lot more emotionally available and open about his thoughts and motivations. BUT the explanations are jarring.

I thought he was dealing with anger issues, but it has come to light that he was not actually *that* angry. He said he was thinking clearly in the driving situation and the other situations—it was more about making a point. After further discussion, he said he thinks that the aggressive behaviors and the gaslighting/correcting are all sort of based on a desire to control the situation. I.e. he doesn’t like something, so he’s asserting his control over it. He has reiterated that he “just likes us to be on the same page”—his page?

While it’s encouraging that he’s being so much more open and self aware now, I am pretty disturbed by the explanations. Anger issues seem like a cut and dry issue that therapy could help with—aggression based in control? I’m not too sure.

We have been together for four years and live together, and have a dog. Much of our relationship has been good, and there are a lot of things I love about him. It’s also not like he treats me like crap all the time, it’s just these occasional really weird behaviors that are distressing. Still, I’m not sure if I should wait it out and see if he can turn over a new leaf (given his newfound self awareness and therapy), or if I should call it quits and move on. Any advice?

**TL;DR: My boyfriend of four years has recently had a realization that his periodic weird/intense behavior was about having control in our relationship. He says he is turning over a new leaf and is working on this in therapy. I’m not sure if I should wait it out and see if he actually can turn over a new leaf, or if I should call it quits and move on. We have been together a long time and there’s a lot of love left.

2025-02-25 15:41:03,1ixxwyj,Need advice on how to handle a difficult conversation re: moving abroad,"Hi Reddit,

I am currently a 33M living in the UK. I am a teacher and have been offered a job in New Zealand. 

My wife (35F) is also a teacher but she is the main motive for the move. Half of her family live in NZ and she has always wanted to 'end up' there. We have 2 children (aged 3 and 9). We spoke recently that if we were to move to NZ it would have to be for a dream job and improve our quality of life. We also wanted to do it before our kids grow up and are doing examinations.

I was fully prepared to reject the job as my wife would be quitting work, my salary alone wasn't enough etc etc ..and most importantly our current quality of life is good! 

However, the school in NZ is a private school and have offered to pay me more than I've ever earned, and then to sweeten the deal offered me a 'no costs attached' rent free house that the school own. Along with flights etc ... Oh, they've also offered places for my children in this very prestigious independent school..this has tipped the decision and we want to take it. It's the best time for the kids and we can't really expect to be offered any more! Needless to say it's a management role at the school.

Me and my wife are excited, we have family there who are excited, my kids are excited....but I'm terrified of my narcissistic mother.

My mother is a functioning alcoholic who will emotionally blackmail, drink to cope with emotions and will then guilt trip you to high hell and back ....now this would be fine if I had a bad relationship with my mum. Sadly, I've grown up normalising my mum's behaviour (it was only my wife that made me realise she was a narcissist).

I worry often that the fact I worry so much about her opinion is due to her successfully being a narcissist!

But the thing that I'm dreading is when she guilt trips me for taking the grandkids away from her....I know I'm going to struggle with this massively. Regardless of the fact that it's what is best for my family financially and opportunity wise.

I'm lucky that my older brother and dad will be understanding and 'know what mums like'. However, they are also enablers (maybe not enablers but definitely allow it). We've clearly developed a really unhealthy attitude where calling mum out on it is not an option we have ever taken.

My mum recently had a go as I hadn't seen her since Christmas....it's been 2 months! 

I'm dreading having the conversation and I hate how it makes me anxious and I know if I spiralled I'd talk myself out the job.

My wife is super supportive....but any advice from relationship experts or people who experience similar would be appreciated.

Thank you....

We’re together all the time so he wouldn’t even have time to cheat. He’s cut off friends who were mean to me (we had some issues with a female friend in the beginning but that has been resolved).

2025-02-25 12:55:08,1ixub37,"My (20F) boyfriend (23M) cheated, and I don’t know if I should leave or stay.","
My boyfriend and I are both in our 4th semester of law school. He’s Muslim (religious), and I’m Hindu (not religious). He’s an extrovert from this city, living with his family, while I moved here from another state and live in a PG. We have very different backgrounds—I’m from a wealthy family and care about my education, while he struggles financially and doesn’t focus much on studies.

We started as friends but drifted apart due to drama in our group. After reconnecting, we kissed, slept together, and became romantic, though we weren’t officially dating at first. Two months later, he asked me to be his girlfriend with flowers and a ring, promising to love me forever and marry me.

Our relationship was amazing at first. He was incredibly caring—hand-feeding me, taking care of me when I was sick, always making sure I was okay. I had a traumatic childhood with neglectful parents, so I had never experienced this kind of love before. I became very attached to him because I live alone here with no friends or family. He was my safe space.

However, he has a lot of family issues—financial struggles, loans, and his sister secretly marrying and moving abroad. I tried to be there for him, but I admit I was sometimes selfish, wanting his attention when he was stressed. Since we had no friends, he tried making some, but they only used him for his car/bike and made degrading comments about me out of jealousy. Eventually, we were back to just the two of us.

I go home every semester break, and the first time we were apart, we both missed each other terribly. When I returned, I made him study, and for the first time in his life, he passed all his exams. I was so proud. I also gave him full access to my phone and social media after he asked, though I hesitated at first. A few days before my birthday, he saw I had Twitter and assumed I was texting guys. In reality, I only used it to watch porn. He was upset but acted normal the next day. On my birthday, despite his financial issues, he planned a dinner, invited classmates, bought me gifts, and paid for everything. I felt so loved that I even considered converting and marrying him. He made me softer, more feminine, and truly happy.

Then, things fell apart.

When I returned from my December break, I discovered he had multiple fake Instagram and Snapchat accounts to text girls. I was furious and, out of anger, added guys to my Snapchat for a few days (I told him before doing this). I removed them after he asked, and he promised never to hurt me again.

But a week later, I found out something worse. A classmate he had invited to my birthday party showed me his texts with her from December. He had been flirting, sharing personal details about me, and trying to get her to sext him. He told her he would never leave me, but the messages were shameless. She encouraged it because she’s an attention-seeker.

I was devastated. When I confronted him, I slapped him multiple times. He got pissed and told his close friend, who then called me and said, “How dare you slap my friend?” At first, he tried to blame me, saying he couldn’t trust me, but then he admitted he was wrong and promised to change.

I reached out to his exes and found out he had done this to all of them. He used multiple platforms—Instagram, Snapchat, Telegram, Discord—to text other girls. When I bring up the pain he caused, he gets defensive and annoyed, so I’ve stopped talking about it. He just wants me to “be fine” with him. He has apologized repeatedly and says he loves me and will change, but I’m scared.

He was my first true love, treated me better than anyone in my life, but also hurt me worse than anyone ever has. I started smoking again to cope. He had made my life and studies better, but now I’m falling apart—I’m skipping classes, not eating, not sleeping. I know I should leave, but what if he really changes? I don’t know if I can be without him.

TL;DR: My boyfriend was perfect—caring, supportive, and helped me improve my life. But he also emotionally cheated on me, texting multiple girls. He apologized and promises to change, but I don’t know if I can trust him. Leaving him means losing my only source of love and support, but staying means risking more heartbreak.

I figured maybe I could find some advice here. My bf, I'm just going to refer to as J from now on, is such a cool and interesting person. I love him so so much, we've been good friends for the last 4 years and have dated on and off since we've met. We met in middle school and, to be completely honest, he's my first boyfriend. I have always had trouble connecting with others, but J has always been there. We were dating in-person for the first few months of our relationship, but for reasons I won't bother typing up, we both ended up moving away to different parts of the country. Even though we were far away, we've always kept in touch, Sending memes and joking around with eachother like always. Eventually, we ended up long distant dating again and have been going steady for the last 3 months. 

I'll be honest, I'm a quiet person, or that's what people say that I'm like. I have a hard time connecting with others. I enjoy listening to other people talk about themselves, and J is a very talkative and social person, the complete opposite of me.
Recently, he's been saying that I've been distant, and that he doesn't know me at all, he had called me last night asking if anything was going on, which nothing has. 
I've always been depressed and suffered with anxiety and fatigue, wich really effects how i intract with people, and ive realized i can be very avoidative and people pleaseing at times without even realizing. He texts me all the time and if I don't reply right away he starts lovebombng me and asking if he's ever good enough. I feel so guilty because it's hard for me to resupricate the same energy. 
After yeasterday, I told him I needed a break and wanted to talk later. To be clear for the last few days, I've been sick with pneumonia so I hadn't texted him as much recently, but now i think i should have been more clear that this was the case. Yes he says he knows I was sick yes wanted to know if anything was wrong with me anyway. 
This afternoon, he called me saying we had to talk. I reluctantly picked up his call because he seemed very distraught, and when I did he was crying. So while we weren't talking (this had been only a day) he went through my message history on numerous discord servers that I was in. He found a screenshot that I had shared about 5 months ago, one of him bombarding me with a wall of about 20 texts asking why I wasn't replying to his messages, at that time I hadent had my phone so I found it quite uncomfortable on my part. I had uploaded it to the server asking what others thought and they reciprocate committing that it was odd behavior.
J was sobbing while calling me saying that I had betrayed him by sharing screen shots of our conversation to people he didn't know, and that in a million years he never thought I would hurt him in such a way. I had only talked about him twice with others, j was very offended that I referred to him as a 'friend' and that he feels sick and that he feels I had made fun of him behind his back. 
I just want to note that the messages in question had no personal information about him or me, and was him questioning me over and over about my whereabouts. J mentioned how he felt like he doesn't even know me anymore as 'every conversation we had' I had also had in that server, as in memes and art that I share with other people. J expresses how he doesn't want to talk to me right now and feels we can't even be friends anymore, and that he's sacrificed so much to talk to me evey day.
I just feel torn up and don't know what to do.

Now looking back it was a very stupid of me to vent into a public server about my relationship. Omg I've hurt him so bad I don't even know what to do. I just want to go back to how things were before, yet I know I'm just a terrible person who can never keep any relationship because I'm just stupid. How do I even salvage this??

2025-02-25 07:35:51,1ixpjup,Need advice re: bf’s mental health,"Hello,

As the title suggests, I (31f) need help regarding my boyfriend’s (31m) mental health. We’ve been together for 3 years now. He is doing all the right things, seeing a therapist, reading self help books but his anxiety is at an all time high right now and it’s causing issues in our relationship. 

He is constantly worrying about money, about his career, about losing our home when I consider us very fortunate to be in comfortable jobs with our own home that we love. I don’t see us having money issues, we’re just like any 30 somethings living in an expensive city. I don’t want to be like this but it feels like I’m constantly lecturing him about gratitude and mindfulness. I’ve mentioned to him that I want him to be able to share the mental load when we start having kids and right now, I don’t feel like I can. We’ve been arguing the past few days about similar topics and I’m getting so sick of it. 

It’s constant. For example, sometimes when we’re grocery shopping and I’m carrying heavy bags, he’s so in his own thoughts that he doesn’t think to help me. There’s so many little things like this. He knows to help me but he’s so caught up in his thoughts. 

He hates this about himself and he’s told me he hates himself and it’s so difficult to watch him continue like this. I have suggested taking up an exercise routine and sticking to it to boost his confidence and prove his dedication to himself but he doesn’t listen. He is most comfortable watching tv, watching sports but as soon as those programs end, he is back in his thoughts. 

I love him so much and I’m excited for the rest of my life with him but I just need advice on how I can continue to support him and also help him grow stronger as a person. 

TLDR : my boyfriend suffers from anxiety stemming from his lack of confidence and I don’t feel like I can share the mental load of daily life with him. Is there a fix? Or will it be 10000x amplified when we start having kids?

The relationship with my brother-in-law has not been good since the beginning of our relationship. Constant remarks, talking behind our backs,... My husband already told me then that his brother does this with every girlfriend, as if he wants to chase them away. 
This has remained a problem over the years. Due to the nature of the incidents, I started to realize, only after years, that my brother-in-law is probably narcissistic. However, because I am not a psychologist, I cannot make any further statements about this. The symptoms are very strong. 
By going into therapy myself, I came to the conclusion together with my psychologist that I need to maintain better boundaries with toxic people. I have been trying to do this for years with my brother-in-law, but it does not work. 
My husband comes from an enmeshed family. He has also come a long way to be the stronger, more independent man that he is now.  But the thing is, I've been telling him for years that I feel unsafe around his brother, but he keeps pushing me to meet my brother-in-law and sister-in-law. I want to just go low contact, to respect my mental health.

2025-02-25 06:55:13,1ixoz3g,I (F19) am wondering how to healthily love my boyfriend (M20),"how do I healthily love my boyfriend?

I (19F) have been in a very lovely relationship with my (20M) boyfriend for 9ish months. We are both in very busy college majors that take up a lot of our time but still fortunately make a lot of time for each other. Even though this isn’t the longest relationship I’ve been in, this is so far the healthiest. 

I’m so used to relationships filled with codependency, love bombing, or just settling with low expectations. But this kind of relationship is still new to me. 

An argument can be solved in the same day, no ghosting, no disrespect, and we both have the same sense of independence and strive of self-success. 
It’s really nice, and (hopefully this doesn’t sound weird) it feels like how a grown-relationship should be. 

My only issue is, I guess because of my own past with relationships, I feel as if I don’t properly know how to love? I’m so scared I’m gonna screw it up. 
I think about this guy so much, I want to say he’s the one but I also am afraid because I have so much life left to live to even call that. 

I think about silly hypothetical futures with hypothetical apartments and hypothetical dogs with hypothetical 6 figure jobs, that sometimes I feel like I’m delusional towards my own boyfriend! 
I just want him to succeed but also I just want to never be apart from him. 
Everything I want to experience is something I want to experience with him. 
I want to endure all the hard times where I have to communicate properly or even answer 8 layers of “why.” I want to celebrate when he gets results that I know he’s deserved all along. I just don’t really know how to describe this feeling. 

Is there something wrong with me? Do the hard parts of communication get easier? How can I love him better?

2025-02-25 03:44:12,1ixlri2,I (27-F) am Concerned that my Boyfriend (32-M) isn't Ambitious Enough -  Is there something I'm missing?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for four years. Throughout our relationship, I’ve always been the higher earner with a stable career. This is largely because he’s a refugee in the country we live in, which means he cannot legally seek employment. I knew this going into the relationship, but it wasn’t a big concern since we weren’t looking to get married, and I earned enough to support myself comfortably without needing him to contribute.

As long as he could take care of himself, that was fine by me.

When we met, he had a job, but it was extremely exploitative and took a heavy toll on him. I encouraged him to leave, promising to support him while he found something better. For about 4-5 months, I covered our expenses—not a financial strain, but emotionally exhausting due to his frustration and self-doubt.

During this period, he started a Google course that had good freelance prospects but dropped out halfway. Eventually, I helped him find a job, and things stabilized. Later, his workplace offered free coding lessons, which he started but then abandoned as well. He kept talking about how being a developer etc could change is life in the long run but it was frustrating to see him just having this pipe dream and never putting in any effort because he was just always tired.

Another frustration for me was his reluctance to return to personal training, a skill he previously made good money from.

When he was between jobs, I encouraged him to restart, but he said his back injury prevented him. His physio never explicitly said he couldn’t work out, so I chalked it up to anxiety. Fast forward to last year—he joined a gym weight loss challenge, trained intensely, and nearly won. This was a revelation for him, but for me, it was frustrating. I had offered support many times, yet he only took action when external motivation came into play.

Now, the job I helped him secure has become toxic, so he quit—without another job lined up. Given his situation, where employment is scarce, I thought this was reckless.

His friend secured him an interview for an English teaching position, which is very well-paying, but he declined, saying he doesn’t know how to teach. This irked me again—opportunities are rare for him, and I believe if I were in his position, I’d do whatever it takes to prepare and secure the job. His reasoning? He’s afraid of making a fool of himself. Instead, he wants to restart personal training, which will take another 4-5 months to start up.

The core issue for me is that, because I earn well, I’ve shared my comfortable lifestyle with him. I asked him to move in, allowing him to contribute what he could to rent. Even when he could afford to split it equally, I insisted he save instead. I often cover our bills, buy him gifts so he doesn’t feel insecure, and generally try to make things easier for him. To be clear, he’s not entirely dependent on me—he does make an effort to reciprocate.

But over time, I’ve noticed he has no sense of urgency when it comes to making money and supporting himself. He always has *plans*, but he never follows through. I don’t ideally expect him to stay in a toxic job, but given his limited options, what else option does he has ? Lots of people study and work, why can't he? Lots of people arent in great work environments, just because they have bills to pay- why can't he? 
Everything he does needs to have a degree of comfort in it - but how can he not understand that life just hasn't dealt him that card - I am here to help us but you can't accept that this is how it would always be like- me being around when you run out of money or quit your job etc

This pattern is starting to weigh on me as time passes. Am I missing something here? What would you advise I should do to maybe relay these concerns to him or to just feel less anxious? 

Just to note: I don’t expect to have a future with him because of these circumstances- but I do love him and want him to have a better life for himself. 
Maybe I am just looking for advice on how not to be so scared for him? I don’t want this dissatisfaction from my side to give him more insecurity and anxiety but I can’t help it. 

# TL;DR:

I’ve been the higher earner in my four-year relationship because my boyfriend, a refugee, can’t legally work. I’ve helped him financially, supported his career changes, and provided him with a comfortable lifestyle. However, he frequently starts and abandons opportunities, lacks urgency in securing income, and recently quit his job with no backup plan. His avoidance of available opportunities or to further upskill himself frustrates me, and I’m starting to feel drained.

2025-02-25 00:19:31,1ixhk14,How to speak to my (F21) unemployed boyfriend (M20) about getting a job before we move in together next month. Worried about our future!,"Never posted on here before but i have no one in my life to turn to for unbiased advice at the moment that isn't just ‘break up’.

My partner and I have been together for 7 months now ( I know a short time) but have begun recently talking seriously about moving in together. I am very excited for this, don't get me wrong - but I've had some serious concerns about our future and his motivation to grow. 

For context, I grew up in a very work centred family where we were always pushed to do our absolute best and succeed career wise - I was raised in a way where family and work is king. My boyfriend on the other hand, grew up entirely differently in an environment of abuse and no strong role models, however he wants a different life.

I love him very much and want us to work more than anything - but our drive for the future doesn’t seem to be matching up. Since I’ve known him, he hasn’t worked a job and has been living off of assistance due to some serious family and homelessness issues in his late teens. I was totally okay with this at first, thinking he’d begin looking for work within a couple of months of settling into adulthood but everytime I bring it up there seems to be another reason that isn’t happening despite him talking about careers in the future, and his severe depression keeps him in bed most days. 

Now, I see there being some hope for change as he decided to go back to school to get a degree after meeting me because he says he wants to be better - but even this seems to be a bit of a struggle due to arising medical issues that have affected his mobility. 

Recently, he’s been in and out of the hospital to hopefully fix these issues and when I brought up the topic of jobs again he said it may be another few months until he can start looking because of the pain he’s in. I want to be understanding and patient, he's a sweet man and has never treated me unkindly and I know what it's like to go through hard times, but my anxiety and relationship with my own family due to this uncertainty is driving me crazy and I'm just not sure what I need to do. 

  \*\*tl;dr\*\*: Please help! I’m worried that I’m being too harsh on my unemployed boyfriend to get a job due to my own expectations of work and our future.

2025-02-25 00:11:30,1ixhdpd,I 19f see a pattern in female friendships and am currently needing advice on how to handle roommate 19f?,"I 19f am currently going through something that I now see as a pattern. Basically what happens is I start a new friendship and it’s good for about 6 months and then a level of comfort kicks in and the “friend” begins making snarky, degrading comments, acting very competitive, and saying untrue things behind my back to make me look bad. It happened twice in high school and now it’s happening at college with a roommate who I thought had also become a friend. In the past, I ended those friendships and the person then accused me of being the bad guy for doing so and didn’t take any responsibility for their actions. Luckily I have friends who have been around a long time and support me but at school it’s more limited and the fact that I live with this person complicates things. Things started off good and now she says rude things, tries to get our 3rd roommate to exclude me, has encouraged others to be mean to me, etc. When I give it back to her she pretends she didn’t just start it by being rude and acts like I’m being nasty for giving it back to her! What?!? She’s also much worse when she has an audience, she loves to make me look bad. One common denominator with her and the other failed friendships is she’s super competitive and insecure. I’m a humble person and I’ll admit my flaws but… I’m told I’m attractive and I am into fitness and taking care of myself and I also work really hard to be top of my class and I guess I’d say I get a lot of interest from guys (she doesn’t) so when I cry to my sister or a friend they say it’s jealousy which would add up. However, I also want to add I’m as good a friend as anyone could have. I’m supportive, kind, like to have fun but also be studious, loyal, etc. I’ve been so good to her. My question is, what’s the best approach with a person like this? When I say something back to her she pretends she’s innocent and I’m being mean (gaslighting?). A friend from home said I need to get more angry and really tell her I’m done with her. Like do something completely out of character to “scare her straight” lol. I don’t even know what to say to her. Or maybe I stick out the year with as much distance as possible but stay quiet. And im stuck in the dorm with her for 3 more months which is literally 3 beds in one room! Why does this keep happening and what should I do to shut it down. I’m feeling so upset, frustrated and sad. Thanks!!

2025-02-24 23:50:06,1ixgwmz,"i've (18F) been with my boyfriend (18M) for 4 years, but i keep wanting more/change. is this normal?","godddddd i kind of hate that ive just gone to reddit to ask about this issue but here it is

what do i do in my relationship? we've been together for 4 years now. i've been thinking about it a lot recently, and i kinda just realized trust is the root of all our issues. i've always thought i was just overly jealous. but i think it's actually because i find it hard to trust him. even when it's over small things. i can't trust him that much because he has a habit of so many white lies, and it just leads to so much distrust and he tells me he trusts me completely and i always feel guilty that i don't trust him fully but i know its because i always tell the truth.

he lies about such stuuupid fucking things like sometimes it's about which friends he's with or where he is, but he's never actually doing anything *bad* he just lies. like about what he had for breakfast, which friends he likes, or he’ll completely change a story about what he did during the day. even changes what he likes blah blah blah. and it frustrates me like crazy. and whenever i get jealous or insecure he always says, ""what have i ever done to make you think i’d cheat on you?"" and he's right, he never has. but all these little lies make me wonder if he'd lie about something bigger.

another issue is he doesn’t love me the way i want to be loved, which i know sounds selfish. but i just wish he noticed more about me. i always take note of the ""silly"" things like the energy drinks he likes, what colors he mostly wears, his favorite shorts, the music genre he's into at the moment, etc. but with me, he never really knows. i’ll get him snacks when he’s sick, send him love messages, all that shit because i WANT to. and it’s not like he’s never done those things, but he only does them if i ask. i just wish he’d notice things about me without me having to say anything. i know he loves me, but i wish he showed it more.

he doesn’t randomly call me pretty, or compliment my outfits, or even really compliment me at all. idk, i love him so much, but sometimes i feel like my longing for more overshadows what we actually have. and again, i know he loves me, but i don’t want to have to ask for things. maybe it’s normal to ask for compliments and stuff in relationships? maybe my standards are just too high?

recently, i've noticed how different we are, especially in what we think is right and wrong. his friends are such immature teenage boys, and he never sees anything wrong with what they do. they’ll say gross things about women in their group chat, and even though my boyfriend never joins in, these are the people he chooses to hang out with. and it’s not just his friends, overall we just have completely different levels of maturity. and i know i’m only 18 and a freshman in college, so maybe it’s dumb to think about knowing that we've only dated through early years.

but i love him so much, and i really never want to leave him. we’ve had so many talks, and lately, we’ve been arguing more than usual, i think because i'm just now realizing all of this. and the arguments always come down to the same things, trust and differences. it’s always me going to him with my issues. and i think he’s even pointed it out before hell say shit like “you always ask me to work on something.” but i just want the best for myself too. he’s so happy with so little, but i always go way beyond what he expects. not to sound full of myself, but i know he’d be fine with way less effort, but i show him everything because i WANT to. and it makes me wonder should i stop trying so hard? but i love showing my love, it’s just who i am.

and i’ve always felt kinda crazy at times in this relationship, like i’m the only one with issues. but maybe neither of us is the problem and maybe its just that we just love differently and that i need to accept it. he doesn’t give me what i want unless i ask, and i don’t want to have to ask. meanwhile, he never has to ask, and i just give. he also never thinks deeply about things, ever. idk but maybe i just need to settle for his way of loving, because i do acknowledge that he loves me but i want to feel the effort.

i also tend to compare our relationship to others at this point, i get envious of people on social media whos boyfriends send letters when sad, or make handmade gifts, spontaneously set up dates, compliment always. and i knowwww that's damaging and sometimes i even will mention things about other relationships and i know its toxic to do that i just want him to get hints sometimes, even if i literally tell him directly how i like to be loved.

some part of me is terrified that the right thing to do is break up with him, but i don’t want to. i love him so much, and we have so many amazing memories. and the thing is—he is such a sweet, genuine person. he’s amazing. so amazing, so loving, and he’s always gentle with me. but we’re just so different. and as i’m saying all this, i really want to emphasize that difference is okay, i just... i’m scared that i’m trying to change him into someone who loves me the way i want to be loved, and maybe that’s just not possible.

but writing all of this out makes me feel like it’s pointing to breaking up and that terrifies me. we’ve never had any incidents of cheating or disloyalty, and we’re always so mature when we argue, and we **always** fix things. but it’s just the same things coming up over and over, and i don’t know what to do. he’s going to college soon, and i know i couldn’t do long distance if this level of distrust continues. but i also know i’d still end up with him, even if it hurts me. i also don't have many friends, im just super introverted, and im scared of being alone.

i don’t want to lose him, but i always wonder if i deserve better. am i expecting too much? can he really change? or does he just not get how important this all is to me? because to me, it just feels like he doesn’t put in the effort. i simply just want to know if i should accept his way of loving me, even if in my eyes it seems like he doesn't put enough effort. and i just don't know what to do with the trust either lol

ugh im sorry this post is so fucking long but thank you for reading all of this if you have, i've deadass never really posted on reddit but I've never felt so emotionally turmoiled about an issue like this before especially with him since he's like so much of my life.

& i am aware i sound pathetic its just difficult 

**TL;DR**: i've been in a 4-year relationship with my bf, and while ik he loves me, trust has always been an issue. he tends to lie about small stupid things, which makes me doubt him and roots my insecurities/jealousy, even though he's never done anything to hurt me. i also wish he showed more attention and affection without me having to ask, even tho i know he cares and loves me, just showing it in the way i want to be loved. maybe that's selfish. i’m wondering if i should accept the way he loves me or if things need to change for both of us. what do i doooooo. i don't want the first option to be to break up with him unless that completely seems like the answer.","Should I accept my boyfriend's way of loving me, even if it doesn't meet my needs, or do things need to change for both of us?","The individual is 18 years old and currently a freshman in college.

Im 17 and started dating my boyfriend like 7 months ago, long distance btw. This guy is one of my mom's closest friend's son, so we were childhood friends and knew each other's parents prior. At first, my mom liked him a lot because she thought she knew him well enough to trust him. But as time went on, his mom would tell my mom his negative traits and how he's not the right person for me. My mom didn't really think much of it because he seemed like a simple innocent guy. But one day, I have no idea how, but our moms saw our texts and found some...not so pleasant things (pictures .. yk teenager stuff.. and just ranting to each other about some things our parents do that frustrates us). Thinking its ""inappropriate"" and ""unhealthy for the both of us"". Since then, she's expressed extreme hatred towards him. She thinks I'm letting a guy I've been with for a short while ruin my family dynamic and my relationship with her and ""lowering my class"". We're still teenagers, but my mom hates how he doesnt have that much ambition and thinks hes so immature. But for me, I know he's trying his best in figuring things out. A few days ago she sent paragraphs and paragraphs to him saying how he's ruining things for her and me. For the past few weeks, she's been on me about what makes this guy so worth it, assuming that I value my relationship with him more than her. She makes these horrible comments on him that it's really hard to bear sometimes.

I want to improve my relationship with my mom but I simply can't throw away my relationship like that. She's already made it a point that she might never accept him and it really feels like a someone's stabbing me in the heart. I trust that me and my boyfriend are still growing and learning lessons along the way, after all, we are still teenagers. But everytime I say this she thinks im defending him and taking his side, when in reality I'm just expressing my opinion. My mom and his mom thinks our relationship is an unhealthy distraction and not beneficial. My mom's limiting how much I see him, even though I already rarely do since we're long distance.

2025-02-24 22:17:49,1ixerau,29F and 28M. Is this relationship worth it?,"I need help guys.

I have started dating my now boyfriend after ending my previous relationship roughly 4 years ago. As you guys all know, the current dating scene is very grim. And I was very excited to date this guy as he is very sweet, kind and down to earth... But now 3 months into the relationship, I have noticed so many flaws of him :( 

He is terrible in bed and his size is small. I have communicated my ways for him to please me but I genuinely feel nothing when he does things... I am basically his first and I thought things would get better after some time but no... He is so unskilled. 

Recently as well, it was my birthday where he suggested to take me to a nice restaurant and he showed me several restaurants (All old looking and tacky... so I said can we please go somewhere else?) He then suggested this other restaurant that his friends told him to take me. But again, I have already been here and didn't find it that great... but he still insisted to take me there. We are there, he then starts commenting ahh it's not that great blah blah.... He then gives me this cheap $30 necklace with a heart pendant that only school kids would wear... (Think of a heart necklace from Lovisa...). I mean he tries and I appreciate his efforts + I don't want to be materialistic but is this what you give to a grown-up woman...??? or is he just unskilled?.... 

I am very direct with him in terms of telling him my expectations and what I like/ don't like... I've told him several times, I feel loved when I receive thoughtful gifts and he shows acts of service.. I mean he tries but he's just not meeting my standards. 

Just for b/g infor, I have been working for 5 years, and I am financially stable + will purchase my own home very soon. On the other hand, my bf has gone back to studying recently, and has 3 more years of studying left. He however had previously worked and owns his own house + has a lot of savings.... 

TDLR: 

I feel as though we are in different stages of life, our expectations and lifestyle are so different. Would you guys still strive for this relationship and communicate your way through just because he tries to improve and is a good guy? Or I am just wasting my time and staying just for his 'potentials?'....

2025-02-24 21:24:20,1ixdfxu,My Boyfriend doesn’t like my natural hair. (4c/Afro),"I'F20' recently started dating this guy 'M24' | met and everything has been so good until he told me he didn't like my natural hair. To give context he and I met on a dating app so of course there was only certain things about me that he saw before we met.One of those things being my natural hair. Anyway we got to know each other and hit it off almost immediately so it wasn't long before we became a couple. He and I never had any issues with each other and honestly he did a pretty good job at making sure I knew I was beautiful. He'd tell me how gorgeous I was constantly whenever we went on dates or casually hung out. He'd also tell me about how my personality made me more attractive. Even when I met his friends and family he'd go on about how he was so happy to have me. I ofc bought into the compliments and would return the words of endearment.

It continued on like that for a while until one day we were texting each other old pictures and kind of just sharing memories. I shared a picture of me in my Afro with him. And he seemed pretty excited about it. He started asking me when l'd wear my hair out around him. (keep in mind he had only seen my Afro once on my dating profile before this) I kind of just brushed it off with a ""im not sure"" because there was truly no telling when l'd wear my natural hair again. I'm not really the type of person who is afraid to wear my natural hair out but anyone who has thick & curly hair knows it can be a hassle so l preferred to keep it in a protective style. I figured since he was so excited to see my natural hair I'd show him whenever I decided to get my hair redone.

So fast forward to about 2 weeks before my birthday I decide to wear my hair out to breathe and figure it's the perfect time to show him my hair. So l send him a photo. Initially he was super excited and told me he couldn't WAIT to see it in person. I was equally excited because I'll be honest l've never seen someone so excited about hair in my life.

Anyway the next day we hang out and he sees my hair. He tells me it was beautiful and that he loves it. It was a pretty nice thing to hear but I didn't look at it as anything more than a compliment because I was still the same me just with a different hairstyle. But he was ""happy"" with how my hair looked and didn't have any issues.I guess that wasn't true because a little further in the week we hung out again and went to hang out at his grand-parents house and before we got out he let me know that he ""wasn't a fan"" of my Afro. 

Honestly I was upset about that. It was a weird switch up for me since he was just telling me about how he loved my hair. To make matters worse when we went inside his grand-parents house we didn't speak to them once. We went downstairs to watch a movie and immediately left when it was finished.

This was new to me since whenever we went to his grandparents house we'd all sit in the kitchen together talking and laughing etc. To me it felt like he was trying to hide me from them. After that I didn't want to be seen by him AT ALL. I obviously brought it up to him and we talked about it ALL WEEK over the phone and all I got was ""well I don't HAVE to like your hair"" and it's true he doesn't r all I was asking was that he didn't share his unwanted opinions if he knew it would hurt my feelings. And even THAT was too much.

To make things worse I got my hair done and we went on a trip from my birthday and he confessed that he didn't understand what the whole situation was about and thought we were just arguing about stupid stuff.

He's since apologized and expressed his remorse but it still sits on my mind that whenever I wear my natural hair he won't like it. What should I do? It seems like he's moved on pretty easily from it but it's not something I can just ""let go"" since it is something I feel truly is apart of me.


tl;dr:
My boyfriend asked me to wear my natural hair and when I wore it out he initially told me it was beautiful, but later took it back and said he didn’t like it at all. I tried to talk to him about it, but he shut me down & told me that he didn’t have to like it if he didn’t want to.

2025-02-24 20:50:39,1ixcm17,My (16M) girlfriend (17F) has too many problems. It's slowly eating away at me.,"My girlfriend of ~1 and a half years is a very unlucky person. Not in the sense of Murphy's law or anything but that she has a bunch of terrible things happen to her. When she was a toddler for example, she had cancer, and thankfully beat it. About 5 years ago she was in a deep depression and attempted twice. Luckily she made a comeback from that but has never been 100% mentally. She struggles very much with things like anxiety and nerves. Recently, it got so bad that she started to have panick attacks and pass out. Eventually this worsened into her getting lockjaw sometimes, to then becoming paralyzed from the neck down to having seizures. Yesterday she was admitted to hospital for having a seizure and its only gotten worse since, having 2 seizures when I visited her there today alone. 5 today in total. I know that it is terrible of me to to say such things about her struggles but it's becoming too much for me. I feel like I can't even say anything to her because she will just become more anxious and I don't want to be the cause for her battles. I feel terrible about this but having to constantly comfort her as everything becomes worse day by day is eating away at me. I'm sure she feels even worse and that's what makes me feel even more guilty. At this point she has stressed me out to the point where I'm worrying about my own mental health for the first time in my life. I feel terrible as I know she is struggling more than anyone but I can't help but feel like I'm trapped. I do love her but I can't bring myself to tell her how I feel because I might hurt her.

2025-02-24 19:32:51,1ixaofa,How do you get over betrayal?,"My partner did some stuff about a year ago behind my back

I confronted him, he apologised, I thought about breaking up with him but I couldn't do it... 
I'm still not over it. I think about everything I found out so often. It bothers me so much sometimes I just want to scream at him. 

Other than what he did he's a good partner. But I can't get over it. 
I tried talking to him but it doesn't make me feel better. 

All I do is think about the way he reacted when I first found out- 
Didn't show an ounce of caring that our relationship could be over and even tried to justify/minimise what he did...

Is it worth staying when someone betrays you, even if they don't seem to show any genuine remorse? As far as I'm aware, he hasn't done it again, but I can't stop hurting. 
I don't know if I love him or hate him. 

(25M and 25F, together 2 years) 

TL;DR
partner did stuff behind my back, confronted him and he apologised. I'm struggling to move past it even though he (as far as I know) hasn't done it again. It's been a year since.

2025-02-24 18:19:28,1ix8w34,My parents are asking me to break up with my bf,"I (25f) am in a relationship with my (25m) partner since 1 year and we have known each other for 10 years. Recently my parents found out that we are in a relationship, it was not voluntary. And all hell broke loose in my home. For context, he is from a different religion and we have a height difference of 1 ft, im 5ft and he's 6ft. 
My parents had asked me a year ago, if i had someone and to tell them if i did ( i didn't have a partner then) and they said they're okay with intercaste partener as well. 
Now that i have a partner they have turned the opposite way. They are looking for any reason and asking me to break up with him. They also found out that he had a gf before me and thats also one of the reasons they are putting forward. They also told me that 5 years down the line he'll be embarrassed of my height snd have an inferiority complex because of me and that i do not look that good. 
I just can't understand what it is that I've done so wrong. They are acting like i have committed a crime to torment them. 
I really didn't expect them to have such stereotypical mentality about dating and marriage. 
I'm breaking down thinking of what to do, i really don't wanna breakup with him but they are asking me to or they won't be involved in anything that has to do with us. I feel helpless and haven't stopped crying since yesterday.
I really need some advice.   

tl;dr my parents found out about my relationship and are asking me to break up with my bf for no valid reasons. 

Update- thank you so much everyone for your advice, it really encouraged me. I do love my parents a lot and I've done everything to make them happy up until now, I'm standing my ground on this one. 
I have set up for my bf and my parents to meet tomorrow. To first talk it out, understand our relationship and then form any opinions and concerns they have. Hope it goes well.

2025-02-24 17:39:24,1ix7v3y,helping my gf financially,"TLDR: gf struggling financially even though she’s working her ass off, want to take over a couple bills for her for a while. what would you do?

what’s up ladies and gents? me (m21) and my gf (f20) have been together for a little over a year now. throughout that time, she’s struggled really hard with finances due to a few different factors. she was attending college last year but her family is very hot and cold with how they support her and quick to change their mind on what they’ll give her, so she dropped out to avoid accumulating even more debt. she lives in an apartment in a city closer to me now with college roommates and has a really solid job cooking and waitressing at one of the top 3 locations in a restaurant chain nationwide, and she gets a lot of hours every week. 

it just isn’t enough. her mom got absolutely ripped off on her car, and now gf has to suffer through the payments. she owes a deposit for her next apartment lease that the owners failed to mention until she was signing it (i watched it happen). she pays for student loans for the year of school she did, and rent for her current apartment. most of the time she eats one full meal a day, and it’s usually what she makes herself at work. the only non essentials she pays for really is a Hulu account that we both use and like $20 - $30 at Hobby Lobby so she can make jewelry. and the occasional sweet treat. she also pitches money sometimes towards whatever we’re doing together.

her mom just recently told her that she can’t afford to pay for gfs car insurance once her brother starts driving so she’s kicking her off the plan. yet she keeps telling gf that if she moves back home and goes to school there, that her parents will pay for everything. her going home is not an option, i love her family and they love me but there is a broken dynamic there that is not healthy for gf to be around. plus, they genuinely live in the middle of nowhere. gf had to drive an hour to work part time hours at a sketchy bar and grill because that was the closest place to work. her parents both earn above average income wise so it’s not like they can’t afford to give her a hand, her mom genuinely just won’t. gf is insanely stressed, her sex drive is dead (which is very important to HER, i am not complaining that my woman is having a dry spell bro what kinda douchebag do you think i am), and she’s lost motivation in all aspects pretty much. she’s just tired all the time, and constantly on edge, and i hate seeing her struggle so hard.

i work full time and have a decent sum of money tucked away. my plan is to put 4k in a separate bank account than my personal and use it to pay her car and student loan payments to try to take some of the weight off her back and give her a chance to save up some money. she won’t have access to the account and i’ll have complete control of it so i’m not worried about the money going places where it shouldn’t, and i trust her anyway. i’m just gonna ask that she pays me back part of it later on when she’s more financially stable. also gonna see how much it would be to bundle her car insurance with my car and homeowners. 

ig what i’m asking is what would you guys do in this situation? i’ve been taken advantage of in the past for being too giving and i know that 4k is a pretty hefty sum of money (i will be fine without it tho). i know she feels bad when i pay 
for her things and doesn’t wanna take advantage of me so i’m not too worried about her taking it for granted, i genuinely just wanna help her feel better.

thanks for reading my novel 🤝","What would you do in a situation where your partner is struggling financially, and you want to help by taking over some of their bills?","The individual (21 years old) has a girlfriend (20 years old) with whom they have been in a relationship for a little over a year. The girlfriend was attending college last year but dropped out due to inconsistent financial support from her family, leading to concerns about accumulating debt. She currently lives in an apartment with college roommates and has a job at a top restaurant chain where she cooks and waitresses, working many hours, but her income is still insufficient to cover her expenses.

The girlfriend has several financial burdens, including student loans from the year she attended school, rent for her current apartment, and car payments that she is responsible for due to her mother's financial decisions regarding the car. She also has to pay for a deposit for her next apartment lease. Her family situation is complicated; her parents earn above-average incomes but are not supportive, especially her mother, who plans to take her off the car insurance when her brother starts driving. Despite her mother's claims that they would support her if she moved back home and went to school, the girlfriend believes that returning home is not a viable option due to an unhealthy family dynamic and the distance from employment opportunities. She previously had to drive an hour to work part-time hours at a less desirable restaurant.

2025-02-24 17:02:42,1ix6ydl,My (19F) best friend (19F) of 6 years suddenly left our group chat and we couldn't contact her. How do i fix this?,"My friend group (all 19F) has been close since middle school—about six years now. Recently, though, one of my best friends suddenly left the group, and I’m really worried about what this means for our friendship. Over the past year, we’ve all been busy with college and figuring out our lives, so we haven’t had as much time to talk in our group chat. We’ve had conversations about this before, and we all agreed that we’re okay with a low-maintenance friendship as long as we can meet up every once in a while, like during breaks. This isn’t the first time we’ve had to do this—back in high school, we also attended different schools in different towns, so it was pretty usual for us to meet up during breaks.  

But now that we’re all in different universities in different towns, it’s been harder to stay connected. It’s a whole different experience from high school, where we could still visit each other impromptu. The distance and our busy schedules have made it much more challenging to maintain the same level of closeness.  

A few months ago, my best friend got sick and was hospitalized for three days. She was really disappointed that none of us could visit her because of the distance. Even after we explained that we couldn’t afford train tickets or take time off due to our schedules, she told us we should’ve made the effort to be there for her. We wanted to visit, but as broke college students, it just wasn’t feasible. After that, we tried to be more active in the group chat, but honestly, it’s been hard. Sometimes it takes us 2-3 days to respond because we’re all so busy. I thought we all understood that we have our own lives and schedules to manage.  

Then, two days ago, she left the group chat after telling us she was hospitalized again. Now, we can’t reach her, but she’s been tweeting things like, “Careless and low-maintenance friendships don’t have much difference.” It really hurts to see this, and I don’t want our friendship to fall apart. I want to fix things, but I’m not sure how to approach this. What should I do?

2025-02-26 00:50:59,1iyaz7m,How do I M21 tell my GF 22F that I’m Struggling with out relationship?,"For context this is both of our first relationships, it’s all very new to us and we’ve been dating for nearly 7 months now.

I’ve had difficulties with our relationships in many facets, she doesn’t get along and hates one of my good friends, making it difficult to hangout with him or talk about him at all. This has caused big arguments between us.

She is often low on money for various unfortunate reasons, like someone hit her car, which she didn’t want and is extremely expensive in its own right and due to a ton of bizarre reasons the security will not cover it. Meaning that all her money goes to paying that off and I’ve essentially been responsible for feeding most of these months. This was not a thing when we started dating but happened during and has now caused many financial issues for me.

She often gets upset with me if I decide to spend time with friends without her, making it hard for me to do so without then having her be upset. Sometimes it’s difficult to spend time with her and friends without her dominating the whole discussion and saying stupid things that often embarras me and people want me to answer for.

She likes telling certain people EVERYTHING about our relationship and that’s been difficult as many things that I feel should stay private she will tell them. I’ve told her how I felt and recently I found out she’s lied to me and continues telling certain people things I want to stay private. This has especially broken my trust in her and now I don’t even feel comfortable telling her things.

Talking about these issues is difficult as she’ll get mad at me and tell me “do you know who you decided to date?” Which as we go along seems like a valid question to ask, however I wanted to take a leap of faith as I thought there’s a way we could work but Ive realized it’s difficult.

Now I don’t know how to address these with her, inevitable I feel like we’ll break up, but rn I feel responsible to be with her as her grandfather will likely pass away and i’d like to help her through that. she also has suicidal tendencies so I fear what would happen if we broke up and her grandfather passed away.

I want to know or want ideas in how I could talk to her about these issues respectfully with her, any advice?",How can I talk to my girlfriend about our relationship issues respectfully?,"The individual describes their relationship as being in its first significant phase, having been together for nearly 7 months. They mention challenges related to their partner's financial situation, which has worsened after an incident where her car was damaged, causing substantial expenses that her security does not cover.

Additionally, they indicate that both are new to relationships and seem to be navigating conflicts related to spending time with friends and private matters about their relationship being shared without consent. The partner has displayed emotional sensitivity, often getting upset when the individual spends time with friends alone.

They express concern for their partner’s mental health, noting that she has suicidal tendencies and is likely to experience emotional distress soon due to her grandfather's impending passing.

2025-02-26 00:39:57,1iyaqy1,"There's a (20M) guy I (21F) like, but I've never told him and now I feel that I've missed my chance, is it too late?","
I've been working with this guy for a little over a year now. We're both very shy and introverted, so it took awhile for us to be able to find things to talk about. But once we did, it just felt easy and comfortable.

He's always looked out for me at work, whether it came to dealing with a creepy customer or employee, or taking care of me when I would have a flare up (fibromyalgia). And I would do the same for him, if his heart started giving him issues I would tell him to take a break or have him do something that wouldn't be as strenuous on his heart.

He got me a little handwarmer from behind the customer service desk at work one time because my hands were freezing and I couldn't get warm.

For the longest time it didn't seem like there was an interest on his end. But I ended up getting sick and was off work for a week and a half. He sent me a text checking up on me and telling me to take care of myself and to stay warm.

I would say our work friendship changed once I came back to work after being sick. My first day back working with him, he started giving me attitude because I was talking to one of my friends behind the service desk. I hadn't spoken to him yet, because of how busy the store was. He saw me back there and started questioning me. ""What are you doing back here? Are you trying to learn and work behind the desk now?"" So I felt the need to give attitude back. ""Yeah! Maybe I am. Why did you miss me while I was gone? Did you want me to hangout with you?"" His answer ""Yeah, maybe I did. You can come over and hangout with us."" And that was basically the start of our bantering. Everytime we would work together we would go back and forth like this. It was honestly so much fun.

A couple weeks ago I closed with him. It was snowing outside and my ride was running a little late (only 1 working car, so I have to be dropped off). He noticed that my car wasn't there yet, asked if I had a ride home and I told I did. Then we parted ways, he went to his truck but kept watching me the entire time. Like he kept looking back at me, while he was brushing the snow off his car. My ride then showed up, and when I got home, I had a text from him saying that he was going to let me stay in the truck with him so I wouldn't be stuck outside in the cold. I was going to tell him how I felt about him that night, but I couldn't figure out when and how I was going to say it.

Another night we were working together, we were in the elevator and asked me if I came here often. It caught me off guard and made me laugh a little, because he's never said something like that before. He ended up putting his 2 weeks in that same night after I left, he told me after he got off work.

When I lost my 2nd job for the holidays, he gave me some of his shifts to help me out. I didn't ask him to and I honestly felt kind of bad when he would ask me.

We've been texting a lot more outside of work recently. He's been encouraging me to leave the store I'm currently at, for a better paying and more stable job. He was also constantly telling me to look in to art school, which is something we would go back and forth on, until I finally caved and admitted that now I do want to study art because he wouldn't stop bringing it up.

Yesterday was his last day. The night before, he sent me text telling me that I better be there to see him. So I showed up, and he gave me a letter that he wrote to me. And I ended up giving him the one I wrote to him. I was really tempted to put down how I felt about him in the letter, but then decided against it. So it was more like a wishing you the best in life and it was great working with you and I'm glad I got to know you kinda letter instead. In the note, I did tell him that I would like to keep in touch and asked if he would also want to too. I wanted to talk to him more when I was there and it seemed like he did too, but I also didn't want to bother him since he was working. I wanted to tell him how I felt, but there was this other girl that he knows from college. And she was trying to set him up with one of her friends, which he didn't seem interested in and he just kinda kept looking at me and seemed uncomfortable about the whole thing. But that's what made me have doubts and lose the confidence to tell him how I feel. I started thinking well maybe he doesn't like me like that. Maybe we're just friends and I couldn't potentially ruin it by telling him.

He did end up texting me later saying that he would like to keep in touch and that he's always here for me. I was so tempted to just text him, ""you know that I like you, right?"" Ughhh it's so frustrating because I feel like maybe he does like me or he's just being nice.

He's just a genuinely good, sweet,respectful, and funny person. But I feel like I have missed my chance to tell him that I like him as more than a friend.
I don't know what to do. Do I keep in touch and see if anything happens? Do I let him go or tell him? Any advice?

Also sorry for the super long post.

2025-02-26 00:37:53,1iyapca,Me 31m wife 31f help navigating this mess with homing a rescue dog after recent losses of previous dogs,"Hi everyone, I've found myself in a hell of a messy situation and any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Some background, 

I'm 31m (high functioning asd along with severe adhd which may be important) married to my amazing wife 31f I've always had pets especially cats and dogs along with reptiles and rats my whole life. 

My wife has only really had cats as she prefers how independent they are compared to dogs generally are, unfortunately we've had our three German shepards pass away with the oldest dying around a year and a half ago and the other two passing both in the past six months.

Digger (the oldest) passed due to age related issues.

Chianna (second to pass) passed from lung cancer.

Hades (most recent) passed around 13 days ago due to his lifelong liver disease and accompanied issues that came with that. 

A very important note is that digger was mine as we started seeing each other 12 years ago and chianna was a joint puppy we got together. 

Hades was a surprise wedding present from my mother which caused a fair bit of resentment due to the money tied to his health issues and especially after he became very reactive which took years to mostly train out of him.

Now to the current issue, my mother surprised my wife and I today with a 2 year old british bulldog she had helped get out of his abusive home and thought we could take him in to give him a permanent home.

My view is that the timing is horrific and while intended to be a positive my mother missed the mark by a country mile, I'm happy to take him in as even though I'm high functioning asd my mental health is at an all time low with having an empty house.

My wife and I grieve in different ways especially with my adhd making me forget then randomly slamming me with memories of my dogs passing so close together. 

My wife is the love of my life and we're slowly talking It through while trying to find some middle ground, she's still grieving and hates surprises/lack of planning so she inevitably freaked out massively when she found out about the dog.

Another point of issue is because my mother thought we'd take him today she can't really keep him at hers past a night or two as she doesn't have the room.

I'm not the best with complex emotions and I know I seem selfish with wanting a new dog but while it would make me happier and more content I do not want to to put my wife down to make myself happy or any damage to her mental health.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and could offer any advice to reach a compromise or would it be best to reach out to some family friends I trust to see if they can take the dog in themselves?

Thanks for reading if you got this far.

2025-02-26 00:36:09,1iyanxw,My (23f) best freind (25m) of 7 years confessed to me .,"Okay so during Christmas my (25m ) best freind of 7 years confessed to me.

We met in highschool and got really close back then but due to both of us having similar worries about teenage pregnancy and all that neither of us really dated in highschool. I'd be lying if I said there weren't some feelings back then . Including a steamy make out or two, but this is way in the past and fissiled out a long time ago. I've had relationships since and life moved on. About 3 years ago we got really close again and are in a very tight nit freind group. And yes in the odd conversation or two freinds would mention something about least likely to end up together , or jokes about either myself or them being so inexperienced or conversations about everyone's experience in a more sexual department. Witch was always met with us making eye contact and playing it off or lying to our friends.

But recently during Christmas he got really drunk because of some family issues and messaged me takkgg about how he's always had me in his mind and he's never forgotten.

And it shattered everything. Before we could hang out alone all the time. I had no issues being around them and now I'm very aware of them in a different way. And he hasn't said anything about it again . Tho I know he didn't forget cause he's mentioned something else from the same conversation.

We used to be so close we could communicate with just eye contact. And just knew things about each other .

We have a mutal friend (26m) who is also pining after him really hard. None of our friends know we had any type of history and it feels weird saying something Now...

We went to out best freind (we are somewhat of a really close trio) birthday and things were normal untill we went outside and while offering my freinds massages (normal for me ) he was very affectionate back like rubbing my legs and hugging me and looking up at me a lot . I don't know if it's standing out now cause of what happened in Christmas or if we've always been like this and I just didn't notice.

2025-02-26 00:34:16,1iyamgu,Me (22F) and my...??? (22M),"Been seeing this guy for a little while now. Everything's great until I ask him anything along the lines of ""what are we"", then he says he doesn't know and goes into a spiral for two hours. By spiral, I mean tearing up and verbally going back and forth between if he should cut me off and stop talking to me or not.   
  
He says he likes me and he fully shows that with his actions (I've met his family/friends, he makes a bunch of time outside of his busy work schedule to be with me, we communicate honestly) but then he says that he knows he's making up every excuse and delaying the inevitable conversation so that he doesn't have to confront the question at all.   
  
He says he doesn't know if he wants a relationship, but also doesn't want to lose me as a result of that. He doesn't want a relationship because he has other priorities, and doesn't think he can balance one with those other priorities. I told him that if he wanted to bad enough, he would figure it out. He tells me that he doesn't want to string me along while he tries and figures it out, in fear of hurting me. He keeps telling me that if he cuts it off, he knows he'll regret it for the rest of his life.

This whole thing has happened at least three times now when he's faced with a decision with me. I.e. if he wanted to continue talking to me, if he wanted to have sex with me, and if he wanted to make anything serious with me.

I'm trying to give him grace because we're both young and in transitional periods of our lives. I like him a lot so I'm not really sure what to do.

2025-02-26 00:32:28,1iyakzs,My (36M) bf told me he questions his attraction to me (25F),"It’s not that he isn’t attracted to me. He tells me that he is very attracted to me, loves me, all those things. But it came up that he’s unsure if it’s enough… that he’d be satisfied with me as a long term partner? I’m honestly not even sure how to explain it. It sounds like he’s looking for greener grass, but when I brought that up he said that’s not the case. I’m flabbergasted. I know I’m not model gorgeous, but I’m also very confident in my appearance. 

I mentioned that attraction grows in relationships as you start to develop deeper feelings, but he said that’s not how it works for him. Since then, he tries to assure me. He tells me I look nice, calls me beautiful, sexy etc. but my god I’ve never felt so insecure in a relationship before. 

I feel like this is something you don’t tell your partner. I’ve even thought this before! “Oh is this the man I want to be seen with for the rest of my life?” But I recognize that thinking as shallow and narcissistic. I trust that as our feelings develop so will my affection and attraction. And I appreciate open, honest communication, but this seemed unnecessary and almost manipulative?

2025-02-26 00:31:39,1iyakdd,"Me 28m , my gf 26f am i the bad guy?","I'll try to type the history up short. Sold a business, been using the funds to pay my house bills. My girl moved in 12 months ago without me asking. I enjoyed her being around so we just went with it. She pays for groceries about 400$ a month. I pay for everything else with the house which is about 2,800$ a month. We both pay our own car and insurances.
My 9-5 can't handle the bills since my mortgage increased back in June by 60% due to insurance problems or something. So my mortgage DTI is around 55-60%. We both make the same exact amount of money from our W-2 jobs.
I've expressed over the months how tight money has been.
A few months ago me and my brother decided that since they were moving back in town we could save money by living together for a year. It's him and his wife and dog.
I told my GF about it and she got mad I didn't ask her first Which I understand but I HAVE to start saving money or in a few months I run out of savings and possibly go bankrupt.
We agreed that if we let them move in she could have the third bedroom as a walk in closet for herself.
I also offered that if she didn't want them to move in she can pay half the bills like they would instead. She declined until a few weeks before they moved in which at that point was too late.
They moved in and do not have enough room for clothes, so my brothers wife asked if she could store clothes in her
""walk in closet"". She said no.

I offered that if she could help with the bills I can reduce rent for them and then maybe the lack of storage for the clothes could be made up for by saving money. She declined to pay anything or share the room until we had a giant argument about it. While I did go back on my word, it still feels like she is trying to ruin this opportunity for me to get back on my feet. Before they moved in she argued with my brother and tried to have a GIANT rule list they had to follow. A lot of it was irrational or way too detailed.
I don't want to be one sided in the story so I can answer any questions.

I’m a college student (19M) and I’m really anxious when it comes to the thought of relationships, so I’ve really been more secluded since my last relationship ended about a year and a half ago. 

Until, one class started 5 weeks ago and an absolute STUNNER sat next to me, I mean wow (19F), so naturally I developed a FAT crush. Now I’m not a terrible looking guy, I workout and take good care of myself (I am pretty short however), but I thought she was totally out of my league. 

However over the last couple weeks she’s been initiating conversation with me (because I’m too scared to do it), when she doesn’t really converse with anyone else in the class. I notice she mirrors some of my behaviors, she kind of messes with her hair or bounces her leg when she’s sitting next to me, and recently (yesterday) she asked some personal questions, but she never holds eye contact, she meets my gaze and then darts away every 2-3 seconds. Now again, I don’t see her do this with anyone else in the class, like barely even talk to them. Now whether she’s just trying to be nice to the guy she’s stuck next to all semester or if she’s interested, idk. Do I ask?

2025-02-26 00:19:14,1iyaay4,"I (FtM19) have been with my partner (F20) for two years now. I picture and plan a life with her, but we have differences concerning physical affection. I feel as though I'm missing out on potential relationships in university. Do I leave my current amazing girlfriend for someone more similar to me?","Me and my girlfriend have been through so so much together, and she is my only serious relationship I have ever been in. We've been living together for about a year now, and she knows me more than anyone possibly could. She completes me and I view her as the love of my life. We are stellar at communicating, and have worked through many issues before. But one prevalent issue within our relationship is physical touch. She is autistic, and hates the feeling of being randomly touched, outside of certain contexts. Meanwhile, I absolutely need physical touch. I need someone to respond to my touch and enjoy it and actively seek for it. Instead, I find myself time and time again, asking her to please show me more affection. Of course, this is a difficult thing for her to do (note that she isn't against physical touch, in-fact she enjoys it at times, and we have sex regularly) and it leads to both of us compromising, with the situation never truly being resolved. This difference between us has caused a lot of pain for me, as it is something so vital to me. But she is perfect in every other way, and my love for her is so strong, thats what keeps me with her.



We did go through a rough patch early on in our relationship, where we broke up for a brief period of time. In that time, I dated a girl who enthusiastically responded to touch. She was everything I could have possibly wanted in that regard, and it made me feel very happy to be with someone who valued touch the same way I do. However, she was wrong for me in every other manner, and the issues within my relationship with my girlfriend were resolved and we happily got back together. Another thing is that she is a lot more touchy and happy to be touched when she is doing well mentally, but she is often too depressed to be comfortable with it.



TLDR; I am in university, and have met so many wonderful people, and can't help but think that I can be with someone who meets all my needs, instead of only partially. But there are no real reasons to leave my current relationship to pursue these ""what ifs"". I love my girlfriend too much, and hate change. But I don't want to end up in a situation where I am stuck, unsatisfied in a relationship, when I could have used the opportunity to branch out in university.","How do I navigate my need for physical touch in a relationship with someone who struggles with it, while also feeling tempted by the idea of exploring other potential relationships?","The individual is in university and has been in a serious relationship with their girlfriend for about a year while living together.

My bf is a hair older than me, when we first started dating and seeing each other each weekend it was like 99% we were atleast intimate weekly.
We've lived together a year now and we've domesticated. I know the frequency of sex isn't as hot as the start when you progress with someone but I love this man and actually want to be intimate with him (I had trauma issues in past and didn't want to bond like that with other partners)
He makes me feel so loved and pretty but we're lucky if we have sex once every few weeks. He's on SSRI which kills his drive, and as a woman I'm too worried to make a move because he never feels up to spontaneity on weekdays when we're working. Leaves pressure of only weekend and he doesn't initiate much unless it's Sunday morning. 
Last time we did have sex he makes jokes ""why don't we do that more"",
But I'm so afraid of being turned down if he has a headache or it's a work night.
I love him so much and he's a sweet man but I've mentioned we don't be intimate as much and it hurt his feelings because he feels he can't control what his medication does to him. I understand I'm a little younger also.. 

I'm always here to support him and love him. For once in my life I just have a man I look at all the time and want to jump on even after being together for almost 2 years and living together 1 year.

2025-02-26 00:15:28,1iya813,My (26F) boyfriend (28M) doesn’t take the lead,"My boyfriend doesn’t takes the steps toward sex. We’ve been together for five years, and in all that time, I’ve always been the one to make the first move. He rarely turns me down, but when he does engage, it often feels like he’s just going along with it for my sake rather than out of his own desire. What’s even more frustrating is that he seems completely content without sex, as if he doesn’t need it at all.
The one and only time he ever initiated was in the middle of the night—around 3 AM. I was asleep when he started undressing me and taking the lead. I was so overwhelmed with emotion that I didn’t even react; I just pretended to be half-asleep so I wouldn’t break the moment. I even teared up because I couldn’t believe it was finally happening. But after that night, it never happened again.

What makes this even harder for me is that he’s incredible in bed. He’s always attentive and willing to do whatever I ask, but he never asks for anything in return. It makes me feel guilty, like I’m taking more than I’m giving. Outside of sex, I’m also the one initiating all the physical affection—whether it’s kissing or touching. He does compliment me, saying he finds me very attractive and loves my curves a lot, but it only ever happens when we’re already in bed. I rarely hear it outside of those moments.

To test how long this dynamic would last, I once decided to stop initiating anything—no sex, no kisses, no touches—for an entire month. He didn’t react at all, didn’t seem affected in the slightest, and eventually, I gave in and went back to being the one to start things.

When I asked him why he never takes the initiative, he told me it’s because he wants me to decide when the time is right. But that explanation just puts all the responsibility on me, as if I signed up for this role when I never did. It’s frustrating.

Outside of this issue, he’s an amazing boyfriend. He’s ambitious , calm, and very smart. He also helps me a lot financially. Being with him makes me feel at peace in a way nothing else does. Just being around him feels more effective than my anxiety meds. He also has an authoritative and commanding presence but he’s very soft around me. His friends and colleagues seems to respect him. However at times, I find him to be too transcendent and disconnected from our relationship. How do I deal with this?","Why won't my boyfriend take the initiative in our physical relationship, and how can I address this dynamic?","The individual has been in a five-year relationship with her boyfriend.

Some background on myself. I struggle a lot with relationship paranoia, anxiety, and vulnerability has always been a horrifying, horrifying thing to me.

My partner also struggles with paranoia because of issues from prior relationships. I know he questions the intensity and authenticity of my feelings because of how hands-off I am.

She told me I was her favorite relationship shes had, she still wears the ring I bought her, the socks I bought her are her favorite socks that she wears all the time. She shared music with me and wondered what I was listening to and would have long text conversations with me. She even reached out to me when her dog died. But at the same time if we made plans to hangout she would cancel. But if we ran into each other when out shed be with me all night and it was like we were still in love. 



Then I told her how I felt about her and that I liked her a lot still, and she said I was too serious and she didn't like me. It doesn't make any sense to me. I was getting hurt so bad so I asked her to please never text me again because we were looking for different things and I was getting really hurt by how she was treating me like I was special and she had feelings for me btu at the same time worthless. (I didn't go into that detail I just said please never text me again). 

  
Why would she do this? Howe could she do this? How could it seem so real that she had feelings for me but then one day she just says she doesn't like me? How was it all fake? 

  
That was two months ago now and I am still really hurt. I thought we could have a second chance as two people who have grown, but apparently she was okay with not seeing me ever again. I know I did what I had to do to protect myself, but at the end of the day I wish she'd text me. I miss her so much even if it was all fake.

2025-02-26 00:02:07,1iy9xu4,I (24m) need advice dealing with my ex (27f). ?,"Trigger warning: self unaliving 

So basically I moved to the city back in 2022 from a pretty small town. I moved here for college. A year and a half in a technical college downtown here. I was about two and a half months from turning 22 and she was two and a half months away from 25 at the time. After moving into my dorm room I began looking for work. The week I moved in I stumbled into a nearby bar looking for kitchen work, sitting at the bar and ordering a drink. The bartender was really cute and I felt this pull towards her that other people often described. For simplicity I’ll call her A and me T. So I got accepted to work there and we were coworkers for a bit. After being there for about four months I went to a bar with her the weekend of Halloween after work. This was a spontaneous decision. So we call and Uber and eventually me and two of her friends end up at her apartment. After a little talking the others left and it was just us sitting on her living room floor. We were talking then kissing then I blurted out how much of a crush I had on her. She seemed stunned but told me she reciprocated. Also worth noting I’m white and she’s black. We dated for a handful of months and then she broke up with me. She was so gentle when she broke up with me and we laid in my bed holding each other. I walked her to the bus stop and we said we love each other. I watched her ride off and turn the corner and it felt like my world left with it. Some of why we broke up was cultural. She would have rather dated somebody from her community and somebody who could be there for her in ways I simply couldn’t at the time. I thought I would never see her again after that night. I messaged her a few days after and attempted to reconcile but she said that it wouldn’t work. She was very gentle again. She’s naturally a gentle and kind human being. I’ve seen her battle with her mental health struggles but I’ve never seen it directed at anybody. I’ve never heard her raise her voice and we never fought. I dated somebody else for a few months after the fact and she was absolutely horrible for me. Everything I loved about L I failed to see in this new ex. Obviously it didn’t work with me and her. L also dated somebody else for a few months that was also pretty destructive and manipulative. This brings us to January of 2024 now. In January I found out I passed my finals for college. The same morning I found out I passed college was the same morning I woke up to find that my dad had committed “unalive” of himself that night. I messaged L because I had nobody else to turn to. About a month or so later in my current apartment she came over after I was having thoughts like my dad must have been having. She was my rock. She came over and talked to me all night long. She held me when I cried. We talked about us. We talked about the relationships that both ended recently by this point. I promised myself that I wouldn’t feel those familiar feelings again. I swore we would be friends. The moment I opened the door that night though and I saw her face a little bit of what I felt for her washed back in and I shook it off. We were just friends right? Then we hung out a little bit later after this. Like two weeks or so later. She wanted to celebrate me graduating and took me out to lunch and bought our lunch despite me insisting to pay for myself. We polished off some cheap cosmos at lunch and we went to the store to get wine after that. We drank two bottles of wine when we got back to her apartment. At first I was sitting on the edge of the bed in her room and she was sitting towards the head of the bed. We were drinking and listening to music. We talked for hours. Eventually we were laying side by side in her bed. Then after awhile I was laying my head on her chest. I have long hair and she was running her hands through my hair as I drifted off to sleep. That was the last bit of intimacy I’ve had. I wished I would have kissed her. I told her tearfully soon after that those feelings were coming back and she told me it wasn’t a good time. Randomly I got a message from her again where she said she was thinking about me. Then after this we talked for five hours straight. This was last week. I messaged her the following day at around 7 am in response to a message she sent at 5am. This message was just a picture relating to a conversation we had the previous night. I haven’t heard from her since. Idk if she wants friendship or if this is missing me. I’ve never come across somebody like her. I’ve been single for awhile now and have no urge to be with anybody at all. And until this conversation I was adjusting to the idea of her just being a fond memory and a lesson/ frame of reference for how love is supposed to feel and what I want in a partner if I were to have a partner. I would be fine being alone. But she has a way of coming back around and every time I have a deep feeling of longing. It’s like when I hear from her I’m on a high for a few days then crash hard. Idk what to do now.

2025-02-26 00:01:33,1iy9xch,My 32M partner wants me 25F to cut off platonic friends that I hooked up with-Feeling stuck,"EDIT: I have already cut off this friend! I should’ve set the title to. I cut off a platonic friend… please stop insulting me and telling me I have no respect for my partner. I am just generally asking the public on how they view the situation and that is all feel free to share your opinion. 

I (25F) have a partner (32M) who has a hard time trusting me around people I’ve had a past with. I’ve always been transparent about my relationships, but it feels like the more honest I am, the more control they want over my friendships.

I’m friends with several people I used to hook up with, and those friendships have been platonic for a long time. One particular friend and I were good friends before we started hooking up. He was somebody that would just randomly just calling to see how I’m doing and catch up on life. He was one of those good friends that you can just have a conversation about life, the things they personally wanna work on in life and just share any new things that we learned. Any time he happened to be in my state he would invite me out for lunch or we go out to a party and hang with my friends, It was very genuine. When we started to hook up, we did one relationship, but we lived in two different states which we agree that it wouldn’t work out between us and we agree to stay close friends. Sometime later I met my current partner and we hit it off.  We never had any issues talking about her past. It wasn’t until the friend I used to hook up with was going to be at a party that me and my partner were going to be a. I didn’t want to be awkward, so I introduced them. My friend was really respectful And hung out with us for a bit, but eventually left to catch up with his friends. My partner made it clear they were uncomfortable with this friend because of our past. My partner said he didn’t want me talking to this person because our past was just too recent. I respected their feelings and stopped talking to this person, even though I miss the friendship. Recently, my partner has become uncomfortable with me liking photos from any of my past hookups on social media, even though I have no feelings for them anymore. My partner told me that it was weird that I was liking their pictures and that it was basically disrespectful and confusing the other person, considering the fact that I told him I didn’t wanna talk to them anymore. He basically said it seems like I’m saying it’s OK to disrespect my partner. I told him OK no problem. I’ll just go ahead and deactivate my account and also Unfollow the person so that if I ever decide to reactivate it, I’m not following them.

My partner has told me they would told me they would cut someone off immediately if I said they made them uncomfortable, and while I get the need for boundaries, it feels like they’re asking me to erase parts of my life for their peace of mind. I find myself constantly walking on eggshells around them because of their insecurities. They claim they’re not insecure and that they trust me. It’s that they don’t trust that other person.

It’s draining, and I feel like I’m losing myself in this relationship. I’m struggling with balancing my own happiness with my partner’s insecurities, especially since I’m not doing anything wrong. I just miss the friends I’ve had to cut off, and I feel like I’m being punished for having a past. It’s not like I hang out with these people often and I’m also very transparent anytime I have hung out with him. I even go as far as checking in with my partner during those times to which my partner says they’re thankful for, but then it feels like they use it later as ammunition against me.

Has anyone been through something like this? How do you deal with a partner who can’t trust your platonic friendships, even after full transparency?","How do you deal with a partner who can’t trust your platonic friendships, even after full transparency?","The individual is a 25-year-old female.

2025-02-26 00:01:29,1iy9xa8,Is there any way I (31F) can make this right with my LDR (37M)?,"After speaking long distance for years, I finally met the guy I've been long distance dating. It was a short but very sweet visit and he made the trip out to see me (from across the country, despite planes making him nervous). 

I had such a beautiful time and he said he did, too. Then, when he left my area, I started to panic. I know we're not exclusive, but I want to be. I wish we could work on seeing one another more often. 

Four weeks after his visit, I became passive aggressive and then blew up at him over text after these events: 1) a joke he made that hurt my feelings, and 2) no gifts or special time together on Valentine's Day. In the message I insinuated that we weren't a good match for each other. 

  
We've had healthy communication for years. I've confided in him that I'm a virgin and would like my first time to be with him. He's not a touchy feely person with his words, which I've always known, but he's been open with me about his life experiences and I understand why he's reserved in that way. He shows love through his actions. And I feel ashamed because I lashed out at him out of fear. I called within 48 hours to apologize and left a voice message explaining that I was reacting out of fear, and told him I like him so much and wish we could be exclusive and is that something he's interested in.

  
He hasn't responded yet. He's been quite patient with me in the past, he's supported me when I've had tough times with my family, aside from the most recent V-Day he's honored all of my wishes. I've tried to do the same for him, but I really failed this time. 

I'm afraid it's over. Is this irreparable? Have I done all I can to make this right?

2025-02-26 00:00:09,1iy9w22,Need help with my sex life (24f) in relationship with my partner (28m),"Me (24f) and my boyfriend (28m) have been together for almost 4 years, are super in love, been sexually active and I’d say we generally have a good sex life.
We are great communicators and best friends, and talk about this topic a lot - but we are stuck. 

Since our relationship began, I’ve struggled a lot with: anxiety during sex, panic attacks, pain during sex, inability to orgasm, low libido, a history of SA within a last relationship, UTIs, yeast infections, pretty much any issue you could have, I’ve had it. 
I think maybe this has caused a lot of tension around the idea of sex, it’s really heavy and intimidating, instead of being attractive and easy and exciting. 

It’s gotten significantly better. We’ve grown so much, and the pain is less if at all. I don’t get UTIs or yeast infections. I haven’t had a panic attack during sex in years. My partner has always been there for me to listen to my concerns and needs. We have worked a lot together to get to this point. He has a really high sex drive but does a great job making me feel loved and pleased even if it takes forever on my end. 

But I feel like I’ve reached this point where it’s just still not great for me. I take too long to orgasm where I just lose interest or get in my head. Or it hurts a little and that distracts me from the pleasure and I get in my head. I usually end up making him stop pleasing me because I just can’t get in the zone. It’s just tough when he’s sooo into it, and I’m kinda - not. I remember as a teen having a super high sex drive, and I wish I could have that back. It felt so exciting and fun. 

We’ve both spent so much time on Reddit reading other peoples stories but nothing is helpful.

We are a LDR and I planned to move to her state when I graduated in a year, but ever since this year started she started feeling really distant. I communicated to her that she felt distant recently and she told me it’s because she feels she wont have a personality of her own if she spends every day with me (we play games a lot) and her best friend mentioned in January that she’s been really only spending time with me and that seemed to have really hurt her. Fast forward to this month, I basically tried to also re-assure her that I love her and if she wanted the space she needed she can take it and befriend her best friends friend group. That what’s she has been doing. But just recently we had an argument where I wanted to communicate to her a problem but i tried to make it clear to her that I am working on it myself and I just wanted to let her know since she told me she can’t read my mind and we wanted to work on our communication.

We did go on dates but the majority of our time together was spent watching movies, cuddling, and having sex. He would often flake on plans the day of which was disappointing to me. I told him I felt like he was disrespecting my time and he assured me he would start to follow through on plans. A few weeks later he makes a big deal about how he wants to take me out to dinner for Valentine’s Day even though I wasn’t expecting anything. The day before Valentine’s Day, he says he can’t go out to dinner and he was drinking when he said he would so it doesn’t count. I let it go but he flaked again one night and I became too frustrated so I told him I felt this had run its course and I needed to focus on other things. He asked if there was anything he could do to change my mind but I decided to hold on my decision. 

This is hard for me because I like this guy. He told me he liked me too, asked to meet my parents, would tell me he misses me, etc. I miss him and I’m wondering if I made a mistake but don’t want to go on being disrespected.

We done the deed a couple of times, until she told me that she didn’t want to have sex until we were married, I agreed because I’m also trying to practice abstinence and was tired of superficial surface level relationships.

I told her about it & she told she did. She said was serious about the whole no sex thing and she’s said it’s hard to do that when sleeping right next to someone. I told her that ok that’s cool ain’t nothing wrong with that, I wasn’t trying to rush anything with her and told her I’m trying to do abstinence too. She forgave me we were back on good terms. We started seeing each other a lot more often and would always tell each other we love each other, not gone lie I’ve started to catch feelings.

She’s calls me and is begging me to hangout I’m not really trying to, as I’m just trying to be alone for awhile, cause I’m just trying to focus on work and other personal things but she kept pushing me to. So I do so just for the night. We hangout, she starts kissing me and things start to take a turn, we play truth or dare and they start to get sexual, her dares was to sleep naked together.

I'm '47M' a pretty laid back husband and father, I don't get emotional, lash out or have much aggression.  I can be lazy, spacey but overall carry my weight and have drastically improved. My wife is '52F'.  I believe I have a good handle on my reactions and almost never speak sharply to people.  I'm not saying that is the right way to be, but I do get upset when someone speaks aggressively to me.  

  
Often my wife will be unhappy with something, it often feels irrational, but I get it, it's not irrational to her.  She typically get's anxious and then speaks sharp, calling out the things that I'm doing wrong and how she works and takes care of the kids.. (i work a 9-5 and also take care of the kids).  It's a script that happens often..  Sometimes it escalates into being super sharp and when I respond trying to explain my position or what happened, it blows up,. She immediately calls me defensive and doesn't acknowledge my side of the story.  Perhaps it is defensive but often there is a pretty clear part of the story that she leaves out.  

  
Then when I get upset that she was aggressive she calls me too sensitive and that I can never take criticism. I don't know, I kind of believe that people should be able to speak calmly, rational and fair, maybe I expect too much.  that a conversation should be someone expresses what they are experiencing and the other person can respond and say that's not exactly what happened or what was going on.. Instead it's this brick wall about how ""there's your defensiveness again"".  I do know I'm defensive but often it's for a reason.

2025-02-25 23:43:13,1iy9iw5,My (29M) GF (32F) seems defensive about a night with her male friend and I'm not sure how to approach this?,"We're 10 months in and it's largely great. For context, she has a bunch of male friends most of which she's not really seen in person for years, they just keep in touch from previous jobs via Snapchat/Messenger etc.

A month in we had a miscommunication which resulted in her feeling 'stood up', we got over it a day later, but one of her closer male friends she must've vented to slightly decided to catch up with her over it. Because of this, I voiced my concern, establishing a boundary of sorts that I'd like to meet the guy if anything, and she even suggested that herself so we could all meet at a bar in town. This dude has a girlfriend of a few years and has quipped to my GF once when she forgot he was my age and not younger as to whether that was why they ""never tried anything"". She also had his Snapchat name as ""Lord Schlong"" for the longest while because apparently he has a huge package (she changed it to his actual name months in and tried to make a song and dance about it to me as if she was being proactive...)

Well, due to the date he had to set apparently, plans shifted last minute and they had to go without me, which again I was okay with under the pretense they meet in town for a quick drink, chat and goodbye -- she had work the next morning at like 6AM so it seemed reasonable. I'd gone on 5 months with her assuming this was the case and as such, put it in the back of my head. She still said on that night I could message her and that she wasn't ""that kind of girl"", but after a couple between us she went radio silent from 10PM until I saw her the next day.

Once she'd came back from a trip with family, she let slip during some unrelated chatter that aside from myself, this guy friend was the only other person who had seen her place she'd moved into just last year. I brought her up on this, because it implied they never stuck to the original plan at all and instead she had him over 1-to-1. She said something along the lines of ""it being a long time ago"" and again, I buried it for a while longer.

Lately, it's come up again, I mentioned his name and she immediately seemed to get defensive pointing out that I'd screwed her over way back during that week which is why he saw her to begin with. At no point does she seem to clock, mention or act as if she's aware she'd overstepped a boundary of mine and with our relationship moving forward soon (moving in etc) I'm starting to be stifled by this. To top it all off, I pushed her a little more on the matter when tired one night and she'd said something about us only being a month in at the time without much elaboration, which has only made this more of a worry than it ever was I guess in my mind, though she assured me he ""didn't stay the night"".

I have to broach this with her right? I don't feel I can move in with someone when this kind of bomb is hanging over my head. I start to think back where we hadn't actually gotten intimate until a few days after this incident because I was getting in my head after being out of the game for a while.  Any insight would be appreciated...

Edit: Forgot to mention, another male friend of hers sent her a drunk video of masturbating -- she told me immediately but only muted snapchat notifications and hasn't blocked him to this day.",Should I bring up my concerns about my girlfriend's friendship with a male friend and how it's making me feel uneasy about our relationship before moving in together?,"The individual in crisis appears to be involved in a relationship where there are trust issues stemming from interactions between their partner and her male friends.

Eventually she started mentioning it and i realized that i was being a dumbass and when i did i started thinking. But what i ended up deciding was it would better off if i distance myself completely and not have her have to go through me being a dumb prick because im not thinking straight.

2025-02-25 23:41:20,1iy9hes,I (33M) thinking about leaving my wife (29F) to be with the love of my life (29F). What your opinion?,"Sorry for the long post but i need to express the whole picture. I am not proud or a saint. You can judge me but please give me your sincerely opinion, advice or experience if something similar had happen to you. As the title says i am thinking about divorcing my wife to be with the love of my life. We are together for the past 10 years which 4 of them we are married. My wife is beatiful, kind, generous, considerate and gentle. Has everything a man should ask to settle down. She was my 1st real relationship. But since the beginning of our relationship i didnt really feel much excitement, butterflies or anything. That probably had to do with our sex life. It was mediocre at best, dull without any passion. Even tho sex was bad i chose to move on with this relationship since she was perfect in every other area. 6 month after we started dating i met the love of my life lets call her kate. Kate is shy but adventurous on the same time and we clicked immediately. We had sex and it was the opposite i had with my wife. Our chemistry was perfect. We met 3 more times but i started have feelings for her and the same was happening for her too. So i told her that i had a relationship and we should stop. But we couldnt really stop. We both felt guilty but we met sometimes for the next months until she found a relationship and we stopped. My wife moved in with me in the meantime. Sex with my wife for next 5 years  went from mediocre to bad. At times we had sex once per month and it felt like a chore. I thought i had some problem  at that time and i was also addicted to porn. So it was mostly my fault that sex was so bad. I didnt try enough to initiate. My wife always had low libido so from her part she didnt feel that there was a problem. Covid fucked as even more. We were like buddies all day together. Until we got married and my whole life changed. Kate messaged me 2 days after my wedding and she was single. At the start we just talked casually but that changed quickly. I couldn't resist her and we met again. But this time it was different. Sex was great as always but we really came close. We fell in love. We were talking all day, meeting whenever we could, living in our secret world. It was the first time i felt in love and it was like setting free from a prison. Even though I was in that situation I never gave any hope to kate that we would be together. You would ask me why you didn't divorce back then. I don't really know. My therapist says cause i didn't want unconsciously to disappoint my parents since i was raised like that. I will tell you that it was probably that i was mentally immature at the time to think what was the best for me. And naturally after 1 year of our secret life with kate we had to stop again. 2 years passed. We had a beautiful son with my wife. Those 2 years i was thinking about kate regularly but i couldn't do much. Until I saw her randomly this summer. Of course she had to be single again. We met sometimes. And now i knew for sure that she is the love of my life, The one i was meant to be together for the rest of my life. I feel really lucky and cursed at the same time that i felt something so strong but in the worst possible time. I had a child now. I couldn't handle that, felt super guilty and i told her that we should stop forever. I blocked her from everything and tried to move on with my life. But i cant really do that. I feel numb and empty most of the time and i am thinking about her constantly. I cant sleep more than 4 hour for the past 8 months and therapy doesnt help at all. I want to forget her but my heart is broken in half. Every cell of my body wants to be with her, she is my soulmate. My son is my top priority. I value him higher that my happiness. If i get divorce, my wife and him will move far away from me. I want to be part of his life. Also i don't want a divorce to affects him psychologically. Last week i heard from a friend that kate is still single and is waiting for me to go find her. She still believes in us and refuses to move on. How can I handle all that? Tell me your opinions. If i choose to stay with my wife how can i move on in my life. I fear i can't surpass the thought that my happiness is elsewhere and it will eat me for the rest of my life. Its basically my happiness vs my sons happiness in my mind. I am desperate and miserable so i wil appreciate any advice. For context i am with my wife 10 years and know kate 9 and half. So my feelings arent careless cause of the good sex. As for my wife. I love her as a person, spent my whole life with her but i am not sexually attracted.

Would it be best for me (M21) to break up with her (F20) now or stay until the end?,"Hey y'all—love my girlfriend, we've been together for a couple years, got a place together last June. I'm leaving the state to pursue a different lifestyle in 4 months, when our lease is over and I've graduated from my college.

Last September, I realized what I wanted to do with my life and told her what I was planning to do. So we agreed to go our own ways, but stay together while we had our lease. I don't know if it was the best idea, though. We've been comfortable, but the decision hurts her every day, and it's gotten worse. The other day we talked about how it's going to get harder and harder for her as we get closer to our expiration date—she's been counting down the days, and she's so scared of the last month, how hard it'll be as we prepare to leave, the pain of the last day, etc.

It makes me wonder if I'm dragging something out that I don't need to, and if I should just move out now and get out of her life ASAP so she can start to heal and figure out a new way in life. Can anyone give me their perspective?

**My inner reasoning to stay**: I already told her we'd stay together until summer and she *wants* to, and she'd be hurt if I left early. *She doesn't want to break up until we have to.* I also feel like it'd be an unnecessary shake-up; we'd have to make a whole big deal out of it, I'd have to move out... and tbh I'm pretty scared of the whole thing.

2025-02-25 23:30:06,1iy98me,What decade is this? 33F and 31M,"
Today my sister suggested I apply for an executive assistant job. It's heavy on the accounting and requires 7-10 years of experience. I have 10 years of experience in an administrative role working for high powered family owned real estate companies, but little accounting experience. So I showed it to my husband of 6 years and he says: ""Did she really think you could do that? I mean you don't have the references."" And then he laughed. The casual dismissal shocked me. His tone. The laugh. It felt so sexist. I mean he could have said anything in that moment. 

When I told him that it upset me he acted innocent (didn't remember what he said), defended himself so hard (said that he wasn't a non-entity/stranger), tried to reassure me that he does believe in me and that he didn't mean it like that. Later he apologized but omg. I began to feel discouraged but I snapped myself out of it.

In general he's a good guy but he often puts his foot in his mouth, denies, gets defensive then says sorry. We are both currently in therapy but we just started on this journey. It's the same pattern over and over again and it's exhausting and frustrating. No it doesn't usually sound sexist but there are themes of control weaved throughout our relationship.

We’ve always had a pretty good sex life, he waited a year for me to start. We’re both 18 and fully committed to eachother, we’ve spoken so many times about marrying eachother and spending the rest of our lives together. I know everyone says this, but you have to take my word when we are serious about this, even at a young age. I love him so much and he loves me so much. 

At the start of the year he brought up to me he was considering having no sex before marriage, and he had felt like God had been speaking to him and like it’s something he wanted to do. I’ve always known he’s come from a christian background and that’s completely fine, i’m happy he’s found God and just happy he’s happy. Me personally, i am not christian. 

When he brought this up to me, i was upset. Having great sex to being told we aren’t allowed to have anymore until we got married was really big for me (and for him). He said to me last week that he’s come to the decision that he’s pretty sure he wants to stop having sex. 

He says that our relationship shouldn’t be built on sex but that’s always been a huge and great part of our relationship. I’ve never seen it in a way that our relation is built on sex, because it’s not. However that doesn’t mean it’s okay for it to stop in my opinon. He’s always had a really high sex drive. We’d have sex every day/night we were together, multiple times.

I keep telling him that I’m not shallow and it’s more than just the act of sex itself that I’m struggling with. It changes the whole dynamics of our relationship even down to day to day chit chat and banter. To me it’s love making and intimacy as I see him as my life partner.

I don’t really know how this works just looking for some advice and what people think about this.

So I am on the autism spectrum, though in the very low end. However I do still have special interests that changes over time, and sometimes they are strong, sometimes weak and other times not present at all. Examples are Egypt, the Soviet Union, Star Wars, Dinosaurs and so on - common special interests for people with autism lol. It mostly shows as I often get this urge to share some fact I learned about the topic.

The problem is that my girlfriend sometimes gets mad at me for talking too much about it. Her reaction varies. Of course sometimes she asks about it or just listens and show interest. But other times she will clearly show that she is disinterested (either intentionally or not unintentional) which of course is fine, she doesn't have to show interest all the time.

The thing is, the longer I've had the interest the more disinterested she gets, which is understandable, but it would also be nice if she showed some interest, even though I know that I talk a lot about it.

But sometimes she gets mad at me for talking about it, where she will sharply, angrily, and spontaneously tell me that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore. Then I get a little sad and mad, and when I confront her, she sharply/angrily tells me all about how she finds it frustrating that everything has to be about my interest, that I can't expect her to be interested when I talk about it so much and have been doing so for so long now, and that I talk too much about it.

I know I talk a lot about it, but it is definitely not the only thing I talk about and is interested in during these periods. It mostly comes out in little bursts of facts, or me telling her about some thing I found that is related to the topic. I would say that I in total talk about it for 30 minutes throughout a weekend day. I listen to hear talk about her interests and life all the time, and I of course don't show the same level of interest all the time, but I of course show interest even if I don't find it the most interesting.

He doesn't not speak to me really at all at work like no ""hey"" ""bye"" nothing outside of work related stuff. The only time I ever had a conversation unrelated to work with him is when he caught me in the parking lot that one day when he told me he was interested. He says basically to keep people out his of his buisness which I thought was understandable, but the thing is I feel like he not really trying to make the effort to know me. We only text that's it. No calls no dates. It's only be 1 week and some days but he doesn't even ask questions about me at all. I try to ask him stuff but it would feel like I'm integrating him cause he doesn't ask anything back. It's literally just flirting that's it. So we plans this weekend to see each other today. He wasn't really texting me yesterday and he didn't say anything about today. He texted me like at 7pm telling me he's bored. I reply shorty agreeing that I was as well hoping that wanna talk to me or mention tomorrow maybe. He never responded. Not gonna lie, that irritated me cause he made it seem like he had such a big ass crush on me and I felt the same but now I'm wondering if he's really interested.

I texted back later and told him how I didn't feel like he seriously was trying to get to know me basically and he was still confused I guess. At this point, idk what to say cause I don't want to sound desperate. So it's taking me longer to respond. He sends another text basically cutting me off. So I try to explain what I mean and he stopped responding. Am I expecting too much after 1 week and a half. I just want didn't want to be played with but maybe I should've just played it cool and not said anything idk UGHHH I'm annoyed ——-UPDATE!!!!: he just respond to my text saying “It’s all love, u have my number hit me when u serious” like what….because I said he’s acting weird and wasn’t show as much interest as I would like what the hell😂😂😂I’m over dating I swear !

2025-02-25 23:18:15,1iy8z0n,My boyfriend’s [M29] sister [F23] hates me and I don’t know why.,"I really need some guidance on how to proceed from here.

My boyfriend [29] and I [28] have been together 7 years and I think his sister hates me. There has been no crazy bad events that have happened between us but she has always been very cold to me and I am unsure of what to do about it at this point. 

The first couple years into us dating she told her family that she didn’t want me to come on vacation with them (I previously had been on several before) and for it to just be the family, so I didn’t go. I accepted it and thought maybe she just wanted some space and nostalgia. But it really hurt my feelings.

Another thing is that she is very social. She’s bubbly, beautiful, funny, and I know she has a good heart. She talks to everyone and is so sweet to them but our exchanges are cold and awkward, even when I really try to have a conversation with her. I have never previously had an issue with a partners sibling before this. I thought maybe she was just going through it and I remember not having much in common with my brother’s girlfriends when I was a teenager. I came around eventually and we found some common interests.

Additionally, she is into photography and takes pictures of everyone and everything all the time. I think we have only ever had group pictures together. She has never once asked me personally to be in a picture with her, she asks everyone around us though. This isn’t a huge deal to me but like it is to the point where I am noticing it and honestly it just really hurts me. I respect how she feels but it just makes me feel like shit and I just wish I knew what I did so I can figure out how to help us move past it.

I have made my feelings known to my boyfriend and he has stated that she just is the way she’s always been and that she doesn’t like me that much but it doesn’t matter because he loves me. He also did not know why and that she did not say specifically.

It’s nothing ‘big’ anymore really but it’s been so long. I’m growing more concerned because it’s been 7 years, we’re all adults and it’s still a very cold relationship. Am I thinking too much into it? How do I move forward and address this issue without making the situation worse?

2025-02-25 23:15:06,1iy8was,I feel conflicted about my girlfriends boundaries (M20 F21). How do I set a middle ground?,"My girlfriend mentions that she is usually cold and distant when it comes to interacting with boys which majority is during her classes at university. However, she has an exception for a childhood friend (M20) because they have been growing up as neighbors up till now.

From my own perspective, she's been okay one time with taking a walk together with him around the neighborhood because his mom  encouraged her to. She's okay with ""gifting"" him snacks or sweets that she cant finish or even like. She once put up a greetings sign on her window wondering if he would see it. When she went to a comic-con with her friends, she planned to meet him there too. She's okay with going to University together with him on the days their class schedules align, sometimes meeting up at campus as well. She's also asked him to accompany her to campus for a group meeting next week.

I asked why that friend is an exception and she basically explains how she pities him because of his shyness and lack of social skills which leads to him having no friends. She has seen what its like for another one of her friend (F20) go through a similar situation and doesnt want her childhood friend to go through the same. As you can see, my girlfriend cares of him which is nice of her and I find understandable.

My problem lies where my girlfriend stated that she finds it uncomfortable if I ever went anywhere outside with any girl. Her reasons aernt known but its clear that she has a boundary for that, most likely due to her being a person that gets jealous easily. 

As we both discuss, I questioned the irony being played here to seek reasons why she thought its normal for her to hang out with him but not okay for me to hangout with any girl, which she then justifies it with various factors such as them both studying at the same campus means its normal to walk there and meet together or that if she isnt going out her way to change plans just so they can meet, its alright for her.

I havent mentioned these points till now because I found it weird but worth pointing out:

1. Her mentioning about being cold towards boys is hard for me to imagine because Ive never seen her act cold toward a boy other than being her kind, considerate and extroverted self. She's told me instances before where she would exchange comics with another classmate and would often make jokes. She once got asked to get coffee together by another classmate but she had classes which she told me how she felt guilty for not being able to go get coffee with him. She's asked a former-classmate which class he would be taking next semester so she could join him to not be alone. (All these are boys)

2. Her reasoning to go to Uni with her childhood friend is because she feels alone. She does have several girl friends but none of them are available to meet or she isnt bothered to ask her other friends for their schedule.

Its hard for me to understand how its not okay to hangout and catch up with, lets say, a female childhood friend but my girlfriend think its okay to ask and accept invitations to hangout with her male friend that she feels bad for.",Why does my girlfriend feel it's okay for her to hang out with her male childhood friend but not okay for me to hang out with any girl?,"The individual in the Reddit post is a university student who interacts primarily with peers in an academic setting. They have a girlfriend who has mentioned being cold and distant towards most boys, except for one childhood friend with whom they grew up as neighbors. The girlfriend has a tendency to be extroverted and has a group of friends, but she feels alone at times and relies on this childhood friend due to the unavailability of her female friends.

The post suggests that both individuals are navigating complex emotions regarding friendships, social interactions, and boundaries within their relationship, particularly concerning interactions with members of the opposite sex. The girlfriend's tendency to compare her friend's situation to that of her childhood friend indicates a compassionate nature. Additionally, the girlfriend's feelings of jealousy highlight personal insecurities that may stem from her own experiences and perceptions of social interactions.

We just recently moved out of our home state and everything seems to be going well, sex life is sub par at best but she says her mental health is bad and doesn’t have a sex drive.. fine is what it is.but that didn’t stop her from fucking this other guy. So it just leaves doubt in my head. Our home life is good, I travel for work so I’m away for 10 days and home for 4. I am the sole provider and she is a SAHM. Again I’m fine with providing and supporting her and our children at the expense of my own. I’ve been seeing some weird patterns when I’m away, not answering my texts, leaving me on read, not really engaging in any conversation. Keep in mind everything seems great when I’m home. I know she probably has her hands full and everything with the kids but I feel like that excuse only goes so far. Recently I have been noticing things she’s been liking on instagram, they are basically memes 
For example 

“POV:

“me calling my long distance boo to make sure he still in love with me even though we haven't seen eacts other yet”

“POV:

“Me scared of going on a date bes what if it works out and i have to stop texting my ex lol”

“POV:

“Getting one last look at the love of your life before you go back home to your partner”

 

 and when I ask her why she is liking them she gets very defensive and says I’m controlling and it’s just a joke and blah blah blah. So I wanted to hear from you guys and get your opinions on this, considering her prior cheating and lack of accountability through the whole situation. 
Also keep in mind since we are friends on instagram you can see what posts your friends like and interact with. I’m not going out of my way to find these things it just pops up in my reels.

History

So, a lot to unpack here. My partner and I have been together for about 7 years. We clicked immediately and she moved in about 4-5 months after we started dating. Her and I were (are?) in love, she was living with me most of the time, and my roommate moved out unexpectedly, leaving me two weeks to find a roommate or to come up with full rent. She decided to drop schooling, and then she moved in, and it was great at first. 

After a couple years (right before covid), she bought a house and we moved in together. We had a plan to get married, and eventually I proposed around year 3 or so. After that, she decided she didn't want kids, and I was on the fence. I think I let our relationship stagnate at this point. I stopped caring as much once that window was closed - I wasn't *sure* I wanted kids, and I have pressure from family and society to have them, so I stopped being sure she was the one for me. 

I subconsciously stopped being as good of a partner around this point. I would let things like the dishes, or trash, slip over and over again. I would say I would learn cooking, and would give it a shot, but it wouldn't stick and I wouldn't do it consistently. She would pick up the slack and do these things. She would talk to me about it, I would make an effort, then eventually the habit would fall apart and the cycle would restart. I'm going to refer to this as the ""laziness cycle"" later.

Recently, sensing we've been stagnant, we opened our relationship. It was a blast at first, but eventually we both got tired of it, now we're back where we started. It's basically a non-issue, aside from her being able to get validation from other people.

Bumps 

There have been some bumps in our relationship. Our sex life became stale after a while as we're both fairly large, so we can't do anything but cowgirl. She refused to try to lose weight with me, and would mock me when I talked about trying to. I used to have high libido (could do it 1-4 times a day), but she only wanted to do it weekly. I tried to spice it up with foreplay, toys, bdsm elements, whatever she wanted. I always made sure she came, but it still got stagnant. I began transitioning, partially, to manage these needs, as well as my anxiety. The estrogen really, really helps with lowering libido, cravings, my OCD, my (until recently) constant weed smoking, and my need to rush through things to get to the ""dopamine"". I'm a lot calmer after starting estrogen. Her and I smoked weed daily for years and part of our relationship was built on mutual drug use, either at festivals, on trips, etc. mainly LSD and MDMA, but it did develop into a bit of a drug problem for me with Xanax. I'm now (mostly) sober, I don't feel a constant urge to be high since starting estrogen. She is bi, so the transitioning hasn't affected our relationship negatively. At the same time, I don't know if it's what I want. I kinda still want to be a dad. I was ok with giving it up to be with her. But also I like looking femme. I need to unpack that personally I think, but any insights into that are welcome and appreciated.

Where We're At

Well, the laziness cycle happened again, and this time she wants me out of the house for good. I don't blame her, I should have put the effort in. I thought paying the mortgage, some of the household bills, and contributing myself, my company, affection, and a host of physical items would be enough. It wasn't, because of course it wasn't. It feels like a major step backwards. 

I mean, we have no commitments or obligations tieing us together, we stagnated during the marriage planning and integration process, and now we're going backwards. I don't think I want to live as casual daters forever. She wants our spaces separate, but she also wants to see each other 1-4 times a week for movies, dinner, dates, etc. I don't know. I feel like there won't be a time where she will want to get back to living together. At least not anytime soon. I don't want to just be her emotional support, cuddle buddy, and booty call. I want more. I want commitment and trust. But I do still love her deep down. Are we just procrastinating ripping the bandaid off?

I truly became a better person, but still disgusted and revolted with who I was. She wants to break no contact. How do I tell her? How do I hurt her that much again?  

I want to be clear, I know I did something unforgivable, and I am a monster. I beat myself up enough over it to know. 

That said, our relationship was toxic from both sides due to some personal reasons, and over the years of our relationship, my personal issues changed me into a person I disgust and do not recognise. I was distant, emotionally unavailable and projected my personal issues onto her to name a few things. 

A pattern I have discovered since the break up is that I isolate myself, or cut myself off emotionally from emotional situations and commitment. At the time, I mistook it for me losing my love for her. Then one particularly drunken night on a holiday, I made the worst mistake of my life. We broke up shortly after due to said personal issues, but I never told her about the one night stand I had. 

In the last 5 months, I have felt nothing but regret, anger at myself and sorrow, for her and how much I hurt her. I have used these months to get better and I truly believe I could be a good partner.

But now she wants to break no contact. I was not worthy of her, and still do not feel as such, but I think I have become a man who could be worthy of her. But how do I tell her about the one night stand? How do I inflict such tremendous pain again?

Early on, she was open and honest with me about having HSV2 (genital herpes). I really respect her for disclosing it so soon, and I told her that it wasn't a dealbreaker for me. Since then, l've educated myself a lot, and have learned a lot. Some say they've never contracted it from their parents, some have and are now left to date with it making things harder, some say dating with it isn't that hard. A mixed bag.
That said, her HSV2 has become a mental and emotional roadblock in our relationship, especially regarding intimacy. We've been physically close but haven't had sex yet. She's expressed that she'd feel terrible if she passed it to me, and I know l'd also struggle with getting it. She currently doesn't take antiviral meds because of the side effects but said she'd be open to trying them again.
It feels like we're both stuck-she has a mental block preventing her from fully embracing intimacy, and I have one because I don't want to contract HSV2. We both want to be together sexually, but we're struggling with the fear and emotional weight of it all.

2025-02-25 23:00:14,1iy8jsq,My (24 M) boyfriend ended thing with me (22 F) after ignoring me for 3 days,"I understand this is probably a subreddit for ongoing relationships but I just woke up this morning to him ending things and I’m not handling it well. Sorry in advance for the long read and if I repeat some things but there’s a lot that goes into this and my mind is everywhere. 

I (22F) and my now ex (24M) had been together for 8 months. I understand this isn’t a very long time but I was genuinely looking forward to spending the rest of my life with this man. We had a lot in common and he was so much more patient and kind to me than anyone I’ve previously been with. 

For some backstory I met him through a friend I cut off a few months ago for a lot of reasons. This friend started to act strange after we started dating even though she had pushed for us to be together, even trying to give herself the credit for us dating. She used to invite me to almost everything and then started to completely exclude me from things but consistently would text him about plans. I also know of an affair she had with a married man around a year into our friendship and hearing the way she spoke about it/witnessing a tiny bit of it I knew I didn’t want her in my life long term. I officially checked out of the friendship after a concert we went to back in October where she went out of her way to hit on a performer who A. had another girl on his arm already, B. had online photos that really made it seem like he had a girlfriend (not the same girl he had on his arm), and C. made us wait an entire hour after the concert so she could give him gifts she had bought him. The last part pisses me off the most since she knew I had to work in the morning and we were hours away from home. It was also just proved that her behavior hadn’t changed since the married man bs. 

I had told my ex about all of this when I made the decision to end the friendship and he agreed that she had not been very good to me. I wasn’t going to have too much of an issue with them still hanging out in group settings since I didn’t feel I had any real reason to believe something sneaky would happen behind my back. 

This was until he lied to me mid January about going to a christmas party she was having. He also lied earlier this month about going to her birthday dinner. I’m honestly still hurt and shocked that he had felt the need to hide these things from me. Especially since I’ve told him of trust issues from past relationships where I was cheated on/lied to. We had plenty of conversations trying to move past it but they didn’t really go anywhere. 

This past Friday was apparently the last straw for us. We had plans to hang out so I called him to see when I could head over. He was at the gym so awhile passes and he snaps me that he’s almost finished. When I read this I noticed that his location was off (you can call me crazy for checking it but I have trauma related to this kind of thing). I panicked and called him again asking why this was, he said he didn’t know and would check it once he was home. He does turn it back on when he gets home and I don’t really think he was doing something sneaky behind my back given I could see he was at the gym. That and the small amount of time between it being turned off and him getting home. I still wanted to have a conversation with him about it where i ended up asking him to promise he wasn’t lying to me about it. I’ve done this each previous time he was lying because I honestly just don’t know of any other way to reassure myself. He said he promised and that I needed to trust him. I asked if he knew that trust had to be earned, he said yes. I then asked if he understood that him lying to me previously had broken that trust, to which he replied he didn’t know it was that severe. I had bawled my eyes out to this man about this and damn near begged him to not do it again each time, just for him to say it didn’t seem that severe to him. We talked a bit more about it afterwards and he finally admitted to one of the lies, I had already known given that I’m not stupid and he’s a terrible liar. Still, him finally admitting it made me feel a bit better. 

We went to bed and the next morning I asked him if everything was okay since he hadn’t cuddled me (something he only does when we had these kind of conversations before bed). He had said yes but then completely ignored me for hours. I know he was working but I can see when he’s active and he knows this. I ended up texting him saying that if he didn’t want to snap/text me that he could just say so since he “wanted to communicate better”. I also called him an asshole for ignoring me which I understand may have a been a bit much but this has happened before and I was losing my patience. I have never called him any derogatory names other than “mean” before this. He replied that he didn’t want to speak with me so we didn’t until late the next day when I was having a panic attack.

I texted him asking if we could talk and he said he needed time to put his thoughts together. I, again panicking, said that I was just asking for a short call to which he refused. I know y’all are probably going to call me crazy for this but I blew up his phone with calls and texts until he answered me almost an hour later saying he would call when he got home. I can’t say the phone call was good given that I was sobbing and panicking for most of it. I remember saying that I felt like I was being punished for wanting to have the conversation we did the other night and that I didn’t understand why he was acting the way he was. He calmed me down and had said that he wasn’t trying to punish me but that he felt the conversation was bringing up things that we had already moved past. I told him I couldn’t just move past him lying to me that quickly and that I needed these talks to be able to. He also told me he didn’t plan on breaking up with me. We ended the call with me saying that if he needed space tomorrow (yesterday) that it was okay, I just wanted to be told instead of ignored. He said he would do his best to talk to me when he could.

Yesterday comes and he again completely ignores me all day, after 7 hours passed of me being on delivered despite him being active I just unsent the texts (one saying good morning and the other saying I hoped he was having a good day) We don’t speak for the rest of the day. I was barely able to sleep last night and decided that I would call him once he got home from work this morning, I never got this chance. He texted me a long paragraph saying that he was ending things and then blocked me on everything. Here are some things he brought up in it. 

That everyone he had spoken to said that our relationship was doomed and he was doing more harm to me than good by holding on. I have been told this by people I spoke to about our issues too but I was set on trying to work things out. 

That he felt neither of us could trust the other anymore. Which doesn’t make sense to me since I haven’t given him anything to not trust me about that I know of. I have been nothing but honest with him our entire relationship. I told him damn near everything because I’m a yapper. He’s the one that lied to me yet I’m somehow untrustworthy?

That he hated to break up with me over text but that he felt in person wasn’t a good idea. A part that really bothers me about it is that he brought up talking to a therapist and they had said ending things was for the best. I personally think this is bs given that I was in therapy for a little bit after the first time he lied to me (I stopped because I couldn’t afford it anymore). They had tried giving me tips on how to better communicate with him, not just telling me to outright end things. Let alone over text, I feel I deserved more respect than that. 

Overall I need advice on a few things. 

How do I get over this? I know it just happened this morning but I feel like my world is crashing down all around me and I can’t stop crying/panicking. I had so many plans with this guy. I cut off almost everyone I hung out with when I stopped being friends with that girl since I met most of them through her and some of them I have reason to feel were involved in the purposefully excluding me bs. I have some work/online friends but for the most part the people I’ve hung out with lately have been his friends, and I loved his friends. I’ve genuinely never had people like them in my life before and they made me feel like I was finally apart of something. That and him saying he’s been talking to his closest friends about it but they were still sending me memes over the weekend. One of them just did today. Idk if they already knew or not but I really felt like these people liked me. I feel so alone and stupid now. 

Was I too much? I know the calling and texting was definitely a lot when he asked for space but I needed him, it hurt to have to beg him to talk to me. Did I go too far on Friday for wanting to have that conversation after feeling like he had turned his location off for seemingly no reason? I feel like I’m the one that’s pushed us to this point with how emotional I can be but I really just needed better communication. I feel he’s just giving up instead of making any effort to do so. 

Am I stupid for hoping he’ll change his mind? In the paragraph he sent he said over and over how he still cares for me and wants to be with me and work things out but everyone is telling him it’s hopeless. I feel like he’s giving up because everyone’s telling him to and it’s breaking my heart. I was told these same things but I always tried to give both of us grace and say that I really think things could get better if we both put the effort in. I’ve missed him so much since Friday and was really hoping I’d see him today and we would be okay. That hope is obviously now gone. I’ve spoken to some family about everything but I can’t say they give the best advice, the way most of them view relationships is very different than the way I do. I’m a hopeless romantic and he was my everything, my everything is now gone and I don’t know what to do.

I still have some things at his place that I need to get back and I’m planning on returning some clothes/gifts from him and his friends when I get the chance. I just can’t have any reminders of him around me after this. Since I’m blocked on everything my sister is texting him to set up a time to exchange things.",How do I get over my breakup and the feelings of loneliness and confusion I'm experiencing? Was I too much in wanting more communication and understanding in the relationship? Am I foolish for hoping he'll change his mind about ending things?,"The individual in the Reddit post is a 22-year-old female. She has recently gone through a breakup after an 8-month relationship with a 24-year-old male. She previously cut off a friend due to negative behavior, which she felt affected her relationship. Her work situation is indicated to involve some online friends, but she has lost connections with many of her previous social circles, as most of her recent acquaintances were through her ex or the friend she distanced herself from. 

She has experienced trust issues related to past relationships where she was cheated on and lied to, leading her to seek therapy, although she discontinued it due to financial constraints. Family members have been involved in discussing her relationship troubles, but their views on relationships differ from hers, causing her to feel she doesn't receive the best advice. She describes herself as a ""hopeless romantic"" and expresses a strong emotional attachment to her ex, indicating a deep sense of loss and confusion regarding the breakup.",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iy8jsq/my_24_m_boyfriend_ended_thing_with_me_22_f_after/,relationship_advice
2025-02-25 22:59:40,1iy8jav,What can I (18M) do to stop feeling like this with my (18F) girlfriend?,"We've been together since December, at the start of our relationship, she tried to leave me as she didn't want me to see her 'bipolar side' where she goes into depressive episodes which could last for months. But, I told her that I'd always be by her side, she'd never become a burden to me. She's had a tough few weeks, she's been spending hours for her art project, her friends admitted that they want nothing to do with her, and her best friend for years replaced her with some boy, that she's cried and grieved to me for hours, I was always there and she appreciated it



A few days ago, what I assume is that side has came out on her, we used to talk every single day, but all of a sudden she's gone completely dry like she's gone off me completely. It didn't help that the night before on call, there was a miscommunication, she got all dressed up for me, we all got hyped up for it, then said she wanted to watch a movie as she doesn't know how she's feeling then after the movie, she got annoyed I didn't ask to see her. She apologized next day and said it wasn't my fault thought



It's like she's talking to someone else. I've been gentle on her, asking her if she'd potentially like to play a game with me, she always says 'I don't have time' nor does she want to call anymore. She isn't putting any effort in our converstations, she takes hours to respond despite being on her phone all the time and she no longer says 'I love you too' back to me. I feel really selfish, but I'm hurt, I can't stop thinking about her and feeling that feeling of being hopeless



I have a erratic fear of loosing her. I've been watching videos and advice tonight on how I can cope with it, I'm overthinking everything, I tried to talk to her about it but it's like she's gone off me completely, nothing helps though. This is the first ever time I've seen her like this, I don't know what to do, I'm always telling her every day that's she's great, she's amazing and always showing my support for her.



She's always active on her phone, a few days ago she told me she was talking to another boy but it was 'nothing like that' and that he was 'cool' on Instagram, additionally, her ex messaged her a few days ago about liking her, and not getting over her. They still follow each other on Instagram, despite me having that convo with her expressing how I'm uncomfortable.

I've been rotting in bed, worried about her, worried about us. Please, if anyone can provide any advice?

2025-02-25 22:55:58,1iy8ge7,My (20F) ex boyfriend (24M) wants to get back together after breaking up 3 times. What would you do?," I (20F) my ex on Hinge, and we got into a relationship pretty quickly (After we broke for the last time, he told me he felt it was too soon to jump into something serious, and that he was kinda pressured into it because he was scared I’d lose interest if we didn’t). Then, just two months in, he broke up with me again because his parents made him choose between them and me (he still lives at home and is finishing school).

We ended up getting back together later on secretly, without his parents knowing. It wasn’t really a proper relationship, he just said we were exclusive. We broke up two more times after that. The last breakup was mutual because he admitted he just wasn’t ready for a real relationship and had a lot going on.

I was really hurt by those early breakups, but I’ve been doing okay since the last one. Recently, he reached out saying he was in a really dark place, apologized, and said he regretted everything, wanting to work things out. I told him I needed time to think, and we started talking normally for a bit. But honestly, it bothered me how little effort he seemed to put into actually showing change. I ended up texting him that maybe it was best if we went our separate ways. He replied with a friendly message, saying I had nothing but a positive impact on his life and that he understood why I was doing that.

Then he reached out again last weekend, saying he’s really struggling to move on and asking if there’s any chance we could get back together in the future. I told him I wasn’t sure, and he then said if I don’t want anything, I should cut him off completely. In his latest message, he said he believes love is a choice and that he wants to choose to love me. He also said  that no matter how hard he tries to move on, his heart keeps bringing him back to me.

I still have feelings for him, but I don’t think I can see him the same way anymore. I don’t know if I should give him another shot or if moving on would be the best thing for the two of us.","Should I give my ex another chance despite my doubts, or is it better for both of us to move on?","The individual is a 20-year-old female (20F) who has been in a series of relationships with her ex-partner.
