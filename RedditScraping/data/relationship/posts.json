        "original": "hello, this is going to be a LOOOONG post but i am new to this subreddit and am hoping for some helpful advice(: \n\nbackground information: i (f20) still live with my parents, and my boyfriend (m22) lives on his own. we\u2019ve been dating since august, and were causally going out all summer. he is also my first boyfriend.\n\nmy parents met my boyfriend in september, and everything seemed good; they were welcoming. the only issue is i was NOT allowed at his place. since then, i have been allowed over twice in the past two months to decorate a xmas tree and to make gingerbread. when i\u2019m over at his place i feel like i need to reply to my mom as soon as she texts me\u2014as i want her to trust me. my mom and i have had a good relationship my whole life, but since i started dating my bf i feel like she\u2019s become distant, and claims she cannot \u201ctrust\u201d me because i\u2019m \u201cless open\u201d. i have spoken to my brother (m22) about this, and he says they\u2019re getting used to me dating. \nfor christmas my bf had gotten me concert tickets + flights to a show i mentioned in july. my mom found out and was NOT happy. on boxing day, my parents had pulled my bf aside to talk to him about said gift, and told him i cannot accept it; speaking for me and not allowing me to be in the room when they had this discussion. i was hurt as my mom didn\u2019t really talk to me about the gift, and i kept telling her i\u2019d like to go and she would turn around to say it was too big of a gift and i will not be going. i feel as if my mom made a decision for me, when i came to her about this she had said she was \u201conly giving her opinion\u201d and \u201cyou two are adults make a decision\u201d\u2014why get involved? my bf cancelled the trip as he wants my parents to like him, and wants to make things easy for me. \n\n my bf and i will go out to do something (i.e., mini golf, skate, etc..) and we think we would come to my place after to hangout as we both are busy and want to take advantage of the time we have together.  on countless occasions, my mom has told me he can\u2019t come over afterwards so he would just drop me off. most of those times i come home, and my dad asks me where my bf is. another time, my bf had dropped me off and my brothers gf (who have been together for the same amount of time as us) is still over, despite being over all day\u2014my boyfriend was not allowed over?\n\ndecember 28th was my birthday, i went bowling with friends i haven\u2019t seen in months. when i left (@4pm) i told my mom it may be awhile till i\u2019m home, and i was told that\u2019s okay because it is my birthday. i was having A LOT of fun until my mom texted me @ 7:00 saying she was \u201cwas not happy\u201d with me, as i wasn\u2019t home yet. i was talking to my friends about it, and they said she was guilt tripping me and try my best not to worry about it. the plan was to have my bf over after bowling for dinner, cake, and i was hoping to relax with him. he ended up coming over despite not wanting to (after the awkward talk, and my mom already being in a bad mood), he tried thanking my mom for dinner and she just glared at him, not saying a word. another important detail is that it was -40, so i had worn a sweater over a crop top i wanted to wear. somehow, some way, my mom saw i had changed to go bowling via my friends snap story and kept making petty comments about it, calling me a immature kid. the reason why i did not wear that shirt before i left is i know my family would ridicule me for it, and make me feel less confident\u2026plus it was extremely cold out. when i came home to these rude comments, and my mom ignoring my bf + i i started crying. my bf ended up leaving fairly early as he was uncomfortable, and i went to my room to cry. nobody checked on me.\n\non a complete side note, we aren\u2019t allowed to cuddle at my home + aren\u2019t allowed anywhere but the main floor.\n\nyesterday, i tried to have a talk with my mom. i wanted to open up about my mental health\u2014as i made deans list last year, i have put pressure on myself to do good again as i don\u2019t want my parents to correlate me not making deans list to my relationship. this talk did not go well, when i opened up and tried to be honest with how i\u2019ve been feeling she just was cold to me. i was visibly upset, and was trying to communicate how i don\u2019t feel like an adult because of the way i\u2019m treated and how it\u2019s effecting me and my relationship. my mom shut down and said she can\u2019t trust me because i \u201cchanged my top on my birthday\u201d, she gave me no other reasons why she doesn\u2019t trust me. i drop my location EVERYWHERE i go, and text her updates when i\u2019m out\u2026yet she doesn\u2019t trust me to be an adult? i am responsible, i pay for my own car insurance, i am successful in my education, i pay my phone bill, and have a job. \n\ni am not sure what i can do anymore. my mom had said she doesn\u2019t want to cause a rift in my relationship but it feels like she does. i honestly just want to be able to go to my boyfriends place every once in awhile, so he doesn\u2019t have to come here every time. i want to be trusted, and i want to be heard and understood with the mental health issues i\u2019ve been dealing with. i\u2019m disappointed in the talk i had with my mom as she didn\u2019t even hug me, and never had a follow up conversation about it\u2026 we were really close, and i feel like she used to care more; i\u2019m just hurt.\n\nif anyone has advice, or have had similar experiences to me i\u2019d appreciate it hearing it a lot!!(:\n\nTL;DR: my mom has interfered with my (f20) relationship with m22, and does not trust me to be an adult despite me being responsible.",

        "background": "I am a 20-year-old female living with my parents. I have a boyfriend who is 22 and lives on his own. We have been dating since August, and he is my first boyfriend. My parents met him in September, and although they seemed welcoming initially, they have become overly involved in my relationship. They don't trust me to visit my boyfriend's place and interfere with decisions related to my relationship, such as not allowing me to accept a gift of concert tickets and a trip from my boyfriend. Additionally, I am a responsible adult, paying for my own car insurance and phone bill, and I am successful in my education. Despite this, my parents do not trust me and have become distant, especially my mom, who has been cold and dismissive towards my concerns and mental health issues.",
