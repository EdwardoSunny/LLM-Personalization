I\u2019m torn. \n\nI\u2019m a 26F and he\u2019s a 32M. For reference, he suffers from depression and no amount of counselling or medication seems to help him. He tells me his view on life is pretty much.. pointless. We\u2019ve been together for 10 years and in cases he\u2019d never be able to hold down a job for more than 1 year cuz he\u2019d suffer from his depression and revert back to video games.. \n\nAnd drinking. \n\nHe\u2019s an avid drinker. I\u2019d say roughly -2L or so a week on a 1 day binge. He used to drink more, 2-3 times a week but now limits it to a 1 day binge of 2L. It\u2019s crazy. I\u2019ve tried to get him off it but no avail. According to him it doesn\u2019t contribute to his depression but makes him feel good about life like he should feel. We tried walks, hotels, diff environment. He\u2019s bored with everything and little joy in it\n\nAnd this is where i come here. Every week. Or every 2 weeks, he wants me to cover for him [we work at the same company] so he can do his binge with his friends. He wants me to cover 2 days of his work so he can play video games and drink. He says it\u2019s therapeutic to him and makes him less depressed. Tbh I feel like a sucker and an enabler but he won\u2019t do anything to help himself. Today is Thursday and rn he\u2019s playing video games with his friends while I\u2019m due to cover this morning. He\u2019ll definitely go for nearly 24 hours. It\u2019s right now 1am. \n\nHe has never covered me in all of our relationship. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is normal \u2026 the drinking absolutely no way but his friend and him don\u2019t have aligned schedules, so Thursdays are pretty much the only times they can hang. I\u2019d say roughly my husband is being covered by me 2-3 times a month with a maximum of 6 days in a month. I still take his pay away ofc. \n\nGive it to me straight guys \nCriticism accepted. \n\n\nIs it ok me to cover his shifts so he can hang with his friend? \n\nThanks \n\n\nTLDR; husband wants me to cover his shifts so he can hangout with his buddies and drink litres of alcohol and play the PS4, says helps with his depression and he wants fun",

        "original": "Ever since I (34F) got married, I\u2019ve noticed a dramatic shift in how my mom treats me.

        "title": "How to get my friend F23 to wake up and break up before her girlfriend F21 kills her?",
        "original": "For simplicity my friend is R (F 23), and her girlfriend is B (F21). This takes place in USA Colorado \n\nOverview: My friend is dating someone who i feel whole heartedly is one of the worst people an average person could meet. B is horrifically abusive, entitled, and has a wholier-then-thou attitude to everyone, even her girlfriend.\n\nTheir current living situation: R and B have been dating for about 5 years. They started long distance and about 3 years ago B moved in with R. B had never had a job prior, and didn't seriously plan to get one once she moved in. She tried and quit before her first shift was halfway up. B adopted 11 cats in their shared one bedroom apartment (their allowed 1 by lanlord) R didn't want the cats, but wanted B happy. R works fulltime to support the both of them and their dozen cats, while B doesn't attempt to make any income.\n\nAbout B: B has a pretty rough history, she grew up in horrible abuse and has both physical and mental illnesses. I don't fault her at all for her cards delt or what she honestly cannot help. Because of a mix of her mental state and enviroment, she has a history of racism, sexism, homo+Trans-phobia, zoophilia, fat phobia, bullying, multiple charges of aggravated assault, and more. B and i were friends right at the same time she and R met, and were friends up untill late last year, which I'm embarrassed of after laying everything out. She doesn't clean the appartment she and R live in, she doesn't cook, she doesn't have friends, she spends her days arguing online and watching drama videos ONLY. Once R gets home from work, B berates her for not doing enough around the house, not spending enough time with her, spending the occasional spare dollar on her games and not B's games, exd. Its almost funnily horrible if it wasn't my friends life that its affecting.\n\nAbout R: R is autistic, and has a hard time making friends. R and I were very close, but stopped being friends for around a year almost 2 years ago because B hated me (for valid reason, but thats not tied to this situation). R still wanted to be my friend but she can't do things B doesn't like, so we cut contact. R is a sweet person, but i feel like takes verbal beatings every day from R for absoutley no reason. When pressed, all she can muster for why she stays is \"she keeps me grounded.\" R has previous mental health issues and has gone through heavy spouts of depression, and i feel she may be scared to be alone after dating someone for so long even if its someone as horrible as B. R also has a heart condition, and stress can cause it to flare up. B has caused R so much stress that she has fainted and had her heart stop on 2 separate occasions, and now that I'm not living with them I'm worried both of them on their own with few other people to help will cause it to flare up again. When telling my friends about this whole situation, I always end it with im almost sure that B is going to kill R either due to her heart condition or her own depression due to feeling theres nothing better then this abuse.\n\nWhy I'm worried / can't do XYZ: I know all these intimate details for fact because I briefly lived with them for a month, and saw all this first hand. I knew they didn't have a picture perfect relationship, and I knew that B was non-contributing to the money side of things, but i didn't think that she was literally screaming at R for having to work to put a roof over their head every. Single. Day. I do not live even in the same state as them anymore, and due to the falling out with B that made me move, R has me blocked everywhere and as of now never wants to talk to me again. I will respect her wishes if thats truly what she wants (which i feel her decision is more based on B making her block me, because thats what happened before and after we reconnected she said B made her block me and she was upset by it.) But if R truly doesn't want to hear from me ever again, that's ok. I just want her to wake up and realize she can feel love from others and not have to take care of someone that contributes literally nothing and her 11 cats she has to care for. I understand love isn't a give and take, but even love alone can't justify the years of abuse and tearing her down right?\n\nTl:dr, what am I supposed to do to help R if I can't even contact her or those around her? How do I make her wake up from a 5 year long commited relationship and take a step of independence?",

        "original": "I am at a breaking point. I can't stop crying. My mother 58F,  wants to send my nephew 14M with Cerebral palsy and developmental disabilities to a group home. My sister 33F passed in 2019, and the father is not around.\n\nMy mother took custody of my nephew, and after my other siblings (23M, and 21F) stopped helping her, she moved last year to be closer to me so I can help her. I've spent the last 15 months helping her with my nephew. I helped get him into school (fighting the school districts for weeks to arrange transit and to instate an individual education plan.) I enrolled him in disability benefits and got him a K-plan with medicaid. It allows our family to hire a personal support worker to help him bathe, dress etc. I work 4-5 hours a week, taking the before school shifts that would be terrible to recruit someone. We now have full coverage, after I recruited my friends and family to fill every shift. I put my mom in charge of the schedule because her and my nephew are the center, and we are trying to work around them. \n\nMy mother won't actually do anything. She is 100% checked out. Without me organizing and scheduling these workers and keeping up with the benefits, my nephew will spend entire weekends in his soiled diaper.  She won't schedule the people I found and trained and got government benefits to pay them.\nMy mom will go out of her way to hide things from school officials, county officials etc. So that she won't be embarrassed.\n\nIt's my opinion my mother is weaponizing her incompetence, as she keeps demanding that I take custody, saying why don't you try doing better?\n\nShe starts fights with my nephew, and he doesn't know how to disengage, so they ramp each other up until there is violence. She is using this as justification to ship him off.\n\nMy nephew is a good kid with no behavioral problems in school, or at summer camp. Most of the problems stem from my mother's neglect. (Sending him to camp with a full diaper, or dirty soiled clothes.) When I try to hold her accountable, she blames all her problems on him. For instance, when she didn't meet him for the bus, I was getting calls, and she responded to me asking what her plan was by removing me as a school contact. \n\nMy mother shipped me off to teen challenge for 15 months when I was 15, because she thought I had behavioral problems (I was smoking a little pot). After teen challenge I went no contact, worked as a dishwasher, went to community College, then university, and now I'm married, own a home, and have a baby on the way. My wife doesn't want to take custody, since we have our own family. (And a really small house)\n\nMy mom wanting to send my nephew away deeply triggers me. I can't stop crying. She doesn't want to even try. I want to go no contact but I can't abandon my nephew.\n\nAny advice or thoughts would be much appreciated. \n\nTldr: my mother is neglectful of my nephew, despite having extra support, and itbis rocking me.\n\n\n\n",

And we had some fights.\n\nMost of the time it is usually me who compromises and apologizes.\n\nWe just had a conversation that really shook me at my core and gave perspective on everything.\n\nShe\u2019s a very career oriented Type A personality woman. I am very unconfident, Type B personality. I work in government because I just wanted to be somewhere safe and stable. I make more than 6 figures. I\u2019m not looking to really go into the private sector because of the volatility and I would much rather work in a stable environment, working towards a pension. I\u2019ve seen my friends being laid off and I don\u2019t think I mentally could handle it. I\u2019d probably spiral down into depression.\n\nShe\u2019s always looking to grow and improve herself. Always willing to learn and not be left behind. Our education levels are also vastly different as well. I\u2019m an Engineer. She\u2019s in medical.\n\nBasically, I\u2019m a guy who likes to drink soda (metaphorically speaking). Soda isn\u2019t healthy at all. But she\u2019s telling me to not drink Soda and to drink Water instead.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just include career. It feels like it includes all facets of my life.\n\n-I very much enjoy gaming but it can be seen as a waste of time. And I can and probably will be feeling the pressure to give it up. Because I could be studying and improving myself career wise.\n\n-I enjoy eating unhealthy foods and she prefers me to eat healthily. Makes sense since she wants me to live a long life. But i am being pushed to give it up.\n\n-She wants me to eventually quit my current job and find better opportunities. That\u2019s what she does and she just wants both of us to make more money. She does make more than I do by a significant margin. But I never expect her to take care of me financially.\n\n-She also wants to raise kids where they are smart and very capable. Very independent. All I really care about is if they are happy and that\u2019s they live a happy life, that\u2019s my number 1 priority. So I feel like fundamentally it\u2019s different.\n\nLogically, all of the stuff she has said makes sense. I could be improving myself to make more money by giving up video games and by continuing studying/advancing my career.\n\nI don\u2019t drink. I don\u2019t smoke. I don\u2019t gamble. I don\u2019t party. I\u2019m just a simple guy who goes to work and plays video games to relax/destress from work.\n\nI don\u2019t feel supported in pretty much anything.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be even me after all of it or that I\u2019ll be happy\u2026\n\nI also have to be honest if I\u2019m properly give myself introspection, I\u2019m not fully developed or mature enough at my age. So I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being unreasonable here since logically it all makes sense.\n\nAm I just being too immature about all of this?\n\nTLDR; my GF is very type A personality.

I have been begging for change for so long as I am tired and resentful of being a caretaker. I\u2019m not sure though if his mental health issues are to blame and so there\u2019s hope for the future if he gets better, or if I\u2019m just going to be stuck in this situation for good. I\u2019m looking for advice from people who\u2019ve been in similar situations! Thank you :) \n\nI\u2019m feeling really lost and lonely in my relationship and need some outside perspective. My fianc\u00e9 and I are in our late twenties, have been together for six years, and have cats. This is my first and only relationship, so I didn\u2019t have much to compare it to in the beginning\u2014but now, after years of growth and self-reflection, I realize I\u2019m deeply unhappy with the imbalance in our relationship.\n\nThe biggest gaps between us are in household labor, emotional intimacy, and physical intimacy. While I love him, I feel like I carry the full weight of our life together, and I\u2019m starting to resent it.\n\nHe grew up in a conservative household where women were expected to handle all domestic work, and when we met, he had just moved out for the first time. As a result, I\u2019ve had to teach him everything about managing a home, and even after six years, I\u2019m still the one keeping everything running.\n\nEven when I delegate tasks, he forgets them or does them so poorly that it feels intentional. For example, I put him in charge of paying rent and bills, but we\u2019ve fallen behind because he forgets. He\u2019s responsible for refilling the cats\u2019 water, but days will go by with empty bowls before he notices. If I\u2019m sick or unavailable, the house just falls apart. He\u2019s self aware but that doesn\u2019t seem to change anything.\n\nFinancially, things are just as frustrating. In the beginning, we split everything 50/50, but when I started working from home and taking on more household duties, we adjusted. Still, he remained rigid\u2014if I ever needed him to cover for me one week, he expected me to pay him back later. I always wanted to share finances more as a team, but he refuses, since his parents keep everything separate.\n\nWhen I was unemployed for a period last year, I took on 95% of the housework while still doing side jobs to bring in money. But instead of supporting me, he constantly complained about how stressed he was and pressured me to get a job right away. It didn\u2019t feel like we were a team\u2014it felt like I was just an obligation to him.\n\nOur sex life has always been an issue. He had struggles in bed from the start, and I encouraged him to see a doctor. He said he did, but nothing changed. His drive is incredibly low, and when I try to initiate, he either physically pushes me away or complains about me trying. I\u2019ve tried to communicate what I like, introduce new things, and be patient\u2014but he shuts me down. Now, after years of rejection, I feel completely unwanted and undesirable. When I express my sadness, he tells me I\u2019m manipulating him into sex, which makes me feel even worse.\n\nEmotionally, I feel neglected, too. I always have to initiate meaningful conversations\u2014he never makes me feel special. I\u2019ve explicitly told him what I need, especially for things like birthdays, but he always falls short. After years of disappointment, I finally told him exactly what I wanted: a card, a gift, and decorations (which I even bought in advance and showed him where they were). I was thrilled to get a present this year, but he still ignored everything else and spent the day in a bad mood. Meanwhile, I go all out for his birthday, yet he refuses to do the same for me because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nEven small gestures are nonexistent\u2014no surprises, flowers, no sweet notes, nothing spontaneous. When I started a new job, he didn\u2019t cook dinner for me, get me a small gift, or even acknowledge it. I feel like I beg to be shown love, and I\u2019m tired.\n\nHe struggles with mental health issues and ADHD, and while I\u2019ve always supported him, I\u2019m starting to resent how much of a caretaker I\u2019ve become. I\u2019ve worked hard to manage my own mental health\u2014I go to therapy, take medication, and put in real effort for my own well-being and for the people around me. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve been asking him to see a therapist for years, but there\u2019s always an excuse not to. His mental health is declining, but he refuses to get help, leaving me to pick up the pieces.\n\nI\u2019ve already decided to postpone our wedding indefinitely, but I haven\u2019t figured out how to tell him yet. The hardest part is that I don\u2019t want this to end\u2014but I also don\u2019t see the value in keeping him in my life anymore. He\u2019s my best friend and I genuinely love spending time with him. The problem is it just feels like we\u2019re friends/roommates and nothing more. \n\nFor those who have been in similar situations, does this gap ever close? Has anyone successfully helped their partner step up and meet them halfway, or is this just how the division of labor and intimacy plays out in most male-female relationships? I need to know if I\u2019m fighting for something that can actually change, or if I\u2019m just setting myself up for a lifetime of disappointment.\n\nI love him so much but at the moment can\u2019t even stand to be in the same room as him when we\u2019re both home because I just feel sad and angry and get pains in my chest.\n\n\n\n",

Though we had a kid we were living separately as he was always finding excuses for not leaving his mom's house or us moving in with him. His family has always been against us since the beginning because of my skin colour and ethnicity. They even left my kid out of family functions etc.\n\nIn 2023, my partner proposed to get married and went for the paperwork. I ended up cancelling it because he was disrespectful about me and my kid. And wouldn't live together with us. His mom who was living abroad came in and persuaded him to go with her as I didn't meet her criteria. He made his passport without telling us. Then in September, he changed his work place and soon he would change his attitude too. \n\nHe was dressing up differently, acting differently. Then suddenly his social media profile was hacked and removed all our photos together etc. It was hard as I gave him everything I had. So I tried to make him jealous by flirting in front of him, he came back and abused me physically as I didn't want to sleep with him. I ended up with a silent miscarriage last year after high fever.He knew but didn't care to assist to the echo. So he went silent. While I was left with another child amongst all this as there two babies, which I didn't told him.\n\nI didn't know what to do, until someone I knew proposed to be in my life and take care of us. At first it was okay but I couldn't forget and my kid too. She was crying and begging for him but he wouldn't answer or call back. That new person, knew what he did to me and knew I wasn't ready to be in his bed as I was leaving he did the same thing. I left went back home and suffered in silence. My kids dad came back in May and pretending to care etc. That's when I told him I was pregnant. His first reaction was it's not his, which I can totally understand. He went back to his family saying I was a wh*re sleeping everywhere etc that he needed a DNA test. \n\nLater during the pregnancy I learned that he was with another women,including one he went to her house and told his family to keep it secret as I would have withhold my daughter from him which I never did. The baby is born and is just like him. I chose to get back with him and forgive the abuse for my kids but he left my daughter with a greater scar as this has hurt her deeply when all this happened. That she cries a lot and has some kind of resentment towards him. \n\nFollowing all this I can't have any kind of intimacy with him. I've been through several anxiety attacks, depression etc. As we were together since high school and I did gave him the best part of me which he tossed away. We come from poor backgrounds and once he was high enough he would replace all this. I see myself like not enough. I want peace. I want to be that bubbly girl I was before.

        "original": "My gf(23F) and I (23M) are together for 4 years. We know each other from a high school. But recently we both hit a rough patch. We both were living together and fights started to emerge and went on to become bigger than one another. I haven\u2019t hurt her physically up until then. But I was not well mentally and when the fights went to almost hurting each other physically (which we did) I hurt her physically very much. I sincerely apologized her and told I can understand her decision if she wants to leave all of this and to start a fresh life and that I\u2019ll support in whatever way I can for that. But she said she forgave me, so I started changing everything in every way possible to make her life peaceful and happy and comfortable. I did everything she told me she wanted and things I told her which are good for her in terms of work and peace and everything. Few months later, started talking to another guy who she met like few months ago and told him each and everything about us. He and all of her friends told her to leave me. But she used to make believe me that she still wants me and used to meet and talk and go to drive with the third guy and I even found them sleeping together (not sex) and also she told me that she got trauma because we became physical before which she did not approve but also said that she became physical with me because of her love towards me and few days passed by I found marks on her neck (which I strongly believe are hickeys). She said she is just talking to him because of work and sometimes the words he is saying about my behavior with her is giving her assurance. I strictly told her to block him and whatever problems she has\u2026 I\u2019m ready to support her and I stood by her all times and supported her whenever she was mentally low and financially as well. But she broke up with me later and I said ok and went on with my life and few days later she told me that she realized that I need to be in her life. And I told her that I don\u2019t want the third guy. But still she talked to him in video calls, chats, snaps and met him behind my back. So I backed off and went my way and she started crying that I left her alone and asked me another chance to prove her efforts. But I found her with him several times and later she even told me that I\u2019m stalking and all the things I did for her\u2026 she said have I asked you to do that?. I am focusing on my mental and physical conditions right now. All of sudden, she is getting tensed about her career and everything and is texting me about how she is not able to manage everything and she is mentally down. She wants to stay for a couple of days with me now\u2026 but said that her family won\u2019t approve of us living together when I asked to live with me (this is after the break up). I told her that if anything I can do to help her in her life, I will do it but if I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t. I even believe she is living with the new guy now. I don\u2019t why she is still talking to me right now. I already feel very low that I hurt the person whom I love the most with my own hands.

        "title": "My (M30) and my husband\u2019s (26M) marriage is slowly dying due to bitterness built up over the years. Can therapy help us come back?",
        "original": "My husband and I have been married for 3.5 years, and together for almost 8 years total. We met while working as restaurant waitstaff in late 2016. He was undocumented and I was a citizen. We started dating in mid 2017 and our relationship on a mutual attraction, we found each other attractive, and I liked his down to earth, practical, and hard working demeanor. Things for the first couple of years were not easy. Both of our families (we are from the same country) are very religious and our gay relationship was not accepted. We had to hang out in my car every time we wanted time together, or go to a movie or restaurant, even get a hotel room for...the deed. Eventually, his family accepted me, but mine is still refusing to meet him despite my encouragement. We have both now moved away from family and have been living together in a small basement apartment for 4 years, but still visit family on a weekly basis. \n\nOn to the problems: I believe the biggest chunk of the problems stems from my inability to help him with his immigration status. Back when we started going out, we were afraid that he could be deported at any given moment. Like the naive person that I was, I told him that he could just say that we were engaged, thinking that that would magically solve the situation should he be arrested. This, of course, is not how things work, and I admit that I never bothered back then to educate myself on how things actually worked. \n\nOne day, he asked me if I thought it would be a good idea to apply for political asylum, seeing as he had previous experiences in his country that may make him qualify. But he also told me that he wouldn\u2019t be able to visit his country should his asylum be granted. He would leave the majority of his family behind, including his sick grandmother, who helped raise him. I told him yes, anything that can help him from being deported would be good, thinking that staying in this country would be the best for him. I also offered him on more than one occasion, money to help pay lawyer fees. He refused the money, I believe be cause he was trying to be kind to me. \n\nFlash forward a couple of years and nothing has come of the asylum application. The only other way I can see for him to stay safe in the country is to marry him and help him get his green card (for those that don\u2019t know, getting this would allow him to be a resident of the US, but still travel to visit his country.) But at the time, I was dealing with my own mental health issues, that I was seeing therapists for. I wanted to be in a better place, feel more ready before I took that step. I realize that everyone is entitled to marry only when they feel ready, but perhaps I was wrong to not realize that my and his situation was not like everyone else\u2019s. For him there was a ticking clock, and all I was doing was delaying the possibility of giving him help based on my comfort. Maybe I could have married him earlier even if it was just to put it on paper. \n\nEventually, we did marry in late 2021, five months after I moved in with him into the apartment we now share. We then quickly sent an application for me to sponsor him to get his residency, thanks to us now being married. It took about 2 years for USCIS to give us news on the application, and they denied it. It broke my heart to hear the news. He had tried so hard, and done everything by the book, and he is such a diligent, positive person that any country would be better for having him. And I felt so useless for not being able to help. The one thing I could provide, the one way that I could show him thanks for being by my side during my dark days recovering from my mental health problems, and it was taken away. I hadn\u2019t understood him or the hurdles he faced in our early years, but after going through some of the process with him, and meeting the lawyers in the years following the marriage, I had a better understanding. But those two years of waiting for a response took their toll on him. His grandmother died in that time, and he wasn\u2019t able to properly say goodbye. Every spring and fall he would become sad and anxious, as he would remember his country through the change in the seasons. At times he would be annoyed with me, or we would argue over small things, and our intimacy also started to suffer. Sometimes, we would go weeks, or even months without acting like a couple, just living together and giving each other space, like cautious roommates. In those two years we also had a lot of arguments as to whether I was wrong to wait so long to marry him, eventually culminating in me crying one night and apologizing for having it all done my way, because I felt everything was done at my pace, without regards to him. This made things better for a while, but we eventually returned to the same.\n\nRecently, I wrote a letter to him (I express myself better in writing, thinking and talking in the moment is too difficult and I sometimes forget things I want to say) explaining the changes that I\u2019ve noticed: that there is no more intimacy, that we don\u2019t spend much time together, that we argue when we do, that he seems to be annoyed with my personality and my way of enjoying things, and that he seems generally disinterested in me. I also told him how I noticed that everyone else seemed to be able to make him happy, he smiles and plays and laughs around our friends, but around me, that\u2019s rare. It wasn\u2019t so much  a critique of his behavior, but rather a way for me to organize everything I noticed, and away to pose a question: was I seeing a problem in the relationship, or was I misunderstanding him fundamentally? Was he just such an independent and self sufficient person that he didn\u2019t need to rely on someone else to feel good, and thus he was ignorant of the fact that someone like me would need his attention to feel good? Or was our relationship slowly dying? I tried making it clear to him that I need that attention, the physical displays of affection, and that I wanted someone who wants me. \nHe responded by saying that he has been struggling lately. The years of feeling like he was giving to me without getting anything back (referring to me putting off marrying him) turned him off to me. He says he no longer has that physical attraction, like his body formed a rejection to me. He says he still loves me as we have spent a lot of time together, and we have a lot of good memories, but he wonders if I would be happier with someone else, because over the years he seems to return to that same bitterness about my inaction time and time again. It seems to me that despite the years of trying to defend myself, and eventually giving up and accepting his point of view, he can\u2019t forgive me. I\u2019ve really tried for years to be a better person in our marriage than the person I was when we were just boyfriends, but maybe it\u2019s too late and it\u2019s out of my hands. The letter and subsequent conversation we had opened my eyes too, to the resentment that I feel after years of feeling blamed for doing what I thought was right. Not only that, I feel now that maybe our relationship is marked forever, and as long as I am in it he will remember how I\u2019ve wronged him. Furthermore I feel that he might be happier going back to his country to see his family again instead of living in a country that doesn\u2019t want him. The only reason he stayed here was because he wanted to be with me. Being married to me is what keeps him chained here, and seeing as I am useless in helping him gain his green card, I\u2019m starting to think that maybe he also would feel happier with someone else. \n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t want to live with any regrets, and in order to make such a big decision as breaking this off, I want to make sure I tried my best to save it first. Hence the couples therapy. Does anyone think that therapy would help alleviate the problems, or are we wasting time and money?\n\nTLDR: My husband is undocumented and I,  a citizen. We started dating in 2017. He was stuck between two worlds, missing his family in his country and wanting to stay with me here. I could have helped him get his green card by marrying him, but I wanted to be in a better place with my mental health treatments first, so I put it off for a couple of years. We eventually married, applied for his green card, and were denied after 2 year of waiting. The nostalgia and resentment he felt across the years have started to affect the relationship making him disinterested and cold with me. And his disinterest and coldness have made me resent him. We both have started thinking if we would be happier with other people. Would couples therapy help us resolve some of these problems, or would we be wasting time?",
