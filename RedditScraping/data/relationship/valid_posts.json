        "content": "hello, this is going to be a LOOOONG post but i am new to this subreddit and am hoping for some helpful advice(: \n\nbackground information: i (f20) still live with my parents, and my boyfriend (m22) lives on his own. we\u2019ve been dating since august, and were causally going out all summer. he is also my first boyfriend.\n\nmy parents met my boyfriend in september, and everything seemed good; they were welcoming. the only issue is i was NOT allowed at his place. since then, i have been allowed over twice in the past two months to decorate a xmas tree and to make gingerbread. when i\u2019m over at his place i feel like i need to reply to my mom as soon as she texts me\u2014as i want her to trust me. my mom and i have had a good relationship my whole life, but since i started dating my bf i feel like she\u2019s become distant, and claims she cannot \u201ctrust\u201d me because i\u2019m \u201cless open\u201d. i have spoken to my brother (m22) about this, and he says they\u2019re getting used to me dating. \nfor christmas my bf had gotten me concert tickets + flights to a show i mentioned in july. my mom found out and was NOT happy. on boxing day, my parents had pulled my bf aside to talk to him about said gift, and told him i cannot accept it; speaking for me and not allowing me to be in the room when they had this discussion. i was hurt as my mom didn\u2019t really talk to me about the gift, and i kept telling her i\u2019d like to go and she would turn around to say it was too big of a gift and i will not be going. i feel as if my mom made a decision for me, when i came to her about this she had said she was \u201conly giving her opinion\u201d and \u201cyou two are adults make a decision\u201d\u2014why get involved? my bf cancelled the trip as he wants my parents to like him, and wants to make things easy for me. \n\n my bf and i will go out to do something (i.e., mini golf, skate, etc..) and we think we would come to my place after to hangout as we both are busy and want to take advantage of the time we have together.  on countless occasions, my mom has told me he can\u2019t come over afterwards so he would just drop me off. most of those times i come home, and my dad asks me where my bf is. another time, my bf had dropped me off and my brothers gf (who have been together for the same amount of time as us) is still over, despite being over all day\u2014my boyfriend was not allowed over?\n\ndecember 28th was my birthday, i went bowling with friends i haven\u2019t seen in months. when i left (@4pm) i told my mom it may be awhile till i\u2019m home, and i was told that\u2019s okay because it is my birthday. i was having A LOT of fun until my mom texted me @ 7:00 saying she was \u201cwas not happy\u201d with me, as i wasn\u2019t home yet. i was talking to my friends about it, and they said she was guilt tripping me and try my best not to worry about it. the plan was to have my bf over after bowling for dinner, cake, and i was hoping to relax with him. he ended up coming over despite not wanting to (after the awkward talk, and my mom already being in a bad mood), he tried thanking my mom for dinner and she just glared at him, not saying a word. another important detail is that it was -40, so i had worn a sweater over a crop top i wanted to wear. somehow, some way, my mom saw i had changed to go bowling via my friends snap story and kept making petty comments about it, calling me a immature kid. the reason why i did not wear that shirt before i left is i know my family would ridicule me for it, and make me feel less confident\u2026plus it was extremely cold out. when i came home to these rude comments, and my mom ignoring my bf + i i started crying. my bf ended up leaving fairly early as he was uncomfortable, and i went to my room to cry. nobody checked on me.\n\non a complete side note, we aren\u2019t allowed to cuddle at my home + aren\u2019t allowed anywhere but the main floor.\n\nyesterday, i tried to have a talk with my mom. i wanted to open up about my mental health\u2014as i made deans list last year, i have put pressure on myself to do good again as i don\u2019t want my parents to correlate me not making deans list to my relationship. this talk did not go well, when i opened up and tried to be honest with how i\u2019ve been feeling she just was cold to me. i was visibly upset, and was trying to communicate how i don\u2019t feel like an adult because of the way i\u2019m treated and how it\u2019s effecting me and my relationship. my mom shut down and said she can\u2019t trust me because i \u201cchanged my top on my birthday\u201d, she gave me no other reasons why she doesn\u2019t trust me. i drop my location EVERYWHERE i go, and text her updates when i\u2019m out\u2026yet she doesn\u2019t trust me to be an adult? i am responsible, i pay for my own car insurance, i am successful in my education, i pay my phone bill, and have a job. \n\ni am not sure what i can do anymore. my mom had said she doesn\u2019t want to cause a rift in my relationship but it feels like she does. i honestly just want to be able to go to my boyfriends place every once in awhile, so he doesn\u2019t have to come here every time. i want to be trusted, and i want to be heard and understood with the mental health issues i\u2019ve been dealing with. i\u2019m disappointed in the talk i had with my mom as she didn\u2019t even hug me, and never had a follow up conversation about it\u2026 we were really close, and i feel like she used to care more; i\u2019m just hurt.\n\nif anyone has advice, or have had similar experiences to me i\u2019d appreciate it hearing it a lot!!(:\n\nTL;DR: my mom has interfered with my (f20) relationship with m22, and does not trust me to be an adult despite me being responsible.",

        "content": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\ntl;dr: Since I was about 16 (I'm approaching 27 now), my Dad has not been there for my family financially or, in some ways, emotionally. He lost his business in the recession.\n\nI could have gotten over business failure alone. What I struggle with are his delusions about grandiose financial prospects that never seem to come to fruition. These delusions have prevented him from ever, emotionally, being there for my family. When the business first went underwater, he fed me a lot of bullshit about how much money he had coming down the pipeline. At the same time, as a young kid, my mom was max stressed about finances, which put a lot of strain on my siblings and I as kids. Not having a clear picture of what actually was happening wrecked havoc on my mental health.\n\nThings have settled down now all these years later. My mom has become the breadwinner and from what I understand, my Dad does make some minimal financial contributions from some side hustles. But my Dad's lack of disclosure about the earlier situation has made it hard for me to have a real relationship with him. He also refuses to get a reasonable 9-5 gig that would pay better than what he's making.\n\nAll that said, my Dad has been there for me for most of my life and made a lot of sacrifices for my siblings and I. I know he's genuinely a good man, but its just so hard for me to open myself up to him when he doesn't speak the truth/is too deluded to. I'm sure I sound like a brat, especially in light of the fact that I am lucky to have a Father at all. But I am seeking advice on how I can overcome this barrier in my life so I can move the fuck on. I'm happy to say that I'll be finishing grad school soon and have an excellent job lined up to help support my family. All comments are appreciated.",

        "title": "Advice on how to deal with my neighbour overstepping boundaries/possible mental health issues",
        "content": "This is a bit of a long story but just wondering how you guys would approach this situation.\nGirlfriend and myself have moved into a new unit for 10 months, absolutely love the place and it meets every need we need in terms of housing except for a small issue we are having with our neighbour.\n\nMyself and girlfriend are mid-late twenties our neighbour (male) lives alone and at a guess he\u2019s about late 50s- early 60s. \n\nWhen we moved in got to know him early on and he seemed like a very nice guy, typical Aussie bloke loves a yarn about the footy and a beer had no dramas with him he even came over one night unannounced with a plate full of food, was an ex chef and the food was great. \n\nA month or so in we had a group of friends over for somewhat of a house warming, he came over that night unannounced with some fried chicken he cooked for us so instinctively I invited him in and offered him a beer. I was outside pre occupied with our other guests whilst he was inside playing a game of beer pong with my girlfriend and 2 of my friends (another being a girl) shortly into the game my male friend who was playing asked me to come inside because he is being abit weird to my girlfriend so I came inside and just kept an eye on the situation. What had happened was he accused my girlfriend of cheating in the game and had an outburst at her something along of the lines of \u201cthat\u2019s the problem with women they always f-ing cheat\u201d and he threw the ping pong ball at her aggressively. After knowing this I asked my friend who was there (big dude who would have no issues standing up for himself if things got physical) if he could get him out of the house. So he had walked him back on good terms I think it was to ask him to show him some football memorabilia he owned, but once he was out of the picture he quickly messaged me whilst inside my neighbours house saying there\u2019s no way he could return without my neighbour. Anyway I went over to to collect my friend, we had abit of a chat because I was trying to learn abit about his backstory and he told us his brother is schizophrenic and has been in mental institutions for most of his life. Anyway we told him the way he acted made the girls feel uncomfortable and he couldn\u2019t come back around which he was understanding and the next day he apologised to me which I said was fine. For the next six months I tried to keep a friendly distance from him, chatting to him if I saw him but not trying to get to friendly. A couple times he asked to borrow a power tool which I lent him which he returned thankfully sometimes with some frozen food he had cooked, we never ate it and would bin it.\n\nThere were a couple of strange incidents in the months passing where he was cutting down trees on our carport without letting us know first, as in physically on top of our carport on our property with ladders setup blocking our driveway (girlfriend was WFH at the time and I was out at work all day).\n\nAnyway last night (NYE) we had friends over, the same group who were over when the beer pong incident occurred and around 12.30 he arrived with a large serving of desert he made for everyone. He came in through the door which was unlocked whilst myself and everyone was in the backyard, I awkwardly took the food. He hung around and it was obvious he wasn\u2019t going to leave and then he asked if it was alright if he got some beers from his and came back, I just froze in the situation - I wouldn\u2019t say I am afraid of confrontation and putting my foot down when needed however I feel a sense of pity for him but at the same time I don\u2019t want him inside my house. Luckily my friend basically  said nah it\u2019s probably best if you didn\u2019t and said it\u2019s just a small group of friends and it\u2019s best if we kept it at that. He took it well and just asked for me to return the plate when we are done. He sent me a text later (got my phone number a few months ago - I\u2019m a tradesman and he said he might know someone who needs a job done) apologising for crashing the party and to have a good night.\n\nI originally thought he may have had abit of autism however I feel the interaction I had with him last night was quite socially aware in terms of social cues.\nAnyway I know I need to have a chat with him to prevent this stuff from occurring again but I\u2019m just wondering how\u2019s the best way to approach it.\n\n\nTl;dr Neighbour old enough to be my dad continually overstepping boundaries onto my property with nice gestures however has been aggressive to my girlfriend in our home, want to know how to deal with it without burning bridges",

        "title": "I (F23) don't know what to do with my \"friend?\" (M23)",
        "content": "So long story short, I have been thinking about venting this out on Reddit cause honestly I don't like to talk about any kind of relationships with my friends. This is because I've never have a boyfriend and if I mention that I'm into a guy or something, my friends usually get pushy to know what's going on with him or how are we doing.\n\nWell, this case is completely different cause I'm talking about a guy I met online in an e-sports community. We're both from Latin America, and I did heard from him in the past cause he's consider one of the best Latin players, but never had any interaction with him because his team plays in higher categories than mine. I ended up replying to a story he uploaded in FB wondering if Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Train was worth to watch in a cinema and I told him it definitely was a great movie. We ended up talking about anime and stuff, and slowly started to get to know each other. As time passed, he closed his social media and used only Twitter and Discord, he even texted me in Twitter that we could continue talking in Discord cause he didn't wanted me to believe that he just ghosted me or something. In the next months (also before I started working and studying at the same time) we used to talk on the late nights and in the morning, even going to sleep around 6 or 7am cause we just kept talking about anything, also we had this \"flirty\" way of joking with each other. One day he suddenly confessed that he had this \"situation\" where he doesn't \"feel anything nor care for anyone\" including his family members, and this has been going for maybe five or more years. He told me he didn't wanted to talk about it because maybe my perspective of him would change now that I knew that he didn't care about me either. I knew he rarely (1-3 times in all this year) texted me first, but I actually never felt anything off about him or expected that. I told him that I wanted to be friends anyway cause I enjoyed the time we spent playing and talking, even if that meant me talking to him first always. He thanked me and told me that he was grateful to have me in his life, but he was afraid to get attached to me cause he didn't know how much time I'd be in his life. I insisted that I will try to stay as much as he let me, but that I valued to have him in my life and that he oppened up with me.\n\nThere were 2 weeks in October that I didn't texted him because I was extremely busy with work and Uni, so I wasn't able to play either. Finally, when I did, he asked me if I didn't texted him cause I felt I was annoying him - honestly, the answer was yes in a lot of ocassions before. He told me he really liked how I was and felt comfortable talking about everything with me, so he was grateful to have me in his life. \"You're probably the person I most talk to, and even sometimes I just really wish you text me so we can talk\"; when I asked him why he didn't texted me then, he told me that he was okay being alone or not talking to anyone most of the time, so he didn't do it with me neither anyone else. Flashforward to November, we were talking about our birthdays. He already told me his birthday some time ago, but now that we talked about it, he said he doesn't like to celebrate at all or to receive any kind of messages or gifts, also that almost no one knew his birthday because of that. He told me he wanted to give me a birthday present cause I told him about a commission I wanted from an artist, and ended up asking for details about colors and even show me one of the sketches cause he \"really wanted me to love it, not just to like it\" and that \"it would be beautiful just because you'll be in it\" (my birthday is in December, his in November)\n\nWithout telling him, I ended up recording one of my favorite endings (Shout Baby from BnHA) and sending it to him, as well as a little birthday message. He answered me 2 days later and told me he was sick so that was why he hadn't replied, but that he really loved the song and appreciated the gift and the effort. I was out of the country at that time cause I went to visit some family for Thanksgiving, nonetheless I tried to talk with him several times after that and every time he just left me in read. My birthday was getting near but I didn't text him cause I was hoping he would do it for my birthday, and well... he didn't. Some days before my birthday, he texted me that he wasn't going to be in Discord for a while and just sent the drawing, that was it. I was... sad? Cause I really loved the commission but it left me such and empty feeling... I have tried to text him like 3 times since my birthday but he hasn't answer at all. So today (actually rn) I decided that would text him one last time wishing him a happy New Year, and if he didn't reply, I would give up on trying to be friends. Honestly, I was beginning to get a little bit attached to him cause I really liked his personality and the way we were getting along, it felt so effortless and easy, I was just being me. With all this said, I don't know if I'm making the right choice cause I don't wanna be in a gray area about all of this... I care so much about him, but I wonder if it is really worth the pain and the effort somehow.\n\nTL;DR: I met this guy online and it seemed like we were building a great friendship and getting close. We have even talk a lot of personal stuff that almost no one else knows and joke in a flirty way. Suddenly, he starts to ghost me out of nowhere and I don't know if I should keep \"chasing\" him some way or another, cause I really do care about him.",

        "content": "Just to get things started, me and my girlfriend have been dating (on and off with breaks) for about 3 years, and we do quarrel every now and then but we resolve it quickly and with minimal issue. We are also long distance if that matters.\n\nSo, I suspect there has been a rift between us since our last break, but I don't know exactly when. I thought things were better, but she was hiding a lot of fear/uncertain feelings from me and didn't talk about it until recently, when it was too late. We argued maybe 3 times in the day over similar topics and \"resolved\" it... except we didn't, and the third time, she decided enough was enough and cut our relationship short for the time being.\n\nI'm not faultless, because I am short tempered a lot of the time but I try to rein it in and try understanding her perspective before I spiral out of control - which I've gotten significantly better at in the past year. She just has a habit of not talking about important things with me, like uncertainties for the future, and only talks about the positives. I don't think she realises that as much as I communicate my feelings, I can't.. really predict how she feels? Or how she thinks? So concerns in the relationship usually come from me. But yesterday she kept saying \"(she) wasn't good enough for (me), and that (she) has made up her mind, because we were getting nowhere. (she)'s growing backwards, instead of upwards\" (paraphrased). I've always tried being supportive of her growth, but I worry I have done the opposite.\n\nI always try to be a better communicator, but she talked to a mutual friend of mine who told me she said that \"I always target her insecurities\" when I genuinely just point out her flaws because I want her to be able to improve. She always goes on about how she wants to be better and grow as people together, so I try to point her weaknesses if/when they show in a nice way. But I might have failed her in this regard. (edit: she was the one who asked me to tell her off if her behaviours were concerning)\n\nI don't know what to do, if I should move on or stay hopeful for a get together, or if I was really, really wrong for doing what I did, but these are most of the details that I can provide regarding our breakup. Sorry if this is all over the place, I am pretty bad at writing reddit posts. Please let me know if you need any more clarifications, I might have missed things in my sleep-deprived state!\n\nTLDR; gf broke up with me over some arguments and other things I thought were settled, but turns out they weren't, now we are in a confusing spot and i dont know what to do.\n\nedit; below will be added context (in the event anyone asks)\n\n\\> A) Have we met?We do frequent video/voice calls. She was supposed to come here in 2020, but then covid happened, so we've been waiting for an opportunity for her to come here, but nothing has happened.\n\n\\> B) Plan for the future?We discussed the possibility of me studying abroad (in her home country) and eventually settling in together/me applying for a long term visa pass. I intend to pursue my University studies when I have enough money saved, in the mean time I've been doing jobs and relevant courses to my field of study. She has been finding more stable work, and said she might be furthering her education if an opportunity presents itself.",

        "title": "I feel like my girlfriend (28/f) taking things too far with her ex and I'm (28/m) losing patience.",
        "content": " We have been in this relationship for almost a year now and it has definitely had ups and downs. The ups are great and the downs are usually avoidable immature stupid things. However, one thing that has started to make me extremely uncomfortable recently is her friendship with her ex.\n\nWhen we first started, she did say that they ended on good terms and that they didn't want it to affect their circle of mutual friends etc. After all, they were together for 7 years. I met her about a year after they broke up and she asked me if it was weird that they still occasionally spoke. Her ex is best friends with my girlfriend's sister's boyfriend blah blah blah. I said all good, as long as nothing happens that would hurt me or make me uncomfortable. She was the one that finished their relationship in the end due to issues that she caused. But in the last year it's gone from the seemingly mature, I should be fair about this to a bit of a nuisance situation where he always seems to be there, and I've had enough. I've never actually met the guy but I shouldn't actually have to.\n\n\\- One day early in our relationship, my gf, her sister and her boyfriend were going on a day trip. She then dropped out because they invited her ex and she said that it wouldn't be fair on me as she wouldn't have liked it if I had done it with my ex. I respected that and I thought it was a good example of relationship maturity. Since, however, she says that she \"should have gone\" and that \"my opinion shouldn't matter.\"\n\n\\- She went for a meal and a few drinks with friends (including ex) one night and she was staying at my house after. She got extremely drunk and when she got here all she did was cry uncontrollably apologizing and not really making much sense. Nothing happened, but she starting going into this long blabbering episode about how she'll never be able to trust me or something.\n\n\\- I would never look through someone's phone, but her screen flashes when someone messages. When its next to me I've seen his name pop up quite frequently. Whenever she's showing me a video or something, she gets a message and his name comes up on the screen. Whenever I've shown any discomfort about the frequency it's apparently them just \"laughing or talking about videos she puts on her Instagram story of her cat.\" Must be pretty damn interesting considering the frequency. I don't even message my best friends that much.\n\n\\- It's her birthday soon. With whatever she's planning socially she had the cheek to say to me \"he's out, you're in\", because it wouldn't be nice for me being in the same room as them or whatever and after all I'm her boyfriend.\n\n\\- Recently she's been talking about changing gym as she's apparently become too fat over Christmas and \"can't be seen\" in her normal one. I didn't really think much of it. The new one that she's going to, no prizes for guessing who also goes there. She doesn't even know that I know that.\n\nThere are other things that I'm too lazy to write. I genuinely know for certain that nothing is going on, but still, it's uncomfortable as hell for me now. She has had an intense history of jealousy in this relationship, she even occasionally admits that she gets extremely jealous over me, even though I literally do nothing. I can't even say that I'm jealous, I'm just pretty pissed off and disappointed because I feel like this is baggage getting in the way and it's now really effecting my mood. I came into this relationship with zero baggage with previous partners or anyone I've dated and I'd like to think that even if a previous relationship had finished on seemingly amazing terms, I still wouldn't force that ex to be part of my life as I honestly think that nobody involved benefits. Whenever we've tried to have an adult conversation about how it's making me uncomfortable with her ex being 'just there' she shoots me down and is adamant that there's nothing wrong. I live abroad and we're both from different backgrounds so I'm not sure if it's just a culture clash or something but I know she definitely isn't stupid. But literally everything seems to be on her terms, yet I'm the one that gets called controlling when I moan about it.\n\nShe invents all kinds of scenarios in her head about me: She accused me of cheating out of nowhere early in the relationship (never have, never would), she's created this image where apparently I have \"feelings\" for the girlfriends of my good friends. Last week I was in a rush for work and had to leave the house quickly, and I forgot to flush the toilet after a pee but I still put the seat down. Apparently I had a someone over. She was sceptical over a new set of christmas pyjamas my aunt sent from my country, implying it was a gift from another girl. She has out of the blue mood swings that ruin my day, but they have become less frequent I guess. There are more things I could mention but I won't\n\nShe's at home with covid at the moment which meant that we had to cancel any NYE plans we had. When I have truly nothing to do I message my best friend, go to his house, have a beer and play some playstation. But according to her, there's \"something there between\" myself and his girlfriend, so I didn't go just to avoid the argument. It makes me angry just writing that due to how fucking ridiculous it sounds. I spent NYE at home alone last night as I just didn't have the motivation to find anything to do (was still ok, nice video calls and stuff).\n\nHonest opinions would be very welcome. I know the default reddit reaction of \"just leave\" will be sure to appear but I would rather at least see if anyone else can relate to this.\n\nTL/DR: My girlfriend's ex is always there is some form. Always messaging, soon-to-be same gym and other things. I'm angry that how my girlfriend is putting me in a position of \"just deal with it\" when if it was the other way round, I would be pilloried. She has a strong history of jealousy in this relationship and I feel like she's putting me in suffocating situations which I wouldn't even dare do to her.",

We have previously had an extremely healthy sex life up until 4 years ago. 4 years ago I had a close call with losing my life, which effected me immensely. \n\nI was under going therapy, however my sex drive completely went and for the past 4 years it has been only foreplay so to speak. \n\nI am unsure how to go back to a fully sexual relationship and every time my husband initiates I get scared off. I do not know why and therapy has not helped this time. I was told at the time I was potentially afraid of painful sex, however that is not the case at all.\n\nSo Reddit, any advice? He is completely aware and we speak often, however I cannot stress how much I hate this. We want children and are planning for this, however my problem overshadows absolutely everything and I can't help but feel useless. I just want our sex life to be normal again but it is only me that has this problem.\n\nRecently this has become worse since he has gained a new circle of female friends and I am fully aware that one is attracted to him. I trust my husband completely, but I not fear if I cannot provide for him sexually, somebody else will come alone.\n\nThanks in advance for reading and any comments.\n\nTL;DR: I had a serious accident 4 years ago which effected having sex. I don't want this to rule my life and want to sleep with my husband.",

        "title": "My boyfriend\u2019s(29M) sister(23F) regrets getting us together and I (23F) screwed it up further by talking about anal",
        "content": "TL;DR My brother\u2019s sister has had consistent issues with our relationship, mostly due to my fault. I keep trying to do better but I keep fucking it up worse: most recently by talking about anal. Help me and my bleeding asshole repair her and I\u2019s relationship. \n\nHi Reddit, posting from mobile. I genuinely am at a loss of how to repair this situation. I don\u2019t have close siblings so I don\u2019t know the dynamics and everything I\u2019ve done so far has seemingly made it worse. And of course, obviously a throw away.\n\nTo Preface: I have half-siblings, but it\u2019s more of a \u201cwe know we exist\u201d kind of relationship. So I was essentially raised as an only child by a single mom. My boyfriend and I have been together 9 months.\n\nExposition: I met Stacey in high school, we knew of each other and had mutual friends but weren\u2019t close until after we graduated. I invited her into my friend group just after we graduated and she fit in fantastically. We ended up going to the same university as well. She and I went through phases of being incredibly close and having down periods of not talking much aside from occasional phone calls. \n\nI briefly met her brother, we\u2019ll call him Ken, when I was 18. He was 24 at the time and working on his PhD and doing an internship out of state. We got along well, but as we were both in relationships: it didn\u2019t go anywhere. However, Stacey and her dad would joke that because of our similar interests were meant to be together in the future, frequently. I always laughed it off and he did as well, but we continued to get along the few times we saw each other throughout the years.\n\nThis past year: Their mother passed away after a long battle with cancer. I had a long period of not being close with Stacey, and just prior to their mother\u2019s passing I had made a resolution to be better and close the gap. This resulted in me being very involved with their family during these hard times. My last words with their mother was a promise to take care of the family and be there for them. \n\nI began talking a lot more with Ken during this time, supporting and comforting him through both the passing of his mother and the end of a 4 year relationship. He was away from his friend support system( he lives out of state, 12 hours away.) and I wanted to make sure he had someone outside of the situation, nearby, he could rely on. We got to know each other a lot more and found that we actually were incredibly compatible. We spent a month just friendly chatting before giving in a going on a date. Spoilers: went fantastic, we\u2019ve been together for 9 months. The relationship is incredible and I\u2019ve never been happier. We\u2019re closing the gap this June! :)\n\nHowever, not everything has gone so smoothly. I attempted to be as there for Stacey as I was for Ken, but I believe she found comfort and support in some of her closer friends she made in college. Everyone grieves differently and I was never hurt if my texts or invites were ignored or declined or her replies were short. We hadn\u2019t been close in a while, and although she was initially incredibly receptive to us becoming closer again, I don\u2019t blame her for not having the effort after her mother passing.\n\nBefore Ken and I went on our first date, he had informed Stacey that we had been flirting and that we were going on a date. She had told him she was completely fine with it and hoped we had fun. Later, she and I had a talk about it and it reaffirmed she was ok with it but warned me that I shouldn\u2019t get attached because he eventually had to go back to his home out of state. This admittedly made me nervous what his intentions were, but I went along with it. A few weeks later, we all hung out together and it went fine\u2026 at first. She slowly became more reserved and withdrawn throughout the night. We tried to involve her, get her to come out of her shell more, I asked if she was ok or needed medicine and she said she was fine. \n\nThe First Sign: Come to find out, she was not fine. She had called my best friend to rant about how terrible my behavior was, openly throwing myself at her brother, seeing me sexually flirt with him, and that no one cared how uncomfortable she was the whole night. I don\u2019t want to discredit her feelings on the matter, she is entitled to them and her perspective. However, my recollection of the night was different. She also mentioned how I was annoying for inviting her to do things too much and she wanted me to back the fuck off and leave her alone and allow her to come to me.\n\nKen and I had a date that night, and I relayed to him the despairing news that his sister didn\u2019t seem happy with the relationship. It looked like we needed to end it or at least take a break until we could have another conversation with his sister on her time. We were incredibly sad, but we decided to take a break and hope she came around. \n\nThat immediately backfired. He had talked to her about it and they ended up fighting. Ugly things were said, such as \u201cI just thought you were going to fuck her and be done with it.\u201d But apparently it resolved well at the end of it, from his perspective.\n\nThe next day Stacey sent me a long text that she didn\u2019t want for us to break up and to do that was not what she wanted. That it was unfair to put her in that position and that while I made her uncomfortable, she didn\u2019t want to interrupt anyones happiness. She also voiced that she doesn\u2019t communicate the same upset directed at me to her brother because she can only hold him so accountable because he is her brother. She said she wants to communicate, set boundaries, and wanted Ken and I to continue our relationship. I apologized profusely and immediately agreed. I was so hopeful for the future of all of our relationships.\n\nIssues and My Failures to Reconcile: Every time I tried to have this talk about boundaries, the conversation was put off or I was dismissed that the boundaries were common sense and didn\u2019t need to be talked about. I should just get it. However, she discussed boundaries she would like me to have with my boyfriend or my best friend, and told them she\u2019d like to have that conversation with me. She also emphasized that she did not have to put in effort to mending the relationship between us because I was dating HER brother.\n\nOver time, I backed off and tried to let her come to me (as she had told my best friend, but not me). Then she was upset I didn\u2019t reach out enough or communicate. She eventually removed me off Snapchat because she wanted distance from me and my relationship with her brother, not wanting to see it. Yet apparently talks highly of our relationship to her brother and comments on his photos of us. She declared that she and I are no longer friends, and that I need to respect that relationship we have between us now. I\u2019m occasionally invited over by my boyfriend when he\u2019s in town and I feel so intensely uncomfortable I have to be convinced nearly every time. (His sister will tell him how much she wants me to be a part of the holidays, celebrations, and dinners but I have personally never heard any of this from her.) There have obviously been more highs and lows between Stacey and I over the course of this, but this is already fairly long. Slowly, I\u2019ve stopped talking in our mutual groupchat, with friend group from beginning of post, for fear I\u2019ll fuck something up again and further ruin this degrading relationship.\n\nThe Fuck Up: I take full responsibility for my mistake. I should have known better. When I do reply in our groupchat, I never mention Ken. I don\u2019t talk about sex. And I try to stay out of the space as much as possible to make sure she can comfortably talk with our friends without feeling uncomfortable his brothers girlfriend is there. These weren\u2019t discussed boundaries, these were ones I imposed on myself. It has been this way for the entire 9 months Ken and I have been dating.\n\nBut I was tired and slap happy on my break at work. Saw people talking in the groupchat and joined in to toss in a shocking one liner and dip. They were talking about how we were all various forms of sick or injured. Stacey hadn\u2019t been active and I forgot myself for a moment: I joked that while my head cold was annoying, I was more concerned about an injury I got while having anal. It was in the groupchat for maybe a minute before I realized my mistake and deleted the message. But, by the glory of god, she had checked the groupchat and she had already seen it. She replied in the groupchat along the lines of \u201cOP I can see this, are you kidding me? Take this somewhere else\u201d\n\nI apologized and took responsibility in reply to her and she simply replied \u201cLmao.\u201d I was horribly embarrassed and feeling ashamed as it\u2019s been a few months since she\u2019s had an issue with me. So I left the groupchat. I hadn\u2019t been very active anyway and I feel like I was now infringing on a space where she felt comfortable. Only moments later I got a text from my boyfriend with a screenshot of a text from his sister: \u201cYour girlfriend just announced to the groupchat she\u2019s bleeding from her ass because of anal.\u201d Followed up by, \u201cI\u2019m extremely uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nBoyfriend not exactly happy with me because he\u2019s been trying to bridge this gap. She\u2019s not happy with me for obvious reasons. And I feel like the world\u2019s biggest fuck up and I deserve the bleeding asshole. \n\nI know this might seem small and will pass with time, but I\u2019m sick of sitting on my hands. I want to fix this so it\u2019s not so uncomfortable or awkward for either of us.\n\nThank you if you made it this far. My significant other\u2019s family is incredibly important to me and I desperately want to repair this relationship. But more than anything, I just want my friend back. Even if we\u2019re back to just occasionally calling each other to update each other on everything for hours. How can I mend this most recent mistake? What would be the best plan of action for the future? What the fuck do I do?",

        "content": "So first some context, I am a 22 years old man who 3 years ago emigrated to a new country,7000Km away from my homeland, alone. I came here without any friends or family with plans to start a life away from the misery in my country.  Since then I have made some progress,  I have a full time job l really like and that is related to the field I am studying and university, I started attending University during the evenings and working towards my degree, I finally managed to rent my own apartment and save some money, I go to the gym in the early morning before work and use my weekends to cook my weekly meals, clean my flat, study and volunteer in non-profit organization I like. \n\nSo now my issue, in the scarce time I have left I try to meet people but I don't really have much success, I am looking for a stable long term thing,I say i am looking for companionship not for some one night thing.  I am not interested in parting or going out to get drunk like the other people in my Univeristy class are but a few days ago someone I was going out with told me, before ending things, i more or less words that I am too mature and focused for my age and that means what I want and what most people my age want doesn't align and that is the reason why I struggle to find anyone.  To be honest I have had the same thought myself before, once a friend from my homecountry made the joke that at 22 years old I won't get anything but if I wait until I am 30 i will do much better because I am thinking like an adult while being just a \"kid\" of course he said it as joke but now there have been two completely unrelated people that basically told me the same. \n\nAt this point I think I will just focus on my other goals and leave the romantic part for when I am older and people in age range are more like me.\n\nWhat do you think?, am I crazy?, I don't believe I am the only one in a situation like this so if you have any feedback to share i would appreciate it. \n\nBest regards and Happy New Year from a little rock in the middle of the Mediterranean sea.\n\nTLDR: I have been told I am too mature and my priorities don't align with most people my age and that Is why i struggle to find a relationship",

        "content": "Backstory my bf and I have been dating for 3 years in March. We have gone through a lot of tough times together and I'm currently in therapy for a lot of things that happened in the last few years. My father passed away and I was really close to him 2 years ago,my bf and I had 2 unplanned pregnancies and 2 abortions and now he wants to try to conceive because suddenly it's good timing for him. We just spent the holidays with his family as we have done for the past 2 years and I had to face his brother and gf who are currently pregnant. I had to sit there and celebrate with them when I am still grieving my losses. I just don't know if I'm the problem or he is. \n\nI have these moments where my mood just switches and I feel like I need to be alone away from my partner. I feel sad when his mother talks about being a grandmother knowing that should be me now with a 3 month old and not his brother and gf having that. I feel like a horrible person for feeling this way but I know I'm still grieving a lot of things. My bf doesnt listen to me when I say our relationship is not good to bring a child into right now and he is saying things like that's not my choice to make.Its like he has forgotten our 2 babies that we never got to meet because he couldn't cope. I just graduated mental health nursing and Im planning on applying for jobs straight away but when I was doing my internship it was hard I was working 12 hour shifts while my bf wasn't working and coming home to cook and clean. There was a lot of fighting about that too. He has only been working for the last 2 months I've been off for 2 weeks since my internship ended. Since we've been here his mum has been doing everything for him,he is a 28 y/o man. \n\nI fear when we go home he will be just as lazy and dirty. I'm talking leaving cups and plates build up with mould. And he can be very emotionally unavailable even though I'm quite a sensitive and open person.I have been diagnosed with depression and so I do tend to cry out my feelings but he never does open up. He says therapy doesn't work for him because he had a bad experience. Our sex life is very incompatible also,I tend to run high and he is maybe once a week if I'm lucky. I never wanted to be that nag or annoying partner but I've tried every approach.Talking calmly,bluntly,shouting,not saying anything. I just don't know what to do anymore. \n\nI'm not without faults and I'm trying to learn to be a better communicator and more in control of myself but I just don't know if it's me thats crazy or him and I don't see this relationship going anywhere. He always said he wanted to travel loads and at the start he had a problem with commitment but now commitment seems to be a funny thing to him he will joke about getting a dog and having a kid in the new year but there's no stability or plan thought out. I'm exhausted trying to keep up with him and plans and spending money we don't have. At the start I suppose I liked his free spirit.His laid back attitude and calmness but this doesn't make for a good reliant partner in the long term and I've already got my foot out the door on this.\n\nTl;Dr relationship is not working out but I don't know if it's me or him that's the problem",

IE, seeing other people, do not spend time together, etc, they just haven\u2019t gone through the court process of getting a divorce. However, they do live in the same house and he spends his time in his room or his gf\u2019s house or work, 99.9% of the time. Every time I visit, I do not see him make an effort, or spend ANY time with my niece, despite living in the same household and calling himself her dad. (Oh and btw, according to my sister, he pays half of what a court would order him to pay in child support and half of market rate rent to my sister who essentially owns their house). It\u2019s well known to us all he is not being a father to her. We just don\u2019t speak on it collectively. \n\nMy sister suffers from a very severe depression and she could use a break from being the sole parent to my niece while my BIL gets off scotch free. GRANTED, I am biased bc of course I\u2019m going to listen to my sister over my BIL, but I still feel like I am spitting some truth here. \n\nI have half a mind to march down to his room, look him in the eye and say the following: \n\nWhy aren\u2019t you a part of your daughters life?\nThe mother of your child could very well kill herself one day, and your daughter\u2019s\ngrowing up without having known you as a father. You are going to go to meet your maker one day and I believe on that day you will see you\u2019ve come up short. I may say what\u2019s up to you in the hallways of this house but I need you to know I don\u2019t respect you. I\u2019m telling you this because I actually like you and think you\u2019re a nice person, oddly enough. BUT YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS YOU. Now, more than ever, and It\u2019s not too late to build a relationship with her. So you should make an effort to do that. And if you don\u2019t want to be a father, FINE! Then just leave the house so you stop giving My niece a f*%#ed idea of what a family should look like. \n\nTLDR: my BIL is not present in my niece\u2019s life and I want to tell him the f*$@ off. AM I overstepping?\n\nEDIT - sounds like the way to go is to being direct with my sister is the higher priority which I completely agree with and see now. Telling her to file for divorce and help her to seek help. Thanks Reddit!",

My boyfriend (mid 20's) has given me an ultimatum that he is leaving the state once our lease ends and I can either go with him or stay here (of course meaning the relationship ends). \n\nI can see why he'd want to leave regardless- he's had a streak of horrible luck and treatment while he's been here- horrible jobs with bad bosses (I even would point this out before he realized it), lack of meaningful friendships, a physically abusive family member (and cousins who would take that member's side and verbally abuse him), and due to all of this an overall loss in motivation. He has been jobless for a few months and while he's been paying the bills, all he does is stay home which is obviously not helping his mental state. He feels resentful of this state and he wants to leave.\n\nOn the other end I have been making strides since moving the the city we are in. I went from being stuck in a financial deficit to working my way up to my dream job with the most amazing and supportive coworkers. I'm getting paid more than I ever have, I can finally start putting money away and save, I'm getting closer to family and keeping contact with my friends. It's the exact opposite.\n\nIt sucks to see him this way and I want to be with him but on the same end there are so many doubts I have. We are only 4 months away from the lease ending and haven't picked a spot. We don't even have money set aside for this move. And with his loss of motivation for finding a job I fear that I'll be moving to a new state rolling the dice on a new job and rolling the dice on financial stability. I have told him this when we started to plan but he is so hard pressed on the leaving aspect that it feels like he doesn't understand why I am on the fence for leaving so soon with nothing prepared.\n\nI understand where he is coming from- he stayed in this city for me for an extra year despite wanting to leave and wants to make sure we don't get stuck here- but I feel like there will be so much given up on a roll of the dice.\n\nAnd I'm not sure if I'm being too selfish thinking about everything I've gained and if I need to take a chance for someone I love.

First few years of the relationship was nice, we met up and hangout quite often, probably because she's staying close to me (we both still lives with our family and our homes are walking distance apart).\n\nWhen the pandemic hit back in 2020, we were on lockdown and therefore stopped meeting for a couple months, still texted everyday and I felt it was alright as I was also busy during then. At the end of 2020 when we were allowed to leave the house and meet up, we still did not do so as she was always busy with her work (she worked in a big firm, was doing some side hustle over the weekends, as well as studying for some professional certification), so I gave her the time and space she needs, so she could have the rest she needs with the little time she had.\n\nIn early 2021, she had some family issues plus having lots of stress over her work and told me that she is feeling very depressed with everything that is going on with her life. I tried to meet up with her, but she was either too tired to meet or doesn't want to leave the house. She eventually left her job and took a short few months break before landing herself in another job which she seem happier about, and at that time it seems like her family issues were kind of handled and things looked better.\n\nFor the following few months, we managed to meet up for a few times to grab lunch/dinner and whenever I asked if she wants to hangout she'll say that she needs to study as her paper is around the corner. Granted, I guess I can't be selfish and needs to leave her alone to handle her own stuffs.\n\nFrom time to time, she'll tell me that she has some depressive episodes, usually happen over the weekends. She will coop herself up at home and when doesn't want to head out for anything. Again, I gave her the space and time I think she needs and didn't force her to meet.\n\nI have told her for a couple times how I felt, that she doesn't seem like she wants this relationship and all, but she'll reply saying she still wants to be together with me. But most of the time, the reply will be more focused on her depression and not addressing my concerns and feelings.\n\nRecently I told her once again that I felt that this is a one sided relationship. She replied saying she felt very guilty but don't know what she's doing with her life and don't feel like waking up everyday, and not wanting to be like this. She said she know it's her problem and to the point that she doesn't know what she wants. I've told her that she needs to seek professional help and get some therapy, and allow me to be there for her as she has been shoving me aside for so long. She claims that she went to see some online therapist and it is not helping, and refuses to see an actual therapist for now.\n\nI have been thinking for many months if I should leave her. I felt that my love for her has already faded to the point that I guess I'll be fine to move on now, but I worry she might not. I am aware that there is no \"the right time\" to break this to her, but at the same time I'll feel trapped being in this relationship and feeling like it's not heading anywhere.\n\nWhat should I do next and how should I break the news to her?\n\nTL;DR: My gf is facing depression, refuses to seek actual help, and it is straining our relationship to the point where I don't think I can be with her anymore",

        "content": "I (28F) have split parents, and my dad (50M) and my stepmom (49F) live about 5 hours away with my younger brothers. I\u2019ve lived away from them since I was about 3 when my mom moved us here, so I\u2019ve always been kind of the outsider. I\u2019m not around as much, I have different values etc. and this has led to a lot of struggles historically. \n\nThe most recent one really started when COVID hit in March 2020. I\u2019m much more cautious with everything, so I was really good about staying at home, not traveling, etc. I would go see my mom a bit (she lives 10 minutes away and was also being careful) but that\u2019s about it outside of work and like grocery shopping. So when that all happened I tried to be really intentional about continuing relationships with my out-of-state family. I started FaceTiming my grandparents more, I tried to schedule a family zoom game night (we did it once and it was okay), and I even tried to schedule a zoom birthday party for myself (no one rsvp\u2019d for the family one so it didn\u2019t happen). \n\nWith a lot of my family this worked great. I talk to my grandparents all the time now and it\u2019s amazing to have that face to face contact even though they\u2019re super far away. My dad and stepmom hated it though. They kept pressuring me to come and visit and said I was overreacting etc. especially when it came to missing Christmas last year. I had offered to come to Christmas at one point, but then I saw my parents were going to 50 person neighborhood Christmas parties unmasked etc. the weeks leading up to my trip and I wasn\u2019t going to mess with that. So I didn\u2019t see them for about a year until most of us were vaccinated and things had calmed down a bit. During all of this time I still tried to keep an active relationship going. I tried to FaceTime, especially to talk with my little brother who doesn\u2019t have a phone yet. And sometimes they would answer, but most of the time they wouldn\u2019t. Or they would forget to call me back etc. They complained to me a few times that they didn\u2019t like FaceTime, so I did more phone calls but still would FaceTime sometimes because that\u2019s the best way to talk with my youngest brother. Also for context, I\u2019d say 85-90% of our interactions are initiated by me. \n\nI kind of got to a point where I realized that if they\u2019re harping at me to visit when I\u2019m not comfortable but won\u2019t even take the time to FaceTime or zoom then it\u2019s almost more about connecting with me on their terms vs. connecting with me. And I saw that come up more when I did go in person a few times because even with checking with them and giving notice of my trips, for two of the weekends they were barely even around or were going out of town suddenly (even though they had told me that was an okay weekend to visit initially). \n\nThat dynamic has kind of continued over the last few months. And I wound up missing Christmas again because I was sick (not Covid) and couldn\u2019t manage the drive. Since I was missing Christmas I tried to FaceTime them a few times throughout the two days of family gatherings to see everyone and talk etc. And they answered once or twice but let it go a few times too. And I didn\u2019t say anything because I figured they\u2019re busy, but it hurt a bit too. \n\nFast forward to this weekend, I was talking to my stepmom on the phone figuring out when I could come visit and do Christmas with them. And at the end of the call she says to me, \u201cBy the way, stop FaceTiming your dad. He hates FaceTime. He doesn\u2019t ever want to FaceTime. And he\u2019s not going to answer most of the time. If you want to talk to him call him.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m frustrated because I feel like I\u2019m being brushed aside. I\u2019m the one making most of the effort and I\u2019m getting told how to reach out instead of getting actual involvement from them. And I get not liking FaceTiming everyone, but I\u2019m their kid. And I do it because I do better with visuals (for multiple reasons related to being neurodivergent). But I know I\u2019m carrying all of the baggage when I react to that request too, so I\u2019m kind of looking for feedback about how others see the situation. Because I don\u2019t want to say that their request is invalid, but it\u2019s hurtful in the context of everything else and Im not sure where to go next. Part of me wants to leave the contact up to them if they\u2019re going to have issues with how I reach out, but then I\u2019ll basically never talk to them. And it would be super easy to just stop FaceTiming, but it feels like the latest way of pushing myself down for their benefit. \n\nTLDR: My stepmom told me to stop FaceTiming my dad because he usually won\u2019t answer and I\u2019m hurt and not sure how to respond.",

        "content": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year and we moved in together two months ago. We had talked about what living together would look like by sharing our individual expectations and making compromises where the expectations where different. For example, I like the kitchen to be clean right after a meal but he prefers to wait a couple of hours to do the dishes. That wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker so I accepted his approach of waiting a couple of hours so that we can chill after the meal. Another example is that I have wanted a dog for a while but he is meh about the idea as he doesn\u2019t want to have more responsibilities - so we agreed that I would get a dog under my name and take care of the day-to-day and financial responsibilities while he can still enjoy the fun bits, which he is excited about. \n\nSince we moved in, he is not following the \u2018rules\u2019 that we established regarding cleanliness and chores. For example, he works early shifts so he is in a rush in the morning and can\u2019t clean up his breakfast, then after lunch he is too tired to clean and leaves the mess behind. He doesn\u2019t see the point on cleaning the kitchen before dinner so I usually end up having to clean the entire kitchen before making dinner because there is no room and it\u2019s gross - or even worse when I try to make a point, cooking in a tiny bit of the counter while I try to ignore the mess. After dinner, he usually smokes and is too tired to clean up so the cycle begins again in the morning with me having to clean the dinner, munchies and breakfast mess every morning before work. I am taking care of 85% of the cleaning, shopping, cooking and throwing out the trash - he only does those things when he feels inspired once in a blue moon or when I nag him enough to follow through. He works outside of the house and seems to be unbothered by the mess that surrounds us, but I work from home and need the space to be clean so I can focus on my work.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about this repeatedly and he acknowledges that the situation is unfair, that he is in the wrong, and that he just doesn\u2019t have the strength to do these things. I suspect he\u2019s suffering from depression because his mood has been low since the summer and he no longer finds joy in the things he used to enjoy. He\u2019s starting therapy this month and one of his goals is to be able to take care of his share of the chores at home. I want to be supportive and give him space to breath. But at the same time, the situation is taking a toll on me and I am building resentment and getting more and more snappy every day that passes. I am also starting to fall into the \u2018since it\u2019s already dirty, I\u2019ll just leave this plate there\u2019 - if the house was clean, I would put in the effort to put the plate in the dishwasher but since the house is already a mess, I don\u2019t bother and just leave it there until I have the energy to clean it all. I have tried to find short-term solutions like getting a professional cleaner to come once a week until he feels better, but he thinks it\u2019s unethical to hire someone to clean when we could do it ourselves (yikes I know). I gravitate between thinking that he is taking advantage of me and that he generally doesn\u2019t care about living in a dirty house. \n\nWe have a couple of other issues regarding different standards for personal hygiene, like how often he should brush his teeth or whether he should get a dental cleaning (spoiler here: he should). Other issues involve miscommunication, difficulty to express needs, etc. For example, he complains that I ask too many things of him during the day but to me, those are things that he should do by himself as an adult - like brushing his teeth before going to bed, taking out the trash when it\u2019s full, not using his phone while he drives, taking a shower when he smells bad, etc. \n\nI have my own emotional issues that I am dealing with in therapy so I know that he is just at the beginning of the journey. I want to give him grace and a chance to find the drive to take better care of himself and his share of responsibilities at home. I hope that our relationship will start seeing improvements in a couple of months but I know it might stay as it is. If things continue the way they are, I don\u2019t think I can stay in the relationship for much longer for my own sake.  \n\nWhat is reasonable in this situation? I love him very much and enjoy many aspects of his personality but I wonder where the limit is between trying to save a relationship and shifting towards self-preservation. I don\u2019t want to give him an ultimatum but I wonder how open I should be about the aspects of himself and the relationship that would need to change for me to stay. Any perspectives or tips are welcomed as I am lost as to how to proceed.\n\nTLDR; Boyfriend and I just moved in together after a year of dating. I take care of 85% of the chores because he doesn\u2019t \u2018have the strength\u2019 to do them probably due to depression - he\u2019s starting therapy to work on it. I am starting to resent him for making me responsible for all the cleaning but would love to stay in the relationship assuming things can change for the better. Any perspectives or tips?",

        "content": "My boyfriend(21 M) and I have been dating for over a year now. For some background info, I am a junior in college and live with my parents during breaks. During the semester, they would usually make me call every night. They also made me come home every other weekend. I don\u2019t own a car or have a full time job and rely on my parents for some more expensive items I need. My scholarship pays for my tuition. Meanwhile, my boyfriend has a high school diploma and is trying to go to college. He just doesn\u2019t have the money right now. However, he plans to get college benefits after going on a deployment for the military (he\u2019s a reservist). My parents don\u2019t like him, have never met him (they won\u2019t meet him since he\u2019s not my fianc\u00e9), and wish I would break up with him. They just do not like how he came from a poor background with a single mother and believe he will not provide for me. I have told them how he\u2019s trying and they always find some way to argue against his actions. My parents also believe that relationships are a distraction during college and hope no one tries to marry me. During a recent vacation my parents and I had, my Dad gave me a lecture almost every day about him. It\u2019s starting to put a drain on my mental state. I no longer feel confident enough to mention him for fear of getting another 2 hour lecture. I plan to go on a date with him next week but fear even trying to leave.

We went seven months without seeing each other while Covid was hitting hardest, and those were the most difficult months of our lives. For a few months following this long hiatus, we were only seeing each other about once or twice a month. Now, because we are both in college and she has more freedom, we do see each other once a week, but only during set hours and only during the school semester.\n\nI was taken aback when she first told me that she could not tell her family about me way back when our relationship first started because it was after I asked her out and I was so unsure about how we would go about seeing one another. Lately, I have been getting more and more frustrated with our situation because I just want to meet her family and not have to hide in secrecy anymore. I respect her decision to not want to tell her family, for fear of being shut out and possibly having to break us off. She says that she won't be able to tell her family until she gets through college and med school (which is quite a ways away). It hurts that the best years of our lives, ones in which we can spend a large portion of it together without worrying about bills or the realities of life, are being spent in secrecy, and I am losing out on so many family parties and events that I see other couples get to be together for. It has gotten to the point where I have been having dreams of meeting her father and mother and going to family parties together, as well as us living our lives with a sense of normalcy.\n\nI am not sure what to do because talking to her about how I am feeling only results in sadness and fear of me leaving. I have spoken to her about this before and this is all that has happened, regardless of my constant reassurance, and nothing gets fixed. I don't know whether to talk to her about it, with the hopes of maybe making some progress, or just go on without saying anything because I know that this dream will never come true.\n\nTL;DR- I am in a relationship with someone of a different culture than me. She has not told her parents after two years of us dating and I am beginning to get frustrated with this. I do not know whether to leave this alone and not tell her or talk to her about it and maybe try and make some progress with our situation.",

        "title": "Bad first date",
        "content": "So I (F 19) had been talking to this guy (M 22) while I was vacationing in Germany this past September of 2021 and I had cut things off shortly after because he was acting very immature. For example while I was on vacation he wanted to hang out and I told him once I get home and know my work schedule we can plan something. I wouldn\u2019t know my work schedule until the week I would work so I literally had no way of knowing when I\u2019d be free until then. He would continue to ask me when I could hang out at least 3 times within the same week. He would also ask me if I still liked him multiple times that same week or if I was talking to anybody else. It just reminded me of a middle school relationship. Anyways fast forward a month and a half we started talking again and just apologized how things went the last time. I go to school full time so I have a pretty busy schedule and don\u2019t like to be out late because I have to be up early to drive to school. With that being said we had finally made the time to hang out AND meet for the first time. I didn\u2019t want to go out because it was a school night (1st mistake) and I had just invited him over for pizza and a movie at my house. I live in the basement of my aunts house and she was not home (2nd mistake) but she was fully aware that he was coming over. I told my mom and my cousin and also had a plan with my cousin to call me and tell me there was an emergency where I would need to leave if things weren\u2019t going well. He came over and right away conversation was extremely hard to do. I tried cracking jokes and just trying to lighten up the nerves and the mood and I wasn\u2019t getting anything. The pizza finally arrived and I had went up to pay for it and when I had come back down he pulls out a lot of cash and is insisting I take it. (I later counted how much he was trying to give me and it was over $100) I refused the money and said next time he can pay. He was then getting into my face and still insisting that I take the money. He did this for a good portion of us hanging out saying if I wouldn\u2019t take it he\u2019d give it to someone else and just being rather aggressive about it but at this point I could smell alcohol on his breathe and he was slurring and just dazing. I kept getting up and doing random things so I could collect myself and just think of what the smartest decision was for this situation. When I sat back down he had put his arm around me and had a firm hold around me and was just staring at me. I assumed he wanted to kiss me and if he did I was not going to kiss someone that hasn\u2019t even said 10 words to me. That\u2019s when I went upstairs to pretend to turn lights off that I had forgotten about and was texting my cousin to call me. She had said her water broke and I needed to get there right away so I ran downstairs and explained the situation to him and he was slow to get up and just not acting like this was an urgency.  So I went upstairs to take him to the door and when I got to the door I wasn\u2019t hearing his footsteps and I was wondering where the hell he would\u2019ve went. When I went back to go find him he was standing in my kitchen staring at me with the most terrifying look on his face. I had never been so scared in my life and at this point I knew I needed him out of my house. I told him I would call him later and he said whatever I don\u2019t care and then he started stumbling towards the back door to my house when he originally came in through the front. And I was so confused as to why he was just helping himself to to any way out of the house instead of following me through the front door. I waited by the window where his vehicle was visible and I didn\u2019t see him return to his vehicle so I was scared that he was hiding in my house.  I finally called my cousin back and told her to stay on the phone with my just in case and I locked all of the doors and left immediately and went to my moms house. He had texted me a few times and I just responded with things didn\u2019t go how I expected and that it was different than when we would text and I haven\u2019t had any contact with him since that. I was in a very vulnerable place a few days after that and I would have panic attacks when I would get close to my house thinking he\u2019d be there waiting for me. I would make myself sick and I was so scared to shower.  I am a lot better now but I am scared to open myself back up to anybody because this was an extremely traumatizing experience for me. Should I be this scared? Should I open myself up and just be very cautious and make sure I let people know where I am and who I\u2019m with at all times? Or should I just give it a while?\n\nTL;DR sorry that is this is such a long story but I had a lot of details. I (F19) invited a guy (M22) over to my house for the first time alone to meet and hangout and he was drunk and acting very shady and was just not acting right. I had to set up a fake phone call to get him out of my house. I was extremely scared and I have been extremely anxious since and I am scared to open myself up to the dating world again because this experience was extremely traumatizing for me. Should I be this scared? Should I open myself up and just be very cautious and make sure I let people know where I am and who I\u2019m with at all times? Or should I just give it a while?",

        "content": "Background for context: I am from the US. I met my European husband  (44m) 10  years ago while studying abroad. I got pregnant and we decided the best option for us was to keep the baby and get married. We chose to go to his home country instead of mine for the first few years, for several reasons including health insurance and family support. The family was initially welcoming, but after my son was born things between my husband and his brother fell apart. Eventually, we decided to stay here in Europe so that my child would not be ripped away from everything he knew and the rest of the family he loved (despite the rocky relationship between the adults).\n\nCurrent issue: This New Year I finally lost my cool. BIL has always had the family (excluding us) over for the really important holidays, like Christmas Eve, and then again on the 26th, so we try to get the family over for the 25th and New Year. We don't complain because it is an equal exchange, and try to just enjoy the time we have with the family. In 2019  they said they would come to us to celebrate New Year, but later said they would only be able to come by after midnight to drink a glass of sparkling wine before heading home because BIL had invited them last minute. Last year was canceled, obviously, but this year we asked them to come to dinner and celebrate the New Year with us again. They came over and had dinner, and everything seemed fun and we were all having a  good time, I  thought, but at 11:15 they stood up and said they were going to head over to BIL to bring in the New Year. I got really upset and asked them why they were leaving just before midnight, and that it really hurts my feelings that they have done this twice in a row now. It's not equal if the other family gets 3 holidays and we only get one. \n\nShe responded by blaming me for not inviting them early enough, and that she can't help it if I can't manage to organize things on time as BIL's family does. I have always asked about 2 months ahead of time, and I reminded her of that, but (perhaps untactfully) added on that I  don't know how she doesn't assume at this point that we are going to ask for the 25th and new years. She got really upset at that and said that if I was going to scream at her (I  was NOT screaming, I might have talked louder than normal, but not screaming), then she was going to go, that she didn't deserve this treatment, why doesn't anyone think about how she feels, etc., and she stormed out. It now seems that she is waiting on an apology from me, for being rude to her and ruining the evening.\n\nI am at a complete loss as to what I should do now. If it were just me, I would have just refused to have contact years ago, but I am concerned about my son. How do I handle this situation without ruining what little contact my son has with his family here? How do I make her see things from our perspective? My husband is still scared of his mom, even though he's 44, so hoping he will advocate on behalf of our family is basically out.  \n\n\nTL;DR: MIL keeps ditching our family in order to celebrate the holidays with BIL's family. What can I say to her to make her realize she's acting unfairly?",

I\u2019m curious to know if anyone has experience being in a relationship and living with their partner, then deciding to live separately again for some time before marriage?\n\nI (27f) love my boyfriend (28m) \u2014 we\u2019ve been dating for 1.5 years and living together for the last year of it. We decided to move in together as we were always at each other\u2019s places anyway and it made sense financially to just live together. I\u2019m glad we did and do enjoy living with him, but do wish we would have waited to move in together and - I realize this is not for everyone but it\u2019s a personal preference - wish we had taken a more traditional approach by instead waiting to move in together until we were engaged or married.\n\nA few other related and non-related reasons contribute to this, but I also feel I need space to really figure out what I want outside of just marriage. I know I want to get married and god willing have children, but there are several other things I\u2019m trying to figure out like possible grad school, maybe wanting to move cities, change jobs and career paths, work on building more of a life for myself outside of just our relationship, and I also think he would greatly benefit from independence and making a life for himself outside of just our relationship too. \n\nI truly believe all of this would be beneficial for us both, and will also give me more confidence in my decision to eventually marry him if and when that time comes as I currently worry that if we were to get married, I\u2019d be agreeing to it more so out of convenience and because we are already so invested and living together. I believe that living separately and having the opportunity to really figure out who I am and what I want, at least as it relates to next steps in a relationship that is on track for marriage will result in us both being happier and very confident in the future. Recently turning 27 has made me realize I really need to figure out what I want and whether this man is the one as both our parents are divorced and it\u2019s crucial for me to feel confident, which I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m in a position to make a confident decision on.\n\nTLDR; I\u2019ve lived with my boyfriend of 1.5 years for the last year and am enjoying it but am considering proposing that we no longer live together until we\u2019re engaged or married. I believe this will be good for us and encourage growth as individuals while simultaneously growing as a couple, leaving us in a better position to confidently determine whether we want to get married to each other!",

I'm not really good at reading people, so I can't tell how she feels at all.\n\nIdc about sex too much, but almost all of my past relationships after high school ended about 4 months-2 years after we stopped having sex. So, I think there may be a problem since we haven't had sex since the day she got pregnant.\n\nShe also hates my best friend (26M) because he made fun of her on a Facebook post of his crush at the time who told him that my (not together at the time) gf was faking her Carpal Tunnel. He trusted his crush, so I understand why he thought she was faking it and I also understand why my gf is upset with him about it. As far as I can tell, it was a misunderstanding and my best friend has apologized multiple times, but she still absolutely hates him. This causes problems, of course, because anytime I go hang out with him, she gets in a really foul mood.\n\nI helped her friend (unk.age F) move into a new house last weekend, she took care of our child all day with no issues. On Wednesday, I helped my best friend move and I left around 9:30am and didn't get home until around 11pm. For obvious reasons, she didn't accompany me, so she took care of our child all day and the dog. She was a little angry, but it didn't seem to be a huge deal and I offered to take care of her all day yesterday and I pretty much did so outside of 1 or 2 feedings and I also took her out to dinner since my buddy ended up giving me some money for helping him. \n\nToday, we had been trading on/off like we usually do when I'm off work. Then, I went to take some moldy bread out back to dump it in the woods so it didn't stink up the house in the trash can. As soon as I stepped outside (it was raining all day and cold enough to turn to ice), I slipped on the mat and fell down about 6 stairs. I hurt my elbow and it has a huge knot on it and it hurt any time I moved it and my hip is bruised pretty good, so I figured I'd sit on the couch and asked her to take care of our child at least until the ibuprofen kicked in and so I could put some ice on my elbow. She got really mad at me for some reason and said that she's not taking care of her since I was gone all day helping my friend move. She said it was my choice to help him move all day and I could've said no so I could help her take care of the kid. \n\nImportant to note also that my transmission went out (new one currently being installed at the dealership under warranty) in my car and she won't let me drive hers for work, so I've been borrowing cars from anyone I could up until this week where my warranty finally decided to cover a rental for a week. So, I dropped it off on moving day and my buddy picked me up from there and drove me home when we were done. So, to say the least, it was not really my choice to be there all day.\n\nAnyways, I was kind of mad and I responded with \"I guess it was a \"choice\" to help your friend move last week, too\" and she got really angry and said she was leaving and left. And now we are up to current time.\n\nSo, I'm not really sure what's going on. I also work a pretty labor intensive job and I come home sweaty and tired and she immediately hands me the baby after I take the dog out and I take care of her pretty much until I go to bed most days except for feeding her which she usually takes care of so she can build up her milk storage. I'll do it if she's too tired or she just pumped or something, but she pretty much does it otherwise. It also takes about 95% of my income to pay all the bills and the rest to get everything else we need each month due to some poor financial planning on my part when I was in college, so that's really stressful and WI continue to be for at least 6 months until a couple loans get paid off in full. Then we'll be rolling in dough, relatively speaking. \n\nShe complains about never getting a break, I can't afford to take her out or get her anything usually, and I don't have time to vacuum (she won't do it because she already does too much around the house) when I'm always taking care of our child (when I'm home), walking the dog, or working and she gets mad at me about that, too. She usually cooks and takes care of the baby. She also has food stamps, part of the reason we aren't married (we've joked about this before, I would definitely try to marry her if we didn't need them, though) because I make too much for it and we'd starve without it. \n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Can't afford any kind of relationship counseling services, I have less than $100/mo over my bills and that pretty much goes to diapers, clothes, toiletries, and things like that.\n\nTldr; gf is mad at me, hates my best friend, idk what to do at this point.",

        "content": "Hi guys,\n\nSorry for the long post. \n\nHave a self-inflicted mental conflict with my fianc\u00e9s [30F] due to her thoughts about my family and myself [32M]. \n\nI am based in Australia.\n\nThe context is that she grew-up with a wealthy social circle (not including family), whereas my upbringing was mainly in the low-middle class. In a relative sense, she perceives me to be less affluent than her (although she knows really little about my family\u2019s actual wealth - nor that I believe that it needs to be shared with her).\n\nA few other subtle instances here and there where it seems wealth appears important to her include:\n-\ther stating she knows richer people than me (when we were talking about friends in general)\n-\tsaying that I\u2019m poor in a sarcastic manner \u201cI don\u2019t think your rich\u201d (I\u2019m a training doctor just recently bought a house)\n-\tasking if my cousins are \u201cpoorer than me\u201d (they didn\u2019t have the best upbringing)\n\nIt sort of bugs me that she appears to think that way of my family- perhaps it\u2019s a bruised ego thing on my part why I am annoyed. \n\nDespite that, she says she respects me and my family though. She seems to get along well with my folks - which is really important to me. \n\nIn her defence, she respects wealth because it is a reflection of how hard you work. I do agree with this as both our families weren\u2019t rich to begin with but a lot of hard work was involved. \n\nI on the other hand appreciate hard work and hustle - but I don\u2019t believe wealth alone is an accurate reflection of that. \n\nIn your opinion, is it wrong for your partner to think that about your family? \n\nHave some concerns whether the above is a red flag as we have both talked about starting a family together. \n\nThoughts?\n\nMuch appreciated!\n\nTL;DR - my fianc\u00e9 thinks my family is poor compared to hers, but she says she still respects my family regardless. Is it bad she thinks this way? Or is it just my ego reacting this way?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the comments so far. I guess there are points I should clarify:\n1) We are all Chinese (westernised) so all have that \u201cwealth\u201d mentality \n2) She\u2019s a pharmacist and pretty much works most days of the week (of course the pay is still not good as mine)\n3) She isn\u2019t wasteful of money (tries to save where she can, and hasn\u2019t made me spend excessively) - this is an important trait\n4) Her family is probably on par with my family in terms of wealth - except what she has seen so far suggests otherwise of my family (we don\u2019t like to brag in general)",

        "content": "Me (45f) and H (47m) have been together for 15y and have a 12f. I think he drinks too much and that, along with a few other things, is making me extremely unhappy to the point of self harm.\n\nSince 12f was born I\u2019ve drink less and less, now only really drink socially. H will normally drink alone, at home, watching TV and get through 2-3 bottles of wine per night. He will drink until he falls asleep, sleep on the couch and then come up between 2-5am, is belligerent and snores and I usually bail to the spare room just so I can sleep. He usually drinks like this any night he hasn\u2019t got work the following day but also drinks when he watches sport and was also drinking on Sundays also. Because it\u2019s been the holidays he\u2019s drunk every night for two weeks.\n\nMaybe this is related, but maybe it\u2019s not, but our relationship is now pretty much completely platonic. It\u2019s like sharing a house with a brother. No affection, no cuddles, no hand holding, no compliments, sex probably three times in the last four years. There isn\u2019t anyone else for either of us but it\u2019s hard to be intimate when he\u2019s asleep drunk on the couch downstairs.\n\nYes I have raised this with him. Last time was November and he said he\u2019d keep it to one bottle and just Fri and Sat nights - that has not lasted. He spends lots of money on the wine too - more than on me or 12f. Of course the 12f has noticed and sometimes ridicules him for it but it\u2019s just normal to her now.\n\nLast year we separated for a time because of this - the drinking, my loneliness, and I was really struggling with covid restrictions too. I came back really for 12f and we had another heart to heart where he said he\u2019d change. He never changes. I just don\u2019t know what to do next to be honest.\n\nTL;DR am I being unreasonable about how much H drinks? Should I just suck it up and stop being sensitive? Should I just move permanently into the spare room like a sister and just focus on 12f?",

Since I found out about the pregnancy, he's tried to get in touch with me six times through email/text/burner accounts, has tried to get mutual friends to talk to me for him, and showed up to my place once. The latter was the only time I humored him. He told me he was sorry, he loves me, he doesn't want to be with my stepsister and wants to get back together with me. I told him tough titties. He made his bed and now he's got to lay in it with her.\n\nI haven't dated much since July because of my life's implosion, but in November a friend from college messaged me out of the blue. We hadn't talked in a long time. He \\[27M, referred to as EX2 for the rest of the post\\] and EX1 were good friends but had a falling out over something fantasy football-related the year after we graduated and I stopped talking to him out of solidarity, or whatever.\n\nAnyhow, we go on a date. We click. We go on a few more dates. We become exclusive in early December. I was feeling really hopeful about this until this morning.\n\nI was supposed to meet EX2 at a new year's party last night. He got there before I left the house and texted me saying that EX1 was at the party and asked whether I still wanted to come. I declined and went to another friend's house and have a pretty good time. I tried calling EX2 at midnight but he didn't pick up, I didn't think much about it.\n\nAnyhow, I go to bed late and when I wake up this morning, I have a message from EX2 saying we're done. I couldn't even respond because he'd blocked me *everywhere*. I talked to a friend who was at the party the EXes were at last night and he said the two of them had spent a good chunk of time chatting with each other but he didn't know what they were talking about. I'm not close with anyone else who was at the party so I don't really have anyone else to ask.\n\nLike okay, it was a two-month-old relationship. I'm sad but I'm not bereft. But the paranoid part of my mind is really concerned that EX1 said something that resulted in EX2 becoming EX2. EX2 has made it abundantly apparent that he doesn't want to talk to me again and I don't want to push that boundary. But I'm so confused. I could contact EX1 but I get the feeling that will open a floodgate of drama. I could also try talking to other mutual friends to see if they've heard anything but I also don't really want to spread this as a rumor if it wasn't true.\n\nI don't know. I'm at a loss. Any advice here? I'm spiraling thinking that my ex is going to try to ruin every relationship I have for the rest of my life.\n\nTL;DR: After a conversation with an old ex boyfriend, my new ex boyfriend broke up with me. I'm afraid that the old ex boyfriend said something to him and I'm worried he'll do it again in the future.",

He\u2019s in debt, no money ever (unless it\u2019s for his car or when he wants someone for himself) he is constantly on his gaming laptop, rarely wants to socialise (he is T1 and uses that as an excuse not to go out) unless it\u2019s speaking to his online friends and for the past few months his demeanour is always miserable with me. \n\nLiving with him, I pay more rent/bills/luxuries, I do all of the cooking and cleaning and do a lot of the driving, day trip planning and do the niceties for both sides of the family I.e birthday gifts & cards.\n\nWell, now I\u2019m in my 30s I don\u2019t know whether to carry on or distance myself further and move on with me life.

The hardest part for me is that we have had some lovely times, laughter happiness and what not but I now walk on eggshells and fear about giving him any sort of constructive feedback or asking him to help me around the house. \n\nLuckily it\u2019s only my name on house, and I own everything.

He had dated people before me and also during our two-month separation about two years ago.\n\nI grew up in a pretty conservative household/community so I didn't dare have any romantic relationships growing up. Ever since elementary school, I've been anxiously waiting for college so I could finally date and hookup and get all the experiences that my less repressed peers have already been having. I have always been looking forward to it and was always super envious of my friends who were allowed to date in middle/high school. On the other hand, my boyfriend's family has always been very supportive and encouraging of him exploring and having relationships, so he doesn't see his dating history as a big deal since it's normalized in his community.\n\nWe met online in high school and have been in a long distance relationship since then (That\u2019s how I was able to hide this relationship from everyone). We both plan to move in after graduating college and we fully intend to spend the rest of our lives together. It\u2019s been an amazing relationship, I can\u2019t imagine my life without him at this point. However, I have always felt myself growing resentment towards this relationship because of the fact that he got to date around before being locked down while I will most likely never get to. I completely understand that this issue is on my part, not his, and that this jealousy is irrational and just a product of my childhood. I also know that I would deeply regret separating just so I could satisfy my need for dating around, so breaking up or opening up the relationship are not options. I really don\u2019t want to feel these feelings, I wish I could just get over my jealousy.

I've also had a pretty rough last couple years with legal trouble employment issues an so on. we met at a mutual work place that I was employed at for a month before getting covid an subsequently being replaced in the time frame. When we met we were both sort of in the throws of addiction/binge drug use (benzos, alcohol, psychedelics, partying in general) and we ended up bonding fast and hard through that.\n\nIn the beginning she went back and forth with me about a relationship being ready for one and the substantially of our connection. I had always stayed strong to wanting a relationship and getting better together and after some lies and betrayals and rejections from her to dating we slowly moved more and more into a real relationship. \n\nI'd say about half way through this time of knowing each other she took a bit of a dive on her mental health as did I subsequently culminating into a overdose/suicide attempt on my part which landed me in deeper issues with the probation and drug addiction support I was already in and losing my most recent job as I had to leave for a couple weeks to get help and sober. Which I am doing much better with now.\n\nEssentially I feel like she's not been able to step out of her emotional state in all of this to A) not really being there for me through everything I've been going through B) always needing me as an emotional crutch which brings me to point C) feeling like I'm often having to sacrifice recovering my mental health to be there for her at any moment. \n\nThis involves me devoting what feel like my already poor financial, emotional, mental stability. I don't mind being there for her and deeply love her for the connection and intimacy we share which is unique in my dating experience, but ive just really been feeling like it might be stunting my own progression and causing me stress as far as if Im not there every moment she needs it that I might lose her (might have to do with the dishonesty that occurred early in our relationship) \n\nWhat's really been pushing me to this more so lately is that I've been staying home/trying to get back into my old *good* habits and routines which had made it to where I haven't came to see her since I saw her last on Thursday morning. \n\nSo this was the current situation that has me feeling off.. She was working lastnight and ubers were very expensive going from about 5x the normal rate down to double. she was working and I had told her I would pay and also use the very last of my money to uber one of us to see eachother and she basically said we shouldn't use our money that way as we wouldn't have much time to see each other anyway. She got off work at 12am lastnight and ended up calling me about coming over to which I then said no since I had ended up in some activities with my brother.she got Choked up on the phone and essentially just hung up and then didn't really talk to me at all before saying goodnight. She worked again today at 9am to around 5 or 6pm, and has that same shift again tomorrow wed been texting today and having good conversation between eachother so all was fine but then again asked if I would come over tonight right when she got off work.\n\nI talked to her on the phone and told her we should wait until tomorrow because I was doing laundry cleaning trying trying get some things done and that I wanted to go to a jiu jitsu class in the morning that's in her area and I could find additional things to do over there until she would be off work this would save both of us money on taking ubers to and from in addition to both of us having Sunday evening and almost all of Monday to relax and hang out. I suggested it would be better for us to take care of our personal things and then not having anything to worry about much for those two days. In addition if I went tonight I'd either just be going back home in the morning or sitting in her apartment by myself and or just meandering around the area outside if I left her apartment for any reason with no key or way back in (I only have enough money to uber 2 mayyybe 3 times and I'm already planning on having some miles to walk bike or bus In the snow tomorrow to make the whole thing work.)\n\nShe again got choked up didn't really say anything to me and then basically hung up on me again i asked if she was sad or disappointed and if she would still talk to me or if we could talk on the phone becquse I wanted to her about her weekend at work etc.. when she was back home she said it's fine and yes we could talk but then stopped really replying to my messages and we never talked on the phone.I sent her a couple messages to explain my reasoning to wait to see each other to which she didn't really say anything but was being blatantly passive upset which I asked for her to try and communicate those feelings, she didnt. I have however expressed my feelings of not feeling like I'm enough when I'm not able to be there for her everytime and how hearing her get so upset in the phone about it totally crushes me and makes me feel bad, and if she really needs to see me that ill make it happen instead of the plans I'd had.\n\nThen I sent her this. And this was where I got pretty hurt and more deeply looking at what's going on between us.\n\n\"it's going to better in the end (to hang out tomorrow instead) for us especially for me to continue working on my mental by doing these simple things consistently like working out keeping up with laundry and chores getting back to the jiu jitsu and that community so it feels important to me I mean just a couple months ago I was basically emergency sent to that detox cause I genuinely tried to kill myself or was ready to and I hate to even say that or make it that way and be heavy with it but thats what happened and I've been only taking tiny steps out of that and hardly even accepted or faced the facts of that taking place or talking about it or addressing it at all and I'm feeling better and I know things that will help and keep improving that so I want to jump on that wave while I'm feeling up to it. To have a better me for me and for you\"\n\nHer reply to me was\n\n \"Be better for you please \ud83d\udc9b it's okay I'm going to go to bed tho I think prettty tired \" and she said that at 6:30pm which is extremely abnormal time for her to go to sleep.  \n\nI'm not controlling at all and give her full freedom to hang out with other people be it other men or women and try to reiterate that I want her to do things to keep herself happy and socially satiated. As well as my remorse for not being able to give her more than I do right now.\n\nMaybe I'm just really sensitive but this kind of passivity towards that subject and that situation which we have only really talked about once kind of stung for some reason. Shes been fully aware of the overdose attempt we were hanging out right up until I had to go to the detox basically at the force of my therapist. However when I got out she was the person I heard from the least which was essentially not at all out of anybody and then when we finally did see eachother a week or so later she was in such a bad mood that she spent the whole day yelling and crying and upset about her personal life while I just sat with there through it with her.\n\nI'm not sure what I expect from her or anybody but I just feel like I'm never able to have my own emotions cause I've been so preoccupied trying to keep her going that I haven't been taking care of myself at all. When she's bad ill put off the whole day just to let her sleep and rest and cook and bring her food and water and vitamins etc in my bed, and sometimes these moods for her will last days or a week until im able to get her feeling better and then the next day something happens and I'm back to her side.\n\nI'm constantly feeling like If I'm not there she's gonna find someone else who will be there more I lost my car early on in an accident going to jump her car battery so it's hard for me to get around anymore plus she doesn't have a vehicle either my only income is sporadic and highly illegal but I keep doing it so that I can have a little something every week just to see her or take us for food and stuff.\n\nMaybe this is all just a me issue feeling inferior to some imagined other man but there's a ton of history to this story that's not been said here as well, but I'm curious what the internet may think about all of this and any genuine  insight would be appreciated. I'd like to say it's not all bad we have am amazing connection like I said and we have really good times together when we're both feeling well and when we can see each other we rarely ever having issue between each other or are able to solve them easily.\n\nTL;DR I feel like the emotional support between me and my girlfriend is unbalanced and I'm feeling drained and kind of alone because of it.",

        "content": "Hi all, I (21M) was just wondering if I can get a bit of advice as I am beyond torn and at breaking point right now\n\nBasically I have been in a relationship with my partner (25F) since Early 2021 and things were great until they started changing, now I have been in contact with Police (UK) as I have hit a point where I cannot take anymore because its going to destroy me if I cant get out safely but then I want to also give another chance (I already have given more than I can count) because she's pregnant with Twins (which are most likely mine) but first I am going to break down why this is tearing me apart:\n\nFirstly, things have not always been this bad and things aren't perfect on my end but nowhere near as bad as what she has done. Part of me misses the good times and keeps some hope that she will change and we can work back to getting where we used to be but realistically it does not seem likely and the longer I remain in this situation but I still wish she could change.\n\nSecondly, she has cheated on me for an extended period of time which I later found out about which hurt me but she decided to blame me for that which was just a cop out but I have gotten over given time.\n\nThirdly, She has accused me of some awful things and had me arrested several times (all no further actioned due to the fact these were all false and \"Consequences\" for non cooperation dispite me never being in trouble before this relationship) but still tells people the same BS story stating that everything shes accused me of is true and will openly tell others and has even made me agree with her story under threat of further accusations, she still to this day uses these accusations as leverage to get me to cooperate with her wants and desires.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, I think she's abusive towards me but I am very unsure if you could clarify for me, she engages/has engaged in the following behaviors which I have pulled from my records so I apologise if it doesn't read well:\n\nEmotional: Name calling, Character Assassination, Shouting/aggression, Patronizing behavior, Public Embarrassment, Dismissive of my feelings, Belittling my accomplishments, Baiting arguments, Threats, Digital Spying, Unilateral Decision Making, Outbursts, Treating me like a child, Feigned Helplessness, Unpredictability/Walking on eggshells, Using others to make me feel ganged up on, Extreme Jealousy, Gaslighting, Using Guilt to Manipulate, Denying Abuse, Accusing me of abuse, Trivialising my feelings and input, Personal Jokes about my insecurities, Blaming me for all her issues, Destruction of my property, Demanding respect, Shutting down communication to maintain control, Socially isolating me from others, Destroying my relationships with others, Withholding affection to get her own way, Tuning out opposing views, Indifference to my feelings and Disputing how I feel\n\nFinancial: She commonly holds my money and is actively stopping me from working right now by witholding important documents\n\nPhysical: States intent to cause harm if she couldn't control her emotions using statements such as \"I wanna hit you right now\" and once turning physical by pushing, she has also left scars on me by biting during Sex which I had stated at the time I didn't mind but she needed to calm down as it was going too far.\n\nSexual: She has never done anything extreme without my consent but she uses sexual humilation against me knowing my insecurities and has also shared explicit videos involving me without my consent\n\nIn addition to this she is extremely coersive and will coach me on what to say then ensure I say what I am told even if she is not there by making me record interactions so she can listen later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is the list of things that I believe can be attributed to abuse which is what I am bringing up to police as abuse as I cannot take anymore but cannot leave without intervention as I have concerns about my personal safety if I do anything out of line, But i feel so bad for this as although it'll help me (get out, get housing, etc.) I don't want to ruin her life and I still have something in my head saying I know she loves me and she can change I just need to give it time and give her another chance, I am so scared of leaving because I don't want her to make more malicious reports or slander me publicly for things I haven't done just to get back at me, plus I do not want to miss the birth of my children or risk not seeing them as the only reason I still battle on is for them (CPS are involved and due to her history it's not likely she will get custody but I believe she may have been slandering me to them to help her perceived chances)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help and advice would be great especially as I don't know if I am doing the right thing here and I am so scared while being unsure what will happen, I have proof and witnesses of most of her behaviour so I am definitely not making baseless accusations here but I am so worried that I am just going to be the one who is physically and mentally hurt here and I will lose either way, I also still feel so messed up because I do still love and care for her which makes me feel completely insane for feeling that way but I reached a point where I cant deal with it or her constant lies anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post, but thank you for any replies or advice\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I am feeling guilty and doubting myself for trying to get out of my relationship which has many signs of abuse while considering trying to stick around for my unborn children",

        "content": "\nTL;DR : I need help/advice on dating ex boyfriend after changing my behaviour. Mutual friends involved made the breakup more messy due to him exposing the private things I\u2019ve told him while we were dating\u2026\n\nSo my ex bf (m21) and I (f21) broke up on Dec 13 but made it official on Dec 17 due to my toxic behaviour towards him and others (which I was aware of and had plans to improve myself). I\u2019ve sincerely acknowledged and apologised verbally and through writing a letter and gathered the effort to start therapy, read self love/ self help books and podcasts, making new friends, etc to fix my behaviour. However, as soon as I had the time to start to take action on fixing my behaviour (after many empty promises because I couldn\u2019t solely focus on myself due to uni, placements and family issues) he said he couldn\u2019t handle it emotionally and mentally anymore. \n\nOn top of this, he exposed the bad things I\u2019ve done to him and the shit talking I have said to him about my friends (ex friends now because they hate me) \u201cbecause it\u2019s fair for them to know\u201d. How is this fair to me though when I had a closer connection to him, valued him a lot more than friends and trusted him because we were dating? I know it\u2019s not good to shit talk but when I\u2019m angry I tend to just blurt out anything out of frustration/jealousy. Now he isn\u2019t stepping in to fix this issue but rather, he just watches my ex friends (they were mutual friends before) talk shit and send me degrading messages. He also mocked me by not using my name to refer me and seems like he is enjoying his time with his toxic friends. \n\nIs it right for him to expose me like that after the breakup? I trusted him with keeping things confidential because we in a relationship for almost 6 years. I never would have suspected him to do such thing since he was mature and thought logically while we were dating. This was like the only major thing he has done that was beyond mortifying which led to me losing friends and also me losing him. \n\nThere were many good things about the relationship but the bad things of the relationship stemmed from my negative mindset/ toxic behaviour which I have started to work on. I feel as if he heavily valued more of the negative stuff compared to the positive stuff to which he valued somewhat lightly. However, I also realised recently that he does have flaws himself like not being able to recognise his part in fights, always blaming me for things, never saying sorry first, HOLDING GRUDGES for things that have happened years/ months ago, etc. So when I have control of my behaviour, do you think it is possible to try and date again? This was a very serious relationship despite us being young as we had talked a lot about future plans and we both somewhat had a mature perspective of dating/relationship (aka the goal to date is to get married and build a family that respects both of our parents)",

It made me kind of uncomfortable because earlier she had been talking about how bad her withdrawals get without the meds and how bad she needs them \u2014 The reason she needed to pay for it that day was because she ran out early. I know that she does need it but I feel kind of uncomfortable that she\u2019s giving it to people for recreational use. She runs out of meds pretty early almost every month but I figured she was taking too much for herself by accident \u2014 As someone with ADHD too I totally understand forgetting and taking too many pills in a day.

        "content": "Okay so I know this is a bit of a read, but I would really appreciate some support on what to do next. \n\nI (21F), have been dating my bf (21M) for the past year and a half. We\u2019ve been best friends since we were 18. We go to Uni in Australia, but were stuck in India due to Covid, and because the borders hadn\u2019t opened by the summer of 2021, we were starting to lose hope.\n\nHe and I both have terrible lives at home, so we knew we wanted to get out of India. We decided to apply to study in Canada after our bachelors, so we could immigrate and get a work permit quickly. \n\nJust a bit of context: Canada has both Universities, and colleges, and the former confers degrees, while the latter sticks to diplomas. \n\nI got into the #1 Uni for Business, but my parents refused to finance my education, citing they wanted me to work for a few years before getting a Masters. This was in complete contrast with their behaviour in the past few months, when they encouraged me to get another degree to supplement my education. \n\nGetting a loan was out of the question, so my bf encouraged me to look at diplomas since they costed much lesser. \n\nHowever, when I did my research about these PGDMs in Canada - I found them to be, to put it politely, SCAMs. They don\u2019t offer any information on life after graduation, no indication that getting the diploma actually helps with anything beyond immigration- and no career support whatsoever.\n\nI know it\u2019s a risk many people take, but I don\u2019t think he and I should. We can still travel to Australia now that the borders are open, although it will be tough to find a job considering we weren\u2019t able to network all that much bc of Covid. \n\nMy bf insists on going to Canada, despite knowing the pitfalls of the course - we didn\u2019t find many graduates from the course or college on LinkedIn, and the ones we did work minimum wage jobs now, which isn\u2019t what we had in mind for our careers. \n\nWe\u2019re both fairly well to do, so this isn\u2019t a decision due to economic duress, but emotional and mental stress caused by living at home. \n\nI need help to show my bf the reality of what he wants to get into - if he insists on going, i fear he will get into a trap of working to make ends meet, and not wanting to come back home due to the above reasons. \n\nI have decided to stick to Australia, as much as I want to go to Canada with him, I need to make sure once I leave, I don\u2019t come back and doing a PGDM doesn\u2019t give me that confidence. \n\nTLDR: Bf wants to escape the country and pursue a PGDM in Canada, which doesn\u2019t have very good prospects based on what I\u2019ve found, and I need advice on how to make him see it\u2019s an objectively poor decision. \n\nTIA!",

I cut college and went to see him at a cafe and he started to talk about the past. He really looked like he regretted it all. He kept telling me about our past experiences and it felt genuine and sweet. He took my hand and started holding it. Telling me how soft and little they were. Kept on asking if any other guy had touched me during these 8 months. (For context, I've never had any sort of physical intimacy with my ex because it was ldr) Got mad when I told him I went on a date once.

        "content": "I (F25) grew up in a big family, my parents (MF 60s) 4 siblings (20-30s) and me.\nIt was tough to get any positive attention from my parents and I felt very alone growing up.\nMy father was very serious about discipline. We grew up in an ultra-conservative Christian environment that encouraged punishment and \u201cspankings\u201d. \n\nHe would use a leather strap to deal out smacks across your backside while you stood at the counter or against a wall. You had to remove your pants first too. It wasn\u2019t gentle and I usually couldn\u2019t sit for a few days which was awkward at school. And these sessions could go on for hours. Sometimes he\u2019d take a break and forget we were even in his room waiting. \n\nAnd the transgressions that earned punishment could be minor - like breaking a toy, refusing extra peas at dinner, or one time when I got stage fright and refused to sing in elementary chorus tryouts. Besides spankings we might have to sit in timeout for hours as a kid, or go without dinner for a day or two or pickup rocks for a week. \n\nI really hated him, I tried to run away a few times when I was older. Like after he broke my bedroom door off its hinges or dragged me across the floor by my hair at 16. \n\nI hated my mom too. She didn\u2019t like me, and told me so often. She would keep track of anything we did wrong, especially me and would tell my dad as soon as he got back from a business trip. So you\u2019d think all week that you in are in the clear and then realize when he\u2019s back you have a 2 hr smack down scheduled. \n\nI really didn\u2019t start to have a relationship with them until after I graduated college.\nThey\u2019ve changed so much now, they are more open minded and I credit that to them finally leaving the church and for being willing to have discussions. And they\u2019ve done so many great things for me - paid for college, gave me a loan for a car, take us on family trips. And as a kid they enrolled me in any sport I wanted, gave me an allowance etc. \n\nBut it\u2019s hard, I still feel uncomfortable when they hug me or say that they love me - they just never said that when I was little. \nWe live close by to each other now and hang out frequently and who they are now is vastly different but it\u2019s tough for me to forget how it was before, and how depressed I was as a child. \nMy siblings sometimes imply that we should just bury it all, but I think as my mom\u2019s scapegoat it\u2019s harder for me?\n\nI really would just appreciate any input or insight from those with similar family dynamics. How do you have a relationship with your parents now despite the past?\n\n**TL;DR; my parents were strict disciplinarians and the punishment made me hate them. But now they are different and we have a new relationship but I struggle to forget the past.**\n\n\nEDIT:\nTo add some answers to below questions/comments.\n\nThanks everyone for sharing your personal stories/insight/advice with me. It really means a lot to me. I think the greatest thing you\u2019ve given me has just been assurance that I\u2019m not crazy for feeling this way, and that It wasn\u2019t ok.\n\n\nFirst - my grandparents on either side had more hands off approaches to parenting - they did not hit my parents. It was the small church community that my parents joined when they first moved south that really fostered this method with them. All kids in that community were dealt punishment at young age - but I think my parents went the extra mile with their \u201cstyle\u201d and keeping it going into older years. \n\nSecond - honestly I left the more\u2026difficult parts out. So for you all to already be saying this counts as abuse has been eye opening and validating for me. I was genuinely terrified of my father as a kid, we\u2019d hear the door open when he returned home and just scatter to our hiding spots. But he\u2019d just wait us out. \n\nThird - I do agree I need to find a good counselor/therapist and think this is solid advice. I had a bad time with a child psychiatrist my parents made me go to when I was in middle school - I developed severe anxiety and a subtype of OCD and was suicidal. I found out that she was in similar ideology group as them and would tell them everything I said in our sessions. So as you can imagine visiting her only made things worse for me. \n\nFourth - I don\u2019t mean to discount the good they\u2019ve done for me and what they\u2019ve invested in to me. But i do wonder if it\u2019s only shown as love now that they are retired and asking which kids will take care of them. But they\u2019ve never apologized for their actions. And attempts to talk in the past are quickly shut down and told it wasn\u2019t bad because they gave us \u201cx\u201d or \u201cy\u201d\n\nFifth (final): I have zero interest in having my own kids. But as for breaking the cycle - this is so important to me when dealing with my friendships and relationships. The fact I can\u2019t say \u201cI love you\u201d to other people\u2026lol yeah I need therapy.\n\nAgain I\u2019m just incredibly appreciative for everyone who has commented or taken anytime to read this long ass post.",

But i changed, and showed it through my actions. Now i acknowledge that and want to take it to the next level. Now i want to become a better person for myself and myself only before ever thinking about being in a relationship.

We\u2019ve been together for 7.\n\nSo I ask: if you have different values or very different personality than your partner, how did you make it work?\n\nInfo:\nHe enjoys simple pleasures and his routine of work, food, screentime. I get bored of routines.\n\nSome values dear to me are things like honesty, freedom, diligence. Work is important to me.\nHe values stability over all things. We define \u201dsuccess\u201d differently.\n\nWe used to work great, when our dynamic was so that I excited him to do stuff (see friends/do activities/try foods/travel etc)\nAnd he enjoyed it (even though he has a habit of excuses and some complaining, but I have never forced him to do anything. In fact he\u2019s said that he actually fell in love because of the passion behind my eyes.)\n\nI feel we started drifting apart when I had to work on my mental health and I stopped organizing things. Pandemic affected things too obviously.\n\nI have battles with myself, with my lack of career growth and bad procrastination. I wanted to start avoiding tv and play less videogames to see if it would help.\nFinding common interests started being difficult.\n\nWe are getting older and he also has an increasing amount of ailments which can prevent doing physical activities.\nNothing too serious, but he is easy to get sick, he gets a headache every time it rains, backpains, a chronic wound on his foot keeps opening and prohibits jogging and so on.\n\nDoing stuff together was a big part of our chemistry, especially because my love language is quality time.\n\nI do want stimulating conversation as well, but he is not the type to join that.\nEven our bedroom preferences are misaligned for crying out loud.\n\nCommunication is not always very fluent, although we have invented tools to help us. We are actively working on this.\nHe clams up easily and I have a short fuse. I like my communications honest and direct, but he can be confused and mix up concepts or words. I tend to overthink. Neither of us are good at \u201dreading between the lines\u201d.\nHe doesn\u2019t like to dwell on past or bad stuff. I suffer without closure (if not solving a fight, or if pretending nothing happened etc).\n\nHe tries his best. He is the most loyal person, and clearly capable of unconditional love. I have been difficult, but he still wants to be on my side. He was very hurt when I thought he didn\u2019t want to do stuff with me, so he clearly enjoys doing stuff with me. It\u2019s just hard to find common ground.\nHe takes care of me in the ways he knows how and makes me breakfast every morning. We work well when we have good days. I love him when he acts mature. \n\nI am scared that our differences are too big to work long-term. And what if we have kids?\n\nI fear that his laid back lifestyle holds me down.\n\nI fear that his best is not enough for me.\nRandom example. He loves swimming. He will join me for a lake swim but only for 2mins. It is amazing he joins even when he is a bit scared of natural bodies of water\u2026 but it\u2019s not like we get to swim together.\nSwim halls are a no go too.\n\nOr, maybe I just need to cure myself from a case of judgemental asshole?\n\nMaybe I am incapable of long-lasting love, because I get bored of things?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just that I am unhappy about myself and my work and that is making me miserable, and I project too much.\n\nI have been overthinking this every single day for 3 years now and it has made me crazy. \n\nTL;DR: husband and I have very different life goals and values.

        "content": "Hello,\n\nI think I'm a manipulative person in romantic relationships, and I'd like to stop. I've been diagnosed with CPTSD and OCD, and am in therapy. I'm 26F.\n\nI was in an abusive relationship for my first relationship for 2.5 years and grew up in an abusive home. I've struggled with coming to terms with my part in the first relationship, because I'm so filled with guilt and shame. I half apologized for my part. They didn't apologize for theirs, but I regret not taking full accountability. They were emotionally, physically and sexually abusive. I lied to them about having a thyroid problem instead of saying I had mental illness, and when they threatened to leave or would leave, I'd say I was feeling worse than I was or go into a crisis, because I didn't want them to leave. I got to the point of feeling like I couldn't live without them, I was worthless without them, and that no one else could ever love me. They saw I was lying and said I was a parasite, and that they thought they loved me, but I was the same as them and they were done with me.\n\nI later sent the half apology and they ghosted me. I was toxic in my own way.\n\nI've gone over it in therapy, the manipulative parts, but I still feel like there's something wrong with me. They said CPTSD can overlap with BPD a lot and that there can be fear of abandonment in romantic context. I don't have it with friends or family, just romantic relationships.\n\nI have trouble with it still, because I still get this urge to contact them and send them a full apology at times. I won't do it, but I'm scared, because I think it's still this manipulative control thing. Where I somehow want them to still be in my life. It looks like they've moved on and got their life together and I really haven't. I had to drop university to go into hospital for treatment, I had one 9 month relationship but ended it out of feeling like I wasn't well enough and that it would be bad for both sides. I did way better in it, but still didn't feel ready and didn't want to be hurtful to the other person.\n\nAt the same time, I'm scared, because I also had an urge to send an apology to them, along with explanations of all the things I couldn't tell them. That I was abused in my family, that I was abused in my first relationship, that I was manipulative, just revealing all these things. Which also feels manipulative because the purpose feels beyond apologizing. I keep bringing it up in therapy, and they said manipulation is trying to fill a need in a not straightforward way, and that I have the kind that isn't calculated, but comes from high emotional distress. I know intention is different than impact. I'm just struggling with what's wrong with me and what it means, that I still have this want to maybe manipulate a person or want them to see me in a good light maybe? Or want to redeem myself selfishly? With a person from years ago.\n\nOr that I'm so messed up that I'm somehow still emotionally dependent on them and wasn't strong enough to fully move on with my life. I'd like to make this stop, and am scared something's being missed in therapy. I don't know if other people with CPTSD struggle with this too or if this is more on the BPD end? Thank you in advance for any advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- Diagnosed CPTSD and OCD 26F in therapy. Was manipulative with lying and being in crisis so the other person wouldn't leave in an abusive relationship. They were physically, emotionally and sexually abusive, but I was  manipulative and still feel manipulative urges. I'm scared something is missing in my diagnosis. I still have the urge to send an \"apology\" to my abusive ex. I also feel urges to send an \"apology\" and explanations of me being abused in my upbringing to maybe elicit sympathy and less accountability from my last partner. Feel manipulative when in high distress and seek rescuer. Hoping for advice.",

        "content": "Over the past few months, I\u2019ve realized my boyfriend of 4 years is not \u201cthe one\u201d for me. Our day-to-day life is honestly perfect, he is my best friend, adores me and treats me like a queen. However, for a MULTITUDE reasons I\u2019m not getting into here, I am increasingly confident this relationship has run its course for me.\n\nWe have lived together the past two years, and are currently in a 1-bedroom lease until August 2022. We\u2019re in a high COL city, and I work a demanding in-person job, so it is not an option for me to break the lease/move forward with breaking up before August (I have a summer break).\n\nI brought up my discontent with the relationship a couple months ago, and it turned into a long, *very* emotional discussion where I said I was going to reconsider the status of our relationship at the end of our lease, and he essentially said he was going to try to do everything he could change my mind.\n\nWe haven\u2019t broached the subject since then, but I confidently believe that I want to move forward with the breakup. He cannot afford our current place on his own (his parents live here, so he'd either move in with them or find roommates, both of which he is very capable of doing), so it is likely he moves out and I will stay and pay 100% of the rent (which unfortunately will be 50% of my income but I can\u2019t emotionally, physically, or financially afford to move in this city either).\n\nMy question is: **now that I\u2019ve personally come to terms with this decision, when should I break the news to him?**\n\nOn the surface, our relationship is fine, we get along great and have a nice day-to-day vibe. Because of this, the last time I expressed how I felt, it almost seemed like he was in denial about my feelings. It would be ideal if I could just rip the bandaid off and break up now, but if I told him now about ending things in August, he would fight that decision and definitely wouldn't want to move out early, so it would be basically me dropping depressing news, then us living under that cloud together for the next 7 months.\n\nI don't want that, but I also know he deserves ample time to make other plans for August, so when is the best time to break the news? 1-2 months before? 5 months? This is obviously not an ideal situation, but it is truly not an option to end things before August. Has anyone else been in a similar situation, knowing a breakup will happen months before it actually can? Any advice about all this would be greatly appreciated. Ty!\n\n**TL;DR:** I don't want to move forward with my relationship after our current lease ends. I'm happy living with him until then, so when is the best time to break the news?",

        "content": "Using a throwaway to avoid compromising personal info.\n\nTLDR: Very emotionally tumultuous back and forth involving a breakup and reconciliation. This is not stable for me and I would like to know if I should cut contact/any other steps.\n\nTimeline is:\n\nWed 29/12: My gf messages me and says \"We need to talk\". We arrange a time and she says that she wants closure, she wants to be able to talk to other guys that she is being introduced to by her parents (she comes from culture where this is the norm for a girl her age) without having me on her mind. She claims that I'm always on her mind and this is stopping her from giving the other guys a fair chance. She then goes on to say that she is toxic, \"its not you, its me\", but that this is the last time we'll be talking to each other. I'm completely shocked at all of this, and I give her a chance to say whatever she wants to without interrupting. At the back of my mind, I am wishing that she would have said \"its not you, it's me, but I want to be a better partner FOR YOU\", but she doesn't. I admit to her that our situation is not stable and we should not talk to each other anymore and move on. She says that she hasn't got closure and throws a mini tantrum at which stage I end the call and say bye.\n\nThurs 30/12: She messages again saying we need to talk. I reply saying what do you want to say? She replies: \"A lot of things\".  We have an 8 hour call that night. She says that she had an \"epiphany\" from last night, that she can't imagine being with anyone other than me, and that she has constantly turned down the other guys that have been introduced by her parents. I think (at that moment) that she genuinely cares for me but still feel that this erratic behaviour is not suitable for a future where we are both looking to settle down, and mention this to her, and say that I don't think we are right for each other. Conversation kept going and we started talking about why erratic behaviour exists in relationships, she mentions \"some people have daddy issues\" and I ask her insensitively and slightly joking whether she has daddy issues. She ends up crying profusely saying \"I can't believe you said that, I liked the wrong guy (i.e. me)\" etc, I apologise again and again, and stay with her on the phone while she calms down because I am genuinely apologetic and realise the comment was insensitive. I care for her so much and do not want to see her hurt or suffer. Eventually she falls asleep and I end the call.\n\nFriday 31/12: I message her asking if she was okay. She replies saying I'm not but what are you going to do about it. I call her feeling guilty about my actions last night and we get talking. She mentions that I am only calling because I pity her, I tell her that I want to make sure that she's okay, that I feel a sense of responsibility towards her, to make sure she is okay regardless whether we are together or not. We continue talking and I try to console and comfort her. She mentions that she wants us to get back together, I get upset at this and tell her that I found it so hurtful that she would immediately jump to \"lets breakup\" rather than \"lets fix it\". I told her that I had been putting in the most effort in the relationship to keep us together and she has not done much. I tell her that I have constantly felt unappreciated in the relationship and that I have always faced criticism about my shortcomings, but never any compliments for my strengths and the things I have done for her. I tell her that I have made a very crucial mistake in the relationship by forgiving all the times she has hurt me, and come back to her. She responds to this by saying that I am right about that. She shifts the blame of the phone call on Wednesday onto me by saying why didn't you talk to me, I provide context to this by saying I had sent messages to her over the last month or so but that I was busy and from her single line responses/and lack of trying to push convo forward she was either busy or going through a rough period (which has happened before and I sort of keep a bit of distance without being clingy). I tell her this and I ask her simply why she didn't keep in more contact with me by calling or texting me first, and she doesn't respond. I end the call as I have to drive. She calls me later and we start talking again. She says that I never called her hot/beautiful when we went out in the past, again highlighting my shortcomings. Start sidenote: This is patently not true, because I remember a number of times complimenting how she looked by saying you look great, i love your dress etc. Yes I don't mention how great she looks every second, and I have mentioned to her in the past as well that despite her good looks, I always like to compliment her other strengths (that she is smart, driven, she inspires me, she is a good natured person etc) because I want her to know that I don't like her just because she is beautiful, but that she is more than that ! End sidenote. She says after criticising me that she appreciates how I have been there for her (single line). The convo drags on and she then she starts speaking from a note that she had written saying how I was always the one she wanted to be with, she had kept all the gifts/letters I had written for her from the first time we went out, that she didn't want to have any regrets later on in life about not saying this, and that this time she wanted me to be breaking her heart. I am stunned by all of this and she finishes reading this. My brain is absolutely scattered by this nights events and the past couple of days and I think about what to say that would both be genuine but at the same time I feel like I am walking on eggshells. I don't say anything for a few minutes, feeling guilty that I do not see a future long term with this instability despite her reading from this note and saying how she truly felt for the first time since we started seeing each other 5 years ago. She says that my silence is breaking her heart and that at least she wouldn't have regrets because I was the one who called it quits. I tell her that I really appreciate her telling me this from the note because I know how difficult it is for her to open up, and that she really means the world to me and that I care for her immensely. We end the call.\n\nProblem now: My brain is absolutely scattered. I can't handle this amount of instability and feel that this is detrimental to my work which requires a high amount of focus (I am a lawyer). I genuinely care for her but this pattern of instability is not new. In the past she has \"broken up\" with me because I have opened another person's snap (on snapchat) before hers, and she didn't want to talk to me after that because she didn't want me to \"change her mind\". We have gone long periods (4 months +) in the past without talking to each other but we still sort of return to each other. I believe I am a forgiving person, but it is very difficult for me to forgive someone who threatens to breakup with me, completely discounting all the times we have been together. In March a similar fight happened where she said \"she didn't want to be attached to me\" and I asked her to tell me that I meant something to her, that I was worth fighting for, and she kept completely silent! This was so hurtful and I brought it up in further convos but she evaded the topic, and I let it slide.\n\nI have tried to express to her how much I care for her and how much she means to me through letters, romantic gifts and gestures, giving her words of affirmation, spending quality time etc. However, I feel that the effort has not been reciprocated equally. Her response to this is that she \"stays up to speak to me\" and has \"turned down other guys her parents have introduced\" for me. I appreciate this but I question if this is enough for me to get married to someone. I am also at mistake for believing her behaviour would change, there was very little change over the years that I have known her. Prior to Thursday's call, when I asked her why she wants to be with me, she has said its because she is comfortable with me and that I understand her. I don't want to be just her therapist (that's what this feels like), I want to be more than that. I have gone through many years of questioning what I mean to her, and clinging on to the hope that I mean something (probably due to my self esteem which has hit rock bottom over the past few years). I feel like I deserve better, but part of me also feels that maybe something is wrong with me ... that I am not a good enough partner for her (and of course I want to be).\n\nShe has faced childhood trauma in the past, which she has not told me but I have found out from someone else. Her dad cheated on her mom and they still stayed together after that. She has not seen a therapist and I believe she has a dismissive-avoidant/ fearful avoidant, her childhood had many occasions of her parents not providing her adequate care and love.\n\nI don't know what to do, but I am unable to compartmentalise my thoughts about her and not let it affect my work performance. I want to provide her support and care because I feel that no one has given her that support, and that genuinely deep down she is a good person. I also feel that cutting contact with her would help me focus more on my occupation and myself and get my life in order. Please help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT #1: Thank you all for your help. Just to clarify when she said \"I liked the wrong guy\" she meant she thought I was the wrong guy because I was insensitive with my comment on the daddy issues thing",

He is an absolute sweetheart, spoils me and does everything that I would want. We have been together for a year and a half.

My mum just had my 2nd brother 2 months ago. Theres no space in the 2 bedroom apartment for 5 people and a dog. She wants me to move out when I have the funds to support myself. Which I completely understand. I\u2019ve mentioned moving out to my boyfriend a lot of times throughout of 2021. He tells me he isnt ready to move out at all. At one point he is and others he isnt. He is comfortable where he is now and I dont think he wants to change that anytime soon, his friends are all there and he has the time of his life living in the barracks.

I\u2019ve told him that I\u2019m going to be moving jobs and that didnt sit right with him. The job in question is a Film Industry delivery job, which my stepdad runs. The only way he will support me is if I start studying while I\u2019m working. And i had to promise him that!\n\nHe doesnt really think about the future, kinda lives in the moment.\n\nThere was a point where we nearly broke up because of a massive argument we had about this issue. Also to add i\u2019m his first ever serious girlfriend. I mean my family likes him and his family likes me. However, my stepdad thinks I need a slightly older guy and someone who has already got a stable good job. My head is 50/50 and i really dont know what to do. I dont want to break up with him but at the same time I feel like I do. Ive never been single for more than a few months at a time.\n\nAny advise would be great.\n\nTL;DR: I feel like breaking up with my boyfriend due to having a voice in the back of my head telling me to do so and that I should\u2019ve stayed single for a little longe.

She understands me and gets me better than anyone else in my life, and I her. We are very close and open with each other, and I see her in my future.\n\nHowever, over the past couple weeks I've started to doubt my own feelings for her. There was no trigger, we have never had an argument, and I cannot find a reason for me to feel this way. I still enjoy my time with her and find great comfort being around her. But I don't really long for her or miss her when she isn't around anymore, but this feeling was also the case in a previous relationship. We still carry on our relationship as usual (at least, as best i can) and to anyone outside of the relationship it would all seem completely normal.\n\nBut this doubt can sometimes completely consume me and worrying about it has sometimes made me feel physically sick and sometimes brought about a loss of appetite. The feelings usually lead to thoughts that I should break up with her if I don't love her enough, but I do not want that. Ive done hours upon hours of reading online about relationship anxiety, ROCD, the honeymoon phase, and various posts on here or Quora from people feeling the same way I do. One blog on relationship anxiety asked \"When you are in an anxiety-free state of mind, would you walk away from the relationship if there were to be no consequences?\" and I absolutely wouldn't.\n\nI have never been diagnosed with any mental health problems, but I have had a hunch that I may have suffered from social anxiety in the past. After reading multiple accounts of people feeling this way due to anxiety or depression I took a number on online tests which stated that I may suffer from mild anxiety. I of course don't take this as a diagnosis and have booked sessions with a counsellor to talk out my thoughts in person to a professional. Ultimately my biggest fear in posting here or going to talk to someone is that they will tell me the doubts are true and that I should end the relationship. Again, I don't want that.\n\nI have read up on various websites and blogs and am accepting of the theory that long-term love is a choice rather than the initial feeling of falling in love. When I'm with my girlfriend the acts of love I do for her like kissing her, hugging her, or getting things she wants or needs don't feel deliberate. They don't feel like a deliberate choice like \"well if love is a choice i better do these things for her\" they are just natural. But it makes me question my own sanity, am I lying to myself? Would I do the things that i do for her for anyone?\n\nMy current theory is that given the timeline, our honeymoon phase has ended and the initial excitement (which I may have wrongly thought of as love) has dissipated. The change to a deeper more natural form of almost subconscious love may have triggered my anxiety and has caused me to question if I really do love her now that I no longer have the feeling of magical sparkly limerence as physical proof. And this anxiety has just sent me into a whirlwind of worry and intrusive thoughts.\n\nWe have talked about it at length together and I am willing to put in the work that a relationship requires for things to work. During the summer we would regularly go on dates and day-trips to various places around the city but now with college we tend to just hang out at my place or hers. But we have had a couple of nights-out together, she has been across the country with me to meet my family in the past few weeks, and we have done things that involve both of our friend groups, So I'm not sure if we really are just breeding boredom.\n\nIf it is relevant, I was previously in a 3 year relationship that ended a couple of years ago. The girl slowly came to a realisation in the last 6 months that she was gay. When we finally did break up we stayed close friends, I didn't feel too bothered about it until I seen her with a girl on a night out a month later. That was when the reality of it finally hit me, needless to say it broke my heart and it really took a year for me to get to a point where I wouldn't cry thinking about it. Maybe this past experience is affecting me in a way I'm not entirely conscious of.\n\nI thank all of you in advance for reading this and any advice you may have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Questions feelings for my girlfriend even though she is perfect in any way and our relationship is very healthy. May be an anxious reaction to the end of the honeymoon phase\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : I should note, I felt this way for about a week in mid-november but it kind of just went away for a couple weeks (not 100% entirely, I was still aware of the thoughts I had had and fearful they would come back) before rearing its ugly head again.",

        "content": "TLDR: I have a situation-ship with Ex-boyfriend (we both see a future with each other just can\u2019t be together right now) where we\u2019re single but see each other when we can and act like the couple we used to be. He\u2019s going travelling for 6 months starting next week, and we agreed we\u2019d try to become official again when he comes back. We\u2019ll probably sleep with other people in the mean time, but now I\u2019ve let myself keep loving him I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve become too attached to someone I can\u2019t even be with yet. Was this a good idea or am I setting myself up for pain? What do I do?\n\n\nBoyfriend and I recently ended things, it was an extremely mutual \u2018right person wrong time\u2019 breakup and felt like the right thing to do since we drifted apart and didn\u2019t want to ruin our connection by dragging it on. He is also going away for 6 months on a gap year and I didn\u2019t wanna stop him getting other sexual experiences whilst he has the chance. Now if you\u2019ve ever broken up with someone, you\u2019ll be familiar with that instant feeling of regret when the breakup actually sinks in - suddenly you want them back and want everything to go back to normal with them. Everyone knows getting broken up with sucks, but I feel like no one really warns you will happen or how to react when there\u2019s a very healthy and mutual breakup. \n\nAnyway, after spending a couple of days crying and feeling terrible, like I\u2019d done the wrong thing because I really do see a future with this guy, we had a phone call and arranged to meet. In person, we came to a conclusion that whilst there\u2019s a lot of stuff we\u2019d need to work on before becoming official again, we\u2019d both like to see each other without any labels. We agreed we could act like a couple (have sleepovers, dates, sex, romantic stuff etc) but I\u2019m allowed to see/get with other people and so is he until he comes back from his travels when we try to make it official again.\nSo far, it\u2019s gone really well. I\u2019ve kissed a couple other people, he hasn\u2019t, but we don\u2019t really talk about the specifics. We just see each other every couple weeks and it\u2019s really nice and romantic just without the pressure of a relationship.\n\nHe goes away on travels in a week, and it\u2019s starting to hit me how unhealthy this \u2018agreement\u2019 may be. If he\u2019s allowed to go and have sex with whoever and go on dates with whoever for the next 6 months whilst abroad, what if he realises he doesn\u2019t want me anymore? Then I\u2019m just left here alone and broken. What if he has better sex and realises being single is what he wants? I keep overthinking, and I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve done the right thing by seeing each other before he leaves, or whether it\u2019s even a good idea to try again when he gets back. What should I do?",

        "title": "Should I (19M) cut off my friend (19M) after he leaves for the military?",
        "content": "I no longer feel as safe around him as I did before.\n\nWe have been friends since high school. But what brought us together was that we were both not just in band, but also romantically frustrated teenagers who had bad experiences with romance in high school.\n\nI had several crushes on girls in high school and none of them liked me back, some of whom even blocked me on social media, (I'm not justifying what I did or pointing fingers at anyone else, I'm just explaining what happened.) and in the immediate aftermath I blamed the people around me instead of looking myself in the mirror. Similarly, his first girlfriend broke up with him over a rumor that caused him to get kicked out of band.\n\nI remember during the quarantine when we were confiding in each other about our romantic struggles. I remember when we would both talk trash about the rest of the band kids and blame other people about our romantic struggles. I remember when we we would talk bad about the girl in our high school band who had a string of relationship after relationship, or the boy who dated half the girls in the band, or whoever we wanted to blame for our struggles, without pointing the fingers at ourselves and identifying our own problems so we could change ourselves for the better. This bond was so strong that he's now my roommate this year.\n\nIn the beginning of 2021 I decided to change for the better. I decided to practice good social skills, listen to other people during conversation, and learn about them by talking to people in my classes so I could become a better conversationalist. I decided to talk to girls, and people in general, so I could learn how to talk to girls and people in general. I decided not to make dating a top priority for the first time in years, so I could be free and happy and just have fun without getting anything in return. I have learned several things about dating, girls, friendships, and relationships that helped me gain a healthier perspective on these things, such as the fact that girls are actual people and not objects who I can just do what I want with, the fact that no one owes me anything and no one is obligated to reciprocate my romantic interests, I should not expect any relationship in return at all, and dating and relationships won't solve all my problems.\n\nI would say that it worked. I have made so many new friends this year alone. I feel so much better not being so bent on trying to enter a relationship for the first time in years. I have actually had so much fun this year just talking to people and taking whatever opportunities that life has in front of me. \n\nBut now when I talk to him I don't feel as safe with him as I did before. He sometimes gives me rides to band practice and he always gives angry rants in the car when he drives. One time he ranted about wanting to kick out one of our other roommates because he ate his eggs, or turned the thermostat down during the winter, or not taking out the trash, as opposed to actually talking to him about it. He has made fun of me when I made mistakes during band practices, and when I asked him not to do that he became defensive. He even told some of our group that \"he was more blunt than in high school\" and \"he will just say whatever he wants and doesn't care about anyone's feelings.\"\n\nI also feel like he has a sexist and defeatist view on girls/dating/relationships. One time he told me that he saw one of our old high school bandmates on Tinder, and said she has now been reduced to a \"basic sorority girl.\" Another time he made fun of another old bandmate who now wears \"basically nothing.\" When he brought up the subject of dating, he told me the other person is different once you actually get to know them in a relationship, and when the subject of dating was brought up in our group chat, he said that \"soulmates are the worst\" and then everyone asked if he was all right. He also rants a lot about his past romantic struggles. I do understand that they suck, but this screams to me that he hasn't actually moved on from them, since that time and energy could be spent on more productive things.\n\nI feel like he is insecure and is trying super hard to put up protective walls around himself, as opposed to being honest with himself and looking at himself in the mirror so he can improve himself as a person. I seriously believe he should seek therapy, pursue a productive hobby, or build some self-awareness instead of making fun of everyone around him.\n\nI don't like his negative rants because it's giving me the impression that anything will piss him off. It makes me feel sad when those rants are directed towards me. Since I want to become a positive person who just wants to have fun at life and maintain a positive outlook, I don't want to become dragged down by negative people who actively reinforce that negativity. I also don't like his sexist/defeatist views about girls, dating, and relationships. It makes me uncomfortable when he talks about girls as objects and portraying dating as something that's completely hopeless. Considering that I have had problems with romantic attraction and having crushes in the past, I do not want to become re-infected by those beliefs.\n\nI'm so glad I have made so many friends with other people in 2021. When I'm talking to my other friends I feel much safer being around them. I don't have to worry about pissing anyone off or anyone judging me. I could just act like my carefree self, talk to anyone, reinforce good social skills and dating strategies, and generally just have fun and maintain a positive attitude. But when I'm around him I feel like having to navigate a long corridor filled with tripwires. Because I feel like anything I do could send him into a long winded rant directed against me, and cause him to reinforce negative views about dating, relationships, and girls.\n\nHe's leaving for the military for next year and I wish him the best of luck there. This would also mean he would no longer be around to torment me, and I could focus my time and energy on productive hobbies and people who actually want to lift me up, instead of people who want to demean me and push me down.\n\nI no longer feel like he actually wants to be my friend anymore. It seemes to me like he's trying to take advantage of me, or at least gains pleasure from pushing me down so he could lift himself up. Not only do I want to become a better person myself, but I also want to surround myself with people who want to lift me up and promote a positive outlook on life, rather than people who demean me, push me down, and people who reinforce toxic views about other people. Again, I have had problems with romantic attraction in the past and I don't want these incidents to happen ever again. I'm afraid of people like him infecting me with these negative and sexist views about girls, dating, and relationships.\n\nI really hope he looks himself at the mirror and acknowledges his wrongdoings so he can change himself for the better.\n\nShould I cut my friend off after he leaves for the military? I don't want to do it before he leaves because he's my roommate as I said before and that might cause animosity between us. But imo after he leaves for the military might be a good time to cut him off because he wouldn't physically be around to torment me.\n\nTL;DR: We became friends because we were both romantically frustrated teenagers who had romantic struggles in the past. Now I don't feel safe with him anymore because I feel like he's constantly negative and this is sometimes directed towards me. I also feel like he maintains a sexist and defeatist view on dating, relationships, and girls. Now I want to change myself for the better and become a positive, carefree person who has fun and maintains a positive outlook on life, as well as improve my social skills and gain a healthier perspective on dating, girls, relationships, and romances, and I don't want to be around anyone who actively reinforces toxic mindsets about these areas.",

        "content": "Our relationship started a little over a year ago as something casual. I caught feelings, as one party typically does, while he openly told me about other women he liked. It hurt like hell. Eventually he realized he was hurting me and broke up with me after 5 months which seemed like a good decision.\n\nI recognized this but was still devastated so in the following 2-3 months I did some pretty self-destructive stuff. I had sex with men for money and something really bad happened to me at one point, after which I stopped. Then my ex and I met again, he told me he was sorry and had made a mistake. He wanted a real relationship with me. I felt unsure and confused about it but couldn\u00b4t resist. So we basically jumped into it head first.\n\nThe next 3 months or so with him were both exhausting and great in a way. He seemed serious about it all, however we did have conflicts as we are extremely different from each other, him being often painfully direct, very full of criticism and on some occasions downright verbally abusive. I, on the other hand, was and am struggling with my mental health, lack of self love, and I\u00b4m extremely low energy due to chronic diseases whereas he\u00b4s super active. I hadn\u00b4t told him about what I had done between the times we were dating and when I finally did, he was furious, didn\u00b4t talk to me for 3 weeks and then broke up with me.\n\nFast forward another couple of months and we\u00b4re back to talking. I still like him a lot and he tells me he\u00b4s been missing me more than anyone ever. He has had casual sex and an fwb during this time which, in and of itself, isn\u00b4t much of an issue to me, however I find it hypocritical of him as he judged me so harshly for my own actions.\n\nI have a feeling that our relationship requires a ton of work in order to not become as toxic as it has been before. But now each of us knows the other\u00b4s deepest darkest secrets and we want each other more than ever. Yesterday we kissed again for the first time and it was so nice. He\u00b4s doing his absolute best to show me he\u00b4s being serious and I want it to work so badly but I\u00b4m just not sure if I can do this again...\n\nTL;DR: My ex and I are both pretty effed-up people who have separated twice under effed-up circumstances but we can\u00b4t let go of each other and I\u00b4d love some input as to whether or not you guys think we (or any couple for that matter) can possibly make it work the third time around.",

        "content": "so I (19F) met my now boyfriend (19M) back in late august when I moved into my college dorm. he lives in the same building as me, so we became friends. a few weeks later, we became friends with benefits, no feelings involved whatsoever. he is the only person I've been with where we had a genuine, stable friendship outside of the sex.\n\nalthough, the more time that I spent with him, I realized that I was slowly developing feelings for him. and it wasn't because of the sex, but I genuinely liked him as a person. he is a smart, charismatic, funny individual whose presence is so enjoyable. however, at the time I wasn't really looking for a relationship, so I didn't take things too seriously.\n\nnow, here's where things get a little...iffy. one night in october, my roommate, my bf, a friend of mine, and myself all got very drunk in my dorm room. it was a fun, lighthearted night until things took a turn. my bf (who wasn't my bf at the time yet) was VERY intoxicated, the most intoxicated out of the four of us. I don't remember exactly how this happened, but I remember seeing him get into my roommate's bed with her where they started making out and cuddling. my friend had left at this point so it was just the three of us. I was like \\*surprised pikachu face\\* because the two of them together was such a random combination, but I didn't care for it at the time. I didn't think twice about it.\n\na couple weeks passed and I realized my feelings for him were growing stronger by the day. you ever have a relationship with someone that started off as a joke and then all of the sudden it's not a joke anymore? that's exactly how things were. \n\nI remember one day while me and my roommate were just chilling on our beds, I confessed to her that I liked my bf. like, REALLY liked him. she was ecstatic because she was glad I found someone I liked after the disaster that was my last relationship (that's a story for another time), especially someone like my bf who was a very genuine guy (like I previously stated). the events that occurred just a couple weeks prior wasn't even brought up.\n\nhim and I confessed to each other as well, and we started to progress our relationship until he finally asked me out. around this time, me, my roommate, and him were super tight, like a little trifecta. the three of us were always together having a good time, and I never suspected a thing. until, well...\n\nI don't exactly remember how this happened either, but my roommate started spending a lot of time with a new friend group, which I didn't have a problem with at all. although, it slowly became a problem when she would invite my bf to hang out with them, but not me. \n\nat first, it wasn't much of a problem at all. I had my own friend group outside of them that I was perfectly happy with, and I was also spending a lot of time with my bf as well, which was a good balance. however, my roommate started prying my bf away from me more and more. \n\nIt started when she would barge into my bf's room when she knew we were hanging out together, and would pry him to go hang out with their new friends to the point where he had no other choice. saying  things like, \"we gotta go, hurry tf up\", and \"come on, don't be a r\\*tard and come\" and would just completely disregard my presence.\n\nthis started happening all the time and I was getting extremely frustrated and upset. one night, I was outside of my building with my friends when I saw my roommate, my bf, and their new crew all come out of the building, and she was being VERY touchy with my bf. he didn't reciprocate but for some reason, it sent me over the edge and I ran inside and started bawling my eyes out. my friends followed me to my room where they comforted me, and all of the sudden I found myself confessing to them about what happened between her and my bf that one night in october.\n\nI didn't want to believe that my roommate, someone I trusted, may or may not be purposely prying my bf away from me for some unknown reason, but as the days went on, I started to run out of choices. whenever I talked about him, she wasn't as ecstatic as she used to be, and would act stoic, even. she would try to find excuses for them to hang out alone KNOWING that it made me uncomfortable, and would constantly use him to drive her around, get food, be her therapist, take her to get her belly button pierced? and she also bought him a bottle of hennessy with a note attached to it? she posted tiktoks of them alone together too, and she never said one thing to me about it. \n\none day, I had a massive panic attack in front of my bf due to stress from academics and family issues and was not in a stable headspace at all. he was comforting me in my room when my roommate barged in and pulled the classic \"we gotta go, hurry tf up\" and started going on a tangent about something awfully stupid that happened to her that had nothing to do with the situation at hand. absolutely no ability to read the room. I remember giving her a death glare with eyes full of tears, and she didn't even bother to ask me if I was okay, disregarding my presence yet again. she dragged him out of the room and he came back a few minutes later to check on me, and told me he was sorry and continued to comfort me, but it wasn't long before she came back and forced him to go off with her and their friends for the night. I heard him yell at her, \"are you f\\*cking kidding me right now?\" \n\nwhen he came back, I confessed to him everything that I was bottling up inside for the past almost month at this point, and he apologized to me, insisting that their relationship was platonic. he told me that my feelings were 100% understandable and told me he would never cheat on me, because cheating is like \"punching a woman in the face\". he agreed with the fact that she has no sense of boundaries, and he said he tried to talk to her a few times about it, but she would dodge the subject every time. I believed my bf bc he never really reciprocated her energy and wasn't doing anything suspicious because 1. he's an awful liar 2. he's very, very brutally honest. everything was more on HER end.\n\nalthough, my suspicions about her, not even with my bf but just her having a problem with me in general were confirmed one night when I got very crossed with my friends. it was 1AM and I knew my bf was sleeping in his room with his roommate there, so obviously didn't want to barge in and bother them, so I stumbled to my room. however, the door was locked and I didn't have my key on me, and I knew that my roommate was in there, especially at this hour of the night. I started banging on the door and telling her to let me in, but no response. I banged on the door for about 5 minutes straight until my fist was red, and that's when I decided to go down to the front desk and get a loaner key. when I finally unlocked the door, it was pitch dark but she was in her bed with some guy, and I was furious. but, i was also too tired to cuss her out, so instead I didn't say a word to her and went straight to sleep.\n\nthe next day, my bf needed help with his math homework and gave me his computer to look at it. and this was when I did something I regret but also was glad that I did. my bf was doing other work at his desk away from me, so I decided to look through his messages between him and my roommate. let's just say I didn't have to scroll very far to see exactly what I needed to see. and NO, I didn't find out he was cheating on me, his messages to her were very dry and short but her on the other hand...\n\nall I saw was her telling him \"get her\" \"get her tf out\" \"get her out\" \"im naked and we're trying to eat\" \"bro I locked the door but that  b\\*tch got in here somehow\" and he said \"im sleeping, she lives there and she's not bothering you lol\". I put two and two together and realized she was talking about the night before when I was banging on the door telling her to let me in. I didn't even know she was gonna have someone over? and like my bf said, I LIVE THERE. it's a shared space. respect it, maybe?  and maybe like, say something to me if you're gonna have someone over? bc if you tell me beforehand I can make arrangements to sleep over a friend's or something? I pay to live in the dorm too?\n\nand that leads up to now. my bf still remains unsuspicious, and our relationship is amazing outside of the drama and I'm so glad that I have him. however, I haven't told him that I saw the messages but he knows that I have a lot of resentment towards my roommate and completely understands my feelings regarding the situation. although, I feel like I need to take bigger action regarding this situation, but I just am unsure of how to approach it? I'm thinking of having a genuine conversation with my bf about me not being comfortable with their friendship, and I know he would understand and keep his distance (they're in that friend group together still and I know that's not gonna change anytime soon). BUT, how do I deal with my roommate? I've talked to her about things like this before and it seems that she understands in the moment but nothing really changes after that. how do I deal with this in general? help me, reddit. if you've read all of this I really appreciate it btw!\n\nTL;DR - skim for more context because my summarization skills SUCK but my roommate, who was someone I trusted dearly, has a problem with me for some unknown reason and has been prying my bf away from me and interfering with my relationship with him. although she was initially supportive, her behavior towards him is suspicious while he remains unsuspicious and has been very honest and understanding of my feelings/thoughts. how do I deal with this?",

She has alcohol problem. While she was in my country it was mostly under the control. When she gets drunk she does following:\n\n1. Trys to pick a fight so hard it's incredible to describe. From total untruth's to things happened like 8 years ago to things she does but accusses me for.\n2. She does everything she  said she wouldn't, minor but still: hangs up suddenly, hurts me on purpose, she even pushed me once.\n3.

Even tho I would appriciate 1 dollar thing from her cause it's for her but I said np baby).\n\nThing is, just like day ago she told me how gifts are great.\n\nAt one moment while we voice I hear her little sister laughing. Sister that she told me bugs her so much and is very difficult.\n\nAt that moment I just went cold. I said: \"I see this is rather amusing, this emotional torture for you two. Again, presents, you can sell them or throw them away. One day it's great presents, other day they suck and are bullshit as you said. So, what's the truth then? This is ridicilous.\"\n\nI almost felt how this sliced her apart and sobered her up. She knew I knew she's doing this for fun.\n\nNext day I get the message: \" Hey I\u2019m sorry for being mean\n\nI have a lot of work to do on myself especially with alcohol\n\nI hope we can talk when I\u2019m better \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThing is, she's one of best people I know when she's sober. Alcohol totally makes become a demon.\n\nSo I was thinking about sending her a message. I want to support her and tell her I'm here, but also to show my huge tolerance is getting overloaded. I'm also heartbroken, especially cause she's destroying herself and can offer so much to the world. So I wrote this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I know better side of you and thats why im not giving up on you. All the problems can be solved if you are perssistent. And I'm ready to support you with that all the way.  \n\nBut you need to start now. No more sorries but just start doing it. No more destroyers of your body,  mind and soul. This world needs you Jen! It needs you sober so you can compliment it with your unique being, your art, your thoughts, your actions. You need yourself sober!  Jen,when you are sober, you are most amazing, sweetest, intelligent, beautiful, insightful person I've ever met in my life and I've met thousands of people. \n\nIt breaks my heart knowing beautiful future you can have. But it does not have to be this way, you can do this, I belive in you. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, what do you people think?\n\ntl:dr: Lovable relationship but alcohol stands in our way.

        "content": "I\u2019m a guy (25) and I\u2019m in a relationship with a girl (24). New Year\u2019s Eve we went to a house party together. This house party was hosted by a gay guy, so there were quite a lot of gay men here.\n\nSo at one point I start talking to this guy. We just chat about normal things at the beginning, then at one point he mentions he\u2019s gay. So here\u2019s the the thing; I would definitely consider myself straight. I\u2019ve never seen a man and felt sexual attraction towards them. But I do however, for whatever reason, enjoy watching gay porn occasionally, and I guess I\u2019m quite open minded, and I\u2019ve wondered in the past how it would be to explore things with a guy sexually.\n\nSo anyway, he says he\u2019s gay, but that he\u2019s also had sex with women and enjoys that too occasionally etc. So then he asks me about my sexuality. I tell him I\u2019m straight and I\u2019ve got a girlfriend. He asks if I\u2019ve ever had any experience with a guy, so I tell him that I kissed a guy once years ago, and that I do sometimes enjoy watching gay porn. But I also mention how I never feel sexually attracted to men in real life. I quite enjoy the conversation at this point because I don\u2019t really get to talk about these feelings with my friends or other straight guys.\n\nI was pretty drunk so dont remember exactly how the conversation went on, but I remember he mentioned how he thought I was attractive and him asking me like: so would you be open to explore things with a guy like me? So I said; well no, I\u2019ve got a girlfriend haha. And I clearly told him like: it\u2019s nothing personal, but you should know that nothing is going to be happening between me and you (the guy). \n\nSo he was like: I get that, but let\u2019s say you were single? So I just said like: I guess if I was single and drunk it could happen?\n\nThen he asked me if I wanted to see some videos of him fucking some guy on his phone, to which I kindly told him I wasn\u2019t interested. He asked me a few more times and even pulled out his phone trying to show me, but I just looked away and again told him it didn\u2019t feel right to be watching him fucking someone. So he said like: but I thought you liked gay porn? So I said like: yea sure but I am not interested in seeing yours. \nThen he said: there\u2019s nothing wrong with it since we\u2019re both just guys. So I saiid: yea but it\u2019s different cuz there\u2019s clearly some kind of sexual tension here that makes it feel wrong. So he asked like: do you think you could jerk off to my porn? So I said like: yea probably but I don\u2019t want to see it.\n\nSo then he proceeded to ask me how big my dick was. I said I\u2019m not going to tell you. He then said like: I guess it\u2019s X inches. So I said nah bigger man. Then he says like. Ok X inches. So again I said no. Then he said X inches (the correct size) and I just started laughing. So at this point I had become a bit uncomfortable with the conversation so I just excused myself and left. \n\nSo here\u2019s the thing. I made it pretty obvious I didn\u2019t want anything from him. But I still feel like, because I was drunk, I let this conversation carry on beyond what I would usually be comfortable with. And if this was a woman instead of a gay man, i never would\u2019ve been so open. But I guess because it was a (gay) man instead of a woman it felt more acceptable?\n\nSo yea I\u2019m sober now and have been overthinking this all day. I really don\u2019t know how to feel about it and I am worried that I kinda cheated on my gf by being so open and answering his questions and shit? How would you feel about this?\n\nTL:DR Got too drunk and too open and comfortable with a gay guy at a party",

When we started, he was my dream person, everything I could ask for in a partner, until I started noticing some aspects of his life that weren't all that good.\n\nHis behavior is always very childish, like being very agitated and playing around with everything, never being quiet, which may be fun at times, but in general, just annoys the fuck out of me. He is notionless about a lot of basic things in life, like good manners and stuff - for example, I always have to tell him to say hello or bye to others at family gatherings, and he doesn't understand why things like that should matter at all. He doesn't care what others think to the level that becomes uncomfortable.\n\nHis mother just won't let me go visit them, since they're poor and she is ashamed of her own house - and she won't change her mind. My parents find it strange that after three years, I haven't even once entered their home. My parents also don't really like him much, so he can barely come to my house too. We never had sex, and he doesn't ever seem to want to. It just feels like a relationship between two kids, while all other couples we know our age do some many more things together that we just can't. \n\nSo I don't think I want to be with him anymore, but I'm so anxious and scared about it because I know he loves me and wants to be with me, he is kind and loving.

        "content": "I know political content isn't allowed, but I promise this is relevant to the story: We're both activists, and we met 2 months ago through the organization we're part of. Because of the activities we do, we meet IRL fairly often, like once every week approximately. Every time we saw each other we would strike up a friendly conversation and ever since the first time we talked I felt like that conversation could progress into something more. \n\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago, I decided to shoot my shot and ask him out, and fortunately he said yes. In the week leading up to the date, we were texting constantly, something I took as a good sign of interest cause he mentioned he doesn't do well with social media. We even went as far as talking about astrological compatibility, showing each other our natal charts. \n\nSo this past Wednesday we went out to see a movie and grab drinks. I had a great time, we had plenty to talk about, our conversation flowed naturally as it always did and he seemed to have enjoyed himself as well. We didn't kiss, which I was bummed about, but understood completely. I figured he was shy/wanted to wait until a later date to do it. \n\nAs soon as I got home that night, I texted him to let him know I got home safe and he confirmed he had fun and thanked me. I responded saying \"I had a great time too, only thing that could've made it better was if we kissed\" just to be a little flirty. Much to my surprise, he messaged me back saying \"I suspected you were gonna say that, but I just wasn't in the mood today\" which to me was just a polite way of rejecting me. I simply replied with a \"That's okay\" but it actually felt like a direct punch to the gut. I felt so stupid cause everything up until that point felt like he was reciprocating my feelings. Might sound dramatic but I couldn't help but cry a little when I got that message.\n\nThat shifted my perspective on how the date went and I started over analyzing it. I guess I was so happy I got to spend one on one time with him that I didn't catch on to some obvious red flags: He mentioned his ex-girlfriend a few times, he talked about how he doesn't want kids when I mentioned I do, he talked about other people he's seeing and other people he's crushing on. That last part I was oblivious to cause he told he's non-monogamous, which I have no issue with and knew beforehand. Problem is that during the date he asked who was I crushing on, and when I gave a \"Duh, who do you think\" answer and didn't get one back, he proceeded to talk about his crush on this other girl from our organization (who is currently dating someone else I had a crush on, ffs). It's so awkward and frustrating to realize how naive I was right then.\n\nThe following days he kept talking to me as if nothing happened, which made me really confused. I mean like messaging me first, asking follow up questions, asking for pictures when I mentioned what I was doing (I've been redecorating my room so he was asking about that, no explicit photos or anything). \n\nI was getting fed up with that so last night I just straight up asked him what was going on between us, if I was right to assume he isn't into me or if he really just wasn't \"in the mood\" that specific day and could be potentially in another occasion. He answered in a cryptic way once again saying stuff like \"I really enjoy your company and I like talking to you and getting to know you\" so pressed further and asked if he meant as a friend. He said yes, and apologized for not being clear with his intentions and tried to move the conversation on but I quickly shut it down by accepting his apology and saying nothing else.\n\nThis morning he messaged me again, and again, was acting as if nothing really happened. I gave a short and to the point answer but now I'm thinking I shouldn't even have done that. This is really messing me up, I confided a lot of personal things to him in our conversations thinking it was gonna led to us growing closer as potential partners but now I'm anxious about what he's gonna do with that information. I don't think he's untrustworthy or anything, but I've had some trauma from past relationships and it's hard for me to open up to people, so realizing he's not interested in me kinda made me feel betrayed.\n\nAlso, logistically speaking, I still have to maintain a certain level of friendship and camaraderie with him since we're gonna continue on seeing and working with each other in the organization as soon as we come back from the end of the year break. So what should I do, just continue on with the short answers until he gets the hint? Or should I act like nothing happened just like he's doing?\n\nTL;DR: I went on a date with a colleague from the organization I'm a part of, we had a great time but he told me he wasn't in the mood for kissing during the date. I took that as a polite rejection, but he kept on giving me signs he was interested. I pressed on and he admitted he has no romantic feelings for me. What do I from here?",

Right after school we always hang out for 30min to an hour. Even after this he always complains that we never have enough time together. Then when we come home, we immediately have to call until we go to sleep. He always says I'm trying to limit our time together by spending it on school and other things because I've already expressed that I don't want to call when I'm doing homework. During school, he would message me a lot, and when I wouldn't respond since I would be doing my school work or talking to someone, he would get upset. He would say that if he's ever talking to anyone, and I messaged him, then he would drop what he was doing and reply to me. I apparently don't do this because I like to spend time with other people more, and I just didn't care enough.\n\nHe would always ask who I talked with, what I talked about, and how long I talked to them. If I talked to someone for too long he would get upset. This was really frustrating, I said I no longer wanted to text him during school because it made me very stressed and overwhelmed. He says that if he doesn't know what's going on or have every single detail, then he feels left out. He wouldn't be able to piece events together. I felt bad, so I compromised and said I can tell him what happened at school, after school. Now I have to write down every single thing I talk about within any conversation and tell him everything about it after school to make him satisfied. Even then, he said he's not even happy because I always miss out on details and information. This is all so exhausting for me. I really want to focus on school, but I'm already sacrificing so much with him. He says that I prioritize school over him, and he's not the first priority for me. To him, we never have enough time together, and I'm always trying to make it shorter. I honestly am more than happy with the time we have, and I'm not looking for more than this. Are his needs valid? I know I have control over my own life and decisions, and he has no right to my conversations, but doesn't that make him the one who always has to compromise? I never ask or expect any of this from him, but he says it's because I simply don't care about it. If I did, he would always report back to me on what he did at all times.\n\nHe also doesn't like it when I hang out with friends without him, because he feels left out. He doesn't like it when I make new memories when he's not there. Sometimes I want space, and I suggested that we should have a break from each other for a week or so. He said he can't do it, and he would break down. If I ever did that, I would be destroying him. I've been really trying to understand what boundaries are and how to make them clearer with him, but I really don't know-how. For instance, when should I compromise, and when should I not?\n\nWhen I tell him plans for something, like \"tomorrow I will be going out with my sister to do x,y, and z\", and they don't go as planned, he gets really upset at me and calls me a liar. He says that I should've tried to make what I told him true, and if I didn't put in the effort to do that, then that means I lied. He says it's like saying I wouldn't cheat on him, and then I cheated. I mean I get what he's saying, but I still feel kind of upset at him when he says that. Is it normal?\n\nHe even admits it himself that he can be controlling but struggles to change those certain behaviors. He says he doesn't know-how, and if he could he would.

        "content": "TL;DR: My partner is overweight, doesn't like it, but keeps sabotaging my efforts to help her lose weight. I'm not sure if I should do more to help, or less.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've been together now for 5 months, and she's already moved in with me, which is a bit quicker than I'd normally go but her options were kinda limited... in brief: she's a legal immigrant with a passable-at-best grasp of English (at the time), and practically homeless due to falling out with her family (for good reason, they're homophobic assholes). She had a part time job, but couldn't afford rent and bills by herself and she struggled to find people to share rent with (she can be a bit... er... challenging at times if you don't know her well and as mentioned her English isn't perfect yet so sometimes she literally says things she doesn't actually mean - frequently humorous, sometimes offensive if you don't know the situation). We get on really well though, so it felt like a good idea all around for her to move in (and so far, it has been).\n\nHer job is now full-time (hospitality industry) and she's getting back on her feet (one could argue, getting on her feet for the first time). She's mostly done this on her own, fwiw, though obviously having a home helped. I don't want to give the impression that I've 'saved' her or anything. I didn't know about her situation until we'd been on a few dates and realised that we liked each other a lot.\n\nAnyway. The main problem is that she hates her body; thinks she's fat, ugly and generally undesirable. Most of the time she seems happy and 'herself', but any time we're intimate together or she's in a situation where she's not wearing her usual jeans and hoody combo, I can tell she's uncomfortable (even when we're alone). I love the way she looks, I have zero problem, however objectively she's overweight (5'3, 225lbs or thereabouts) and has gained a bit of weight since we've been together. She also doesn't have very clear skin, which gets her down too. She has self-harm scars, though not that many and the newest are from well before we met. There's no real reason for me to think that she's clinically depressed (at least, not currently) though I'm far from a mental health professional. I've spoken to her about it, she's admitted she had a period where she wasn't ok, but is fine now, and I've had no reason to suspect otherwise. 75-80% of the time, she's outwardly a completely happy 23 year old.\n\n(I'm not exactly a supermodel myself but am down to 185lbs now (5'7). I think of myself as reasonably confident... wouldn't wear a bikini in public but I'm fine with my body in private). \n\nI think she believes me when I tell her I think she's beautiful the way she is, but she can't see it herself, which is pretty normal I guess. Neither of us are \"conventionally attractive\", whatever that means these days, but I think she's hot. We're both pretty 'alternative'.\n\nI've been trying to cook her clean, healthy meals in an effort to help her lose weight so she can feel better about herself but I frequently find fast food containers/pizza boxes/chocolate wrappers/Ben and Jerry's tubs around the place. I've mentioned them a few times, and she gets very shy/awkward about it. It's a bit demoralising, because I cook 95% of her meals for her, and it feels like her end of the bargain isn't too difficult to hold up. I don't ask much from her, so it feels annoying when she does stuff like this. But then I feel bad about feeling annoyed... I know how comfort food works and I try not to make a big deal about it.\n\nShe also smokes, a lot. Not always just tobacco, either. I don't have a problem with this at all, I join her sometimes - but it does feel a bit counter-productive. Other than her job being pretty active, she does very little exercise. Not that she's 'lazy' exactly, she does her share around the house and it's not like we never go anywhere or do anything active, but when it comes to exercising for weight loss... nada. Her, um, declining stamina levels are starting to affect... my... favourite bedroom activities... but only a little. We still have plenty of fun.\n\nI've tried to talk to her about this, and she says that she often feels like she needs comfort food, or needs a smoke (which inevitably then leads to comfort food) when she's stressed or sad and feels guilty because of everything I'm doing to help her, so feels like she has to hide it from me because I'd be annoyed at her (partly correct!). And she knows that this isn't helping her lose weight, and she understands that she is unhappy because she can't lose weight. She acknowledges the full cycle that's going on here, just can't seem to break it.\n\nShe also says she doesn't like exercising because she doesn't like being sweaty and she sweats easily (her home country is quite a bit colder than mine on average which I guess doesn't help). She also flat-out refuses to go swimming (my preferred exercise, since I'm not a huge fan of being a sweaty mess either) because of her body image issues. She seems fully aware of the problem here too, just... not able to progress. And I feel I need to reiterate at this point, it's her problem with her body. I'm 100% fine with how she physically is, the solitary reason I'm interested in her losing weight is that I want her to be happy mentally and I can tell she's not.\n\nI've asked if she wants me to drop the whole thing and just leave her to sort her own food out when we don't eat together, but she seems to genuinely appreciate the effort I'm going to, and seems genuinely upset that she's \"messing it up\" by binging.\n\nSorry for the long-winded post. My general question here is... how do I help? Do I even help? Is there anything more I can do, or is this something she needs to do on her own whilst I just give her time?\n\nI love this girl, reddit. She's been dealt a shitty hand and deserves better. I just feel like this isn't going away and is always going to be there if we don't solve it somehow.",

Earlier this year I went through a bad breakup with a long term gf (4+ years, lived together), and I reached out to who eventually became my new partner as a friend looking for support.\n\nI've come to find out that my partner's mental health is worse than they were letting on in the beginning of the relationship and I feel as if I'm spending more energy managing their emotions than I am enjoying the time I spend with them. I feel as if I cannot truly communicate many of the issues in the relationship cause I know the conversation will get twisted into a way in which I'm now apologizing. Since we've started dating, she spends 3-4 days a week here citing that 'she can't be at her house' or that 'she needs to see me'. Days she's not here she'll call 3-4 times a day just to say hi. I often feel expected to provide since I know she's not making alot of money, despite her not really taking the help and working on improving their situation.\n\nMy partner has attempted in the past, and has expressed to me ideation as recent as within the past couple weeks. I'm concerned that since I'm her only support currently that a breakup might precipitate some drastic reaction. The addition of this pressure makes it doubly difficult to communicate honestly and openly.\n\nOf course I still care about this person, and want them to do well and continue growing, but I just don't see a good romantic future between us. Since we've started dating, she spends 3-4 days a week here citing that 'she can't be at her house' or that 'she needs to see me'. Days she's not here she'll call 3-4 times a day just to say hi. To be honest, I'm not sure we were ever really healthy friends as I look back, I've always felt like my emotions were taken less seriously as her issues were always 'priority'\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to best navigate something like this. I've been thinking of writing her a letter to do it as I feel I'd have a better shot at getting all of my feelings out there accurately, but I don't want to come across as impersonal or cold. Is there any chance that I get to protect myself and her at the same time?\n\ntldr: Feel taken advantage of in my current relationship, but my partner has severe depression.

When I am on video call with her she will come and throw random clothes at my webcam or just unplug the internet and throw a fit afterwards to me telling me to break up with her. On top of that, whenever I ask her for the reason why she doesn't like her she tells me that her background is not good (she's viet). Coming from a traditional Chinese background, she always tells me that I didn't learn Chinese history and that the Vietnamese are gold diggers and she pulls anecdotal stories of a viet girl getting pregnant with one of her friends friends to collect child support or how viet people used napalm bombs during the vietnam war and they are barbaric and this and that. In short, she says that to Chinese people, vietnamese people are uncultured compare to Chinese people, which I have no idea what it has to do with her. Similarly, when this topic first came around about me dating her, she had woken me up at 8 am telling me to watch a video about how only poor Chinese farmers go to vietnam to find wives because no one wants them, and told me how she would be losing face if her friends know that Im dating a viet girl. She also keeps telling me that my parents are working hard to make me succeed and I am doing something like this and its so disappointing and that she feels extremely furious whenever I talk to my gf, to the point where she is literally shaking in anger when she talks to me.

I had been slowly trying to cut him off despite feeling guilty for it, but I couldn't deal with his behavior anymore. he would not pick up any hints even after I straight up told him I didn't want to be friends anymore. I tried to talk to him about how I felt, and everytime he'd either change the subject or guilt spiral and say how bad he felt and threatened himself and I felt like I'd have to talk him out of it. His behavior never changed from anything I said despite my various attempts to approach him about it.\n\nso one day, I just cut him off. he'd moved to another city and school so I wouldn't see him in person if I didn't drive to his house, and I blocked him on all social media with no explanation. that was a few months ago, but recently a mutual friend that has stayed in contact with him told me that he didn't understand why I blocked him. they also told me that soon after (I'm pretty sure the day after I blocked him) that he was sent to the Psych Ward, I'm assuming for an attempt. I feel insanely guilty over this and I know it isn't directly my fault, but I was his only real support system at the time and for years. and I suddenly left him alone despite knowing this was a likely outcome for him. \n\nthat friend has thought I'm an asshole this entire time aparently, despite them not telling me anything until very recently about anything from Alex's side. so my question is am I in the wrong? and if I am, what do I do about it?\n\nTL;DR I cut off a very close friend of three years with basically no warning despite knowing he struggles with mental illness. mutual friend recently told me he tried to commit afterwards. am I in the wrong with what I did? and what do I do if I was?",

I actually found I was having to work harder to keep up with her. \n\nWe then had our daughter who is coming up to 3 now and once she came along things changed with her desire for sex waining as she was breastfeeding and said she was touched out. I waited patiently not wanting to push her and once out daughter was on solids and off the breast we started having sex more..2 or 3 times a week so it felt like things were getting to a better place. \n\nAbout two or three months of that and we decided to try for another baby and unlike the first time we pretty much got pregnant right away ( the first time to almost two years) . And unlike in the first pregnancy where she still wanted sex she felt so drained so pretty much from that moment the sex stopped again.  Our daughter is 8 months now and we have had sex last about 14 or 15 months ago and I am honestly finding it really really difficult. \n\nI am not wanting to sound selfish but her sex drive seems very low if its even there at all.. this extends to not really proactively trying to kiss or hug me and I'm not sure tbh whether I am feeling sexually frustrated or just starved of any kind of intimacy at all. \n\nI have brought it up a couple of times but she says she's too tired or other things of that nature so I end up getting snarky at times and making passive aggressive jokes when situations come up alluding to the lack of sex. \n\nOver the Xmas period we had a rare night where the oldest was staying out one night with her aunt and my wife was feeling a little ill but said its a shame I'm ill as we could have tried sex.\n\nThe same thing then happened on nye when she said \"I'd have liked to of had sex this year but it's a bit late now as the kids etc there is no Opportunity \"\n\nI then brought it up a couple days later that when the eldest went back to nursery we could maybe have sex of the youngest was asleep.  The reply I got was that it was strange I would bring it up when she is saying she is tired... which basically said to me no chance of that happening. \n\nNow if I was being cynical it feels to me like she's mentioned it at times ut can't happen to try and placate me and make me think she wants it when she doesn't. \n\nI have insecurities around myself on general how I look etc and in the past have had partners that have withheld sex almost as a weapon so I put a lot of stock into sex as being an indicator of whether my partner loves me which might not be right but I can't help it. \n\nOver the course of the last year I have asked whether she still finds me attractive and feels the same about me and such at times and each time she has been hurt and said of course she does etc so I don't think that she doesn't want to be with me but my mood is starting to get more and more irritable with the lack of intimacy.\n\nI'm not sure what I am looking for.. maybe reassurance from others who have been in the same position or and help or guidance about how to deal with this...or whether I just wanted to get my thoughts out of my head and onto a page. \n\nThanks for listening to my story\n\nTldr: after second daughter born wife not intimate anymore.. says still finds me attractive etc but no sex or intimacy.",

There were some differences between us mostly regarding our material status and the way we think about life.We weren't the best match but we made it work out somehow because I chose to make her happy and do the things that she wished for since I considered myself being the weird one in that relationship.\n\nI am coming from a family who struggled a bit with money during my university time and she was from a family which didn't really had that problem. Now things had changed since I had a job for the past years in a very well paid industry and she sort of struggles with her career. \n\nBecause of the financial status I always were the one who was focused on having a better career and overcome my situation while her was more on enjoying her time (travelling, getting the nicest things etc.). That let to some issues from my side since I am not that type of person. I don't thrive that much for vacations and travelling as her since I enjoy other things.  We had talks about my perception about life but in the end she accepted the fact that I am not that type of a person and started to live a very simple life.\n\nAfter the pandemic started I basically lost everyone. No friends (since my friends were mostly girls - like 10-12 years old friendships), no other activities that didn't involved her. Basically we were living our lives non stop together 24 h/day 7 d/week (For the past 2 years we live in the same flat).\n\nDuring this time our situation got worst since I started to not wish to do things with her anymore. We had numerous fights, endless talks about how I am and my lack of happiness, lots of talks about how we should break up and the list goes on. I stopped initiating sexual things with her about a year ago and for a good 4-5 months we didn't even kissed or said something nice about each other. One time we even got in a proper fight.  I basically rejected her in every single way I felt. I stopped going with her to parks or out in general. I only went to do basic chores like shopping.\n\nGrowing up for such long time with somebody made it very hard to break up, but in the end I did it and it was horrible. \n\nMy issue is that now I feel guilty about doing it since I was the only person left in her life. Now I am all alone only with my parents and a remote job to fill my time. Is killing me from the inside to know that she still claimed to love me even after 2 years of continuous fights and argues (I would say that in the past year we argued at least 2 times / week and had weekly endless talks about the same thing: us and how we should breakup), no sexual actions, no kissing, no \"I love you\".  I basically stopped loving her and at the moment I feel no need for a hug or to see her.  Basically I stayed so much in the same misery that now I don't feel anything anymore.\n\nHow should I overcome the guilt? I've always been the emotional type of a man. Never just dated somebody without considering having a life with that person. Now knowing that I basically lived 1/5 of my life with her I can barely do something without feeling guilt. \n\nDid I ruined her life? Am I ruining my own one for the sake of making her happy even tho I am not? Every night I stay up and think how I am going to harm her regardless of how I will live my life from now on. Happy or sad she will find out one way or the other how am I doing and the tough that she will feel bad about me is making me feeling like I don't want to live anymore.\n\nAny toughs about my sad love story? Sorry for the long text but is the first time I let this out of my mind. Never shared with anybody how I felt and I think I can't stand a single day thinking about how bad I and her we are going to feel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks dear community!

All of my closest friends leave to the capital 1 hour away but I stay in the city with my girlfriend (she was not from the same school). This really affects me because they seem to enjoy life over there whereas my life has become calmer, boring sometimes. She can't move to the capital because she didn't finish her studies. She will finish them in 2 years. I made friends with people which were already old friends between them but it is difficult to include myself within their group and I don't find the same feeling with them than with my friends in the capital.

We were an example of opposites attracting, where she was more emotive, spontaneous, and talkative, and I was more analytical, methodical, and quiet. We'd spend weekends at her place playing video games, cooking food, and talking about our personal lives. For a while, it felt balanced and healthy, with both sides supported and supporting.\n\nThings changed once the pandemic started. Jane and I got an idea to move in together with a few other friends in order to lower the monthly rent and avoid isolation. Overall this was a good move. It's been nice to have some extra company, especially during lockdown periods. But I've also noticed that as stressors have piled up, our dynamic has changed.\n\nJane needs a lot of support right now. She has anxiety issues and has been burning out due to her busy job, grad school, family drama, and a shitty ex bf, on top of COVID. I've spent a lot of time in the past year listening to her vent about all of the above, and for the most part, I haven't minded. I want to support her and help her get to a better place. (She has also helped me through a lot of issues, and I appreciate that!) She has made moves to improve her situation, including getting a therapist, but still leans on me as someone she can vent to about everyday frustrations. And by \"everyday,\" I mean every. day. She will approach me in our shared spaces to start venting about her coworkers, her professors, her ex bf, her parents, etc., sometimes for hours. Even if it isn't a vent, then it is her asking for feedback on her interpersonal problems. I feel like a live-in therapist.\n\nShe is at least sort of aware this is an issue and has told me a few times that she feels bad for always complaining to me. When she says something like this, I feel guilty and bitter, because while I want her to feel comfortable confiding in me, I can't deny that I do wish she would find another coping method. I've encouraged her to take up exercise or some sort of hobby, but she doesn't do it often enough to make a difference to her stress level.\n\nI find myself in the position of worrying about her and worrying about myself. I want to sit her down and have a conversation about boundaries, but I'm struggling with putting the words together. In particular, I find it hard to center it around my emotional needs, which I have a bad habit of pushing aside. Does anyone have any scripts that I could use, especially if you've had to have this kind of conversation with a friend before?\n\nTL;DR Best friend has been leaning heavily on me for emotional support for the past 2 years, and I'm feeling drained. I want to have a talk with her about boundaries but don't know how.\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "My brother has anger issues, no two ways about it.  He lives at home with my mom and stepdad, attending community college part time to get his associates.  \n\nEver since he was young he's been an angry kid.  Not outwardly mean or vindictive, but angry.  Throughout the years whenever my mom or I have tried to talk with him about his issues he just completely shuts down and refuses to chat about them or seek help.  My step dad is a bit of a loser with his own (milder) anger issues as well, and so this is where I think his problems stem from.\n\nWhen you confront him about his anger, he mutters under his breath \"Everyone thinks I'm fucking stupid\" or something similar and then simply refuses to engage.  While we're not a perfect family, he has grown up in a stable, loving environment.  \n\nI'm worried about him.  Very simple tasks can send him over the edge, like my mom asking for help with a chore.  I try to hang with him regularly (We both play video games) but sometimes his raging is just out of control and all he'll do is rant and rave about how some champion is broken or overpowered.  I definitely understand that games can be frustrating, but his constant negative attitude makes the games unfun to play.  I always invite him when I'm playing alone or with my friends, but lately my friends have gotten tired of his attitude and don't want to play with him anymore.  I know he has a couple friends of his own, but am not sure how his relationship is with them and am concerned that he'll push them away in similar fashion.  I'm also worried about him eventually holding down a job, getting a girlfriend, and building a life.  How can I get him on a better path?\n\nTL;DR My brother has anger issues and I'm worried that he's headed down the wrong path.  How do I help him stifle his rage and achieve his goals in life?",

        "content": "I met her in college 6 months ago. She is not my first friend in college but she's the closest. I got close to her because her story was really touching for me. None of my other friends make me feel judged or stop being me like i mentioned below. She's very introvert so she hasn't make any real friend except me in college (she has some good old friends thoo so she's not totally indignant) but she's polite and respectful to strangers.\n\n\nI did tell her to say to me anything without fearing that I'll be offended or something. Because I believe that honesty is the most important aspect of any relationship. That is okay with me. \n\nJust a side note, i'm not a type of person who take things seriously, like if you tell me about something that you find annoying or weird about me, maybe the way i sit, or the way i act. I'll just laugh it off. Or maybe you calling me dumb, or other stuff. But if you do it like a million times the collective effect will be devastating for me. I'll stop being me around you, I'll fear being judged. I will start being overthinking about what to say to not look dumb or stupid. Individually if you pick some comment it'll have no meaning that's what i mean. \n\nThere are things that I find annoying or weird about her but I don't tell her because I want her to love herself. She's a very insecure type of person. As a friend, i just want to help her being secure by not telling her to change. \n\nBut as an human being doing this is very damaging for me psychologically. I just don't know how to explain myself to her. I'm not putting blame on her because i'm the one who choose this way for her. \n\nIt just make me feel like my emotions being repressed, she has some temper issues, she faced abused in her childhood and her parents are abusive physically and manipulative. That makes me feel sympathetic towards her. \n\nIn life, I want to become emotionally stronger so I can achieve my goals.\n\nCan someone with more experience give me some advice? Like how to help her deal with her childhood at the same time not putting myself in a corner. How to deal with people in such cases? What are the methods to deal with my emotions? If I talk with her how do I explain my feelings to her? \n\nI want to know how to be more understanding? What are the redlines? Especially from people who work in care sector like psychatrist, nurses who have to take inappropriate stuff on a regular basis and have to deal to be understanding and non-egoitic \n\nI asked her to talk about this but she said she is too tired to talk about this now which is not bad on its own, but intensified my feeling of being treated as a robot since mostly we don't meet when she is tired, we don't talk when she doesn't want to. We hangout when she wants to. We watch stuff when its her wish. She called me immature for minding it, i understand that she is tired. But I can't help with my feelings. It felt like we never no stuff based on my emotions. \n\nFor someone who is gonna suggest, that she's not my friend. She has so many good qualities that make me be close to her. I also appreciate her being honest about my cons since this is very rare these days. Maybe someone older is able to understand something that I fail to.\n\ntl;dr: i don't mind when my bestie puts remarks on how i act or eat. In most cases they help me to improve and be more sociable. But, when those remarks adds up they drain my self confidence, it just feels like I have nothing good in me to talk about. I'm not special.",

I decided to try to put my foot down and do things I wanted to do for once just to see if that would make me happy. On Saturday I got off work and called him and he mentioned going to his parents for the rest of the day since it was New Years. I said no, because I wasn\u2019t really feeling up to it since my Christmas fiasco with his parents (I\u2019m not sure I mentioned that in my OP?), and he was unwilling to set boundaries with his mom so I told him I\u2019m not emotionally ready for it and don\u2019t know if I even want to go in the future at this point. I told him he was welcome to go and I would stay home. He was really upset and told me that wouldn\u2019t work and I HAD to go.             \n          \nI was really angry after that. I told him basically everything in my first post, and when I told him that I wanted to leave he showed me the door. I went to a friends to cool off and gain some perspective, which I think really helped. I did end up having to go back home, so I showed up about 8pm and we didn\u2019t talk all night. The next morning, he cleaned the house which I guess was his way of apologizing because it was doing all the things I hate: cleaning the bathroom and organizing all his laundry that just piles everywhere.                    \n               \nHe told me he wanted to talk and essentially said that I was right about everything and that he would do what it takes to make it work. We had another talk about what I truly think I want, living alone, etc. but it was very difficult, because all I could think about was how to spare his feelings. I offered me moving out and us just dating again, but it seemed like that would only be giving him half of what he wanted. Ultimately, I decided to stay to give him another chance. It kind of scares me how quickly he went back to normal now that I\u2019m looking at it today. My friend said he would never be able to get over something like this, so it does seem weird that my fianc\u00e9\u2026 boyfriend? Is completely fine now. I\u2019m also starting to have doubts that this was truly something I wanted and not something I did make him happy. I feel so unsure about this at this point.              \n           \n**tldr I tried to leave and then didn\u2019t and now I\u2019m doubting myself again**",

For perspective, I was 5\u20195 and about 115lbs when we started dating and was about 210 at my heaviest. I gained about 100lbs in 14 months.

It\u2019s getting sort of bad too. One of his ex\u2019s (who is gorgeous!) dm\u2019d him to wish him a happy new year over the weekend and it put me in a super terrible headspace.

Sally (40) and I have a true love story and have been friends for 12 years and lovers for the past 3+. It had been 5 months up until 6 weeks ago, and she randomly contacted me, as she does, and I invited her to my house to talk. We ended up spending the next 36 hours together, and it was amazing. Not just physically, just lost in the love of our hearts. We remained in contact, and then I found a reason to reach out, and then spent the whole weekend with her. That was a month ago, and we\u2019ve picked right back up. So, two weeks ago, we\u2019re having one of those hard talks that needs to be had. It got a little heated on her side because it was about a girl that I had been with, during our break. I knew she knew and I felt horrible about it. I definitely thought she had done her own thing during those months, and had no qualms with that. Sure, it hurts, but that\u2019s part of life, love, and relationships. We\u2019ll, during the somewhat heated conversation, she let \u201cslip\u201d what she had been up to recently. She said she got ahold of her friends (couple) and had a threesome with them, and try introduced her to a man that she ended up doing a bondage/bdsm session with. Her next words were, \u201csome people pay really well for that.\u201d Then she preceded to tell me that there was no penetration, and she hadn\u2019t had anyone else inside of her since me. Okay, we were broke up, I\u2019m not a jealous person (until I am), if that makes sense. Well, now she opened the book and I want to read it. We\u2019ve had a split or two before and she told me about a friend of mine and hers and what went on with them one night, just some innocent finger banging. Like, I said, I get it, things happen, we\u2019re adults. No qualms, with that. I worked right through that. We\u2019ll, for me, this is different. I\u2019m still trying to work out why. I told her I needed to understand, and know more, this truly bothers me and need to be in the light. I\u2019m a very open person, and I do not judge her for this, I just want to be consoled. She went as far as to tell me that the couple and her use a fuck machine, and there is no penetration with the guy. Same with the guy that they introduced to her, and paid her for bondage/w a whip to tell it in her words. I\u2019m very good at reading people,  and I did/do not believe her. She started crying and her eyes told me all I needed to know. So for the past two weeks, I\u2019ve gone up and down the rabbit hole, spending thousands of dollars drinking, drugging, and gambling to stay out of my head. I\u2019ve been with her almost every second since, until something comes into play that reminds me that the love of my life has/had a side job where another man thinks he owns her. Im in a certain kind of hell. I have heaven beside me and he\u2019ll within. I am broken, to the point I\u2019ve been walking in the cold all night outside freezing in the mountains and snow trying to make sense of this.

I\u2019m no angel, but I\u2019m honest and value integrity in that. And when it comes to Clyde wanting Bonny to console him, I would do whatever it took.

        "content": "My (30F) bf (38M) of 4 years is sending me mixed messages about how he feels about the future of our relationship. I'm looking for any input from anyone who's been I'm a similar situation.\n\n\n\u00a0Yesterday he said that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone who makes him feel like less of a person than he actually is, like he's not enough. He also said that I may be more suitable for someone else who could give me everything I want that he apparently can't do. (He's said similar things before. Sometimes I think it may be a manipulation tactic).\n\n\nThen he said that he's open to couples therapy for some guidance and wouldn't say this unless he felt there was hope for us. Sooo a few different messages there. I'm feeling sad and kinda doomy.\u00a0\n\n\nA little background: all relationships are complex so the intricacies won't come through in a paragraph but some main issues we've had for years are that he's been pretty lethargic and non initiating (just in general with planning activities for us, communication and sex). I often feel like he just wants to be left alone (he's an introvert) and that I am asking too much...He's struggled with some depression and is a very sensitive person, so our conflicts take a large toll on him and have created a lot of baggage which he seems to need a loooooong time to recover from, which to me often feels like stagnation and makes me impatient.\n\n\nHe thinks I focus too much on my needs and on how he affects my happiness and need to work on my own trauma and let go of expectations. He says that once I start focusing on my own healing and stop pressuring him into things, I will get everything I want naturally, because he will have the needed space to do his own work and be happier and healthier.\n\n\nOk, I've been doing exactly that!\u00a0 In therapy, grad school, hangout with friends, hike etc. He is seemingly not doing enough work for himself. He made some promises (exercising, going to therapy) and he's not upholding them. I've grown a lot and am a much better partner, giving him space, doing my own thing, trusting that he's on track....but where the fuck are the results?\u00a0\n\n\nSoo after the conversation yesterday it just feels like he's using excuses and pointing fingers at me once again. Saying that I'm never satisfied with him and that we are just too different. He acknowledged that he needs to do more work, but he once again just wants me to completely back off and let him do it on his own time.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't know....it's frustrating. I just want a functioning, happy, energetic partner who will prioritize our relationship and I feel like he's stuck in his own pain and doesn't care enough to truly fight for this.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm willing to go to therapy (I was the one pushing for this for like a year)...but I'm not sure about his motivation to put in the work needed. He seems to think that we see reality in fundamentally different colors and he can't get past that to feel compassion for me and stop judging.\u00a0\n\n\nThere definitely is a lot of love and care for one another, but shit has been very hard for years. At what point is it unfixable? Is it delusional to keep hoping that things will change?\u00a0\n\nThank you for reading. \n\nTL;DR boyfriend of 4 years seems to think we are too different and keeps pointing fingers in my direction as we talk about our issues and my concerns. Said that he doesn't want to be with someone who makes him feel so bad but at the same time is open to couples therapy in hopes of receiving guidance and working things out. I'm receiving mixed messages and feel sad and unsure of how much motivation he actually has to fight for us....",

        "content": "My mind has been in a fog the last 3 days and I really don't know what to do.\n\nMy wife has always had an outstanding credit card debt that we discussed about long ago even before we were married and hoped I would help her with in the future. When we got married her balance was roughly $8k with a 20%+ interest rate. Basically we came to a conclusion that with our incomes at that time and trying to save up for a house, we would just do damage control and make minimum payments+$100 to slowly eat away at the balance until we have more income.\n\n4 Months after we got married, I found out she had been keeping \n another CC from me that had over $3k balance on it. So we decided to take out money from our small savings and pay that off immediately as I didn't want to worry about accruing interest on 2 separate cards. We then had a long talk about debt and our future's plans. She promised to never use that card again and to stop using the $8k card.\n\nFast forward now to 3 years into our marriage (2 years ago). We found out my wife was pregnant (unexpected, but yay!). Our current savings for a house was not going well as we lived our first few years of marriage more frivolously than we expected. So I decided that we needed to get our finances in order again and actually stand firm on our future goals since we will now be supporting a baby. This is when I find out that even with our \"overpayment\" of her credit card it was still at $8k, we hadn't made a dent.... She says she didn't realized she had a couple monthly auto-payments with it (which in with my math still didn't add up) but again we had a very long conversation, with her breaking down and crying for being so sorry about her financial situation, that came down to You Need To Stop Using That Card. Cut it up, clear it out of all of your saved websites, everything, remove it from your life. She promised to do so, showed me the canceled auto-payments and we ventured on.\n\nNow 2 years later, New Years Eve, I found out that I've worked at my job long enough to be able to take a Pension Loan out of up to $8,500. I was thrilled to actually set a finish line to her CC debt and set all of this behind us. Figuring now that with our overpayments for the past 2 years and including the interest, the CC should be in the $6k range. I researched and got quoted a pension loan (from my job not a 3rd party) for $7k that would actually reduce our monthly payment and we could have the debt completely paid off in 18 months! I was ecstatic and ran down the whole opportunity with my wife about 3 hours before the New Years ball dropped, but that's when she dropped the ball on me...\n\nShe broke down crying and told me the balance is now over $12k...\n\nShe says she never told me the true balance because of how ashamed she was. But the thing is, I know what the balance was 2 years ago because I had her show me her bank account. And even if she was ashamed, we are way past that as we've been together for so long and have a child together... This is not something to keep from your husband...\n\nShe has lied to me over and over and over again about her debt and I can't take it anymore. I'm mostly just so upset/heartbroken that she lied to me for years than what the debt has become.\n\nAfter that roller coaster of emotions that night, I've felt nothing... And I really don't know how to handle this. Like, literal nothing. I have no emotion when I see her and it's scary. I mean, overall she is a great person, smart, so nice, never rude, great with our son. But I just don't know anymore. I don't know why I can't feel anything anymore. We haven't even kissed once in the new year and I'm not upset.\n\nAm I overreacting? I know it's not like she was cheating on me. It's just like my subconscious has ripped out my connection to her without my say. Maybe I'm here just to vent? I don't know... Any input would be much appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading such a long/not well written post.\n\n**EDIT:**\n*Thank you all for everyone who has commented and given me their advise. I still really want this to work out, I don't want our family to fall apart for my son but this will be on my wife.*\n\n*No matter what she does, I just can't bring it to myself to take complete control over her finances. Even though many of you stated that it is the only way, it's not what I want to do, she is my wife not my child.*\n\n*Just to start the ball rolling what I decided to do was to give her a simple test this week, I told her to get her statements together for her CCs and show them to me so we can go over them. I am not going to reminder her to do this, she has to show me that she cares about fixing this and is willing to do such an easy task without my help. By Sunday, if this doesn't happen, I am going to put it out to her straight that I don't think this marriage is going to work out and see where that goes. I want to go to couples counseling but I am not sure I am willing to even go through that if she won't do even the smallest things to fix this, I need to see something from her end. Even thinking about it, just showing me her bank statements isn't really something to be considered \"working on fixing it\", it's so remedial that it should be given... but I need to start somewhere. Either way, I am going to get professional help on this and go by myself to see a therapist next week.*\n\n*Wish me luck and hope it all turn out well for me and my family. I will post an update on this in the future.*\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Wife has lied to me many times over and over again about finances and I've lost almost all trust in her.

        "content": "I (F23) have two sisters (28,25) and our relationship has been rocky to say the least. I've gone no contact with the oldest one for about 2 years, now I'm very low contact with her. I used to be close to the other one, but in the last two years there has been a lot of tension, misplaced anger and resentment towards me (she's had some difficult years carreer wise and gained a lot of weight, me on the other hand have had good years and a big weight loss). She would always make remarks about how I lost weight to feel better about myself and that she's not that insecure so she will not lose weight. I can feel the energy change when I tell her good news/achievements so I  distanced myself from her. \n\nI finally found a new place to move in and organized a christmas dinner and house warming (covid rules allowed this). At the christmas dinner she was in a bad mood but I didn't pay much attention to this. \nAfter the christmas dinner we had an argument in the groupchat because the 25y.o one said that \"I wanted to organize a dinner, but made everyone do everything\". This is not true, i was in the kitchen from 8am till 4pm. 2 friends help decorate the dining room and table, and helped me peel potatoes and cut some veggies for the salad. My sister offered to make 3 snacks and make the punch, which I accepted her help and thanked everyone for their help for the dinner. My oldest sister chimed in, meanwhile she was not there to see all the work and preparations I had put into the dinner. I felt like shit given that they never appreciate the effort I put into doing something nice for them.\n\nThen the 28y.o uninvited me to the new year's party she had planned at her house and told me to enjoy \"Mike\" (fake name). I'm dating Mike but I haven't told them about him because we are still getting to know each other and see if we have a good base to make it a relationship. They found out about Mike because the 25y.o went through my phone while I was showering and read atleast 4 months of messages between me and Mike. She also went through my personal stuff in my bedroom and found some toys. She's on the conservative side and blocked me after the discussion in the group chat.\n\nI am not mad they found out about Mike, i'm mad that she felt like she had the right to go trough my phone and my personal belongings and that they don't think that this is a problem / violation of privacy. \n\nI honestly dont trust them anymore and dont feel comfortable around them. I'm currently not speaking to them but my mom keeps insisting that I have to talk to them because \"we're sisters\".\n\nIs it even worth it to try to have a relationship with them? I don't know how I can get past the privacy issue.\n\n\nTLDR: rocky relationship with sisters have become worse due to one of them going through my phone and personal belongings and the both of them not seeing how this is a big issue/privacy violation for me. Mom insists I mend the relationship because we are sisters, but i'm not sure if I want to and if it's worth it.",

        "content": "We've been together for about 5 years now, and this last year he has been depressed a few times. I really don't like to see him like that. I dont want anything to happen to him.\n\nHe studies Law and is in his second year, the studies are very hard (top 50 best law school in the world, not to brag, but just to show the level). Now we need to study for our exams and thus have no christmas vacation. He has social anxiety, and he has a terrible fear of calling on the phone even to ask a simple question.\n\nIn my opinion he has too much pressure from his wealthy parents and older brothers and older sister that all also study at university and all study for high-perceived degrees (if that makes sense, this is not my first language). The family is quite rich and are very restrictive with their children, as an example: some things are very weird to say or akward. While most of us would think it is normal to say random things to our parents or to jump in the couch or scream for no reason and be crazy from time to time. There it is really weird and everyone is like SOOOO judgemental. Even his brothers. But his parents are very chill with me, I'm also quite extraverted and im not scared to speak, lets say it like that.\n\nHe said to me that it hasn't anything to do with that pressure I'm talking about, but often he says, \"yes but my parents will be very mad if i fail etc.\" And today he said again that he is depressed and only want to sleep and he can't study anymore he studies 5 pages a day while he has 500 to do, not even exaggerating.\n\nI think the pressure comes from his parents, the fact that he has the habit of being judged constantly, and that he isnt free to be how he is, like being goofy. And i think the studies may be too heavy for him. But he is an excellent student and always had very good grades and he wants to be the best at nearly everything, so he has drive and will, but now I don't know it anymore.\n\nPlease can someone help me, what can i say, what can i do, and no go to a therapist is not an option that would be 10000 times too embarassing for him and he would never ever accept to go. I heard that a \"winter depression\" or also called \" a seasonal Affective Disorder\" is really common.\n\nTLDR; BOYFRIEND IS DEPRESSED AND I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT, HE STUDIES A LOT AND HAS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON HIS SHOULDERS.",

        "content": "I (26M) met \u2018Anne\u2019 (23F) through mutual friends and at first we got along really well but she very quickly started to make me a bit uncomfortable. There\u2019d be things like we\u2019d meet up for lunch and she\u2019d jump in and pay before I got a chance, which if it happens once or if it\u2019s only for something small is one thing, but this would happen every time we met up. There was even one time we were looking in a bookshop and she snatched a book I was going to get out of my hands and insisted on paying for it. When I tried to protest she sort of created a scene and I was so embarrassed I ended up dropping it. I should also add that I have a full time job and am well paid enough to look after myself. The other thing that would make this worse is that a day or two later she\u2019d be posting on social media saying she was broke and asking if people could PayPal her money. She also does this thing where she just constantly almost bombs you with compliments, for lack of a better term, like she\u2019ll constantly tell me I\u2019m fantastic and great and the sheer quantity makes it seem insincere and false, and because she makes me uncomfortable just makes me cringe and feel guilty. When I told her this made me uncomfortable she said it was \u2018a you problem.\u2019 What really makes me mad though is that I have a connective tissue disorder called Ehlers Danlos syndrome. It doesn\u2019t impact me too much, thankfully, but on a bad day I walk with a cane. When she found this out, she would constantly try to tell me and everyone else what I could and could not do, and talk over me and make a big deal of it if I said I wasn\u2019t up to something, which is something that makes me want to scream.\n\nWhat brought things to a head originally was that I posted on Twitter griping that I\u2019d bought a new binder (I\u2019m trans) and it didn\u2019t fit even though I\u2019d got one from the same place just a few months before which still fit perfectly, and she started sending me messages offering to buy a new one. Aside from anything, this was a simple case of returning it and getting the next size up, but even if it hadn\u2019t been, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very appropriate for someone who really didn\u2019t know me well to offer to buy me underwear. I let her know that she was making me uncomfortable and that I didn\u2019t really want to be friends, and soft blocked her on Twitter. \n\nFor a few months everything was fine, but then flash forward to a few weeks ago. A friend was having a Christmas dinner and guess who was there? She sort of cornered me at one end of the table and kept talking at me. I was sort of zoning out and she kept loudly asking if I was okay which made me more and more uncomfortable. I made my excuses and managed to leave early. Nothing happened until today when she started following me again on twitter. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what to do at this point without it becoming a major thing with mutual friends. She\u2019s very dramatic and inclined to exaggerate, and given how much she enjoys playing the victim (even going so far as to center herself in things that happened to people she knows) I wouldn\u2019t put it past her not to try and turn people on me. I\u2019m going to properly block her on Twitter before she starts liking and replying to every single thing, but I was hoping someone might have some advice on letting her know clearly that I do not want to be around her without it turning in to a big thing.\n\nTL;DR: someone who I\u2019m not comfortable with keeps trying to get back into my life and I\u2019m not sure how to shake her",

I never felt like I loved anyone again and started to not believe in it. \n\nRecently, we met up through a friend after years of him hating me and when we cuddled etc I was overwhelmed by the same feeling of intense love I had for him seven years ago. It hit me really hard and I find myself yearning hard for him to be there when I'm getting to sleep or im sad etc. I yearned for him even before this. He has now left the country and I feel like a piece of me has gone with him. He has also said before that he feels obsessed and he doesn't understand. \n\nBut it has been ten years. I don't know him anymore. I always thought I idealised what we had until we met up but I can't deny the pull I have for him. We have something I can't explain. For example I have been smoking weed everyday for 3 years and all he had to say was I think you should stop and something shifted in me and I just did which is CRAZY.

He\u2019s an amazing guy, we have the same interests, he makes me laugh, he encourages me to try my hardest at school (I\u2019m in college,) and it judt seems like he gets me in a way that no one else really does. \n\nHowever, there\u2019s a few things that are getting in the way. First, he\u2019s super unmotivated. He\u2019s had maybe 4 jobs his entire life, none of which he\u2019s had longer than a month. He recently quit his first \u201creal job\u201d 3 weeks after working there, and is looking for part-time fast food work now. He also went to school for a few months to work in IT, but never received his certification, and hasn\u2019t mentioned anything about trying to start it up again. I\u2019m a full-time college student with a part time job, and it makes me upset to visit him after my week is over to see he hasn\u2019t done anything but smoke weed and play video games all week. He currently lives with his parents, but has to move out in March. He has been planning on moving into a new place with his friend, but his friend has not found a place yet. If he can\u2019t find somewhere by March, my boyfriend says he is going to move into his friend\u2019s current house, and sleep on his couch indefinitely. He always comes up with reasons why a job doesn\u2019t work for him, but I\u2019m worried that if we stay together I\u2019ll have to end up supporting him.\n\n\nAlso, he\u2019s incredibly unhealthy. He only eats fast food and microwaveable meals, and never works out or attempts to be physical. (This next part is TMI and NSFW, just a warning) it\u2019s gotten to the point where he refuses to do guy-on-top sex positions, because he can\u2019t hold himself up for more than a minute. I work out multiple times a week, and ask him if he would like to join me, but it never ends up happening. \n\nI enjoy spending time with him so much, and he\u2019s a great guy, but with these things I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll feel trapped in this relationship if things continue.

I'm forever grateful to my mother (and my grandmother for that matter) for not telling me I need to move out for college and graciously not wanting me to rack up student debt while paying my tuition. I know that sometimes I can be a bit entitled and I try my best to check myself and apologize when I see what I've done wrong.\n\nMy mother is an amazing person, smart, funny, assertive! She worked for everything she has in life (she's a teacher too) and I am everything I am today because of her. All my accomplishments, all the luxuries I'm afforded are because of her. She doesn't do my work for me of course but she paves the way for all my work to pay off quite easily because she pays and allows me to stay here. Saying that, however, she's a bit...mean.\n\nShes never really had any empathy for anything if it inconveniences her and her comfort. She has the absolute ideal that the only opinion that matters in the house is hers because its her house and she pays for everything and shes worked for everything. Even in emotional matters, if she thinks a certain way, that's the right way. \n\nI'm a pretty sensitive soul, I cry a lot and I honestly think all my sensitivities and other issues stem from my mom's high expectations of me. Shed praise me and say how proud of me she is but then she would always yell at me if I wasn't up to standard or I made the same mistakes over and over and over again.

But the times that I dont do what she asks or I mess up or make mistakes, she called me useless and mentally r\\*t\\*rd\\*d. I try to plead my case because none of what I do comes out of a place of malice. Ive tried asking for more kindness and leniency, Ive asked her many times if I could have a doctor see what's wrong with me, the whole 9 yards.\n\nEvery single time these things happen she says I shouldn't use mental illness as an excuse or that I'm \"badgering her\". She says that all the time. That me keeping on her, trying to explain my thoughts, feelings, and perspectives are badgering her. It doesn't matter, it's not her opinion so it doesn't matter. She hates when I cry, she laughs at me and says Im playing the victim who wants attention. \n\nSometimes I genuinely fuck up and I see her point of view and I apologize, but other times I just wished she saw how much Im struggling.\n\nHow can I talk to her when she mad at me without badgering her? She just tells me to go the fuck away any time shes mad and if I linger to say anything she screams at me.

The extent of my \"relationship\" knowledge at that point was that the guys who were into me had a big girl kink and didn't want people to know if we hooked up.

        "content": "As a quick summary, most of my \\[18F\\] high school friend groups ended due to covid. My main group in senior year became an already-established group that I kinda got inserted into. It's a mix of guy and girls, and I wasn't part of the large hangouts but I became super close with the girls (call them Penny, Cat, and Ava). Like groupchats, daily midnight calls, random food runs, etc, we even went on vacation together.\n\nOver the summer, all of this inexplicably began to stop - I still don't know why. We still talked, but stopped hanging out like before. Eventually, I was invited to / suggested hangouts with the big group (w/ guys) -- always for casual hangouts though, never their \"normal\" ones. There would be multiple days a week where I'd be crying and breaking down alone at home, knowing that they're all together without a word to me. My boyfriend is also in the group, making it hit even harder.\n\nThen college started, and it's been wonderful. I *love* my roommate, and we quickly became friends with another girl and Cat. There's another large group in my dorm that I'm also part of, so yeah overall I've been really happy and feeling good in college. However, as a result I've also gotten a little more distant with Penny and Ava (Ava goes to another school), while a lot closer to Cat (she and Penny are roommates though).\n\nWinter break has been okay, because most of the HS group has been on vacation so they haven't been able to hang out together. Today though... found out Penny, Cat, and Ava are at the mall. Even though we stopped hanging out over the summer as \"the girls\", the three of them didn't hang out either unless it was with the big group... So this really stings. That they've been occasionally texting in our chat over break but it's probably daily in *their* chat, that none of them cared to think about inviting me, that they're doing things they know I love and just... don't care.\n\nIt's making me **terrified** of summer break. Going from security and happiness to four months of lonely nights only to find out they're all hanging out and having fun without me, four months of smiling and pretending not to die when we meet up and they talk about things that happened, four months of mental breakdowns and disintegrating self-esteem until school starts again. Last summer it was mostly due to the big group, but now the girls are another factor. I just... I don't know if I can go through that again. I barely hung on last summer. Thanksgiving break this year actually led me to suicidal thoughts. I don't know how I'm going to last the four months of summer...\n\ntl;dr - I have a great social life in college, but dreading being left out by high school friends on a daily basis over the summer, and the many incoming mental breakdowns :/",

        "content": "It took me so long to think about whether or not I should post this on reddit, but after reading about 1000 comments on \"gf vs career\", I am just absolutely torn by my situation and any interesting insight would be comforting.\n\nI am a 30 year old M working in tech (remote) and have been living in Ireland for about 5 years. In the first month of Ireland, I met the most beautiful girl (26 F, Taiwanese) I have ever seen in a pub (cliche). I fell in love with her instantly and together we have so much fun. She is very introverted and silent, whereas I am very extroverted and conversational. We love each other with soul and heart. \n\nAfter 6 months of dating, she had to go back to Taiwan due to Visa issues. We did long distance for 2 years with the idea that should would return to Ireland for her work and for us to be together. Then, covid hit and all went to shambles and with no goal in sight we broke up late 2020. \n\nAfter breaking up and my ability to work from home, I moved to Dubai were my family resides and got a remote working visa to live in Dubai permanently. I absolutely loved living in dubai and due to my complex  cultural background (my whole family have different passports), I have never felt truly at home anywhere except for the first time in Dubai.\n\nIn my time living there, I missed her incredibly and I was sure I was not going to see her again. In May 2021, she finally moved to Ireland by herself without me even being there. I was shocked and amazed. So with impulse, I packed my stuff and moved to Ireland to see her. We got along so quickly together that we spent  pretty much 24/7 together.\n\nI told her that I loved living in Dubai and I wanted her to come, because I am simply not happy in Ireland and I can never enjoy myself there. As much as I am with her and we are always together, I always have this hunch that we should be moving to Dubai together. She obviously said that she doestn want to as she just made her move to Dublin.\n\nLast month I went back to Dubai to see my family and friends for a month  by myself. She unfortunately couldnt come. We were on great terms of me going to Dubai. However, as soon as 1 week passed, she has already held it against me, stopped communicating on a daily basis and has slightly threatend me to break up because she diagnosed as clincally depressed and 'i left her alone in ireland'.\n\nI came back for Christmas and NY and she had told me shes going back to Taiwan for a month in February for Lunar new year and that in March she wants to move in together to  avoid any more fights and drama. I asked if I could have the flexibility to go to Dubai every now and then to recharge, but she said no. She said that she will not be okay with me going to Dubai unless she joins or unless she leaves back to Taiwan.   \n\n\nTLDR; Now I am in a position were I need to make a choice. Either I sacrifice my comfort of living in Dubai and choose Irealnd were I am not happy and comfortable , unless I am always with her. Or we break up and I move to Dubai for good and regret missing out on what could be my forever-partner; my future wife.\n\nWhat to do oh fine people of reddit? this is aching my heart and my brain... :(",

        "title": "My (22F) best friend (22F) has turned into a self sabotaging person after her relationship ended. It\u2019s affecting our friendship now.",
        "content": "This is a long one, and still leaves out some of the crappy things she\u2019s done, there\u2019s just so many. Friend and I have been friends since we were 15, always on good terms but didn\u2019t get super close till about a year ago. From ages 15-21 we saw each other maybe a few times a year, more often in school. The past year we\u2019ve been together 24/7. I became pretty close with her and her boyfriend at the time as they lived together so he was pretty much always involved whenever I hung out with her. This didn\u2019t bother me, because he was cool, and he became a friend I trusted. Fast forward, he breaks up with her randomly one morning, ending their relationship of five years. I have no contact with him at all. She spirals out. She\u2019s inconsolable for weeks, not eating, amping up her smoking, throwing up constantly (and I mean everyday), crying at parties, crying to his friends at parties were at with them.  \n\nOnce she finally stopped that spiral, she began acting out in other ways. Now she fucks these two guys, one is 19, who she has sex with with no condom and isn\u2019t on birth control. Another, she doesn\u2019t even like and has said so repeatedly, this one is my least favorite, because he has commented on my body to her about how he\u2019s attracted to a photo she showed him of me and asked my \u201cbra size\u201d to her. She had sex with him that same night. That made me really really uncomfortable especially because he\u2019s a little creepy towards her and he lives in my apartment complex. Third, she still hangs out with her ex a few times a week. This relationship is weird she previously was driving over an hour to go visit him while he was at work in the middle of the night to an unsafe neighborhood (he works security) and now she just goes and visits him while he\u2019s at work and just sits with him for hours just hanging out with him. They have sex constantly as far as the last time I was concerned they still said I love you to one another and they\u2019ve been broken up for seven months. He is talking to numerous girls and having sex with numerous girls which he tells her about but she still just hangs on to him. Fourth guy is her coworker Who barely speaks English and who she leads on and allows him to buy her breakfast and food and all these expensive dinners and has confessed that he\u2019s in love with her twice and she just continues to lead him on because she likes the gifts he gives her.\n\nBesides the chaos of all the men she\u2019s seeing, she takes no accountability for the problems in her life that she causes. She potentially might be moving out of state and instead of just working more hours at work or getting another job she decided to make a premium Snapchat to sell her underwear which her ex-boyfriend gave her the idea of. Our other friend (18F) who we share, her and I have been getting closer and because of this the friend that is the problem has been jealous and is very passive aggressive towards us whenever we hang out without her. When we do invite her along to hang out with the rest of our friend group, she tries to throw us under the bus and make it seem like we don\u2019t invite her places when in reality we do things that she she doesn\u2019t like (like go to the movies). Or times when she\u2019s busy and just makes us look bad to all of our other friends including the guy I like and my other friends boyfriend. \n\nWe\u2019ve brought all this up to her numerous times the past few months. We\u2019ve had the same conversations in hopes of fixing our friendship and strengthening it back to what it used to be. We actually talked last night for hours and still got nowhere. She seems to be under the impression that friendships should be unconditional and that we should just give her a break and accept the lifestyle that she\u2019s going through because she\u2019s still trying to figure herself out. The problem with this is that we\u2019ve been dealing with it for months now and she keeps putting herself in situations that don\u2019t benefit her. These men that she hangs out with don\u2019t treat her right they try to force her to do things and she says she acknowledges that what they\u2019re doing is wrong and says she\u2019s never going to talk to them again and then a week later unblocks them and goes hangs out with them because she\u2019s bored. It\u2019s just not the type of friendship that I want to be involved in. She\u2019s one of my best friends, and has the biggest heart, but she makes terrible life choices in all aspects of her life, not just with men. \n\nShe\u2019s also the sweetest person in the world with the biggest heart, but that\u2019s actually the cause of her problems. Conflicted what to do because it\u2019s just exhausting watching her life unfold the way it is and she doesn\u2019t want to accept our help. Her words were she just wants us to accept her as she\u2019s figuring it out. The problem is , is she isn\u2019t figuring it out. She\u2019s just continuously putting herself in bad situations and expecting us to pick up the pieces. \n\nTL;DR! Best friend has turned into someone I don\u2019t recognize after her boyfriend of five years broke up with her. She now has been giving all her attention to different men and putting herself in situations that put her in danger and expects us to not have any opinion on it and to pick up the pieces when she gets hurt.",

        "content": "I (F20) have been with my bf (FTM24) for 3 years now. The beginning of our relationship was perfect until that one year mark also being around the same time we moved into a place together. 1st problem was he brought a roommate (F40) who is really nice and we both worked with her (I now have a different job at a vet clinic) but that made me feel off because it was our house? But it worked fine I guess. Plus his two dogs (one of them being kind of aggressive who later on bite both me and the roomie. Yup) anyways.. \n\nThis past year has been an absolute nightmare on top of that pandemic stress, there was about 4 months where I didn\u2019t work because my store had closed and I was responsible to take care of his dogs and basically be a housewife which wasn\u2019t terrible but also something I didn\u2019t want because I really wanted to work. And was expected to do everything (cook, clean, and take care of his extremely misbehaved dogs) which I completely understand that he was working but I was also receiving EI and was still paying bills, but received no help from either of the two with house related things. \n\nFast forward a couple months, we barley would talk which was never the case even while living together and had 0 sex because I felt no sexual feelings towards him or anyone. And he always brought that up which made me feel extremely insecure, which made me want to have sex even less. He knew prior that I\u2019m really nervous about intimacy because of abuse but always brought up \u201cbut I\u2019m not him so what\u2019s the issue?\u201d Which I know is a red flag. \n\nI recently moved in with my parents again because it was more convenient for my job plus the fact that he wouldn\u2019t train his dog after months and months of me asking. (Every time I tried to work with him to better his behaviour my bf completely ignored every thing I asked him to do) we really don\u2019t talk much anymore (I used to call him every single night) but slowly stopped because he just wouldn\u2019t text me back after hours or just had really dry conversation. Which is ironic because every time we are actually together he\u2019s on his phone. \n\nThere\u2019s more issues but do I really have time to jump into all of them? Probably not. \n\nHe always tells me that he loves me and wants a life with me but I really don\u2019t see the effort anymore. And I\u2019m just having a hard time breaking up/moving on because he gets so emotional every time I brought it up that I just get so nervous talking about it now. I just don\u2019t know what to do and feel stuck. I know I\u2019m young and have my whole life ahead of me, people always make sure to to tell me that constantly but I\u2019m just afraid. Any advice on what to do to fix it or how to break up and move on?\n\nTL;DR Me (F20) and my bf (FTM24) relationship has been going downhill for months, I\u2019m feeling stuck and unsure where I should go from now, break up or try once again to relight the spark we once had.",

        "title": "Am I a victim, an idiot, or just horrendously naive?",
        "content": "WARNING: Long post\n\nI am m/43. 6\u20194\u201d 380. \n\nIn July of 2014, I (M35) went to a 4th of July picnic at my cousin\u2019s place. About a 3 hr drive from where I lived. She has 10 acres in the boondocks and always hosts parties/picnics. I am shy, and not very personable, especially in crowds. (There was >100 people at the picnic.) The year before, I had a breakup with my GF of over 7 years. I\u2019d say that it was probably 80/20 my fault, mostly untreated depression. Anyway, I met a woman at the picnic who was a coworker of my cousin. Let\u2019s call her (F44) Pat. Pat was there with her boyfriend Bill (M44). At this time, Pat had only been dating Bill for about a month. Pat was about 5\u20195\u201d, 130lbs, and red headed. An absolute knockout. I\u2019d say I\u2019m a 3 at best, and she\u2019s an easy 8. We played cards, ate a shit ton of food, drank a shit load of alcohol, and smoked a shit load of weed. It was getting late, and we ran out of alcohol, so Pat and Bill volunteered to go to town (about 10 miles) and get more. I went to give her $20 for beer, and she flat out refused, but asked if I wanted to go with them. I said sure, and we went. We stayed up until 4 or 5 am partying, and had a great time. \n\nFast forward about 4 months. I had moved to a town closer to where my cousin lived, but still about 45 min away. I had commented on one of my cousin\u2019s FB posts, and apparently Pat saw it and sent me a friend request. I of course was ok with that. I accepted the request, and about 10 minutes later, she sent me a message on messenger saying that she heard that I had moved closer to my cousin, and that she had had a real nice time at the picnic. I told her I did too, and it was fun hanging out with her and Bill. She then asked me something which I thought was kinda weird and cute at the same time. She asked, because I am a big dude and can look intimidating, if I would go to a liquor store with her, and pose as her bf because the guy at the counter was acting creepy. I said sure, kinda laughing it off. I guess I forgot to mention that her current bf Bill lived about 2 hours from her, and they could only see each other on weekends because of their jobs. \n\nShe had just bought a house, and invited me to a housewarming party. I went with my cousin and her husband whom she had also invited. There were probably 20 people there, including Bill. Again, we drank, smoked, and played Trivial Pursuit. It was fun. At about 10pm, Pat was hammered and passed out, and everyone went to leave. She woke up, still hammered, and told everyone goodbye. As we were leaving, she gave me a hug and kissed me on the cheek, thanking me for coming. She also kissed other people, in that same drunken friendly fashion, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. It was nice though, not gonna lie. \n\nShe then messaged me the next day, and apologized for passing out, and then kissing me when I left. Apparently Bill had told her that she made a bit of a fool of herself. I laughed it off, and told her it was no big deal. She had kissed a bunch of other people too. \n\nAnyway, over the next few months, we would chat over text and FB messenger two or 3 times a week. Mostly just memes and shit we both found funny. Then, she started peppering our conversations with little complaints about Bill. How he was waffling on committing to her. I guess they had planned on Bill moving to her city and in with her. I played the sympathetic ear, selfishly and secretly wishing she would dump him, but never telling her that. \n\nOne night, I guess she had found out that Bill was trying to hook up with a mutual friend of theirs. She actually drove up to where Bill lived, and was going to confront him. She was texting me on her way up there. I was working nights. I just told her to be careful. \n\nI guess they had a fight (just verbal) and she left. I messaged her the next day asking her how it went. She said she was done, and she was sad. Again, I was just the proverbial \u201cshoulder to cry on\u201d. Which I was fine with, because A: I was pretty much crazy about her by this time, B: I figured she was waaaay out of my league, and C: I thought this friendship was better than nothing, as imbalanced as it was. \n\nA couple days later, I guess Bill had called and apologized, and had promised to get his shit together and move in with her. She accepted the apology. She told me that she loved him and that she couldn\u2019t stay mad. \n\nOver the next few months, we would keep messaging back and forth. Again, just memes and jokes. We had very similar senses of humor and views on life, politics, religion, etc. And again, I was totally smitten with her, but never led on with that or let her know in any way, shape or form. She would end conversations with \u201cThanks, friend!\u201d Or \u201cTTYL bud!\u201d I thought maybe this was her way of being subtle and letting me know that she didn\u2019t think of me as anything other than a friend. \n\nSo about another month went by, and one night she messaged me and asked what I was doing that night. It was my night off, and she thought I might be going to my cousin\u2019s place to hang out. I told her that I was, but not until the next day. She then asked if I would come over to her house (it was on the way) and help her tear up some carpet. She said she would buy me dinner as payment, and that I could just spend the night, and go to my cousins house in the morning. I was secretly flabbergasted, but said sure, in my most \u201cnot excited\u201d voice. She then said, and this is a direct quote, \u201cJust so you know, you can sleep in my guest bedroom. We\u2019re not going to have sex.\u201d I laughed it off and said jokingly, \u201cJust so we\u2019re clear, when I knock on your door, and you answer it, you\u2019re NOT going to be naked?\u201d She laughed and said no. \n\nSo I drive over there, about 60 miles, and she already had most of the carpet pulled up. I helped her take the rolls outside. It took all of about 20 minutes. We then went and grabbed burgers and beer, and went back to her place. We sat in the living room, and ate our dinner, and drank the beers. We were watching TV, and it was about 10 or 11 o\u2019clock, She said that she was going to take a shower and go bed, because she had to work in the morning. I said ok, and I cleaned up our dinner mess, and went to bed while she was in the shower. \n\nThe next morning, I woke up about 5am, and I was scrolling on my phone, still in bed, and I heard her get up and start getting ready for work. I was still on my phone when she came into the room, and said \u201cI need some snuggle time.\u201d She then got into my bed, and we snuggled. Nothing else happened. She had bed clothes on. To be honest, I was so excited, I wouldn\u2019t have known what to do if anything DID happen. I pretended to drift back to sleep while she laid in my arms. About a half hour later, we got up. She left for work and I went to my cousin\u2019s house. \n\nNow, my cousin and I talked about what happened. She told me that  Pat wanted to hook up, and that I had missed a golden opportunity. Honestly, I had no idea what was happening. I didn\u2019t want to make any move or anything, because I didn\u2019t want to ruin the only friendship I had at the time. I was confused as fuck. I am also no saint by any means, but I knew that Pat and Bill were still an item, and I didn\u2019t really want to get in the middle of anything. But I was totally enthralled with Pat. \n\nSo, a few weeks later, a mutual friend of Pat and myself was having a bday party, and invited us, separately. I was off work that day, and Pat didn\u2019t get off work until 5pm, and the party was at 7pm. Pat suggested that I could come over to her house, and that we could go to the party together. I said ok. She then said that she was running low on funds couldn\u2019t afford to go to dinner before the party. She then told me that she would leave her house key hidden by her front door, and that I could come over and make dinner. I said ok and did so. We went to the party and everything was fine. I didn\u2019t drink, and she had a few but nothing debilitating. We went back to her house, and she told me I could stay over again and leave in the morning and she would go to work. So again, we went to bed, in separate bedrooms. I woke up early the next morning and she was already in bed with me. I didn\u2019t even hear or feel her get in bed. I put my arm around her, but did not do anything else. Later on, her alarm went off and she got up. She told me that I could sleep in and leave whenever I wanted. I really wasn\u2019t comfortable with that, so I got up and went home. She hugged me before I left and thanked me for going to the party with her. \n\nIt was probably a week or so later, and she had texted me a couple of pics of Bill that she had taken at a party that they went to. He was obviously drunk, and dancing with a female friend of theirs. Along with the pics, she had said \u201cCan you believe this shit?\u201d I was kinda pissed, and asked her if she had said anything at the time, and she said no. I then told her that she needed to be honest with him, and let him know her feelings. Either shit or get off the pot. Put the bandage on the relationship, or rip it off and move on. She agreed, and again mentioned that she was still in love with him. I didn\u2019t answer for about half an hour. I then messaged her back and said that I couldn\u2019t tell her to be honest without being honest myself. So I told her that I was smitten with her. I admitted that I was scared to say anything because I didn\u2019t want to screw whatever our relationship was up. \n\nShe thanked me for being honest, and again said that she was in love with Bill. She then said that she was too old for me. I didn\u2019t press the issue. She\u2019s 9 years older than me. She then said that I probably shouldn\u2019t sleep over anymore (she was the one who suggested both sleepovers). She said that she liked me as friend, and would like to remain so. I agreed. \n\nI talked to my cousin right after this and told her what happened. She of course told me to keep my chin up. \n\nThe next day, Pat texted me, and apologized for \u201csending mixed messages\u201d. I guess my cousin had confronted Pat at work the next day about her behavior. I played it off, and accepted the apology. \n\nWe pretty much stopped communicating after that, but still remained FB friends. I was also FB friends with Bill. \n\nAbout a year later, they ended up getting married. I sent them both a message of congratulations. That was in 2017. \n\nI am not going to lie, I was pretty devastated when we stopped talking. But I understood that it was probably better for the both of us. It killed me when they got married, but I didn\u2019t tell her anything of course. \n\nI continued to see their life over FB over the next few months. My pathetic ass didn\u2019t have the balls to unfriend her. I did unfollow them both so I wouldn\u2019t see their posts anymore. And once in a while, I would check their pages. Like I said, I was a weakling for just not unfriending them both. \n\nThis went on for the next few years, with me checking their pages less and less. I think the last time I checked their pages was 8 or 9 months ago. I have since moved back to my hometown. I have a decent job and my own house and car. And I\u2019m still single. I\u2019ve not had any relationships, or even dated since all this happened. Not because of her, but because I\u2019m still a fat shy dude. \n\nTwo days ago, Pat messaged me on FB saying hello and asking how I was. She also said that her and Bill were getting a divorce. I have not responded to the message. I haven\u2019t talked to either of them in 4 years. I don\u2019t even know if I SHOULD respond. \n\nLike I said, it took me a while to get over that heartbreak. I am feeling good now. But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m setting myself up for another disappointment if I respond. Is she sincere? Am I comfortable with being someone\u2019s second choice? Am I pathetic if I AM comfortable with that? I am at a total loss on how to proceed. \n\nI don\u2019t think Pat had nefarious intentions with what happened before. I\u2019ve kinda just blamed it on myself for being inexperienced with women, and maybe not having a high level of self esteem. Before my relationship of 7 years, I had not received any attention from women. And I haven\u2019t since this thing with Pat. I was just so mind-blown that a woman like her would have ANY interest in me. For a long time, I would go back and forth with \u201cHow could she have any interest in you?\u201d and \u201cMan you missed out on something because you were too much of a wimp to do anything.\u201d \n\nSorry for the long post, I just thought I had to get my thoughts out as succinctly as possible. \n\nSo whadya think Reddit? \n\nTL;DR\nI might\u2019ve been played emotionally by a confused woman awhile back, or I\u2019m just a fat inexperienced dude who hasn\u2019t grown up, relationship-wise. Now this woman has contacted me again, and I don\u2019t know what to do.",

I have a pretty high sex drive and am a very sexual touchy feely person. She is not. This last semester was the worst college has ever been as has life in general. This was for both of us. As a result we didn't have sex for basically 4 months and didn't really have anytime for our relationship. Now in the past, for different reasons, we have gone 2ish months at a time with no sex. I should note she is very happy sexually in the relationship. Over winter break we had a good few rolls in the hay and the first were quickies and rather meh, then we had a solid go at it and she was satisfied and I geuss I was too. But after it was over I just had this feeling of ...... Idk dissatisfaction. In my head I just had the string sudden thought of\" I don't know if this is working for me?\" \" Idk if I want to keep doing this\". I have now spent the last couple weeks thinking about this and have no conclusion. I love her dearly and this relationship is extremely extremely important to me. We have also been having more and more tiffs/ Lossing patience with each other and arguments over the semester. We talked about it and both noted we were both unbelievably stressed and sorry. But this trend hasn't really change much over winter break. For me in particular I find myself more easily unhappy and angered in situations with each other. I'm wondering what all this means if anything. This is both of ours first successful long term relationship. We have both had many sexual partners  and are not stranger to relationships but this whole healthy long-term thing is new for both of us. I don't want to end things. But I am worried that I need to. And I don't want to be dishonest or lead her on or be selfish about all of this. I also k no ow that I have a tendency to over react. I'm just looking for advice.\n\nTL;DR!\nme and my GF of 2.5 years love each other but had sex after a long no sex string and know I'm having doubts about my feelings.",

        "content": "My (23M) wife (25F) have been married for nearly 3 years. It started out great. My wife was working while I finished up school, so I did ALL of the housework (cooking, cleaning, laundry, you name it, I did it.) because I had a bit more time for that. That was a totally okay and fair arrangement that we had and I was happy with it. \n\nAs we approached my graduation, I expressed my hopes that she would start helping me out a bit more around the house, since we were both going to be working all day and I wouldn't be as free. She gladly said she would help out. \n\nFast forward a year to now. I still routinely cook all of our meals, clean every dish, wash and fold every article of clothing, vacuum, mop, and take care of all things around the house, (genuinely, I can't name one thing she does). I work until about 6 or 6:30 each night, and then have to cook us dinner. After that, I do any cleaning that is needed before I finally have time to sit down. What is she doing while I'm doing all of this? Sitting on the couch. \n\nA few other items I want to note: She showers once every 10 days, she goes 3-4 days between brushing her teeth or putting on deodorant. She doesn't take care of herself physically and has gained about 50 lbs since we got married (which is normal,\u00a0 but I'm the guy who goes to the gym at 6AM, and fitness is really important to me) I run every errand we have and do the grocery shopping alone. She'll leave all of her trash on the ground after she's done with it, and I have to pick it up. And lastly, our sex life is really non existent. She doesn't come on to me. I could come onto her more, sure, but when she hasn't showered, brushed her teeth, or worn deodorant in who knows how long it's not ideal. All of these I've talked to her about improving those as well, and they were taken well. Promises and assurances were made she would do better with them, but those also have been empty. \n\nI moved from my hometown and away from my family to be with her. I don't have friends where I am, it's pretty much only her. I really did sacrifice a lot to be with her. I put in loads of effort to our relationship and don't receive any effort back. I tend to fill empty inside most of the time. I don't have friends here to go get drinks with or even to talk to. And to make matters worse, we both work from home and we will in a one bedroom apartment. We are together 24 hours a day. I've noticed the last few weeks I've felt sad, angry, and overall empty, and realized everything I've said above was why. I don't know what to do because talking to her about this has not helped and has only resulted in unfulfilled promises and hope of change which is obviously not coming. \n\nWhat do I do next? \n\nTL;DR\nMy wife has not done any household work for the past year and beyond, leaving it exclusively to me despite us both working 40+ hours a week. She has non existent personal hygiene and doesn't take care of herself. And I'm getting to the point if having enough.",

        "content": "Hello all, this is a very personal issue to me so I\u2019ll give some background but try to keep it brief. \n\n\nAt 16 years old my mother passed and I was independent afterwards. When I graduated high school my aunt let me stay with her for two years till I transitioned to university and then for one year after I graduated. The thing is throughout that time of staying with her I often times did not feel welcomed. Granted I never payed any rent (although they asked me to right before I moved out which expedited my move and mind you they did not need the financial help) I always felt I had to earn my right to be there. There were times where she would say she \u201clet\u201d me stay there. She would yell at me if I didn\u2019t have the dishwasher unloaded before she got off work. She would check my room to make sure the bed was made each morning. She would get upset if all the drawers weren\u2019t perfectly closed. I always felt like I had to tip toe around. I\u2019d pretty much stay in my room. It never felt like home to me. I always felt like the black sheep and they took me in out of obligation kind of and were ready to crack the whip if I ever made a mistake. \n\n\nAs stated before I\u2019m 24 and finish my masters next semester. I\u2019ve never not been in school or worked. Anyhow, one day things got really bad this time it wasn\u2019t my aunt but my uncle. He found out I ate upstairs even though I know it\u2019s against the house rules. He called me deceptive untrustworthy and as punishment decided to make me pay rent. Given my traumatic background this sent me into a depressive episode and I moved out of the house and the state two months later with my partner. Since then I haven\u2019t really talked to anyone in the household much. They may have called once and in return I have called once. I know my aunt wants me to call more and always tells me to call. Almost like she\u2019s letting me know she won\u2019t make the first move. My question is should I be calling and reaching out more? I honestly don\u2019t have the desire to I just feel guilty. Despite the BS I am grateful for them giving me a place to stay and I know ultimately they do love me and I don\u2019t wanna seem ungrateful. What should I do?\n\nTLDR; living with my aunt was very traumatizing and stressful at some points and since I\u2019ve moved out we don\u2019t talk much. Should I be reaching out more even if she doesn\u2019t initiate the call?",

        "content": "So I live in a share house with several guys, and I am the only girl. This house is basically a two level mansion with eight bedrooms.\n\nAll of the guys are quite nice and they are pretty good looking. I have a boyfriend so I\u2019m only friends with them. \n\nI have a girl friend who I\u2019ve known for the last 7 or so months through a mutual acquaintance. I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s my best friend or anything, but we do text every day and hang out every other weekend or so. She\u2019s a nice and sweet girl, but has a lot of issues (depression/anxiety/low self esteem etc). In the past, she attempted suicide several times before she was put on antidepressants.\n\nShe also does not have much luck with men. Her face is quite cute, but over the years she gained a fair amount of weight (not obese though) which not all guys like, especially since her photos use heavy filters and don\u2019t reflect how she actually looks in person. She chases men aggressively which turns a lot of guys off. Also, sometimes she says things which are tactless and inappropriate for the situation (such as telling everyone she\u2019s just met at a party what medication she\u2019s on, and rambling on about other guys she\u2019s been talking to in front of someone she\u2019s interested in). \n\nAnyway, for NYE I had a small gathering at my house, the plan was just to drink with my housemates and boyfriend mostly. She asked if she could come over since she didn\u2019t have any other plans for the day. \n\nOne of my housemates is a 28 year old British guy who is tall and reasonably charismatic/good looking. I have gone drinking with him a few times as friends, and he is pretty chummy with my boyfriend as well.\n\n Anyway, my friend was obsessed with him as soon as she saw him at my house. As everyone got more and more drunk she started saying the same tactless things (OMG this and this guy is calling me, I\u2019m on this medication, bla bla bla). Then, she started to aggressively hit on my housemate, being all over him and clinging super hard. He was obviously annoyed but at the same time kind of horny? I guess. So they went back to his bedroom and hooked up.\n\nShe slept over at my house in his bedroom, the next day we all had breakfast in the kitchen together. He was being polite to her and also drove her home but you could tell he was NOT interested in her. It was obvious he had regretted sleeping with her. \n\nAfterwards, my friend became so obsessed with him. She texted him like an insane amount of times, tried to call him, told him she told her family about him. He became scared of her and stopped responding to her. She became even more aggressive and told me to ask him about her and also asked our other friend to text him. \n\nOne night he talked to me and said that she was way too full on and that he didn\u2019t know what to do. He also said he wished that he hadn\u2019t slept with her. I told him to tell her he wasn\u2019t interested, but to this day he still hasn\u2019t said anything to her. \n\nShe however is getting progressively more.. crazy? She keeps telling me that she really likes him and that she\u2019s planning on texting him more. And told me that she feels so disposable with suicidal thoughts. She even went to this creepy tinder guy\u2019s house last night and hooked up with him, telling me that she did it to take her mind off my housemate.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do and in all honesty I don\u2019t wanna be her friend anymore.\n\nTL;DR my friend hooked up with my housemate, he rejected her afterwards, but she is getting progressively more obsessed and aggressive towards him",

        "content": "I would like to start by saying I am completely at fault here by failing to express my emotions properly.\n\nI (29 M) am from south Asian country where arranged marriages are pretty common. I met my current wife  (27 F) through this process where my parents arranged. My parents gave complete freedom to me as well if I wanted to go ahead with the match or not. The match was arranged about a year ago in December 2020 and because of Covid , we got sometime to get to know each other better. During this time my wife completely fell in love with me but I didn\u2019t. My main problem was with the attraction. I am not at all attracted to my wife from beginning but I thought that attraction was not imp as much as love. I spent the entire year with her and I saw that she loved me to death even though I ignored her. There were certain complaints from her side that I am not giving proper attention to her but I always gave excuses. Anyways after almost a year, I was still where I started with no attraction and no love. My current wife at that time noticed these and even gave me the option to back out. But I was too scared because of the backlash I would receive and thought that i would later develop feelings for her. So I convinced her that I would do more and since she is in love with me she was easily convinced. Fast forward, I married her about 4 weeks ago with typical big fat wedding. I now am with her daily for the past 4 weeks and couldn\u2019t bring myself to face her. I cannot see her face as I\u2019m not at all attracted to her and keeps comparing her to my ex and literally find most other girls attractive and not my wife at all. I understand that love is more imp than attraction but I just cannot convince myself now with that. I am going into depression because of this and my wife is starting to notice this as well. I want my marriage to work but I just don\u2019t know how. I finally confessed to her that I\u2019m not attracted to her and she said she would do everything to make herself attractive to me. But I\u2019m not sure if I can ever find her attractive. I am depressed thinking about this and feel like not only ruined my life but her life and lives of two families.\n\nAny other redditors in this scenario, could you please help me? We can\u2019t divorce because of social stigma and I want my marriage to work. I really want to love my wife but just can\u2019t seem to go beyond her physical appearance. Is it possible to change my way of thinking ? Are there any redditors who were in this situation and overcame this ? \n\nTL;DR: I am only looking at attraction element of my wife and not able to feel her love because of it, is it possible to change my mind to look for her love and not just her facial beauty ?",

        "content": "Hello! So, this question is mostly for users my age that are students or unemployed and have an employed partner.\n\nSo, I (18F) and my partner (19M) have been together for a year now. He's an amazing guy, our relationship is fantastic and we are serious about each other. \n\nI'm in high school, graduating this year, will stay at that school for an additional year to get my certificate in graphic design and then I'm planning on going to college. So I'm a full time student, with no income and will probably stay this way for a few years.\n\nMy boyfriend had a very unfortunate upbringing to put it nicely and as a result of that he dropped out of high school, moved to The Netherlands where my step father took him in and they found a job for him. (We all are Hungarians, I haven't moved to The Netherlands permanently yet, step dad and boyfriend did). So he's been employed full time for a few months, loves his job and his boss is satisfied with his work.\n\nSo, no problem with that. He's doing great, I'm very proud of him. \n\nSo my \"issue\" is that from now on he's the one that's gonna pay for my plane tickets and tests (my mom and step father asked him to) and now he's planning on buying me a new phone since I mentioned that I'd like to have a new one because my current one's back is cracked and there are slight burn-ins on the screen.\n\n Don't get me wrong I'm incredibly thankful! But I won't be able to pay it back in the near future and don't want to take advantage of him or something. And it's not that I absolutely need a new phone because this one works fine too it's just a bit old and has a cracked back that can be replaced easily.\n\nEvery time I tell him not to waste his money on me, he corrects me and says \"our money\". But I cannot contribute to it with anything yet and even though I know that the reason he moved here for work to begin with was that he could start saving up for our future and genuinely thinks of it as ours, not just his, I feel bad. \n\nIt's not that he spends a bunch because he doesn't. And he spends a fair share of it on (cheap) consoles for himself too. But that phone is 300 euros and starting our own life is always rough. We could use that same money for more important things and I feel guilty for it even though I know it's not a huge amount.\n\nSo I guess my question is this: \n\npeople that are in a similar situation, how do you deal with it? Do you let your partner buy you moderately expensive things? If so, how do you return the favor? How do you even it out?\n\n(Please do not advise breaking up for some reason because as I said oue relationship is fantastic and I love him with my all. So ending it over this is not a realistic option.)\n\nTLDR: My partner is employed, I am not because I'm a full time student, he wants to buy things for me, including a new phone and I feel guilty because I can't pay it back",

        "content": "\nHi all, \nSo my mom has had severe depression for a good 5/6 years now and has been through two messy divorces in her life one about 4 years ago with my dad. I have two siblings but my sister has a really fraught relationship with my mom over lots of things in the past and my brother is basically never at the house he lives at with my mom (it\u2019s insane how a person can be out of the house as much as he is I\u2019m talking there are full days where he doesn\u2019t come home at all) .\n\nAll this leads to the fact that I am the person who my mom talks to and confides in the most. And I hate it. First she is *constantly* talking shit about everyone in her life, my sister especially who I have a great relationship with making it quite hard to hear. Second, if she isn\u2019t doing that she\u2019s recounting some trauma from her past, most of which I have heard before numerous times making it again really uncomfortable and is frankly boring at this point. I do constantly try and talk about light hearted subjects with her but somehow they always get twisted into her going back to either if these two conversation points. Even if I try and validate her feelings (something I did do a lot previously) it didn\u2019t seem to help her because she thought that she was right and everyone hates her but when I counter her arguments she then yells and argues with me while crying which obviously doesn\u2019t make me feel good.\n\nAll this to say talking to her is a consistently stressful endeavour. Lately this has also been manifesting as her being really jealous that I have friends I want to see when I\u2019m back home from uni. For example, I spoke to my friend for 3 hours on the phone yesterday, which is a long time I am aware, but I spent 2 hours straight that morning talking to her and then obviously would spend the rest of the day (about 4 hours) after the call with my Mom. But she called up to me and told me to get off the phone because I\u2019d been ignoring her. This is one of many examples where I will want to spend time with friends and despite the fact that overall I will have spent more time with her it\u2019s not good enough and she yells at me for not caring about her.\n\nIs there literally anything I can do in this situation? I am just kind of sick to death of feeling bad when I\u2019m with my mom but also feeling nothing but guilty when I don\u2019t talk to her because as she\u2019s tried to explain a few times now she\u2019s mentally ill and I am her only confidant and friend so the only time she can get things off her chest is to me. It\u2019s just a really heavy burden to bear and I honestly don\u2019t want to bear it but she\u2019s my Mom and I respect how she\u2019s kept herself together while I was still young to help me out and she now needs the support.\n\nAnd to clarify she\u2019s aware that an issue is that she has no friends but the depression is preventing her from going to make some. I\u2019ve offered to go to many different things with her to meet other people and she has refused to go even when we are about to leave.\n\nTL;DR Mom has no friends and so confides some really awful things to me and gets jealous when I hang out with mine. Is there any way I can get around feeling bad when I speak to her?\n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone for all of your comments it was quite eye-opening to hear so many people say this isn\u2019t normal and I am suddenly thinking \u201cyeah, this isn\u2019t normal, why have I been putting up with this\u201d.

Extremely painful breakup, while I was dealing with complex PTSD, depression and my mom who was just diagnosed with cancer, all while still building a business and providing for us, he started an emotional affair, then lied about it, manipulated me by using my trauma\u2019s against me making me believe I was being paranoid, and then gaslit me. It\u2019s not even the breakup that is so painful, it\u2019s the betrayal from my best friend in the whole world. \n\nSo, now I\u2019m alone in our house which we bought together 2 years ago, which we completely remodelled together. And I don\u2019t know what to do with it.\n\nEither we sell it (both unable to buy a new house and will have to rent), or my dad wants to buy out my ex so I can stay here. (I will of course pay his part of the mortgage then as well)\n\nIt\u2019s a great place to live, I have a dog and 2 cats, and incredibly nice (but old) neighbours. It will be very expensive to live here alone and I will have to work even more to pay it all, but at least I\u2019ll be paying off a mortgage which to me is money for my future (if I rent I just throw away money).\n\nBut, can I ever enjoy this house again? Can it ever be a home again without him? Can I ever feel happy in the house where he betrayed me? And broke a piece of my soul? \n\nRight now my memories are making me see him everywhere. Together cooking, cuddling on the sofa, watching our favourite shows, remodelling the house together, our first time seeing the house, our first puppy together.\n\nAnd the evenings are the worst, it gets lonely. How could he, my best friend, do this to me. I see him in my memories, together in this house, and I really can\u2019t believe it.\n\nI added no kids to my opening question because I\u2019m completely alone, besides the pets, I think it\u2019s (still painful of course) but different if you have your kids to focus on and who keep you going. So I\u2019d love to hear from someone who went through something similar.\n\nTL;DR: very painful breakup after 5 years after betraying, if I stay in our home which we bought and built together, and is filled with memories, good and bad, can it ever be my home again without him and without all the pain? Can I be happy here?",

She lost a huge amount of weight due to her living habit.\nBefore leaving home my gf was like cinderella, doing absolutely everything for her family, from laundry to cooking and cleaning. She was the only one with a driving licence to, so she did almost everything.\nI have always found it very unhealthy, she was like \u00e0 slave.\n\nBefore moving, her family was really supportive of her decision to move with me. But yet they are giving my girlfriend a hard time for leaving the house to the point where its becoming suffocating. Especially her little sister who always seems to take great pleasure in telling her that she is responsible for their mothers suffering. \n\nI dont know what to do to help her, my girlfriend takes everything to heart and is very affected by the situation.\nI support her as best i can, but the whole situation is getting to me as well.\n\nTL;DR: my girlfriends family is overwhelming, how can i be a good partner and support her the best i can?",

        "content": "Apologies in advance, this is kinda long. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this\n\nAbout a month ago, I (27M) matched with a girl (24F) on Hinge. She's asexual/demisexual, this will come into play later. We instantly clicked and only after a few messages, we exchanged numbers. Conversation was flowing and she was checking a lot of my boxes about what I was looking for, as was I for her. She's smart, funny, gorgeous, into the same music as me, etc. I was excited to meet her and she was excited to meet me. She had apparently told her friends about me, before we even met in person. Conversation with her was easy and also really flirty. So much so, that we shared nudes with each other over Snapchat, even before meeting. I really liked this girl and was really hoping this would go somewhere, hopefully a relationship. From what she told me, she felt the same way. So we planned a day to go on a date.\n\nHowever, the day before our date, I had gotten my Covid booster. I scheduled this a few weeks in advance and had kinda forgotten about it. I thought I'd be fine, as I felt okay most of the day afterwards, but as I was going to bed, that's when it hit. I woke up feeling like absolute shit and let her know that we might need to reschedule. She said that's okay, she'd also be fine with just hanging out at her apartment, if I felt okay enough to do that. I kinda toughed it out because I really wanted to meet her. I show up, we're both awkward, but the chemistry is nice. We kissed, cuddled, watched YouTube videos, and ordered pizza, all while sitting together on her couch. After eating, I started feeling sick, so I ended up leaving. After getting home, I sent her a text apologizing for feeling sick and that I'd love to see her again. She said it was okay and couldn't wait to see me again.\n\nThe next night, she invited me back to her apartment. I was feeling much better. Given my feelings for her and the previous conversations we had, I brought condoms with me to her apartment. Sex was not expected, but I wanted to be safe, just in case. We pretty much do the same thing as the previous night; sit on her couch, cuddling, talking, and watching YouTube videos. After a few hours, she tells me she needs to work in the morning, so she needs to go to bed. She kinda awkwardly tells me that I'm welcome to stay with her, if I'd like. I agree, so we get ready for bed. We crawl into bed together and spoon. I'm the big spoon. I'm rubbing her thigh with my hand as we're laying there, completely terrified of whether something was going to happen. Should I make a move or not? She's kinda reacting to my hand and grinding on me. After maybe 10 minutes of dancing around the thought in the head, I speak up and ask her, \"hey, do you maybe wanna make out?\" She turns around to me almost immediately and says \"hmmmm... Yeah, okay.\" So we start making out and things heat up quickly. My hand goes under her shirt, feeling around, but I'm not touching any intimate areas without consent. She notices this and asks me \"you want to touch my boobs, don't you?\" I say yes, so she gives me the go-ahead. She guides my hands to her boobs. She then asks me if she can touch me, I say yes, so her hands go in my pants. I ask her the same thing and she says yes, so my hand goes in her pants. Clothes start to come off at this point and **she asks me** if I want to have sex. I say yes, and I tell her I brought condoms with me. She's cool with it and also mentions she's on birth control. I go grab a condom from my jacket and then we have sex. I'm really into it. She seems really into it. There's no indications to me whatsoever that's she's not enjoying this or is uncomfortable with what's happening\n\nAfter we finish, we clean up then crawl back into bed together and cuddle. At this point, we're wide awake, so we start talking about little things like what our families do, favorite color, etc. She asks me now that we've had sex, do I plan on ghosting her now? I reassure her that no, I really like her, I'm not going to ghost her. So we cuddle and fall asleep together. \n\nIn the morning, everything seems fine. She's a little quiet, but nothing out of the ordinary. We're both awkward, shy people. We get ready to leave, I kiss her goodbye, then she leaves for work and I head back home. After this, this is when things start to go downhill. The conversations become much shorter and colder. What used to be nearly instant replies, now becomes hours later. What used to be paragraphs, now becomes short sentences. I'm thinking maybe she thinks the sex wasn't good and has lost interest. I'm not really sure, but I'm feeling really anxious. After a few days of this, I ask her if everything is okay between us. She reassurres me everything is fine, she's just busy with work. We hang out at her apartment a couple more times and I stayed the night, but we didn't have sex, because she was feeling asexual. I also took her on a really romantic date based around things she liked, she seemed to have fun. With that said, after a few more weeks of feeling like shit because our of dynamic completely changing to where I feel like she's uninterested and like I did something wrong, she finally tells me she's just too busy to date. She's wants to focus on her career and has some things she needs to work on with herself, but she'd love to stay friends. Obviously, I'm hurt by this, but I agree to try and stay friends. We still text a little, but she's still distant. We don't hang out anymore. To me, because of the feelings I have for me, I feel like a friendship like this isn't going to work out and isn't fair to either of us. So I tell her exactly that am how I'm feeling.\n\nThis ends up in a very drawn out, emotional conversation. She tells me that she identifies as asexual because of some bad experiences in the past with guys. She was not ready to have sex with me and did not enjoy the experience. She says she doesn't feel like I did anything wrong and she really needs to go to therapy to get this sorted out, but also says she felt pressured and like she couldn't say no in the moment and was angry that I had \"woken her up\" and asked her to make out. These are reasons why she did not want to date me any longer and why she was being distant with me. I'm completely taken aback and feel like shit. I didn't know she felt this way. I knew she was asexual and had some bad experiences, but I didn't know the full details until now. I didn't know she was asleep, she responded to me immediately. She's the one that asked me if I wanted to have sex, not the other way around. I asked for consent at every step and tried to make sure she felt comfortable. If she had said no, that would've been fine. I didn't want her to feel like sex was a requirement. I really liked this girl. I really cared about her. But now it basically feels like she's accusing me of assault. Since this conversation, we longer no longer talk. We've unfriended each other and have gone separate ways.\n\nSo I've been replaying all of this is my head for the last week or so. Did I do anything wrong? Did I legitimately assault her?\n\nTL;DR: asexual Hinge date leads to a lot of confusion",

        "content": "\nTL;DR! - Perfect 5 yr relationship, BF now wants to now be single to find himself after ADHD diagnosis. He says he still loves me more than anything - Confused and hurt\n\nSorry for the long story in advance\u2026\n\nMe (f27) and my BF (m29) have been together for nearly 5 years. From the day we met we have always had a great time together, and we have what everyone calls the perfect relationship. I also thought from the things we say to eachother and do together that this was it, forever.  We both have good paying jobs and are financially secure, have bought a house together etc. We can spend time apart whenever wanted, we don\u2019t have any jealousy issues etc.\nIt\u2019s what I imagined a fairytale life to be, we rarely argue and if we do we more often than not see positive change from our disagreements. \n\nWe are so similar in some ways (love the same music, both enjoy the gym, love chilling out and having a laugh together). We are also different in some ways (he is more laid back whilst I am a bit more anxious). We have both always said that we balance each other and help each other grow because of this. \n\nHere it might be worth mentioning that I have had some anxiety issues in the past - I\u2019ve been having counselling for this for nearly a year and am much improved, I can cope well and rarely feel anxious anymore. This was always to do with past trauma wounds and I never used to get anxious about our relationship). He has just been diagnosed with ADHD, and I cannot imagine how hard this has been, to suddenly be medicated and able to live with a different more productive brain function after nearly 30 years. (He has now been medicated for 4 months).\n\nEverything was fine, and we just spent a lovely Christmas in our first home together which we bought nearly 9 months ago. We were building our lives together into something awesome and had a very strong future ahead. I have always felt so loved and secure with him and I know he feels the same from what he\u2019s said. We had mentioned getting married etc but I never put any pressure on him as I wanted him to do it in his own time.\n\nAfter Xmas, I got home from spending 2 nights with my family, and he sat me down and revealed that over the past couple of days he had been thinking that he maybe needed to be by himself for a while to \u2018find himself\u2019. This of course came as a huge shock to me, it was totally out of the blue and literally days before we were saying how excited we were for our next year together. \n\nI could never imagine either of us ever considering not being together due to the deep love we have and great relationship. He has never ever suggested being separated before and we have made promises of forever to each other. \n\nHe said he could finally be the person he wanted to be his whole life now he is medicated, and wanted to experience life alone because of this (sorting out a household alone, paying bills etc) . He said he wants to commit to ours lives together but for some reason isn\u2019t 100% sure and couldn\u2019t put a finger on the reason. I had a hard time understanding how you can have literally 0 problems in a relationship and still want to question it, and also am unsure if living alone would be a solution. Also I was confused by these thoughts only having been for 2 days, surely you would be thinking about something like this slowly for months? \n\nWe talked for hours and he then came to the conclusion that it was more a self confidence thing and wanting to have a good self image and he thought leaving me whilst he worked that out would be the best thing, but then realised that it can still be worked on with us being together. \n\nHe suggested it might be due to the fact he never had proper relationships before me and so has nothing to compare this to, and really know what he wants from a relationship. But I haven\u2019t had a huge amount of relationships either and I can say for certain I would never give this up, I felt secure and safe, trusted him completely, felt loved and had affection, great sex life, had so much fun together, what else could I want!\n\nWe have gone back and forth and now He has again said he thinks it would be best to be alone whilst figuring it out. I am struggling to understand his thoughts as selling the house would take months, where would we stay in between etc, there\u2019s a lot of problems with this. Everyone says how much they wish they had a relationship like this, and we always say to eachother how lucky we are to have this. \n\nI know we would both be technically \u2018okay\u2019 if we broke up but I\u2019m just so confused\u2026why?  I cannot bear to lose him (although I won\u2019t beg for someone to stay with me), my heart is so broken. Any advice is welcome, please.",

Awkwardness about rent.\n\nSo I have an agreement with my mother that I am allowed to live in a property she purchased partially as an investment, partially for me. Math was done and it worked out best for everyone rather than me paying rent in someone's basement. I've been in the process of going back to school and getting a handle on life and my mother has said she will wave my rent and supplement my student loan as long as I am in school. I am immensely grateful for her, cause I put her through my shit for years, but I am making my best effort. \n\nRecently my friend needed a place to stay and I offered her a room. $500 a month + 1/2 Utilities. My mother stopped supplementing me and allowed me to pocket the rent. Well 4 months later and we're now dating. I now feel weird asking for rent now. I don't pay my mother, and technically the money my girlfriend would pay just would go to my mother and she would have to just pass it back to me as she would need to supplement me again.\n\nTl,dr Is it wrong/weird to make my girlfriend pay me rent to live in, what is essentially, my house when I do not pay rent due the required support of my mother?",

        "title": "How Can I (26F) Deal with My Parents (50s M and F) Not Paying Me Back almost $6K I Lent Them",
        "content": "Hi Reddit. Apologies for the long post. I assumed this was the best subreddit to post, but if not let me know where might be better.\n\nMy parents have had financial issues for years. My dad makes money, he\u2019s just so bad at managing it. I have literally offered to help him find billers or personal assistants just to help him make sure his cash comes in properly but it never goes anywhere. I have always been there to lend them money or be a stop-gap to help fill in for bills.\n\nMy issues with money with my family go way back. In high school they made me give up a few full rides for college to go to a prestigious school because they claimed they would pay for the difference. Turns out they couldn't pay the difference and I took out unexpected loans. In the end, I got an elite fancy degree, but the sting of paying for a college education that I could have gotten for free, especially since I'm not on a career path that is brand name college heavy is something that to this day I still silently resent them for.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2021, my family asked me for money like in the thousands of dollars. At the time I was making about $48 k a year, so I wasn\u2019t broke but also far from balling. I had paid off one of my private loans + my car (I lived really cheaply so I had good savings and thought it was a good time to get rid of some debts). I paid $5k for someone in my family to go to school\u2026only for them to essentially forfeit the semester and my $5k went to waste. I took that as a loss on my end, but it really hurt because I was led to believe this person was serious about their education and they just were not, and if I had known that I would not have spent that money. I helped pay for so many big bills, I also co-signed for a car note for someone because I had a good credit score (I know majorly dumb on my part). I helped pay other bills. Aside from the $5k I spent on tuition, I lent my family another $7200 that was explicitly promised to be given back to me. I recognize that was dumb, but I don\u2019t know I really believed this would be given back to me.\n\nAnyway, I had a mini-life crisis. I just didn\u2019t like my job and had been tired of living in the same state and honestly needed a break from my family. Towards the end of the summer of 2021, I quit my full-time job and moved to freelance work. I also moved out of my parent's house to one of the most expensive cities. I did this under the assumption I\u2019d eventually get the money from my parents back, which was not a smart decision. I fully admit it was an impulsive choice, but in all honesty, it did improve my mental health.\n\nHowever, moving to a new city drained everything I had left in my savings. Like I started getting financial anxiety I had not gotten in a long time. I actually started to charge stuff on my credit cards which I had kept at $0 balances for so long. This is when I really started pressing my parents to pay me back because it was getting to the point where I really really needed that money back. Welp, I only got $1500 of the $7200 I lent to my parents. The only reason I got the $1500 was that I threatened to not come home for Christmas until they gave me something. I have expressed my frustration multiple times. My mom at least does apologize. It was really emotionally disconcerting to be in a rocky financial situation and just not get help from them.\n\nAnyway, it took like 2 months to get the very stark reality check that I can\u2019t sustain myself on freelance work in my new expensive town. I went job hunting, and I'm starting a full-time job later this month which pays about $70k annually. Financially, I'll be totally fine without them paying me back. It's just emotionally I'm struggling with.\n\nI'm trying to remain levelheaded about the situation because: 1) I get that my parents asked me for money as a last resort. I know they did not want to take money out of spite but out of desperation. 2) Realistically, I should have not lent money that I couldn't live without and I should not have co-signed a loan for someone. I could have said no, and did not 3) I'm the one who made the choice to move to my current city without understanding just how wildly expensive it is and how my freelance work + my dwindling savings wouldn't cut it. If I hadn\u2019t done that the missing $5k from my parents would have not been as devastating.\n\nLike I love my family, I love my support system. In everything but money, I am happy with them. But it's just not sitting right with me, that they would promise me something and not give it back. I have found myself withdrawing from them and I hate it. I find myself answering their calls less and when I visit them I find that I spend more time away from them than with them. My mom the other day asked me for $100 and I literally did not even want to speak to her till 2 days later bc it made me so mad. I eventually did send the $100 to her. When I got my Christmas present which wasn't particularly exciting or expensive my first thought was \"this cost a fraction of the car note I've been paying monthly for you all\" not \"wow thanks for the gift\". I literally don't want to think like that. I don't want to be that person. I'm struggling with how to navigate our relationship with this really hard backdrop.\n\nI don't want to avoid my or be mad at my parents because of money issues. I just don't want to keep being upset or angry by this since it's not like it's life or death. Does anyone have advice on how I can just accept the reality I'm not getting what I lent back and navigate a relationship with my parents given how disappointed I am in this situation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR! -Parents borrowed money from, under a promise to pay me back and haven't. It's making me not want to be around them and looking for advice on how to navigate a relationship with them given this.",

After a few months of NC we started talking again. It seems most of issues stem from my father(63) who admittedly is a bit controlling. He used to not be that way when I just got out of high school but now it\u2019s the irrigation of small things that added up plus the pandemic. \n\nWhen I started college and lived in dorms a phone call once a week and a visit once or twice a month was fine. The college was in driving distance though not convenient because it\u2019s Southern California.\n\nInitial lockdown was bad for the relationship because I chose to hole up with my father who got out of the hospital literally 3 weeks before. I mismanaged that a bit because I should have spent a few months at her parents house but the past is the past. \n\nThe controlling thing is texting if I\u2019d be home for dinner if I\u2019m out, harassing me via text if I\u2019m out late with her and of course the lockdown lack of contact. He has expressed heavy empty nest worries and that if I moved out he wouldn\u2019t see me again.\n\n\nThe solution would be to move out but since we aren\u2019t dating currently that option really isn\u2019t on the table. She did some pretty harmful things on her end during the break up like doing it via text and a kissing a coworker incident while drunk(the main catalyst for doing it). We\u2019re just talking and no idea if things will improve but I\u2019m going to use the parent example as a thing to fix because any future relationships it will probably become a problem again.",

        "content": "I (24F) have been quite unhappy with my manager (late 30s/early 40s F)  for a lot of reasons. Since she is essentially my first ever manager, I don't know if my situation is something everyone has to put up with or if she is really just a bad boss. A few more details below on why I am unhappy:\n\n* She tells me that I should speak up more in meetings, but there have been times when I do speak up/ask a question and am interrupted by her and dismissed. At one point, one of the other people in the meeting even had to speak up for me and essentially say \"Let her speak\". She also orders me around in front of everyone in meetings in (I think) a rather brusque way, like \"Redditor, take notes on this\" or \"Redditor, make sure to do XXX\"\n   * I have vented about this to my parents who are from the same culture/country as her, and they say that's just the way they did things over there. I personally don't think that's an excuse.\n* She never hesitates to give me constructive/negative feedback, but I have rarely heard words of positive encouragement or recognition from her. I know there are lots of ways I can improve and appreciate the feedback (and I certainly don't want sugarcoating/flattery), but some positive feedback would be nice once in a while. She also always compares me to other people, saying \"Oh, XXX always does this right\".\n* The last straw was promotion season this year. I previously asked her what the minimum eligibility was this year (it was previously 3.5 years whereas I had 2.5) because I had heard rumors they had changed to 2.5. She told me it was still the same in our division, so I didn't meet eligibility. Promotions are announced in December but are decided upon pretty early on--I heard nothing from her until Dec during my performance review, where she said \"Oh btw, it turns out the rules had changed to 2.5 this year. I hope there are no hard feelings because I didn't find out until very late in the process. I think one more year would benefit you anyway.\" Now it is entirely her right to decide whether or not to promote me, but the lack of transparency and communication was really shocking. I feel like if I were her, I would've set up a proper meeting soon after she found out the rules had changed and the decision was made, rather than casually dropping it mid-conversation months later.\n   * Side note: pretty much everyone my year received this promotion (think Analyst -> Associate), so it felt really crummy watching everyone else celebrate their promotions.\n\nI am currently on the job hunt but would like to at least hold off until bonuses at the end of this month.\n\nTL;DR: I don't want to work under my manager anymore but am not that experienced--maybe I just have too high standards?

        "content": "Tl;dr My partner of 6 years is finally recovering after 3 years of suicidal tendencies and severe depression.\n\n\nMy partner and I meet 6 years ago while working. His accomdation fell through and my sister invited him to live with us.\n\nHe was going to head home (8 hours away ) after the seasonal work finished but we had already hit it off. \n\nIt was terrifying for me as I was 19 and had never lived with a partner before, and he lived with us a week before we got together. sounds like a recipe for disaster right. \n\nI was a mess and violent with untreated PTSD(domestic violence survivor). He was amazing, he was first person to tell me my behavior wasnt okay and got me to see a phycologist. He came from a similar background so was incredibly understanding and laughs about it these days saying he domesticated me. \n\nWe moved around together to a few places and eventual settled in his home town, He neverso much as raised his voice at me, he was my bestfriend we rarely argued and did everything together, I became more and more stable and was content and felt safe for the first time.\n\nTwo years in we had our own place and we where happy and planning on getting married. Our entire live fell apart in one day when his brother, whom he was close to took his life.\n\nHe started off barley leaving bed and needing alot of support, he left his job. He became angry after a few months and became physically sick. He wouldnt let me sleep and would scream at me for hours.\n\nI started uni while cleaning cooking and caring for him to keep myself sane. He became suicidal I had to call the police his freinds and family, I did anything necessary to keep him alive, sometimes even having to physically retrain him from hurting himself. I even stuck my arm through a glass door when he locked me out to attempt, I climbed to a window saw him trying a noose went to the door and stuck my arm through it. Took him to doctors andthe hospital ect\n\nHe hated me for it he was cruel and would laugh when I cried and yell at me when I had panic attacks anything everything to drive me away. He begged me to leave so he could finally be with his brother.\n\nI started working casually on top of uni to keep us afloat. Some of my family begged me to leave but I am stubborn I wanted the man I knew he is back, all I could see was how much pain he was in. \n\n3 years later he started fo get better within the last year he has made leaps of progress. He never yells at me anymore, he is gentle again sweet and kind, his mother knows everything and loves me to pieces for going through all of that for her son.\n\nHe smiles and laughs everyday and runs around with the animals. He makes random noises and is going to uni this year ( I finished my degree) I'm so happy to have him back I could cry or laugh, so relieved and thankful \n\nThe problem is I'm still scared of losing him and react in fear sometimes during arguments. Then he feels so guilty so awful for the monster he was back then and I just dont want to hinder his recovery with my fear. How do I react more calmly with minor disagreements now, I know it's from how he use to react but I cant even remember the last time he raised his voice at me. My body just reacts.\n\nI really dont want to hinder his recovery I'm am 100% committed to this man and once again we are happy. So please no leave it comments i didnt go through all this to leave now.",

        "content": "Hi reddit. My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly 3 years. We are moving in together and have been approved for a nice rental property that fits all our needs. \n\nSo a bit of background: This is my first time living outside of student accomodation and my partner will be moving out of her parents house.\nI\u2019m a graduate from uni and will be starting a full time job soon. On the other hand, my gf is still in uni and works on a part time basis. \n\nWe\u2019ve decided to split utilities 50/50 and rent 60/40 as I\u2019ll be earning more than her. We think this is fair and we\u2019re both happy.\n\nAfter this came up in conversation with my family, some don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair and that everything should be split 50/50. They have been trying to convince me to implement that.\n\nOur income will be quite different so I think splitting rent based on what we both can afford comfortably is a good idea, so 60/40.\nI don\u2019t think my family should really have a say and are being a little overbearing. \n\nI guess my 2 questions are how do people typically go about splitting rent with their significant others? And how do I go about dealing with family members trying to input their ideologies?\n\n\nThank you :)\n\nTLDR: Gf and I are loving in together and have decided on a 60/40 rent split arrangement because of our different income. My family don\u2019t agree and are trying to implement a complete 50/50 split.",

        "content": " **Background**: I am in a 5 year relationship with my girlfriend of 6 years. She has never had a boyfriend before, whereas I have had 2 previous relationships. We don't have any children, just our wonderful dog, and talked about getting proposals and looking at rings for this year. I work full time while she works \\~23 hours/week + she was upgrading a high school class. I pay all the bills, most of the food, and a majority of her debt. She has some mental health issues (BPD) that she has struggled with throughout her life whereas besides now, I was otherwise happy mentally. After Christmas, she told me we needed to talk about our relationship where that she has several issues about our relationship.\n\n**Problem #1 - Kids**: Initially when we met, she wanted to have kids a year in our relationship. We compromised and said we would wait until I was 28. However, we both knew we would have a kid. Now, she tells me that she no longer wants to have children. Given her mental health + new outlook on life as she has gotten older, she does not think she could take care of a child responsibly, nor would she want to. She does not want to waste my time, and I respect that decision. She mentions she has been dropping subtle hints that she doesn't want children anymore, but I never seem to get it. To be honest, at first, I thought that this wasn't a problem. After having our dog, I TRULY felt I could go either way. It is slightly annoying to find who will take care of our dog if we went on trips or even just to go to work, plus I could travel the world with her much easier. I mean, how could I love a child who hasn't been born compared to this woman of 5 years? But I think no matter what I say, it would sound like I'm saying anything to save the relationship.\n\n**Problem #2 - Dead bedroom**: When we first met, we had a lot of great sex. It was even more special to me because in my previous relationship, we had sex maybe once a month. I was VERY insecure and she gave me validation that I was desirable and wanted. I think I wanted to give the same to her. I would rub her butt and tell her what a great body she has, because she really was gorgeous. I was definitely the \"reacher\". Sometimes I would grind on her when the song wasn't sexy as joke. However, maybe a year or two into the relationship, she sat me down and said that she felt that I was treating her like an object. My heart sank. I felt disgusted that I made her feel that way. This woman was also patient with me, kind, and would give me the world if she could. I hated how I made her feel, but at the same time, I felt like she saw me as an ape. I felt that she didn't see the times where I showed her appreciation for who she was. I just wanted her to feel the validation.\n\nOver time, she began to feel the opposite. That I didn't want her anymore, and I admit that I was MUCH less touchy than usual. I perhaps overcorrected as I didn't want her to feel like a sex toy again. So we decided to make a solo/couple porn account. It would make us both feel good to be called sexy and wanted. And then I found out she \"cheated\" on me. I found texts of her and this unknown man where they talked dirty and the whole works. Things that she would never do with me. I felt ugly, betrayed, and ashamed. I confronted her and she told me she was sorry and got caught up. I forgave her. She was young and na\u00efve. In the back of my mind, I thought that perhaps I didn't set enough boundaries on what the porn account should entail, so maybe it's not cheating. However, after that, sex to her seemed like a chore. I don't think she envisions sex with anyone else but me, but, her guilt bleeds into it. I have performance anxiety because I know if I don't get off, she will spiral into sadness, even though I tell her, and I do, enjoy it. It has become a loop of negativity around sex. She tells me she doesn't feel me touch her the same, but, I do. I think I've worked a middle ground, but it kills me that she doesn't see it.\n\n**Problem #3 - Potential Emotional Cheating**: So after these issues were brought up, I agreed to a break for 30 days, but it's hard it's been brutal for me. I feel like I'm drowning. An anchor holding me down. So I reached out to her friend to find out how my girlfriend was doing. I didn't want her to be hurting herself (BPD), when she drops a bombshell on me that she has gotten close to a guy she met online in a game. She(the friend) said that the man didn't respect relationship boundaries of her, saying he wanted to \"sleep and cuddle with her\" and has since moved onto my girlfriend. Except for, it seems my girlfriend has become enamored for him. Apparently my girlfriend and the friend have gotten over a few fights over this guy, though I am not sure what the fight entailed. The friend says they(man+girlfriend) both claim to only be friends, but I suspect that the man's intentions are not true. I have NO proof of cheating or any of their conversations. Only hearsay from the friend. The rules of the break were to only reach out to friends, and if she considers him a friend... idk. I'm just at a loss. Maybe she just likes the attention. Maybe she sees more, however she has NEVER brought him up. I didn't know he existed or how close they were. Maybe the only reason she is entertaining him is because she gets what she feels that she is missing from me. There is a few more issues with our relationship, but minor compared to these ones. And to be honest, I know the issue stems from lack of good communication. Hell she has even brought up the dead bedroom multiple times herself, and I knew it took a lot of courage for her to do that. I think I was ashamed to get REAL help from therapy but now I begged her that I would set up appointments for counselling, but she seems done. Where I give solutions, she gives reasons to stop. But yet, she wants a break to figure it out. I don't know if we will get back together, but if she decides she does want to, should I? I am also scared that this is related to her BDP and the guy is manipulating her. My heart wants to save this but I'm just at a loss. Can I have some direction?\n\n**TLDR**: Girlfriend wants a break from our relationship stemming from some major issues she has brought up prior. I didn't do anything REAL to help us, and now I may have caught her emotionally cheating. I don't know where to proceed anymore.",

        "content": "Hello. I would love some insight or advice on what to do here and if I am even using the term \u201cdaddy issues\u201d correctly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve been with my SO Ryan for about 8 years now. We have been long-distant for a part of it, and are looking to take the next step (moving in, marriage)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground: Ryan and I were raised in the same town with very different families. I am a hybrid only child (much older siblings, never lived with them), and very close with my parents. Ryan\u2019s dad left when they were young and is in and out of rehab. He is not close with either of his parents at all. He has one sibling he is close with. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRyan works as an admin /exec assistant in a large city and often gets \u201cassigned\u201d to work with people. He\u2019s met many new people through his career and recently had a career change. As an exec, he would spend once a week or once every two weeks working alongside his bosses \u2013 not a daily thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo when I met him, his was an assistant for a man named Dave. Dave was in his 50\u2019s and a very successful business man. Ryan always spoke about Dave in the most positive way, giving me constant updates, having me watch videos of Dave presenting, getting to know the family, etc. A couple times, however, Dave kind of treated Ryan like he \u201cwas the hired help\u201d (his words) and Ryan realized that Dave would never value Ryan the way Ryan values him\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo up next is John. John is also in his 50\u2019s and Ryan started to repeat the same things he did with Dave, with John. You could see the admiration that Ryan had for John anytime he spoke of him, in relation to him, etc. This is when I started picking up on the obsessiveness Ry had over these two men.  John lives far away and Ryan eventually stopped working for him but they still keep in contact\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, and the main character of this story, is Steve. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSteve is in his later 40\u2019s and Ryan started working for him about 7 years ago. Through the years they have gotten closer, and in the last few years Ryan has gotten obsessive, to the point that Steve is starting to notice and make comments. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSteve is mentioned at least 20 times in a day, for mundane things that don\u2019t matter. Ryan has picked up on many of Steve\u2019s habits from the way he talks, to his appearance, and his mannerisms. He started listening to music he used to hate because Steve likes it, and do hobbies he doesn\u2019t like because Steve likes it. Also, his former hobbies that he actually does love still, he puts on a show and acts like he doesn\u2019t care about in front of Steve. He was so genuine around Steve when they first met but I feel like he\u2019s trying way too hard now and he is completely fake around Steve. He hasn\u2019t acted this way around John or Dave so this is a whole new level of worship. He spent over $30,000 remodeling his house to match Steves  (I\u2019m not joking, he did it so he could show Steve what he did) and this is when Steve finally started to notice and make comments about him copying everything (Ryan thinks he\u2019s joking but I can tell he is serious). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSteve and his SO got me a very generous gift after I did them a favor, and Ryan was so jealous over it that he was lashing out at me for three days due to the jealousy that I got something from Steve and he didn\u2019t (he didn\u2019t say this, but I knew this is what triggered him). Also, what I did for them \u2013 he wanted NO part of. He thought I was getting closer to Steve and family and he didn\u2019t like that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, Ryan is progressively disliking Steve\u2019s best friend more and more. Steve and his best friend, Adam, are close in age and hold the same job titles. They have been friends for over three decades and are incredibly close. Ryan actually met Steve through Adam! In the last year or so, Ryan has had this vengeance against Adam and doesn\u2019t hold back at the opportunity to speak negatively about Adam to Steve in hopes of driving a wedge between the two \u2013 so Ryan can take his place as the \u201cbest friend\u201d. I finally told him to stop because it\u2019s going to look bad on him. However, Adam has also shared with me some concerns he has with Adam (that were valid and more of constructive criticism), and I think Steve may also think these things as well, but I won\u2019t share that with Ryan. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know Steve well and I do love him and his family as close friends, but the obsession from Ryan is starting to hit a concerning point with me. I was recently told by Ryan that Steve has done a lot for Ryan\u2019s career and Steve will always be the number one priority to Ryan, no matter what. The irony behind this is that Steve would probably start to pull back from Ryan a little bit if he knew the point of obsession Ryan was at. Steve has told me his personal philosophies and they are significantly different than Ryan\u2019s. (Money first vs family first). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tread this conversation but it\u2019s starting to worry me. I think this stems from not having a father figure in his life and him wanting to have that relationship with an older male figure now. People other than myself have suggester therapy but he won\u2019t listen or take it. It\u2019s just getting exhausting at this point. I don\u2019t feel like I am competing against him for my SO\u2019s attention because it\u2019s clear (in his words) that Steve is always number one. I\u2019m more concerned with the root of this problem, which is the daddy issues, Ryan\u2019s obsession, and how to help him think differently / see this differently. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SO has daddy issues, clones himself to be like this father figure he found, and everyone is starting to take notice. Prioritizes \"daddy\" over everyone else in his life and it\u2019s getting to a worrisome point. How to retrain this behavior / what to do about this?",

I\u2019ve been in long relationships before so I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m not judged on the time of this one. But this past year (specifically November 21st 2020) i met the girl of my dreams. A girl who took me for me, who wanted to take baggage i had from the past and help me handle it. This girl loved me unconditionally, had the upmost respect for me, did everything she could do when i was slightly feeling down, stuck by my side no matter what the situation was, she was able to tear down the wall i had built up around myself after so many years between family issues and past relationship issues and pull me out of the pit I was stuck in (this side of me i never let come out even to my closest friends, I always tried to pretend to be as happy as it could seem when I was struggling on the inside). Even though i was only with this girl for a little over a year. She became such an important figure in my life in such a short amount of time. And in august the girl who was strong and able to take on anything life threw at her broke, because of me. But things didn\u2019t end there, it was a storm of arguing and fighting where even my friends got involved to the point where even one of my best friends (who i lived with) told me i need to break up with her or i need to move out. So we did, we broke up for a day. And then it was back to me visiting her and us planning on hiding being together until things got better and we worked through everything. Hell we even went on a mini vacation to Florida  so she could visit some schools the next week. Enough rambling, fast forwarding to November 2021 right before thanksgiving, we got into a fight and ended up breaking up (this isn\u2019t anything new we always had these little fake breakups but never actually left each other). During this time i was conflicted on whether i wanted to be with her anymore or not and if i just wanted to be single after all that has happened. After both of us pushing each other away since august. So what did i do? I snapchatted a handful of girls. Never flirted or anything of the sort. But it came down to me still wanting the same girl i had for the past year. When it came to getting back together again i decided to hide and delete the conversations even though there was no flirting involved or anything of the sort. This was my biggest mistake. I kept this lie going up until yesterday when she found out about it all and that i had been lying about it since November. That was her final straw and now she\u2019s gone. I was scared to tell her the truth in fear of her leaving and now i wish more than anything i could go back and be up front with her or even not talk to those other girls to begin with but i cant. I\u2019m a mess, i start a new job in two days (my first real job - electrician at a company that makes submarines), i graduate my electrical school in April and now i dont have motivation for either. All i want to do is fix everything that has happened but i know i cant. And i know if anyone even reads this or responds I\u2019ll hear the \u201cthere\u2019s more fish in the sea\u201d or \u201cit\u2019ll get easier over time this just happened\u201d. But i know that\u2019s not the case when it comes to this girl. I\u2019ve had my fair share of heartbreak already but i know nothing will compare to this. I lost someone who loved me for me, who only wanted the best for me, who went through hell and back with me just in hopes of the future we imagined. I feel as though i lost my soulmate, and this girl will always be the girl i wish i was with regardless of where or who i end up with in the future. If you made it this far thanks for reading, just wanted to get what\u2019s on my mind off of it. If you have any advice or life experiences that could relate i would love to read it\n\nTL;DR \nI\u2019m struggling right now and needed to get everything on my mind off my chest. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m looking for advice or not so i wanted to post. Long story short i lost the girl who meant everything to me.",

My girlfriend (30 F) lives in an area in Ohio where we both grew up all of our lives. I find it dreary and depressing with little opportunities for me. However, I do love her very much and find her attractive. She is 30 and has never lived on her own in her whole life and is typically pampered by her parents quite a bit and lacks some life skills for sure. No surprisingly, she is very close with her family and will never leave the Ohio area in her life (she told me this countless times). For this to work, I would have to give up my life in the South to live in Ohio for her. We have been off and on for approx. 3 years now and recently got back together. Things have been OKAY but not great with a few fights here and there. Every day that I am in Ohio (I have been here for months even though I am now paying for an apartment in the South that Im not even at) I feel like I am giving up so much just to see if things work and where this relationship will go. Because of our off and on nature of our relationship, she will not give me a definite timeline of when she would be move in with me in the future. Because she has never lived on her own, this concerns me and complicates things. I need a firm timeline to feel comfortable, but she needs to feel more comfortable in our relationship before she gives me a definite timeline. I feel like I am in complete limbo and just exhausted at this point. I brought these concerns up to her and she acts like its not that big of a deal. Should I feel bad for thinking this and telling her? Thanks in advance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I feel like I am giving up too much for my girlfriend and feel bad about bringing it up.",

He used to always taled about his ex, triangulate me against her and other girls he would talked about, compare me to other girls he slept with ( he did apologize for that), and everytime we talked it was always about him only. Anyway, we did have some cool times but it wasnt good most of the time. I also got pregnant by him, but aborted. He was the first guy that I felt I couls really opened up to and him felt the same way towards me. All of this lasted for a 1 year and half\n\n\nIt's just  hard now because I've never been in a relationship and everyone around me is popping kids, getting married, in a relationship, getting a bunch of dates and/or are working in their career fields. I'm currently back in school. Anyway I just feel that, its just so hard to not feel like its just too late for me. I'm a really introverted person. Yes I can socialize and have conversations but its always others who poor their life stories into the convo if it makes sense. I'm not in a hurry at ALL to have kids. But it would be nice to have someone..\nI just feel that I messed up so bad with the last guy even tho I know he was a really toxic person.\n\n\nMy friends tell me to be patient, to stop looking/forcing things, and enjoy being single. But I get pissed inside because I feel like its easy for them to talk when they have someone and have been in relationship in the past prior to their current bf/husband.  \n\n\nI miss the cuddling, waking up next to someone, growing with someone and sharing moments and feelings lol.\nI don't like the idea of letting a guy chase me and all the bs about dating nowadays and the expactions to look/be xyz. With the last guy, he did say that I made it \"too easy for him\" (while he didn't even call himself easy for sleeping with him in the first place) Yes he was also a real mysoginist.  \n\n\nPhysically, I'm not ugly or out of shape just to clarify things. I am quite athletic and good looking but I dont knw...\nAnyway, any words of wisdom/encouragement? \n\n\nP.s: Sorry if I sounded mad, its just hard when people around you put pressure on you to be dating and in a relationship. A lot of the times, thats all what my girlfriends talk about ( their men/bf, their dating stories with their current so).\n\nTL;DR: I am a 27f who is feeling lonely and depressed because I  never had a bf and I feel that it's too late for me.",

We admitted we still have feelings after he broke it off. I don't know how to stay platonic with a friend when we know there are mutual romantic feelings. \n\nSo, background was pretty much as stated above. I was married for 12 years. During that time the college ex was still a friend of ours and we would catch up a few times a year for the past 20 years. I separated from my ex-husband (very amicably) last year, and I caught up with my college ex as a single woman for the first time in 16 or so years. It was kinda obvious that feelings were there. We tried dating for a few weeks, but he said he just wants to be friends again, even though he still has romantic feelings for me. \n\nAt first it was ok. But after a while, knowing we both have feelings for each other made it difficult for me to not want to pursue a relationship with him again. I feel guilty when I flirt with another person, mostly because my ex made it clear that he isn't interested in dating another else. I know if it's not for him, I probably would have ask this other person out. I know I shouldn't wait for him, but I can't help but to feel guilty.\n\nI feel like this is now getting in the way of our friendship. Tbh I don't actually know what is the difference between \"just friends + mutual romantic feelings\" and \"a romantic relationship\". \n\nIs it possible to stay in as \"just friends\" while having mutual romantic feelings AND both parties know about it?

I keep looking at price tags for days whenever he is not present wondering what I can give him to make us even. When we got married .

I had a terrible childhood. My parents weren't wealthy. They could only afford our education which was quite expensive since me and my brothers always went to private schools. My dad was in alot of debt. Creditors were always asking for their money and my dad was always being a cry baby at home,telling his young children exactly how poor we were going to be,how creditors were threatening him, he was losing all his respect . It was abuse and me and my brothers did not need to listen to all that when we clearly could not help.Then my brothers reached 18 and they got scholarships and left home. I was all alone with a father who is always crying about money and a mother who loved to show off in front of her family despite our very tight budget. I had written about every single day in my diary. About every holiday when I had to wear old clothes. Everytime when my parents taunted me for being a burden because they had to pay my school fee. I cried while reading that diary. I still can't believe how I am perfectly fine after what happened in my childhood and early teen years.\n\n\nThings are alot better now for my parents ,I can say that their lives have changed entirely . Its been like that for years. My brothers got good jobs and they supported my dad alot. Now he runs a business with the help of my brothers. \n\nI am only realizing now why I am so sensitive about money. I have always been. I do not know if there is anything I can do to make it better . \nI  know that I might not need to discuss finances with my husband now but in future when we have kids ,there will be times when we have to talk about how much each of us should spend on kids.

I work a 40+ a week job and make somewhat alright money, she works multiple odd jobs and makes under 500 a month. We want to get a house, and she constantly talks about it. This is not possible in our current situation and she somehow just ignores that and keeps talking about it.\n\nI've been telling her to get a steady job so we can do some of the things she's always suggesting and she gasses me up and tells me that she's doing this and that but it never comes to fruition. Good example, we had an argument about this at the start of December and she told me she was applying and looking into becoming a school bus driver. Now it's been over a month later and I asked her what she has done regarding that and she didn't really say much. Also, she is unvaccinated. So I looked online and it took me all of 3 minutes to find out her being unvaccinated would make it so she can't work there. So I asked her what on earth she was doing the last month regarding that and she didn't really have anything to say.\n\nEven the vaccine is another frustrating situation, she isn't vaccinated and I am. All political BS aside considering we live somewhere where it's currently required to do anything it's a pretty big hinderance. She claims she isn't anti-vax and was waiting for a particular one to be available, so whatever sure, typical of her to choose the choice that is the hardest but whatever it was in trials. Now that particular one you can get and she now says that she's now waiting for another one. I really really feel like she's just saying shit to shut me up with zero intention of following it.\n\nI'm trying to become a musician and have had moderate local success. I still work 40+ hours a week to support myself and still get shit done. She wants to become a politician and has run a couple times, when she does her life shuts down and she uses that as an excuse for not doing anything else, but then she half asses her campaigns and does terribly. When we get into arguments she always says shit like when she gets elected she'll have all this money to do this that and the other thing... I'm always just like, what about now? What about the present? She'll throw the fact I'm trying to be a musician too at me during these but I actually support myself/us while simultaneously doing that and have done pretty alright at this point where there is a potential.\n\nWe talk about having kids and getting married but all I can picture is how much is going to be on my shoulders and all the excuses I'll be fed. I would 100 percent have to give up being a musician while I take over supporting the kids financially, I know if she got off after having a child her going back to \"work\" (which consists of walking a friends dog and doing personal care work 2/3 times a week) would pretty much not happen. I just picture her running half ass campaigns, feeding me more BS about how everything's going to work out in the future while doing absolutely nothing in the present while I watch my dreams fade away and she does whatever the fuck she wants.\n\nI really want to be a dad, I really want to buy a house. I really want to do all these things we talk about but I feel like I'm the only one with a realistic outlook and actually taking action and taking steps to make that possible. I've gotten to the point where I think about her and I don't have fond feelings, I just get frustrated.\n\nI don't even know where to go from here, I don't know what to do.

        "content": "I've \\[22F\\] been with my boyfriend \\[21M\\] for about 6 years now. We went to the same school for 8 years and started dating our sophomore year of high school, and we're about to graduate from college in the spring. I love him SO much, but it's been a concern from day 1 that he doesn't have his shit together. I have always been super ambitious and career-oriented while he's always been more relaxed and go-with-the-flow.\n\nI actually broke up with him about 2 years ago while I was at a software engineering internship out of state mostly because I felt like I was propelling forward in my future career while he wasn't doing much of anything at all. After the most emotionally turbulent year of my life being single, we got back together during quarantine, and things really did improve. He seemed to be taking his studies more seriously (he is a landscape architecture major), he solidified some more of his interests, and he's been working at a landscape architecture firm as a part-time intern for almost a year. However, it's obvious he's not passionate about what he's doing and doesn't want to work for the firm he's currently interning at, but he's made zero effort to look for opportunities post-graduation or discover more of his interests, even while I've been actively seeking and recruiting for roles. He used to talk about moving to Portland and doing something there because he loves that city, but he never followed up on that either. Yesterday he mentioned maybe getting a job at a restaurant next year to pay rent, so I know his focus isn't on getting a stable job with a salary and upward mobility.\n\nIt looks like we'll both be living in the same place next year, and obviously I want this relationship to work out. He's a wonderful person and we are so connected. But I can't wait around for him to get his life together while I work my ass off to accomplish the things I've dreamed of accomplishing. I know he can work hard too, but he's stuck and has always been content with doing the bare minimum.\n\nI don't want to baby him or mom him either, and I've tried hard not to interfere so that he can figure out what he likes on his own and doesn't resent me for pushing him harder. But with graduation coming up next semester, I'm getting stressed out about the future of our relationship and am wondering if I need to proactively have this conversation with him. I just don't know what to say or how to approach it.\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend doesn't have his life figured out at all and I don't know what to do.",

I really want some advice on how to manage my own feelings around this. \n\nTo cut a long story short I have a horrific colleague who is lazy, a liar, but very clever about it. I\u2019ll see loads of emails from her that make her seem incredibly keen, proactive, involved and busy - but actually, when you look at what she does, it\u2019s nothing. Literally nothing. She\u2019s just got the bullshit down. She doesn\u2019t even turn up most days, claiming she\u2019s \u201cworking from home\u201d but actually not seeing any patients at all. Our boss works from home so isn\u2019t exactly keeping tabs of who is where. \n\nWe both work with mentally unwell patients so her lack of morality or a conscience astounds me. I end up seeing them because that\u2019s my job. I cant ignore and leave unwell patients for weeks on end, it feels wrong and weighs on my mind outside of work. I\u2019m getting paid for it. The ridiculous thing is she is getting paid more than me (I am part time as I have a baby, she is also but works more than me) but actually spends less hours than me at work. \n\nAlso it DOES mean more a lot more work for me because I end up seeing all of the patients when we should be sharing them, and as I\u2019m the only one in the office I will inevitably be brought a lot of work while she is at home not being contacted by anybody. But I\u2019m more worried about calming myself down about it because I don\u2019t see a way to raise this without looking bad myself. \n\nAnyway I\u2019m sorry for waffling. I guess my main concern is how I can manage my own anger and frustrations around this. I\u2019ve honestly never encountered such a person and have found most of my colleagues to be a team. \n\nI\u2019ve been reduced to tears, unable to sleep because I\u2019m so angry and upset over the injustice of it all. I tried to send her an email suggesting she pick up a patient and it turned out someone else had sorted it! Just my luck. She\u2019s a slippery one. \n\nAnyway. I think my feelings around this are unhealthy. I genuinely can\u2019t sleep, cry, vent to hubby. It\u2019s obviously not right and affecting the limited time I DO get at home. Any help?\n\n**tldr** Have a shitty ass colleague and my anger about her is ruining my life. Help me manage my unhealthy feelings?",

I tried to adjust myself and went to  therapy to seek help for being able to manage with things that scared me  (anger bursts mostly), or being able not to get affected as much by  constant complaining (I feel completely drained). I moved across the  country for him because he was unhappy where we used to live. Not  surprisingly, he isn't happy here either and misses the time when he  lived and worked back there. There were a number of red flags that I  missed at first and then I just kind of settled. He has a lot of good  traits that keep me with him. He's caring, loyal, a good friend, he's  always there if you need him. But I came to realize that I will not be  able to live with him my whole life.   \nHe's quite controlling, takes me on  a guilt trip any time I want to spend time separate from him (\"You  ditch me every weekend to see your friend\", - not true, \"Do you not want  to spend time with me?\", - meaning \"why don't you want to come to work  with me and hang out\" when I'm off).   \nWe had *the talk* multiple times. He always says that he knows the issue and he's willing to change. I always tell him that I don't want him to change for me but only for himself if  he thinks there's a problem. He promises to change every time after a  big fight with him punching walls, furniture and throwing stuff. I'm  terrified of this. We have a week or two of peace and then he's being  himself.  \nAgain, I do not want anybody to change for ME. I just want some  peace. I'm trying to meet people and find friends but it is hard. I feel  lack of social support and it's keeping me in this relationship too. I  have my mom who's far away (I moved to another country 4 years ago) and  that's pretty much it. I'm not afraid of being alone. But I don't want  to be completely alone with nobody at all to talk to.  \n\n\nI feel that I  trapped myself in this relationship by, first moving far away, and,  second, by buying a house together. Now we have a joint mortgage and I  can't just leave or ask him to leave, it's his house too (we pay 50/50  for everything).   \nTo further complicate the situation, we bought a dog  who we both love. I know it's just a dog for some but I can't imagine my  life without her anymore.Not sure what I'm looking for here. I'm sure  people have broken up while having a joint mortgage. What were your  first steps? Or should I just keep trying to make it work?\n\nTL;DR  \nMy  relationship is not working for me. I tried to make it work but I can't  get used to his behaviour that I find abusive. The problem is that we  bought a house together and have a joint mortgage. I also lack any  social support and don't feel that I'm able to leave because of that.  What would be the first steps to get out?",

Terry has been making me uncomfortable by text-spamming me his personal problems stemming from work (long story short is that his landlord is suing him for being late on rent/evicting him). This problem predates us, but because my department head can sometimes be bad about getting us paid correctly (employees get paid more when they do task X on a day, but he'll forget to approve task X days and I'll have to remind him; it always gets paid out with interest but is sometimes a week late). Note that I'm not responsible for the paychecks, but I am for recording task X days, which I always do. I also always remind our department head, but payroll can be slow to fix it. \n\nAnyways, Terry keeps blowing up my phone with \"I'm so anxious about all of this\" and sending me pictures of his eviction notice and court notices and his life. I haven't ever responded, but it does make me uncomfortable. Sometimes this will also happen while he's out on a job- where he'll get distracted from work and start the text-spamming, stating that it's anxiety. It makes me worried about his safety (this is is a highly physical and dangerous job- you need to focus when you're working in our field), and I have to remind him that phone goes away while you're operating. \n\nHow do I tactfully tell him that although I'm happy to help with the pay stuff and anything else required for the job, I'm not his friend or his therapist?

She hasn\u2019t made an effort to leave and she\u2019s a sensitive person, so I don\u2019t know how to approach her.\n\nSeveral years ago my husband left me for another woman. We\u2019d just purchased a home together that I couldn\u2019t afford on my own, and literally a week later I found out he was having an affair. I took on a roommate (who I will refer to as Roommate), who is and was a personal friend, to help me out.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t make a ton of money and I didn\u2019t need *too* much to get by, so we agreed on a sum that equals about one third of the mortgage and a quarter of the utilities. Her rent and utilities has never gone up and she pays significantly less living with me than she would have to in an apartment nearby. She asked me to give her three months if I ever needed her to move out.\n\nWhen she moved in, it was us and my daughter. She referred to herself as \u2018auntie\u2019, and I was not super comfortable with it but let it slide. In hindsight I wish I\u2019d been better about setting boundaries, but more on that shortly\u2026\n\nEventually I meet someone, and over time, things get serious, and two years later he moves in. I get pregnant and now there are two children, my spouse, and Roommate.\n\nWe lived relatively harmoniously until I got pregnant. I think there were some jealousy issues and some insecurity issues on her part (but I am speculating). She suffers from severe depression and deep insecurities and I\u2019m used to her closing herself off at times, but she started to go long periods of time without speaking to me. She projected her insecurities onto me frequently, accusing me of being upset with her when I wasn\u2019t. She brought up needing to move out, that we needed our space, and I assured her that we were happy with her there. At the time, I meant what I said. As the pregnancy progressed and she seemed to grow resentful of me, I did wish I\u2019d agreed with her when she said maybe she needed to think about moving out.\n\nLabor and delivery was rough. To put a long story short, a big mistake was made by the hospital staff and I arrested. I died temporarily and so did the baby. We were in the hospital for almost a week. I was an absolute fucking mess when I got home. I had bonding issues with the baby. I didn\u2019t feel like she was mine, but I wanted to. Meanwhile, Roommate started making demands to hold the baby \u201cevery evening before I go to bed\u201d. She barely spoke to me but lit up like a Christmas tree every time she saw the baby. She would get visibly upset when she didn\u2019t get a chance to hold the baby. Boundary issues that had always existed (roommate vs. friend vs. family) became huge after this baby was born. I feel like her proximity to us has made her feel like she's part of the family, when she's not. To digress, I felt very pressured to share the baby with her because she lived there and because I wanted to keep the peace. It made me feel awful after a day of sharing the baby with actual family  who visited frequently for the first month or two.\n\nEventually we had a discussion about her demands to hold the baby, and she didn\u2019t speak to me for a month. She was completely avoidant of me. I ended up writing her an email that said something to the effect of, we can\u2019t continue our friendship like this. She apologized and we\u2019ve been more or less OK ever since.\n\nThis past September, I finally mentioned that I thought it was time for her to find her own place. I told her I\u2019d like her gone by the time the baby turned one, which gives her about eight months.\n\nShe looked at apartments for a few days, then stopped speaking to me again. I think the prices scared her, but again I'm speculating. I asked her about a potential roommate to which she said she didn\u2019t want one. The steam died quickly though and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s actively looked since September.\n\nSince, Roommate needed an emergency surgery, which she needed to recover from, and then of course the holidays have come and gone. I haven\u2019t pressed the issue with her, but I\u2019m ready for her to move out. Unfortunately, she's a 'path of least resistance' type, and will stay in a situation because it involves the least amount of work, even if she is unhappy.\n\nThe \u201cdeadline\u201d is coming up, and I don\u2019t want to kill our friendship, but I just want her to leave. How can I approach this with her?",

She\u2019s a school teacher and had originally mentioned that she could only spend her holidays with us and we were under the impression that she was keen to spend as much time as she could with the baby.

We were very excited about it. She then suddenly delayed and shortened her plans to see her first grandchild for the first time simply because BIL asked her to. They have an enmeshed relationship and she always agrees to everything he says - even when the requests are completely irrational. Am I justified in being annoyed or am I just being entitled?",

Before I felt he was CLEARLY interested but now his actions seem hot and cold.

The next day I was excited to see him after work and I immediately asked if he wanted to hang out, he said he'd let me know then texted me he needed time to process what happened. I was very anxious all the next day until the dinner. The next day he asked me out to dinner and we talked about it and he said he'd needed some time to think and talk it out with a friend, the night of he was really happy but in the morning the situation seemed more complicated and we needed to be really slow and intentional since we live together. I said that makes sense and we continued hanging out and went for a walk. We had a ton of fun, the conversation was varied, deep, intense, and sparking, and he kissed me in what was the best kiss of my life at the end. The date was great but so far it feels almost emblematic of a pattern I feel: We have this intense moments of joy/connection, and then he pulls away/needs more space.\n* He repeatedly has said he needs a lot of space. We've talked about since we're roommates we didn't agree to live together and we need to be able to be roommates. That's fine with me, I also like space. However, When we do interact, I'm not sure if I should be comfortable being affectionate/flirtatious- I'm a very physical person so for me it felt natural once we were clearly in a romantic territory to sometimes lean on him, kiss him when greeting or saying goodbye, pat his belly or back playfully- I totally get space and myself quite introverted and busy so I need a lot of space as well- but there's a difference between space and not knowing how I'm supposed to interact with him. At first right after we admitted feelings he seemed for flirtatious, we'd play a game and kiss the \"winner\", he'd lean on me on the couch or kiss me before a task- now I feel like the physical touch is intermittent. In the early stages in my experience, attraction is like a wave, it builds on itself- I don't need to spend everyday with him but it's just not a good sign if he seems distant when I lean on him or not wanting small cute touches to say \"we're doing our own thing but I'm thinking of you ;)\"\n* He doesn't text me very much.\n* We've had sex to completion once in the month we've started dating. I was very understanding when he told me he has ED, I've had exes with ED and normally just being non-jugemental and being reassuring helps, but then I asked him he watches porn and found out while we were not able to have sex, he is jerking off to porn multiple times a day. I asked if it was an addiction and he said yes because he's been single for years so it's become a neurotic habit. I sympathize but knowing I live with him, the idea that I am RIGHT there, in the other room, and I could jerk him off or any other sexual act and am horny af thinking about him but he prefers to watch porn instead feels really off. Sometimes we hang out and cuddle, I ask if he's horny and he says he isn't because he just jerked off. Realizing his problem isn't physical in nature but more that he is saving his sexual energy for porn makes me feel really different about it.\n* I went away from christmas to see my family for a week. We'd had the discussion about porn shortly before I left and I told him one of my exes had ED and he stopped watching porn days if we were going to hang out a couple days before and it completely solved the problem, because of how intense porn is it can numb you in a way. The day I left he brought up on his own volition he was going to not watch porn the week I was gone to see if it helps. Well I got back and the same thing, we cuddle and I asked if he's down and he says he doesn't have much of a drive since he's watched porn earlier. He says he needs to stop but frankly with a willing woman who he has expressed strong sexual attraction to who he says he's been crushing on for months in the other room and he's still using porn I kind of doubt he's going to. And I know it's not about me per se but at the beginning i was so INTO him and SO horny that it's almost started making me feel bad about myself, like I have this huge insatiable sex drive and that energy and attraction and lust is just dying on the vine and it feels pathetic.\n* I give him tons of space- I don't text him every day, I don't expect to interact/hang out every day, I don't walk into his room without texting first to see if he's ok with it (he knocks on my door but I don't even feel comfortable doing the same to him because he needs so much \\~space\\~), I even find myself avoiding common areas if he is using them- I want our time together to be intentional. That said, if we make plans to hang out, I get really excited and look forward to it. Let's say he says he'll be home at 430, so I think great, I'll get home at 3 and get ready, but then I wait around for several hours because he won't hang out until maybe 730 or 8. I keep myself occupied but the whole time I'm like, ok, we haven't really hung out in days and I'm really excited and you're delaying to just bum around in your room, playing guitar, reading a book, taking a shower. And knowing what I know about his sexual issues, I believe he probably is jerking off part of that time which is really icky to think about. I KNOW that if we didn't live together, that might be his decompress time and that's really normal, and I wouldn't be so aware of his daily habits- but it still feels disappointing he's not as excited to spend time with me or prioritize me?\n* It's hard to explain but it's just this energy- he feels more distant to me now, then before we confessed. Correspondingly, I've become more shy, distant, and anxious, which obviously makes it harder for me to relax or have fun in his presence.\n* The night that finally made me feel maybe we should end it I slept in the same bed as him, he was touching me a lot- even if he can't always get /maintain an erection he's very interested in touching/looking at me and would say he wants to have sex and he just needs time to get comfortable- that kind of kept me going along with the one time we did have sex to completion we both had amazing orgasms which NEVER happens to me with a partner- so in the middle of the night he wakes up and is carressing me, getting me going, and we start doing it- I switch to on top, say I'm tired and he wants to stop- I say ok, but can see he is still super hard. I ask why he wanted to stop and he said in this weird tone he was tired, honestly it may have been a lie, I don't know. I know he's not in the best physical shape right now but I would jerk him off, I would use my mouth, like, the hard dick we've been waiting for is right there and he spent all night teasing and building me up even waking me up for sex and then just lost interest. After that I felt like time will not fix this issue, there is some emotional disconnect. To be clear, anyone should be able to stop sex at any time for any reason, but it's like, I can only take so much rejection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told him how these things are effecting me emotionally the other day and he said it's only been three weeks not counting the week I spent with my family, I said he's known me four months on top of those 3 weeks but I see his point, he can tell I'm used to be in LTRs and am expecting to interact a certain way but for him it will take time, he's been single 5 years and is very independent, love at first site may be real for some people but he needs to ease into it and relationships don't happen overnight, he knows at his age what he needs and the amount of space that feels right to him especially with living together and he doesn't just want to jump all in right away, he feels we spend lots of time together, that it will be okay it will just take time, and that I encouraged him to advocate for his needs/say if he needs space earlier. I explained I am not saying his needs are wrong and I also enjoy space but that in my experience the early stages is like a momentum and if you're applying brakes to it so often it creates room for doubt, I told him when I walk in a room I don't know if I need to be distant or familiar and that is confusing. He said that is a boundary we are learning to navigate. \n\nI understand his POV but something emotionally feels off. I can't tell if it's my anxiety or if I'm reading he is not emotionally a good choice. It isn't just about the space- it's about the ENERGY he emits, it's about the affectionate, searching, wanting energy dropping off so early. I feel like the certainty and romantic energy I initially had has faded into anxiety. Knowing he's only had one LTR which he ended, I read about attachment style, and maybe I psyched myself out, but I'm worried he has an avoidant attachment style, and despite how much I like him, which I still really do, I'm not sure I want to wait to find out! Am I being unreasonable and asking for too much?\n\n  \nWe probably have 1 big hang out where we spent all evening and night together each week, and then several small hang outs like eating a meal or playing pool together throughout the week or a short cuddle before bed, he checks in with me at least in a small way every day like saying goodnite and kissing me or texting me, and he continues to make plans with me. To me, this is NOT a lot of interaction with someone you really really like.  \n\n\ntldr; roommate romance, I can't tell if he's emotionally distant or if I'm too anxious, he wants lots of space, he says I'm rushing it and if I give him time he will get there, I feel like he's not consistent or feeding the flames of lasting interest, and am considering ending it.",

        "title": "How do I [26M] stop obsessively worrying about my (platonic) best friend so much [26F]?",
        "content": "This just torturous. I know that I am extremely irrational for worrying so much, but I need help.\n\nI met Jay seven years ago this month, along with my other best friend, Nolan [26M]. She was with a boyfriend (someone else entirely) at the time, so I've grown to always see her as just a friend and nothing more. The three of us were calling each other 'best friends' within 2-3 months. She and I are extremely - and I mean EXTREMELY - close with one another, probably to the point of us being codependent. We are two peas in a pod, we're open about everything with each other, including sex, and frequently give each other dating advice. We have so many inside jokes with each other that they've kind of developed their own expanded lore. She is one of my only friends, and she uses me a lot to satisfy her emotional needs.\n\nShe is usually the initiator in the friendship. She's an extreme extrovert and I'm kind of an introvert, and I often find her energy hard to keep up with. I almost never declined to hang out with her, and I often feel as though I've committed some sin or that I'll damage the friendship if I do.\n\nUnfortunately, she suffers from bipolar disorder with psychotic episodes, as well as borderline personality disorder. She also used to have bad anxiety. For the first few years of our friendship, she was always happy to hang out with me, but would only do so if Nolan was also with us. If the three of us were planning a hangout and Nolan bailed, she would immediately bail as well. If I asked her to hang out, she would only do so if Nolan was also free. Fortunately, this went away over time, but it was a bit strange.\n\nOur friendship has been far more good than bad. But she gets sick often and easily, and it's gotten pretty bad at times. Her anxiety used to be far worse than it is now and would sometimes cancel due to anxiety. I think this is kind of cause me to see her as fragile in a sense. It's really hard when it's combined with the fact that I really, really care about her as a person.\n\nIn 2018, Jay's mental health started to worsen again and she slowly stopped hanging out with us due to depression. And then a little while after she got better, around November 2019, she stopped taking her meds and fell into a horrible depression and stopped talking to me. Two months later, I contacted her roommate, who said that several people reached out to her asking if Jay was okay. During part of this, she got fired from her job due to absences, and she would apparently go for several days at a time without leaving her room or even eating. She finally started talking to me again around July, and we hung out again in October. Unfortunately, she then had a psychotic (literally) manic episode, and lost nearly every one of her friends, except for me and a few others. It was extremely frightening for me to witness, and was probably even more so for her.\n\nLong story short, by March 2021, Jay got back on a medication and has been perfectly stable ever since. But I have developed some serious PTSD around literally ANYTHING that might suggest that her well-being is compromised. \n\n* If she doesn't respond to my texts for too long (like 6+ hours), I begin to worry (she usually texts me all day, every day).\n* A few months ago she went on a date with a guy, went to his apartment, and said she'd turn her phone off to focus on the date. I immediately worried that she could be getting r\u00e0p\u00e9d, k\u00eddnapp\u00ebd, or m\u00f9rdered. Obviously, none of those things ever happened.\n* Whenever she says she has period pain, my empathy kicks into overdrive.\n* When she said she had a bad headache recently, I started freaking out, hoping that it wasn't a severe headache and that she wasn't suffering.\n* She started waking up late recently, and working fewer hours (she and I are independent contractors who choose our own hours). Yesterday she said she just wasn't motivated to work and didn't work because she felt she didn't need to. It's made me extremely scared that she's becoming depressed again.\n\nI can only hope that she's still taking her meds and that her illness isn't getting worse.\n\nMy worrying never damaged our friendship until today.\n\nI've had kind of a tickly throat for the past few days. But my mom, who has been very sick for months, ended up testing positive for c\u00f3vid today - I see her frequently and did so yesterday before I hung out with Jay and Nolan (my mom has previously had several negative test results so we assumed it wasn't covid).\n\nI told Jay and Nolan about this in our group chat, and basically spent several minutes dumping all of my freaking out and fears onto them about my worrying that I may have infected them. Jay got quite annoyed with me. I apologized, but now I feel like such a fool for freaking out in the first place.\n\nJay said she's not mad at me, but said that she's feel frustrated if my cov\u00edd situation begins to impact our social life, but that she understands if I don't want to hang out for safety reasons.\n\nJay probably hates me for dumping all of my emotional baggage onto her. I think my logical side still recognizes that this is not the case, but it sucks to have to deal with.\n\nTL;DR: my best friend has dealt with a lot of serious mental health issues in her life, and I always worry and freak out that she's in danger.",

        "content": "I (F,19) have been with by boyfriend (M,19) for a little over a year now, and we have been LDR for about 65% of our relationship.. Looking at the timeline of our relationship:\n\n Fall 2020: Awful for him as he always compromised for me, while I was new to relationships, so I wasn't fully emotionally expressive or comfortable with him just yet.. Additionally, covid hit, so we were forced to conduct our relationship online and off-college campus. However, I felt fulfilled and told him I loved him towards the end (about a month after he said it to me).\n\nWinter 2021: Awful for him as he continued to compromise for me all the time. I moved onto campus while he remained at home. The stress of studies and living alone on campus meant I only spent <30 minutes with me a day through texting or calling. I still felt fulfilled and continued to love him. He nearly broke up with me though.. But I reasoned with him and we stayed together after a very very emotional couple of days.\n\nSpring 2021: Good for him. Good for me. He moved on campus and we spent nearly every day together in person. we barely ever fought.. and I finally got comfortable with my emotions, so he felt like he didnt have to compromise as much and felt like I was reciprocating. Truly a turning point in our relationship.\n\nSummer 2021: Awful, lots of fights and almost broke up. We were both LDR again.\n\nFall 2021: Mixed for him. He got to spend almost everyday with me, which was great, but in the process felt like he lost his close friends as he ditched them a lot to spend time with me. I felt horribly guilty.. I also felt like I was weirding out my roommates by letting him stay over nearly everyday, but never told him. I felt good that I was able to spend a lot of time with him.\n\nNow that it is Winter 2022, we are once again LDR. He is taking an internship at Amazon while I am still in school. We are only a week in and are losing hope.\n\n1) He will be graduating early, which means we will have to go LDR for an year while I am still at school. Considering that at that point, we will only have been together for 2 years in total, going a full year LDR seems horrible..\n\n2) He will not be able to visit me as much since my new roommate practices Islam and is uncomfortable having over men overnight.\n\n3) Even if we get through everything and I graduate college and we stay together, he fears I will not be able to get a job in the same city as him. This may mean long distance again..\n\nHe is ultimately afraid that the next 2.5 years will be torture for him due to LDR and less time spent together. We are very very close and unusual from most couples, I think, because when we spend time apart, we miss each other so much that it physically hurts us and makes us behave weirdly (i may be wrong lol, maybe this is something all couples do).\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n\n**In his words:   \"If I really only had 2 good quarters with her and suffered the rest of the time, that\u2019s 5 months of goodness for the 48 months I\u2019m with her, so a 10% happiness ratio and 90% suffering ratio for a future that may or may not happen. Meanwhile, I have to deal with being sad all the time, fights and quarrels, lots of long-distance, lots of weirdness when in person, and a weird relationship with my friends. It\u2019s just a tough choice to make. It\u2019s tough because we\u2019ve already made it so far, I don\u2019t want all that effort to be wasted. But at the same time, it\u2019s not really easy for me to just accept an inevitable future of suffering for someone with who I don\u2019t even clearly see a definite future with\".**\n\n**i love him.. and will do anything for him.. he is my world..

So few months back we started doing this job (picking an autistic kid up to/from school). which is like 4 hours per day and we started talking etc. but from my pov altho we talk i dont think he treats me as a friend and i for some reason have expectations that he will because i have had a go at him few times saying look as a friend i shouldnt have to ask or he shud be doing things that he does with his other friends.\n\nAn example (& if he cared enough imo, even if he didnt say I am his friend) is when we go pick up the kid, I walk to his house to save some time, but if its raining or w/e then I would fully expect him to say I will come around to your house. thats what i would expect from anyone. He didnt the first time.\n\nAnother example we go church and until i brought this up, he didnt pick me up for church (as i dont have a car).\n\nBoth times he agreed he should be more thoughtful, he said he is like that with all his friend which i was sort of ok with but what has pissed me off more is that before xmas break i asked him for two things (One important, one not). so he doesnt say two words to me the whole xmas, just when we are about to start our job, he casually  texts 'holidays is over, how was your xmas break.. and i m pissed like for two weeks, you dont text your friend or ask to go out etc, (I heard at least once he went out with his other friend, so he is clearly not like that (ie uncaring etc) with all his friends. plus if he valued me asa friend he would want to go out or w/e. (i didnt text him either because i was waiting for him.. maybe that was a  wrong move i dunno). the only thing he did text me was to lets go church and both times i declined to go with him cuz partly i was mad but partly i was doing other things which I could have postponed..\n\non the first day back he casually mentions the two things I had asked for, and tbf at that point I SHOULD have enquired why wait until now, why not just text me as and when..\n\nI dont want to have a go at him again because last time he did get angry (not because i had a go, but i have a habit of going quiet and obv he could tell something was wrong) saying i cant just stop talking to him and then restart when i feel like because he has some self respect/dignity. and he is right about that but then equally he should follow through with his friends claim.\n\nI have said to myself i wont have a go at him this time even though I am angry but come on if someone says they are your friend then they should at least do the 'friend' things. as an example my other friends have sent me messages, i have gone around to his brothers house and we hung out few times... but maybe i should talk and not have a go instead?\n\nthe other thing i said to myself is i WILL try to have no expectations going forward but again thats hard because its my mind/brain and i cant just stop myself and i would rather not have another 'acquaintance' i have plenty of those, the one that say hi/hello when u meet them and then after that no contact..\n\nI could just stop this job so i dont see him. but i KNOW he wont contact me as he didnt previously and I want him in my life as a friend.\n\nTL;DR! a friend says he is friend but doesnt act like one.",

With no hesitation I have been putting all my concerns on a back burner because I know he\u2019s struggling and needs me to be supportive instead of needy. So I\u2019ve had a few weeks to contemplate our relationship. I asked him to meet up numerous times so we can talk about things but he always came up with an excuse like \u201cour friends are getting together in a few days and if I wanna go I can\u2019t go out today\u201d \n\nSo since it\u2019s not worth him risking an hour to talk face to face. I thought I might as well say this to him now because the longer I don\u2019t say anything the worse it gets. I think I deserve more. For days I\u2019ve been trying to put my feelings into words but I\u2019m stumped. Every way I try to frame it makes it seem like \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough\u201d or \u201cyou don\u2019t put any effort\u201d. That\u2019s not the case though. People have their own unique ways of showcasing their feelings and I feel like he does it in a language I don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not okay to compare and I know that. But I also know that in order to catch societal cues and shit I have to observe people. My therapist told me that a few months ago. And I\u2019ve been keeping up with it. And it\u2019s making me see that while my entire world revolves around him, his had an orbit I couldn\u2019t even conceive. I have been trying to balance the expectations and understanding of his situation and I am genuinely at a loss where to draw the line. I love him. More than I could ever have imagined myself loving someone. So I feel so selfish for wanting to be treated differently. I know I shouldn\u2019t do this but I\u2019ve been seeing how my friends are treated by their bfs and there is a common grounds with the boyfriends treatments. I never had that. Sometimes I just wanna say \u201cSpoil me.\u201d Am I asking for too much? I don\u2019t think so. Just please show me that you want to spoil me. No money needed. My family is well off and I lack nothing I want. But I just want silly notes to be slipped into my bag. Or for him to know my favorite tea. \n\nIt\u2019s not like this is a foreign concept to him. I\u2019ve been consistently doing these types of things for the past 3 years and expected nothing in return. He knows it means a lot to me but he puts in no effort. \n\nHe acts like these simple things I want are only a hassle for him. I want to see him more often but he always says how he isn\u2019t in the mood to deal with his parents. He knows that my parents are hard asses too and I have been taking every opportunity no matter how risky it may be. \n\nI open up and his response is basically \u201csorry you feel that way\u201d. I came to him with a problem and he turned me away. Just like that. No effort even trying to understand what I mean. \n\nTL;DR I don\u2019t know how to express these desires to him without seeming like an inconsiderate brat.

We\u2019ve been together for almost 2 months and have known each other for 6. She said something inappropriate and I remember saying like \u201chush\u201d or something cause my mom was in the other room. The only reason I said it was because you can hear things very clearly in the room next to mine and she was talking about pornstars and erections(something I\u2019d prefer my mom not to hear). Anyways, after I said that she became withdrawn and quiet and seemed very, very upset. I kept asking her what was wrong and trying to joke with her and showing her TikToks and such. She wouldn\u2019t talk to me and finally decided to tell me to take her home. I was pretty upset by this and felt frustrated that I didn\u2019t understand what was going on. We get halfway to her house and she tells me the reason she\u2019s upset was because I told her to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d. I have NO recollection of this. I\u2019m not calling her a liar by any means, I believe that she thinks she heard this or did hear it from me. However, I am incredibly distraught by this and the fact that I don\u2019t remember ever saying that to her. Just for reference I would NEVER say that to ANYONE I love in my life. Ever. This has happened one other time where I spoke to her in a tone that she said was rude(Again, I don\u2019t remember). I am genuinely worried for myself and very upset. I\u2019ve apologized to her profusely and am feeling very confused and frustrated. Talking to someone like that\u2014especially someone you care about\u2014is very serious and I don\u2019t know what to do from here. I feel like a piece of shit for saying it. I did not consciously say it and did not mean to say it nor do I remember saying it but have accepted that those words came out of my lips. I\u2019ve scoured my thoughts for any semblance of intention for saying that to her but I can\u2019t find it in me to speak to anyone I love like that. I am worried this is either a medical issue and I did say it or maybe she misheard me. I\u2019ve never been in a situation like this and am so lost. This has made me consider seeing a doctor to ask if this could happen, maybe something like Dementia or STML. Regardless, where do I go from here? How do I make this up to her?",

I know it has nothing to do with her sexual preferences as she does find males attractive. \n\nAny idea what might be holding her back? She is more introverted but does have a decent job and is functional. She is a more anxious person and does not drive if that's relevant. She did experience a lot of trauma growing up from a father who had severe anger issues (would yell and smash/throw/break things). Her two older siblings don't seem to have this issue though. It concerns me as I feel she might be lonely, especially as she gets older. \n\nTL;dr: 31F cousin has never dated and does not want to date\n\nEdit: my goal isn't to push her into dating if she doesn't want to. I just want to understand her perspective better and know if she does need my support in anyway or not. She's fairly shy so that's why I thought I'd get more insight before approaching her. Maybe there's obvious things I'm missing here that are important to be considered.",

        "content": "When I was a kid, my aunt told me about her boyfriend or fiance who bought her a Maserati and she turned it down because it was \"too much\" and she couldn't accept it and that I shouldn't accept gifts that were 'too much'. He died so the relationship didn't progress and I never got to ask him about it.  I have gotten feedback from romantic partners that I don't accept gifts enough or well.\n\nFor example, once went to a jewelry store with an ex who wanted to get me a $16k necklace we thought was pretty. I said it was nice but too much and I'd prefer something from an independent artist. Honestly if the $16k went to a meaningful piece from an independent artist and he really wanted to spend his money like that maybe, especially since we were serious?\n\nIn that relationship I also would not accept items unless they were on sale. This part was probably obnoxious but I do a lot of humanitarian and volunteer work and it was hard to stomach $2k for shoes. $299 for shoes (originally $980) that were really well made and would last a long time, fine, but $1-2k on a regular basis was difficult. I felt like if he knew me or accepted me as I was he would have found a way to get pretty shoes and jewelry, sure, but also do something related to my humanitarian interests like a donation to a group I worked with or a cause we both liked. I would have definitely appreciated that more. His mother was upset I turned down the necklace, said she'd pick up the pieces for him from her favorite independent designer and got me cheap fakes that fell apart while putting them on. He regularly buys his current girlfriend stuff from luxury brands so clearly she doesn't have an issue with it so maybe I was weird.\n\nOther boyfriends have felt threatened because they said I seemed above their paygrade or said I didn't accept gifts well in general. Although I made it clear I cover my own expenses, etc and valued things because they were from them, they felt like they couldn't give gifts that matched it or what I put into the relationship. When guys took me out to dinner and the bill for the night (a few places) came out to almost 1k that also made me extremely uncomfortable although they said it was normal. I tried to pay repeatedly and suggest cheaper places but they didn't accept. Before someone asks, there was no s\\*\\* involved with the dates and they were my age (college, early 20's).\n\nI've also had experiences on the far opposite end of the spectrum which sucked feeling unappreciated and used, or partners said I did too much for them even without gifts and they felt unbalanced and guilty.\n\nSo I'm getting back into dating and am not sure where the line between \"should accept it\" and \"too much\" is and how to graciously accept something. Because of the amount of criticism I've received about this, I thought about it and realized part of it in the past was because I was emotionally unavailable and because gift giving is one of my love languages, not accepting them was a form of maintaining that unavailability.\n\nTL;DR here's the line? How do you know if you're giving too much without return, and when something received is too much or okay?",

        "content": "I am sorry if this is going to be too long but I feel like I have to explain my situation in detail. :(\n\nAlright, so first some background.\n\nMy boyfriend (35m) of 1.5 years and I moved into the apartment in October last year. It was an urgent move because we had to move into a city that neither of us knew anything about.. so we were staying at a hotel while searching for an apartment. And our stay got quite expensive for that reason. So we didn't have much choice.\n\nIt was quite difficult to find a nice & affordable apartment at that time of year. So we settled for this one. It HAD NOT been cleaned before we moved in (there was dust everywhere, bathroom was dirty, carpets were stained etc). Furniture was old (we looked for a furnished one which is common in my country btw), it is from 1980s. Their excuse for dirtiness is that nobody lived in the apartment for quite some time, nor visited it.\n\n However, on the brighter side, the apartment was large, well lit and in a good location. And we only plan to stay there until October 2022 so we decided that it was ok for some time.\n\nAnyway, I am not the neatiest person alive but I don't think I'm a slob. We do dishes every evening (yes it piles up but only for a day so no dishes are left dirty overnight). We clean the bathroom once every 7-8 days. We clean dust every few days (I am allergic to dust so this is extremely important.. I dust EVERYTHING). We vacuum maybe once in 10 days (maybe it should be more regular).\n\nPerhaps I am a bit messy though. Both of us are. I usually don't clean up mess right away (papers, clothes and stuff like that), sometimes they're left on the table, not organized.. no clothes are on the floor, but there are always some on spare beds, or chairs.. not a large pile, though, and it's not dirty clothes.. \n\nWe're also smokers (smoking is allowed). I want to quit and I know it's an awful habit but I am looking for a right moment (already quit and started again in the past :( ). Perhaps we don't wash the ashtrays that often... I just forget about it, because they are often used.. but they're emptied often...\n\nAnyway, as we have two bedrooms, one of them is set to be an art studio sort of lol. I am an artist. So I have a lot of art supplies. And I have no space for them. (Did I mention that landlords left all their stuff locked in wardrobes there?). So in one room, there is a large table onto which I put my tablecloth, and that's where I keep my art supplies. So it's always full of stuff. There are also lots of boxes for art supplies that I don't use often. But they are well organized, not scattered over the room.. etc. And I have an easel, under which there is another cloth which I put in order not to spoil carpets with my paint... Maybe it looks ugly there but it is for protection.\n\nAnyway, so, to get to the point. \n\nWe had planned to go to our hometown for holidays on December 16. And we planned to stay until January 10. My boyfriend is a project manager so he works a lot and I also happened to work a lot during that period. \n\nSo 16th comes, we have very limited time, not everything is packed, we panic. The previous day, washing machine (which is like 60 years old lol) broke and almost made a damn flooding. But we fixed it. And I used some plastic containers to pick up water that flooded the bathroom. Water was dirty and left traces on th container. Also that day, I cleaned both the bathroom & the kitchen. And hanged the clothes. \n\nSo on 16th, we are only half-packed, and we are in a hurry. Panic, panic, panic. So we did the dishes from breakfast, left them in open to dry, clothes still wet so we left them to dry too, I packed my essential art supplies, scattered my clothes across the bed to pick what to carry, etc... We managed to pack everything, and we have 10 mins until we go. Boyfriend smokes, he accidentally drops the ashtray on the table lol (onto OUR tablecloth), but the taxi is waiting for us already, so yeah, we go... i am a bit anxious because we'd planned to clean the whole place before we go but you don't always do as you planned.\n\nSo anyway, we let the landlord know that we would be far away during the holidays, they said ok.\n\nAnd, a couple of days ago, the landlord calls us and says that he would be in the apartment on Monday to take some measurements (he wanted to replace a couch). I wasn't very happy about it because he'd be coming while we were not there. And we left a small mess. But I said it was fine, what else was I supposed to say? \n\nOn Monday, he calls and complains that the place is \"extremely dirty\". Lol. I ask him \"How? What is dirty?\", he says \"The container in the bathroom is dirty and there is some ash on the table and the place is a mess\". \n\nAs I said, there were some clean clothes scattered over the bed, art supplies on the table, CLEAN dishes on the kitchen countertop (2 plates, 2 cups, 1 pot and some cutlery) and CLEAN clothes hanging to dry... And he complained about dust? But he knows we left on 16th Jan. In which world does dust not accumulate for such a long period?! \n\nHe says he'd be coming on 11th after we return to \"talk\".\n\nI feel really embarrassed. Is he right? Does he even have any right to criticize us for small mess like that? Nothing is damaged. We were in a hurry. We had to follow a bus timetable. It's not like the place is hoarded with stuff. I dread what he might say when he comes. Or he might even spread it as a rumor or something. \n\nShould I be embarrassed? Am I in the wrong? Or is he? What would you classify as dirty? Also, how do I explain the situation to him without sounding like I am just finding excuses? \n\nBoyfriend says that I am overreacting and that the guy is an a**hole but I am really embarrassed. How do I deal with this?\n\n**Tl;dr** - Boyfriend and I moved into a new apartment in October. We clean regularly but there is always a small mess of stuff on tables (art supplies, papers, etc but nothing dirty). We left on Dec 16 to visit our hometown. Before that, apartment was cleaned. We left a small mess (scattered clean clothes on the bed, a plastic container containing traces of dirty water in the bathroom, unnecessary art supplies, and some spilled ash on OUR tablecloth on art table). We were in a hurry when packing, so that is why all that was left. Landlord visited the place while we were not there and complained about the mess. Now I am really embarrassed. Am I a slob or is he overreacting?",

        "content": "\nNot sure how to start this so I'm going to give out some basic back story about me and then the situation. I'm a 30 year old tall morbidly obese guy abut 350lbs. I've been told by many people that I have a very kind personality and can be fun to be around. I wouldn't call my self attractive but I'm not ugly ugly either. I have a pretty stressful life, mainly brought on by a parent with mental illness and a Job that was taking alot of my free time this last year.  The job taking all my free time gave me alot of of extra income and since I was basically in a work, deal with parent, sleep cycle I wasn't really using using the extra money. \n\nI wanted to find a way to get away from some of that stress, I was looking for a fun distraction and with so little time to meet people in conventional ways I started looking into Sugar baby/sugar daddy relationships. I ended up joining a pretty popular site for that and started talking to a girl we'll call her M. We chatted for a couple days and she told me what she was looking for, M was/is pregnant and recently single and was looking for some help with expenses in getting things ready for the baby. She was looking for a short term thing only which sounded perfect to me.\n\nWe planned to meet for lunch but maybe 30 minutes or so before M asked if I'd like to go straight to a hotel instead and we did. She looked very attractive in her pictures, in person she was drop dead gorgeous. I'd genuinely say shes a 10/10, under normal circumstances I would never end up with someone this attractive. We started talking getting to know each other a bit and things escalated quickly  We were at a hotel so you get the idea and as a sd/sb there was money involved. But despite the circumstances we had this raw physical passionate connection that ive never felt before. We met again the next day and it went the same way. But she opened up alot more the second day and pretty much told me everything about her while we were laying in bed. \n\n\nM's backstory: She was in a extremely abusive relationship for a long time, she's pregnant with his child. She managed to get out of the relationship and her ex ended up in jail he'll be there for a long time. She had a decent job and made decent money when we met, not amazing but it's solid money. I've been able to verify pretty much everything's she's told me at one point or another. \n\nI noticed our conversations changing, we developed what seemed like a real friendship we started hanging out and doing friend things like meeting up for lunch or going to the movies, messaging each other through the day things like that. Money was only involved on days we went to a hotel. I started getting more free time away from work and we started hanging out more and more this all happened with-in a couple weeks. It always meant for this to be a short term thing, we both planned it that way and had talked about it. Work went to normal, my disposable money decreased and some circumstances with my parent meant the financial aspect and thus our arrangement was coming to an end. \n\nExcept it didn't. Its been a few months now we've kept talking, we kept hanging out. Money stopped being involved she got a promotion at work she makes good money now I pushed her to reconnect with her family who her ex had distanced her from. She has that supprot system again shes really happy to have them in her life again and theyre all excited for the baby. She says I'm amazing she loves how kind, thoughtful and supportive I can be. From everything ive heard i'm the polar opposite of what her ex was. \n\nSo it's gone from a SD/SB arrangement to a FWB type arrangement and i find my self thinking of her often. I feel incredibly proud of the changes she's making in her life and the way she's getting everything together for her soon to be child. She credits me for alot of these things, but honestly she really did it all her self all I did was give her a little encouragement. \n\nBecause of the way we met one side of me feels like this can't be anything more than what it is and i should leave it at that and appreciate it for what it is. But i find my self thinking what if this can me more. I can tell she doesn't need me financially anymore, so why am I still around? My birthday was recently, she gave me a extremely thoughtful and somewhat expensive gift that was based of a story I had told her about my childhood. \n\nI feel like I want this to be more but I also feel like i just happened to be the first guy she met after her abusive relationship that was kind and supportive and she may just be latching on to that feeling. \n\nI just need someone else's perspective \n\nTL;DR\nI met a gal on a SD/SB site, it somehow morphed into a FWBs instead and I'm wondering if I can morph again to something more.",

        "title": "My former friend (19M) often physically hurt me (19NB) as a \u201cjoke\u201d. Was this actually abuse?",
        "content": "Context: I am a few inches shorter than him, and I have chronic illness that causes severe fatigue/weakness. I was physically incapable of protecting myself because of this, and he was well aware of that fact. He was also my first actual non-online friend and I didn\u2019t know what a healthy friendship looked like (I still don\u2019t), which is why I let this go on for so long.\n\nI recently cut ties with an toxic friend. He verbally and emotionally abused me for over 2 years, and he would become so angry at me that he would scream at me, call me slurs or purposely cause me to have panic attacks. Last July, he got angry at me while we were alone together and he tried to hit me. He stopped himself before his hand could make contact and he stormed outside instead. When he came back he just acted like it never happened. This is the only time (that I know of) where he was clearly physically abusive towards me. After that incident I decided to stop being friends with him. \n\nIt took me several months to cut him off but I\u2019m finally free. As I\u2019ve had a lot of time to reflect and think about what I\u2019ve gone through, I\u2019ve realized that the abuse he did to me was a lot worse than I initially thought, and I\u2019ve started to identify all of the seemingly \u201cnormal\u201d things he did that were actually abuse. But for a while I thought that the incident in July was still the only time he had tried to physically abuse me. Then I realized that I might be wrong.\n\nStarting in January/February of 2021, we began to see each other IRL a lot, and he became a lot more physical with me. It started with him just throwing pizza boxes at me \u201cas a joke\u201d while we were at work. Then he started to punch me/hit me/kick me, again as a \u201cjoke\u201d. It was hard enough to leave bruises sometimes. Because of my chronic illness I have a lot of blood pooling in my legs and it causes them to be hypersensitive to pain, and I told him at one point that kicking me in the legs caused enough pain that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it. He responded with \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d and immediately did it again. But he was laughing while he did it so I felt like it was just a joke and that I was being too sensitive. \n\nThere were other times when the physical stuff would be\u2026 more serious. He would push my fingers back as far as possible or he would make me hold my hand as close to his lighter as long as I could to \u201csee how long I\u2019d last\u201d. A couple of times he\u2019d ask me to lift something heavy to \u201csee if I could do it\u201d despite knowing about my chronic illness and knowing that it would cause me to black out/hyperventilate and get vertigo. There were times when he would step on my feet/my toes (while I wore shoes) until I was in pain. At one point he even choked me for a few seconds. There were also some times when he would \u201cjokingly\u201d hurt me until I did something that he wanted (like give him my phone or move out of the way).\n\nI was uncomfortable with all of this and he legitimately caused a lot of pain, but I thought it was just normal friendship stuff and I ignored it. Again, all of this was done in a joking manner and it never really happened when he *appeared* to be angry. But there were times when it happened after I did something that I know made him annoyed/angry, even if he wasn\u2019t outwardly angry, so there might have been some malicious intent there, I\u2019m not sure.\n\nWas this physical abuse? Or was it just normal friendship stuff that I misinterpreted as abuse? Should I have told him to stop? It is my fault that I didn\u2019t tell him to stop? I don\u2019t know.\n\nTLDR: my former friend verbally and emotionally abused me for several years. Early last year he started to regularly hit/punch/kick me (among other things) \u201cas a joke\u201d, and I just let him, but now that I\u2019m looking back on it I don\u2019t think it really was a joke after all.",

He turns into a different person entirely, gets stressed and anxious, constantly complains, and is easily distracted. He constantly interrupts me and gets upset and hurt when I ask for space.",
        "content": "My boyfriend (25M) and I (25F) have been together for 7 years and living together for 3. We have a pretty great relationship and most people who meet us think we are made for each other. However, the worst fights of our relationship have all involved one thing: Him working from home.\n\nI am a college student and I also have a part time job. My boyfriend works a full time job in an office about 25 minutes from our house. When Covid first hit, all my classes went online, as did my work, and he was also instructed to work from home. At first we were a little excited as we would get to see each other more and work in our pajamas. Things quickly turned south.\n\nMy boyfriend has severe diagnosed ADHD and being in his home environment proved exceedingly distracting and he found it very difficult to focus. This, coupled with being unable to leave or see friends due to lockdown restrictions, made everything very stressful. He had just started at this job right before the pandemic hit and learning the ropes from a distance was causing him a lot of anxiety.\n\nWe turned our guest bedroom into an office for him, and my desktop set up was in our bedroom so we would have separate spaces. However, he could not seem to stay in his office and would CONSTANTLY come bother me. I had never had this issue with him in the 5 years prior. He would come barge into the bedroom every 15 minutes trying to talk to me, even while I was writing papers, doing work, or in online classes. It was incredibly frustrating. He didn't respect my space or time in the slightest. He would try talking to me while I was in the middle of an online lecture and I would miss things my professors were saying. \n\nWhen I pictured us working from home, I pictured us getting to have breakfast and lunch together, and maybe taking a break or two and saying hi. I did not anticipate him having daily mental breakdowns where he would interrupt me every 15 minutes freaking out about work, his coworkers, stress, etc. I'm not exaggerating when I say it was about every 15 minutes. He would NOT leave me alone. This was unchartered territory for our relationship and I was losing my mind. I was stressed out as it was and I could not handle him constantly interrupting me and complaining about his work. He would get so worked up over me not making time for him in the middle of our work day and say that I was hurting his feelings and not acknowledging that working from home was affecting his mental health. It was also affecting mine! He did not handle the isolation of the pandemic well and would frequently cry and have anxiety attacks.\n\nI had the worst grades in my academic history during the semester he worked from home and the majority of it I think was due to him constantly begging for attention and interrupting me when I was in online class or trying to study. I would get behind in my own job because he kept making up excuses to come talk to me instead of doing his own work.\n\nWe fought A LOT over this and I seriously considered breaking up with him and moving out. I broke Covid restrictions and went and stayed with a friend for a bit and then when I came back I had him go stay at his mother's house because I was at my wit's end.\n\nIt really messed with me because prior to this, we never fought and didn't have any major issues in our relationship. I had never seen this side of him before and it made me re-evaluate our whole relationship.\n\nThings eventually settled down, he got to return to the office, and I got to return to in person school. After that happened we stopped fighting and our relationship was great again.\n\nIt's been great for almost an entire year until now. One of his coworkers caught Covid and yesterday he was told to work from home until further notice. His office is also considering having everyone work from home again anyway due to omicron. \n\nI was home all day yesterday because my uni is on winter break. I also work at my uni so I don't have work (classes start back next week). I thought things wouldn't be bad because I wasn't working but I could not be more wrong.\n\nHe kept getting distracted all day, tried talking to me about every 20 minutes on average, kept interrupting me in anything I tried to do, etc. Then he would get mad when I asked him to leave me alone. He said I didn't care about him or how he was feeling stressed and overwhelmed with working from home. The more he talked to me, the more time he was wasting, and the further behind he got in work, which stressed him out even more. Yet he would NOT leave me alone. It was near constant. I couldn't eat, I couldn't pee, I couldn't do the dishes, etc. without him breathing down my neck and freaking out or complaining about work. It was too much and neither of us could leave the house as we were both exposed via his coworker. \n\nWe started fighting and me getting angry made him cry. He started crying saying he couldn't do his work and it was honestly just cringe to watch. He wanted me to comfort him but all I felt was anger and frustration. I just wanted to be left out of his work drama. He has zero problems when he works in the office and does NOT act like this when he's not working from home. It just felt dramatic and overwhelming and I wanted nothing to do with it. He begged me to just sit in the room with him while he worked, saying he could get it done if I just hung out with him. I told him absolutely not and that he couldn't hold me hostage like that and that his behavior was bizarre and making me uncomfortable. This made him cry even more and he started hyperventilating.\n\nIn the 7 years we have been together I have never seen him like this. The whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth. He has mental health issues, as do I, and he takes anxiety meds in addition to seeing a therapist, but working from home just sends him over the edge.\n\nThis morning I woke up to find we were snowed in, further trapping us, and his antics started up as soon as he woke up. He's been in a sour mood, complaining all day, interrupting me constantly once again. \n\nI went for a walk in the snow to get away from him and came back inside to have a bite to eat. I sat down with a yogurt and hadn't even had one spoonful before he came downstairs and started up again. He sat down across from me and apologized and I was pretty short with him. I said I wasn't mad, I just wanted to be left alone while he worked and to eat my yogurt in peace. I also said I'd be happy to hang out after he's off the clock. He got angry at this and said I was shutting him down by not talking about it. I said I didn't want to talk about it, I just wanted to enjoy my food in 5 minutes of silence and that I would be completely fine if we just waited until after he was done working to hang out. He felt I was being rude and got upset with me over this. He screamed something like \"Fine, I just won't talk to you at all then!\" and stormed upstairs.\n\nI waited and then went upstairs too and a few minutes later he showed up in the doorway to my room, AGAIN, I sighed and asked what he wanted and he just turned around and went to his office and slammed the door since he didn't like my tone.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend turns into a needy, complaining monster when he works from home and suddenly all respect for my time/boundaries goes out the window. What do I do about this???\n\nPlease don't give me the stereotypical reddit advice of break up with him.",

        "content": "My husband and I have been together for many years. I think one of the reasons our relationship has been so successful is because we agree on almost everything ideologically, but personality-wise, we couldn't be more different. I am very direct and up-front, whereas he tends to prefer to operate in the background and avoids the spotlight. We've been in marriage counseling for about a year to improve our communication skills (highly recommended!) and I'm starting to learn how he became who he is.\n\n\nWe both experienced abusive fathers growing up. My father was physically abusive. I caught beatings on a regular basis, but when a beating wasn't happening, my dad was ok. I've been able to coexist with him in my life as a result. My husband, on the other hand, went through something much different. His father never laid a hand on him but he grew up in what I would call a psychological torture chamber until his parents divorced. It's too painful for me to share what he went through, just understand that no child should have gone through it, and that I fully believe that I got off easy with the regular beatings. Fortunately, he was taken out of that situation eventually and in the care of his mother who is a wonderful woman who raised him very well, but it certainly left a mark. \n\n\nI have learned that his way of coping with that experience was to try to please his father by being very agreeable with everything, which is his main way of coping with life now. He pretends to see everything through rose-colored glasses because he doesn't like to admit when things are really bad, even though he's incredibly intelligent and analytical. He's a highly gifted network/cybersecurity engineer but rather underemployed because he had a bad job experience that seems to have harmed his career self-worth, even though I know he would love nothing more than to be solving real cybersecurity problems for a living. Even though I have no real experience or valuable real-world skills, I've almost caught up to him in pay simply because I'm willing to take risks and ask for more money and he's seemingly unwilling to do so. It's not the money I'm concerned about, it's the fact that my kind husband is being taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers and he seems to not want to fight back. I try to tell him that he has to fight back or they WILL take advantage, but he gets frustrated and filled with-self doubt. He is always well-liked by people (unlike me) but doesn't seem to want to make friends for some reason. He is convinced he is a bad person, but I've never encountered evidence of that other than typical dumb teenage mistakes and the like that we all made.\n\nI think his lack of progression in life is starting to hurt him psychologically, but he's the main cause of that lack of progression! Literally only he is holding himself back with this approach. I don't want him to stop being my sweet husband, but I also don't want to see him hurt by people anymore. I am working on convincing him to get into counseling; he is a military veteran diagnosed with PTSD but we are fighting with the VA over whether the military will cover it so we're at a standstill on that. We could afford private care but he is stuck on this thing with the VA and holding back due to that. But are there any books, resources, or advice others have for someone in this situation? Can anyone relate? My husband is a good, kind, caring person and deserves more than what he's getting out of life, but he doesn't seem to realize that he needs to reach out and at least ask for it at some point (if not demand/take it). I've left him to his own devices on this issue for a long time, but I can now see that it's starting to really hurt him and I don't want to see him go through all this unnecessary pain. I also worry that he may even falsely \"agree\" with me on some things and that breaks my heart. I never asked for that and I don't want him to secretly resent me over it.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Husband is very agreeable due to childhood trauma and it is negatively affecting his life and mental health. How do I help him?\n\nEdit: I do want to note that he IS assertive in some areas, such as when our lives are in danger, in laws become problematic, etc. It's only when it's about him improving his station in life that he doesn't want to be assertive. I just wanted to make that clear.",

My mother's side of the family has some generational issue with empathy, ego, power and control and because my mother didn't really get along with my father's side of the family, I was primarily surrounded by my aunts (My mother has 7 sisters+1brother). I remember since I was like 4 yrs old, I was picked on about the size of my body, my looks, my monolids, being constantly compared with my cousins who were the same age as me and just relentless belittling and patronizing. Still to this day, I struggle with the idea of self-worth and overall self-esteem and insecurities. \n        So, I made sure that I protect my baby sister from all that. I made sure to never ever make any comment which would make her insecure or go through the trauma that I went through and still dealing with. I made sure to let her know that she was special and beautiful in her own way. Consequently, she turned out more confident and outgoing than me and my second younger sister (who also struggles with some of the same issues as me). \nBut she has started to act a lot like my aunts and I don't know how TF she turned out to be that way. She used to be quite sweet and respectful until she hit puberty and now she can say the meanest things just like that. \n     I started having problems with extreme acne flareup which has left my once flawless skin quite pigmented and scarred and she'd pass absolutely hurtful comments on that, knowing fully well that it's something that I'm having really hard time dealing with. She'd pick on my monolids. She'd make comments on my nose. She'd make fun of my body.\n       Time and again I have reminded her how the things she says so nonchalantly are extremely hurtful yet she does it again. \n      I have stopped talking to her for a while now because I don't need that energy in my life and another person to point out all my insecurities for me. \n     I just don't understand how she turned out to be this way?\n\nTL:DR 8 yrs younger sis(16) constantly mocks and picks on my(F,25) biggest insecurities despite me pointing out that her words are hurtful. Growing up, because I went through traumatic experiences, I made sure to make her well aware of her own self-worth and teach her self-love[which are things that I still struggle with]. Consequently, she turned way more confident and outgoing than me and the sister next to me(which I'm absolutely happy about) but now I have no clue how she turned out to be so fucking mean and just plain ruthless.",

Her nephew (42M?) never helped out with my grandmother's care at all (early stage Alzheimers) despite living in her home for free for years, and her niece (40F?) never listened to her after she continually tried to encourage her to graduate high school and not have kids too early (she did neither) and was ungrateful after she helped her financially with said kids after she became a single mother. Granted, the most strained relationship she has is with my cousin's mother, who she has largely implied contributed to her older brother passing away (20 years ago) due to alcoholism and (I suspect) drugs, (the sister-in-law's brother was an addict), even going as far as to say I quote \"She killed that man.\" I found her on Facebook thru my cousin and just out of curiosity happened to Google her name and had the shock of my life at what I found- a recent article about homelessness in my city with her and her husband profiled.

        "content": "My sister (29F) and I (27F) have had a tumultuous relationship at best. She hated me growing up and really treated me badly. Bullied me a lot, blamed me for the family's problems (although my whole family did), and was all around nasty to me. My parents were neglectful and my sister was high-maintenance, and I have worked out that they let her control me and treat me like shit so she wouldn't cause them trouble (courtesy of my multiple therapists). Things got better randomly when she went away for college, and then I moved across the country for a couple of years, and then came back to our hometown after graduating. We lived together for a year but that was the absolute worst experience. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially she constantly demanded my time and competed with my friends, people I dated, and would also force me to take care of her dog while she left for days on end (very sweet pup but untrained at the time, high maintenance and extremely dog-aggressive, so not the ideal scenario). She would lay on the guilt extremely thick or just cuss me out and scream at the top of her lungs until I caved. It's important to note that for years growing up and until recently when she didn't get her way from me she would scream at me non-stop, threaten to never speak to me again (when I was 16 she didn't speak to me for a year - I even had to take the bus because she wouldn't drive me home), call me terrible names, all that jazz. I have honestly regretted reconnecting with her at times, as life was truthfully easier when she hated me and paid me no mind. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe moved out because that wasn't working, but a lot of the same behavior continued. She calls me non-stop (presently even calls multiple times a day and during work), pushed me to go on trips with her or buy designer things for thousands of dollars when I was broke and would berate me for saying no, demand I go out with her or come over to her house whenever she wanted. She would regularly compete with my long-term SO (now husband) for time and try to make me feel bad for not wanting to hang out every time she did, for whatever reason. It's also a thing that she would never agree to do things she didn't want to do and will not hang out if I initiate but she doesn't feel like it or has plans. However she would always conveniently say \"I would never/always do **\\*insert terribly inconvenient thing she wants at the moment\\*** if you asked me to.\" And trying to fight that and present the truth doesn't work because she will yell over me, interrupt, clap her hands while she yells over me, whatever. So I never would actually get a word in. When I was away from her and would try to just ignore her, she would blow up my phone non-stop with calls and paragraphs of texts, would blow up my mom and tell her how horrible I am, and even blow up my husband's phone and demand he hand me the phone. I have even pretended to be out of town to avoid her in the past. She moved away to a neighboring state in February so things were a bit easier, but still the calling, the demanding time, and things were still factors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cut her off in July for three months and honestly, it was nice. I didn't have to deal with hearing from her and her demands. I got to do things as I wanted in peace without the FOG routine. My mom naturally forced an intervention around my sister's birthday in October (told me to come over and then my sister was there). I will admit, I did give it a chance as I kind of hoped things would change and the guilt of saying no to her face two days after her birthday was a factor too. Ironically, she ended up moving back to our town last weekend and I kind of feel things picking back up. What's worse is her boyfriend (another funny point is she doesn't make her boyfriend do anything. I suppose he won't let him control her that way and just doesn't take her seriously so she transfers that to me) and her are long-distance as he stayed in the other state, so I am kind of realizing I may be screwed. She has already been calling me every day 4-6 times a day at least, and her last call she said \"so we're hanging out this weekend and doing a,b,c,d,z activities.\" Gave me no option of course and I have already seen her two nights this week (under two hours each time but still). It all hit me like a ton of bricks that I am very close to sinking into my old habits. Not totally there yet, but I have tons of anxiety around this and see it unfolding really easily if this progresses. She keeps saying how sorry she is and how things will be different this time but I see the same tricks starting to unfold. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this sounds weak but please give me the \"if I were you\" advice. I just need to hear how to stop this in its tracks. I ideally don't want to nuke it all or explicitly tell her I'm cutting her out again, but just to be like her boyfriend almost (lol) and make it clear I am not even entertaining being treated like this again. If that can't happen, then I suppose I'll have to cut her off, but honestly if I cut her off I'll probably have to low-contact my mom too as she may set something up again to reconnect because \"we are sisters.\" More irony, my mom is no-contact with her sister because she's awful too.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr My sister has been terrible to me my whole life so I went NC for three months. Now we are reconnecting and I see old habits coming back. Can you offer me some advice or a course of action? Thanks in advance guys <3",

He's very thoughtful and caring which made the following situation all the more surprising to me. We've always disagreed a bit over covid-- me being more cautious. However I got covid in early 2021 then two shots Pfizer. He never got covid (we weren't living together so he wasn't exposed) and only got 1 shot J&J. I've always been concerned he would get it and we've been struggling with the dynamic of letting him look out for his own health, while I'm actually a scientist and pay more attention to health news/science so I get frustrated that he's not as informed. I've been bugging him for months to try to get a booster (where we live it isn't easy), and he tried somewhat but not as hard as I wished.\n\nFor the holidays we went home to visit his family in a country in Europe where covid is very prevalent. We had briefly discussed before that I would like to avoid indoor dining and people should take ATK tests before we met up, but once we arrived it was hard to follow that due to his friends and family wanting to go out.\n\nLo and behold he got covid, we stupidly didn't recognize the symptoms because we just had a negative PCR test the day before (2 days before our flight), we flew back home and now he's hospitalized as required by the country we live in and the rest of our vacation was cancelled (we had 2 weeks of traveling planned).\n\nIt was a wake up call for me because I realized I should have been more assertive about my needs, at the same time, I'm not sure he even would have listened to me and maybe would have just gone on the trip himself. I told him I wish he had gotten a booster earlier and that we hadn't done indoor dining. He says he wouldn't change anything because he got to see his family and friends (who he doesn't see often) and he doesn't feel guilty if anyone at the airport got sick, because they're also taking a risk by traveling and omicron isn't worse than the flu. He also says he followed all of the regulations set by the government and it's not like we were out partying. The only thing he feels bad about is that our vacation was cancelled.\n\nPersonally this was a big shock because he knows I have family working in healthcare where the hospitals are overwhelmed. I feel like he was prioritizing his own well-being instead of taking the larger societal well-being into account. Looking for an objective view on this... does he lack empathy, or is this a reasonable view to not feel badly? I know I was imposing my own values onto him, but how do we move forward with such differing views about our responsibilities to society? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Boyfriend got covid, we travelled, and he doesn't feel guilty if anyone got it because they were also taking risk, omicron doesn't make you too sick, and he followed all of the regulations. Is this reasonable or lacking empathy?",

This leaves me Monday and Wednesday to run errands, clean my room, deal with ebay orders ( its a side gig) and, do anything else \"chore\" like I have to do. \n\nThe problem arises because whenever Jen is home on break she expects me to stop in on nights and if I say no sorry im busy doing stuff she gets upset and try's to guilt trip me and if i ask her to just respect the fact im busy on the weekdays so we have free weekends she says \"im just expressing how I feel\". She gets upset if I try to run these errands on the weekend too. I cant tell how to solve this problem I cant keep dealing with these guilt trips, im have things I need to do I cant just sit around and watch movies ever night with her and snuggle as much as I want to which ive expressed so many times.\n\nTLDR: my gf keeps guilt tripping me for not ditching my responsibility's and coming over all the time",

        "content": "New account since my friends know my real one,\nI guess this was my first real relationship, so I'm just unsure if I did anything wrong or if this is just an inevitable part of dating. \n\nI'm 25f and he's 24, we'd been dating for about 3-4 months seeing each other about every other weekend (we lived about an hr away from each other and we're both students/residents in the medical field), so I felt like that had been enough time to ask if I was his gf (which I assumed yes because he'd been fine with me taking pics on a holiday outing to post on Instagram for the first time [lol, FBOfficial]).\n\nEssentially he said that I wasn't his gf because he was moving in about half a year for his next year of residency and LDR never work so he's not interested in even attempting one. \n\nI ended up asking for space a couple days later and when we did talk after a week it was pretty much just disagreement on why he didn't want to give the relationship a label and why he was even dating me if he was planning on breaking up in half a year due to changes in his residency program that started after we started dating.  It was pretty inconclusive and it seemed to boil down to he felt like he couldn't give me the more time a relationship needed/LDR concerns etc despite me saying that I understood we were both busy so it's not like I was expecting him to make an hour commute to see me during the work week and that he/it was enough for me. After that day it just turned into polite conversing and how are you/etc for about a week until he broke up with me the day after Christmas and said he needs me to not talk to him \"right now, maybe in the future\" because some things from our discussion were messing with his head.\n\nTldr: Did I push too hard in wanting a label on a relationship with an \"expiration date\", or is this just kind of to be expected once in a while while dating?",

        "content": "Hi \nSo I\u2019ve been dating my girlfriend for 6 months now and we started having sex 2 months ago. We have just had it like 4 times because each of us live with our parents as because we weren\u2019t able to move out due to the pandemic and are only able to do it when my parents are not home.\n\nSo the problem is that the sex isn\u2019t fulfilling at all (at least for me). I mean we were both virgins so I cannot say about having much experience but still I feel that it isn\u2019t good. It\u2019s because she never tries enthusiastically to make me cum and after a while her body gives out and she gets tired before either of us climaxing and I have to pleasure myself which ruins the whole point of having sex.\n\nThere are 2 things of concern here - \n1. She doesn\u2019t have a good lifestyle. Like she sleeps at like 3am and she doesn\u2019t watch what she eats at all. Like she has 2 meals a day and one of them is straight up junk food. She doesn\u2019t much drink water. Like if I don\u2019t remind her, she survives on like a couple of glasses per day. She doesn\u2019t like working out so she prefers to sit all day long. Then she has hypothyroidism, which should make her more health cautious anyway.\n\n2. She says that she has started discovering about her sexuality only last year when she turned 20. She still sometimes isn\u2019t completely mentally turned on during sex which is quite a bummer for her. \n\nI think both of these things are having a huge impact on our newly happening sex life.\n\nAs for me, she said that I have a great sex game. And contrary to her I take care of myself in every way possible from good sleeping routine to regular exercise and good nutrition.\n\nYesterday I kind of tried talking to her about it, how her health is really important and in order to have good sex, she needs to pay more attention to it. But she became sort of upset that I was mocking her, which I was not. I truly care for her and our relationship but I feel she needs to put in some efforts and thought into this. \n\nAlso her dad won\u2019t let her go to gym idk why so we can\u2019t do a couples gym session as well.\n\nHow should I convince her to start taking care of herself otherwise it would be really bad for our relationship?\n\nTL;DR girlfriend\u2019s wrong lifestyle is affecting our sex life and I want to convince her to do something about it.",

        "content": "Here is the thing. I have mental health issues. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar I - with paranoid delusions. Another psychiatrist diagnosed me with BPD. I also have anxiety. \n\nSo, I know there is a possibility for me to be overreacting. \n\nThe situation. This is just a small chunk of one of the arguments we have been having. \nBecause of previous fights, I decided that we needed to set some expectations/boundaries/etc. So I wrote these out: \n\nTolerances: \nEmotional - withholding information so that I won\u2019t get upset/ lying about something if I ask - just say you\u2019d rather not say or it\u2019s not my business. Being shouted at isn\u2019t helpful to me. \n\nPhysical: I will not stay if there is physical abuse. (Not saying you do that - this is just a expectation) \n\nSexual expression: \nAmount- If you don\u2019t want to have sex - help me masturbate? Or I will just go masturbate. \nIf all is happy and good. My expectations for sex are at least 3-4 times a week. \n\nBedroom needs - sometimes I will want rough sex \u2026 sometimes I need intimate sex. If we can kind of talk about that before sex or make four play that energy so I know what to expect when having sex. \n\nFinancial: \nSplit bills - doesn\u2019t have to be even always. If you are struggling or I am struggling we can talk about it.  Give or take. It just can\u2019t always be take. \n\nPast lives: \nChildhood - if you have questions about it ask. \nRelationships - I can handle talking about your past relationships. It hurts when I have to comfort you over pain of you missing your past lover. \n\nFamily: \nFamily is important to me.\nIf you have a family gathering or tradition don\u2019t assume that I can automatically do it. I have family to. We should talk about it before it\u2019s assumed I\u2019m going. \n(Not saying that you don\u2019t do this already. It\u2019s just an expectation) \n\nFriendships: \nIf you are around me and talking to your friends\u2026 please don\u2019t refer to them as \u201csexy\u201d in front of me. It makes me very uncomfortable. Especially if you don\u2019t refer to me as \u201csexy\u201d when you see me. \nIf your friend invites you someplace. Talk to me before you agree that we will both be there (even if I\u2019m off) - I also don\u2019t want to hear about an event that \u201cI\u2019m going to\u201d from someone else. I would like to hear it from you. \nIf a friend is coming over - ask if it\u2019s okay.  I ask you if it\u2019s okay. I want the same respect. \n\nGirls - if you are not comfortable with me hanging out with you and another girl. Rethink how you actually feel about that person. Because to me, if we can\u2019t hangout together then something is up.  I\u2019m not saying I will forever need to be there if y\u2019all hangout\u2026 I\u2019m just saying if you don\u2019t want me there \u2026 something is up. Also, if you leave out information - like a girl being there hanging out with a group of you \u2026 it\u2019s suspicious to me why you wouldn\u2019t divulge that information and just make me not trust you. \n\nGoals: \nUmm. Don\u2019t really have anything for this. \n\nAdditions: \nChildren - if I get pregnant (I\u2019m pro choice) but I don\u2019t think I would be able to terminate the pregnancy. \n\nPets - talk about it. See if we can afford it. See if the responsibilities are okay with both. (Sorry if I didn\u2019t really talk to you about leia that much) \n\nRelationships - open relationships, im not really against it. But at the same time I\u2019m jealous.  So\u2026 I don\u2019t want that at this time. \n\nSubtractions: \nBreaking up - I want all of my belongings. If we break up before this lease is up. We will need to set up roommate boundaries or talk about who will get the apartment. ( I do not want that to happen at all. ) \n\nSecond chances - cheating is a no go for me. If you cheat I will leave. Having any form of intercourse. If you emotionally cheat on me I want us to talk to a relationship therapist. \n\nTime: \nSmothered - if I need space I will leave and get out of the house or go to my room. I\u2019m not trying to hurt you. \n\nRecharge after work - ehhh. Idk. \n\nDigital communication - I don\u2019t really have anything to say about this. I know you don\u2019t reply sometimes. And I know when you are with someone or doing something you aren\u2019t looking at your phone. This really hasn\u2019t caused me any strife. \n\nDigital presence: \nI\u2019m not really sure how to explain myself. I will just say what I want - if you feel like I\u2019m taking it too far let me know. \nI want you to actually \u201cfollow me\u201d on Facebook. I know I can tell you about it irl\u2026 but it sucks to know that you have been constantly online and you don\u2019t like my posts. \nOne thing that hurt my feelings but I never brought up. You liked a girls post  (a person that we both know) she was in very suggestive / revealing stance. It made me really uncomfortable and it crossed a line. That happened after we were public about our relationship. If I saw someone\u2019s bf/gf/wife/husband do that\u2026 I would think really negatively about that persons relationship\u2026 I\u2019m assuming other people do the same thing. I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t know them irl. That\u2019s fine. But if it\u2019s someone we know\u2026 that reeks of infidelity. (To me personally) \n\nPast relationships - I don\u2019t tend to delete posts about past boyfriends. If that bothers you - let me know. \n\nPrivacy: \nJournals - don\u2019t ever read my journal, unless I let you read something. I will probably never forgive you for that. If you want to really know how I\u2019m feeling about something. Ask me. \n\nPhones - I won\u2019t snoop on your phone. Don\u2019t snoop on mine. Unless something is really bothering you. I will show you what you want to look at - in my presence. \n\nComputers - same as phone. \n\nConflict: \nArgument - even if there is an apology, I need a resolution. I need us to be aware of our actions of hurting each other and how we can fix it or stop doing that or something. \n\nOkay - so we had a talk about this. I explained to him that if he couldn\u2019t do these things then we should rethink our relationship. But he was like (this is a general idea of what he said) \u201cI can see how some of those things bother you\u2026 yes, I can work on these expectations\u201d \n\nNow the problem - tonight he asked why I\u2019ve been pulling away from him and not been lovey or affectionate the past few days. So, I explained that he still hasn\u2019t done some of the big expectations. 1. Sex 2. Social media him following me. \nI will say this is the first relationship I have been in where my SO has an online presence. I don\u2019t know what is proper etiquette for relationships. \n\nWell, this started a little bit of an overflow of things that have been bothering me. \n\n1.\tOn New Years Eve we went to the bar i work at. I was in pain because of my sciatica. I was under the impression it would be a quick visit. But people were there that we knew. One of those peoples is a girl he said he has/had a crush on. \u201cI don\u2019t like her like that\u201d anyway, I was getting some fresh air and when I came back to the patio he was engrossed in conversation with her. I tried to get his attention - and yes maybe I should have tried harder - but heat was going to my face. Because just an hour before we to the bar - we ate at a restaurant and we barely had any conversation.  Boo. I was angry that he was engrossed in conversation. So, I do the only logical thing I know to do, walk home. Ha. It took be 25-30 minutes to walk home. He didn\u2019t notice I was gone until 25 minutes later. But hey. Maybe I\u2019m overreacting. \n2.\tThat I\u2019ve noticed that when she is around he is constantly looking at her. \n3.\tI explained that Ive been giving him the same energy he gives me. Especially since New Years. So the past three or so days I have been distancing myself. It\u2019s been a few weeks since I we had the conversation about the expectations. And he isn\u2019t following the one major one. The social media. I feel stupid for even wanting that. But\u2026.\n\nLast month, I wrote a very heartfelt post about being adopted and what not. And I also posted a new headshot or whatever it\u2019s called. A day or two before I posted this, he said he was bored with fb and insta because it\u2019s all the same thing. \nOkay, so I have posted the heartfelt message and everyone is liking it. But because FB is stupid. Since I\u2019m in a relationship with this dude. It shows me first if he has liked a post. It also notifies me when he likes other peoples posts. Which is fucking weird but hey. So..19 hours later is dings that he has liked a post. And it\u2019s a post of a girl he used to fuck. Her post was 12 hours old or whatever. So\u2026 we got into an argument about that. But I was just trying to explain how it made me feel. He blew up. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the night he threw his phone and it went into the wall. \nSo\u2026 his explain is that he didn\u2019t see my post. And he also said if it doesn\u2019t have a pic and it\u2019s words that usually he goes past it and also that I need to tell him i stead of FB.  Boo.. so he gave multiple explanations for why he didn\u2019t like my post or read it. \n\nSo, I speak about my expectations\u2026 which he agreed to. Then tonight he says that he thinks that expectation is stupid and he doesn\u2019t want to do it. I\u2019m like I\u2019m not asking you to change who you are. I\u2019m not asking you to do something that you don\u2019t already do. I\u2019m just asking you to follow me. \u201cwe are friends on fb\u201d so what. Just fucking follow me. I even said the night I read my expectations that If he doesn\u2019t agree or like any of the expections or if I\u2019m asking to much that he can tell me. So he chose tonight (weeks after I give him my expectations) to tell me he doesn\u2019t agree with it. \n\nI feel like he is trying to test me to see if I will stand up for myself and break it off. See how week I am. Break me down. When we have these \u201carguments\u201d it\u2019s usually good a week or two after. Then he starts doing shit that we have talked about and we have the argument again.\n\nTonight I straight up said that he manipulating me or he is a sociopath. Am I being too needy? \n\nI feel like there is so much more he says and does and it\u2019s very manipulative. At one point he said I was trying to gaslight him. And so I looked up some of things to see if I was. And he ticked every freaking box. \n\nI\u2019m sure he has another view about what is going on. But this has just been what i see and hear and feel. But remember I do get paranoid delusions. \n\nTL;DR yeah, I wouldn\u2019t read it either. Very convoluted writing style. Tangental.",

I lived in country A, she lived in country B. We were doing things long distance until she got a job in country C, and we both decided to move there. To support each other but also finally live together. This was already a possibility before we got married, so I and my family did know it was coming up.\n\nSadly, with the way things have been going in the world I haven't been able to go back to country A and see my family for almost 2 years.\n\nI feel like I've matured in my marriage, and just wish that that mature version of me could've helped my family more when I was there. Sometimes I find myself wanting to just go back and help them. They are not doing badly by any means, but whenever they tell me of their hard days, I get really upset. I want to be there helping drive around our mom, stay up with them when they have to get some work done, and help around the house.\n\nI try and call every day when I get the chance. And I try and send them money when I can. Other than though, it sometimes feel like I've \"abandoned\" them. I don't really know how to bring this up with my family, or with my wife.\n\nMaybe it's feelings of homesickness combined with the nature of the health/travel situation in the world today; Im sure many others have this stranded feeling too. Perhaps my family also needs to learn to adapt, and I can't think I'm responsible over them forever. But I just really wish I could take some time away from where I am and just help them with whatever's going on with them.\n\nAny advice for my own mindset?

I always knew I wanted to have kids only after I was married, and now that we finally are I\u2019ve allowed myself to start thinking more in depth about it and I had an inconvenient realization. I could not bring a child into this situation without seeing change in his behavior.

He never had any real responsibility or bills before we met. He quit his teaching job to start a company and never learned how to manage money. A month after we met was the first time he had his own apartment and was \u201con his own\u201d. When we first got together we argued like cats and dogs about petty things (dishes, laundry etc.) He eventually understood that a clean house is important to me and has started to help out. When he realized that money management is important in a relationship he tried to do better. We just had a baby and it\u2019s the same thing all over again. I have to let him know that there are things I expect from him before he actually makes any effort. Sometimes I\u2019ll have to remind him but I\u2019m just tired of having to ask. I don\u2019t want to go through every \u201cmilestone\u201d of our relationship having to hold his hand. \nWe come from two very different backgrounds. His family are heavily involved in the church, his family has numerous preachers but they all babied him and still do. I was raised by an ex military meth head. I feel like his family set him up for failure by not expecting more from him and always letting him slide by. Even as an adult they coddle him. He\u2019s said he doesn\u2019t like it but I think that\u2019s all he\u2019s used to so of course he\u2019s not going to tell them to stop. \nI love him and the good outweighs the bad but sometimes I wish I wasn\u2019t with someone who needed help to just grow up. \n\ntl;dr fianc\u00e9 parents baby him and it\u2019s affecting our relationship",

But that\u2019s not the problem.\n\nThe problem is my family, even tho I love them:\n\n1. Whenever I go to my parents about my problems or tell them how I feel, they would give me, \u2018That\u2019s your problem.\u2019 or they just take it lightly. I\u2019ve been dealing with depression since the start of high school, and it hurts and lowers my self esteem to hear that.\n\n2. My older brother has been a bit too controlling and is a bit of a bully. He would mess around with me and when I tell him to stop, he won\u2019t until something else distracts him. \n\nHe gets upset whenever ignore him when he asks something and automatically thinks I\u2019m ignoring him on purpose. (Sometimes it\u2019s true, but so do that because I either didn\u2019t want to talk or answer something). Whenever my lil bro and I get into a fight, my older brother would take his side without hearing mine, (or he does, but takes his side anyway.)\n\n\n3. Most of the things are the same with the older brother expect taking sides and being controlling. However, he does not respect me or my boundaries.\nWhenever he talks or over explains things and I tell him to stop, he won\u2019t until my parents/older brother tell him to stop. He never knew the meaning of \u2018no\u2019 properly. He shows me thing I didn\u2019t want to see(some videos he thinks it\u2019s funny or some scenes in his game) and when I tell him no, he doesn\u2019t stop until I either yell at him and I get in trouble or I give in. He invades privacy and treats everyone, especially me, as the house maids, he doesn\u2019t do his chores.\n\nHe also fakes depression, no he doesn\u2019t cut himself or wear dark clothing for show, sometimes when he talks to me or show me something, I sometimes tell him \u2018Leave me alone.\u2019 Or ask \u2018Can\u2019t you just show your friends?\u2019 His excuse, \u2018I have no friends (Lie) people bully me (Somewhat true, they just don\u2019t hang out with him much) and because of those, I have depression.\u2019 \n\n(This pissed me off because he didn\u2019t have to work hard to get a therapist but it took me a while until my parents were too late and saw that I cut myself for the first time)\n\nI tried to tell him personally how I felt about his behavior, not once, but twice. And each time he ended up trying to run away to get me to have sympathy for him, I knew if I let him run away, my parents would blame me for letting him run away.\n\n\nI\u2019m at a lost here, no one will listen to me, (except my friends and boyfriend of 8 months, they help me pull through) and I lost hope in order to get them to listen to me. \n\n\n\n\n\ntldr: my family doesn\u2019t listen and I don\u2019t know what will make them listen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I do?

        "content": "Throwaway because he knows my Reddit account. Starting to think I (25F) am not compatible with a guy (25M) I\u2019ve been dating for 3 months. I don\u2019t have much dating experience at all and met a guy on tinder about 3 months ago. I\u2019ve never met somebody on a dating app but we have a ton of friends in common so I decided to give it a chance. Things have been great. He treats me well, is super nice, and all my friends like him. But I\u2019ve noticed some things I\u2019m not sure about.\n\n1.) He lives with his parents and is 100% dependent on them. Living with his parents is not a problem but they pay all his bills, do his laundry, cook for him, etc. If I ask him about doing something he usually responds with \u201clet me talk to my parents about it\u201d. He doesn\u2019t even have a credit card. \n\n2.) He\u2019s working 30 hours a week as a retail associate making $11 an hour. He does have a college degree. He was offered a position as a Lead but turned it down because it would be too much work. My parents own a business and needed a part time helper (8 hours a week) and he said no because he doesn\u2019t have enough down time as is. I\u2019m a hard worker and work 50-60 hours a week with a salary of $92,000. I\u2019m okay with being the breadwinner in a relationship but I think I would like somebody who is hard working at least. \n\n3.) He doesn\u2019t have good money saving habits. He spends over half his money on something he collects and doesn\u2019t seem concerned about saving it since his parents pay all his bills. I have $200,000 in savings with no college debt while he has about $5,000 in savings and $20,000 of college debt. I\u2019ve mentioned a couple vacations this year but he can\u2019t afford them. \n\n4.) He doesn\u2019t like children. I personally don\u2019t want children but I do love children and love spending time with my nieces. He met my nieces once and didn\u2019t say a single word to them.\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do here. Is this something I should talk to him about? He\u2019s young, maybe he\u2019d change? Or would these be dealbreakers? \n\nTLDR: dating a guy who is in a different stage of his life and not sure we are compatible anymore",

        "content": "This will be a long one so thank you to everyone who reads it and gives me some genuine advice for this conversation.\n\nTL/DR: I found out I had herpes several years back while in a relationship. I found this out after having sex without a condom hundreds/thousands of times without medicine and didn't pass it, but I am now on medicine and I know my chances of passing this are virtually zero. I met someone I can see myself with long term and I want to tell her before we get to the point where we are bf/gf.\n\nI know in making this post I'm probably going to get some hate, but I'll try to explain the situation as best as I can and hopefully can avoid a comment section of entirely negative judgment.\n\nI'm a man in my mid-late 20s, and I found out that I had herpes a few years back when I was in a long term relationship. Basically, I was dating a girl for several years and we lived together when this came to light. I can skip the specifics but in short I went in for a normal physical and was asked if I wanted to do a full panel STD test, did it and found out that way. I took a second test to confirm and was at a complete loss as I had never had any symptoms or any idea of how I had gotten it.\n\nMy ex and I at the time had never worn a condoms, and on average had sex twice a day for \\~4 years. I never cheated on her so I knew that I must've had it for awhile/before our relationship. She got tested twice and DIDN'T have it. I decided to go on daily medicine that drastically reduces the chance of spreading it and have been taking it since I found out. We continued to have sex without condoms as we planned on getting married and it was never an issue. Her and I broke up for unrelated reasons years later and she got tested afterwards and still didn't have it.\n\nThis is where I'm going to get the hate, but I hope I can explain my position as this is how I will explain the position to the girl I am currently dating. I have been out of a relationship from my ex for about a year and have had a few FWB situations and have not told them. We've had sex between the two main ones hundreds of times in this past year and they have been tested during/after without getting it. My last situation was with a girl who was basically a nympho and we would hook up A LOT (sometimes 4 times a day). She wanted more out of our situation and I didn't, so we broke things off. She also let me know that she gets tested between partners and was negative across the board.\n\nSo that was a lot, but now to my current situation. I met a girl that I really really really like about a month ago. While it is fresh, I know what I want and I can see myself being with this girl for the long term. I know that she has the same feelings and is infatuated with me as well. We've been having amazing sex without a condom but I know that if this is going to be something long term then I need to disclose this to her but I have terrible terrible anxiety about this situation.\n\nShe will be the second person who I've ever told about this. I can imagine how disrespected she will feel with me not disclosing this to her but from my perspective, I have had sex hundreds of times without a condom while I had it while taking no medicine and haven't passed it. I have been taking medicine which takes the chance of me passing it to her literally zero and I'm fully aware of this and would never put her in a position where I can knowingly pass this to her. I am extremely healthy outside of this and I'm already having feelings of love for this girl and I just don't know how to navigate this. I don't know that I should explain to her that I have had sex thousands of times over the years without passing it without a condom, and that I have been taking medicine every single day to protect the people that I'm hooking up with.\n\nI know that I took away her ability to make an informed decision before we had sex, but I also wanted her to know that it isn't something that I can pass on to her.\n\nAnyway, I think I need to get this all out on the table and hope that she'll let me explain. I know what I did was selfish, but I know I didn't put her in harms way.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me?\n\nOutside of this one little thing, we are perfect for each other. We're both attractive, have similar fun personalities, make good money, have dogs, have great goals, truly enjoy each other's companies, etc.\n\nPlease give me some words of encouragement and don't rip my heart out, I've already done that to myself.\n\nEdit: I understand that I should've told her and others, truly. But I also know that it can't be passed and her and I can go years without this being brought up and it would be no risk to her. I just want to be honest with her.",

We did fight a lot because I had to constantly beg him to call me text me or just go on dates with me otherwise he wouldn\u2019t text me for days or do anything with me at all. We started dating in January 2021 and well I thought things were going great. He was the first to say I love you and was my fist time etc. Things were relatively normal until a few months in which i probably should have broken up with him then as there were so many red flags. I paid for a majority of our dates he paid for some and he technically was supposed to pay for his tickets to Disney (we went on a trip together for my birthday) and still owes me $500 since I paid for everything though he said he would pay ,e back but never did. He constantly told me I was berating him for asking to well act like a normal boyfriend would for example show that you care etc. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask for someone to call you and text you especially when you claim to love and care for that person. He had a lot of problems he was going through and well I became the punching bag for it . Every time we fought we would make up and things were normal until they were not.\n\nStory: Our 1 year anniversary was coming up and 3 weeks in advance I asked him what we were doing and if that we could both take off of work to spend time together. He got upset with me about it he said he would be losing money and then he said he valued money more than our anniversary and more than me. He hung up after that and blocked me. I tried reaching out to makeup with him and that\u2019s how I found out he blocked me. That same day I found out my grandma passed away and was trying to tell him that and I wanted to talk to him asking him to forget about what I said about taking off of work. By then I realized I didn\u2019t deserve to be treated the way he treated me ( I have left out many things on how crappy I was treated) and he said word for word I\u2019m moving on so should you. So now I mourning my grandma and a breakup but I keeping wondering if I was asking for too much and was I really a bad partner. Any input helps.\nTL;DR - I should have left the relationship sooner",

        "content": "Okay I sound dumb right now but I just need to get shit off my chest. I'm 16(M) in high school and I'm a junior. I know dating in high school doesn't really go anywhere but I'm lost at his point. Around the start of school I started dating a senior she is 17. I talked to her a few times before but, never really found interest in her till recently. I talked to her for a few weeks before I asked her to go out with me. She said yes of course . She was the nicest most genuine person I have ever met in high school. She made me laugh all the good shit like a relationship should be. Around November her mother passes away she wasn't really connected with her mom. Her mom left her at a young age because of drug abuse. Now I know she didn't have much of a relationship with her but, I didn't expect it to go downhill so fast for so long. She lives in a toxic household with her dad who I'd say isn't parent material. Now when we started dating I made her happy and safe around me she was getting out of bad path she was on but then her mom passed. Now being a good partner I stuck with her and I still am (maybe not in a few hours though)\u2026 we have been dating for 5 months. She's described to me as being numb that she can't feel anything I kind of understand but I don't. I love this girl with everything in me she's my first good relationship but , when someone says they can't feel anything hurts. Reason is because you try so hard to make them happy and have be there for them. I tried for months to help her cope. I've had family members pass away myself but even I was super connected to them and I still was able to do things. The hardest part for me is how she pushes me away and just shuts me out when I try to help her. It hurts me knowing that she is hurting but I can't help I just have to sit and watch her hurt. I worry for her that she is going to make the wrong choices and go down a road that she shouldn't be going down. I know I'm just a young man with so much ahead of me but I worry for people way more than I should. I worry for everyone around me. She says she loves me but at some points I just don't believe it sometimes. I feel like I'm being told a lie that I should be able to see through but I can't. I've always wanted to help people in their lives its my passion I enjoy making people happy. I want that to be my career for when I leave my house. I wanna be able to lift people up into my arms. I love making others smile its so lovely but I just can't seem to do it for her. I feel like I'm chasing a dream at this point. Like she's just a shell of a person that I loved but she refuses to ever let me see that person again. I just some words that will help calm me or help me because I can't wrap my head around anything right now. Thank you for listening I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR I'm lost in my relationship and I don't know what to do or how to fix the issue. I just need some words of advice or something to help clear my head.",

        "content": "For context: Me (21F) and him (22M) are in the same extremely selective and small college science program, dating is pretty controversial because we're essentially all coworkers. But we kind of connected the week that we met and ended up hooking up. We agreed that we weren't going to date, but it has essentially turned into that at this point. We're \"friends with benefits\" but we go on dates and I live in his apartment half the time.\n\nI ignored a pretty major red flag early on. It was only a couple weeks into the semester, I was with a friend and we were drinking, I only had one shot, but I'd been working all day and hadn't eaten all day, plus I'm a major lightweight, I ended up getting pretty drunk off it, which was a huge mistake on my part because our science program was hanging later right after. He ends up pulling me away from the group telling me I was embarrassing him. We end up at his apartment and he does not want me there, he says I need to leave, but I feel awful so he reluctantly let's me sleep in his bed. He ignores me the entire time, I'm apologizing and getting pretty emotional, but he is clearly furious. When he turns in for the night, I'm still incoherent and sad, he gets into the bed beside me and tries to have sex with me, he like kisses me and tries to make out and touch me. I tell him I don't want it, but he continues until I start physically fighting him. The next morning he apologizes and I forgive him.\n\nHe does this one more time when the two of us are high. But I let that one go because he was also intoxicated.\n\nRecently (at this point I sleep at his) we were going to the movie theater together, and he invites his ex gf. I know they're still friends, I don't mind him being friends with her, but he still spends the night at hers sometimes and hangs out with her a lot, plus she doesn't know about us. I've brought it up with him before and he says there's nothing between them and they don't even talk much anymore. When I show up, she is clinging to him like they're still dating. We go to dinner the three of us, and she suggests getting high. He wants to, and I didn't want to tripsit, so I agree. We end up back at his apartment, but his ex lives pretty far, I bring it up to him that she can't drive, but I make it very clear that I would be upset if he made me leave. He convinces her to stay the night, then looks at me and says that the two of them will walk me back to my apartment. I'm furious and I storm out, he doesn't follow me or text me, I walk aback to my place high, and they sleep in his bed together.\n\nThe next morning he comes over and apologizes. He tells me he will never see her again. I tell him that I don't need that from him, I know that they're friends but he needs to set boundaries with her. He says: no I promise I won't see her or talk to her again.\n\nThat night he doesn't show up for our date, I wait for two hours, so I text him, obviously angry. He comes to my apartment furious, he tells me I can't expect him to remember everything and that I shouldn't be angry because it makes him upset and guilty and when he's upset and guilty he thinks about his abusive parents. I tell him that we were supposed to meet two hours ago and I've been waiting. He shoves me (lightly enough that I don't bruise, but hard enough that I stumble back a little),  and grabs my arm and starts dragging me towards the door, yelling at me.\n\nI visit my family for the holidays, I distance myself slightly from him, I'm busy and a bit disillusioned, but I love him and care about him and I want him to be happy. When I come back I give him a Christmas present I bought and one that I made, which I worked on for weeks. I was kind of disappointed with how it turned out and I say that, but he says its very good.\n\nI run into his ex 10 hours later in the class that we share. She tells me he showed her the gift and it's great. So I know that he lied to me and that he's been seeing her.\n\nWhen we're working in the lab, I'm slightly upset that he lied, but I figure it could be nothing so I don't mention it and I talk with him as usual. My phone is dead, so I ask to see the time, he opens his phone and I see a bunch of text messages from her.\n\nThe next day I'm walking to that class I share with his ex and I see the two of them walking together to that class. He sees me and like nods but then ignores me. Doesn't wait for me to catch up or anything.\n\nI'm mad and I text him all this, that he lied and broke his promise. He says that I clearly don't care about him but she does. He apologizes but I'm fully done at this point. I want to end it. I give him one last chance. I say an apology isn't enough, he has to set boundaries with her. He says nothing he does will ever be enough for me, and says he won't change.\n\nWe have most of the same friends, and they like him way more than they like me because he's super charismatic. They don't know any of this, I feel left out already and lonely (He says I'm lonely because I'm unlikeable and mean and not friend material). He's actually pretty well known in the community, he's an up and coming scientist. I feel uncomfortable being in this university. I'm not traumatized, but I'm nervous I suppose, about being around him again. He makes me feel terribly uncomfortable and a bit unsafe. I'm ending it tonight, but I want to tell my friends I just don't think they'll believe me over him, and I also don't want to ruin his life. I'm thinking about dropping out and moving back home, I'm having a hard time handling this, and I don't know what I should do.\n\n(I know this looks like a bot account. He found my private anonymous reddit account so I had to delete it and make a new one.)\n\ntldr my partner I'm going to break up with tonight is a close coworker at our university. He's been slightly physically aggressive (not enough to bruise) and lying to me. I'm not scared, but I don't feel safe being around him. We have the same friends and I think they won't believe me. I'm thinking about dropping out of school and moving back home. What should I do?",

She spent a LOT of time, energy and money on her education (went in to six-figure debt) and it's now paying off in a well-deserved way.\n\nMoney has been a contentious thing. between us at times. I wasn't the greatest partner at the beginning of our relationship. At one point, she loaned me some money (not a small sum) with no questions asked. I was also staying with her in the city so I could work a job while living with my parents in the suburbs. She later found out that I was in contact with/had some residual baggage with an ex and gave me an ultimatum about the relationship continuing.\n\nShe was FURIOUS about the fact that I had asked to borrow money while maintaining emotional ties with an ex. By this time I had started to fall in love with her and really wanted things to work out, so I worked really hard to amend what had hurt her badly. Over 5 years our relationship really grew and blossomed.\n\nI am now earning what is considered a good salary, so based on that you can only imagine what she's making. Until last month we were about equal in earnings, so splitting everything 50/50. However, she has indicated that our finances are going to continue as they are for 5 years, until she pays off her student loans. And then she would re-evaluate at that point. She also admits that she's carrying some resentment from feeling like I was using her for money at the beginning of the relationship.\n\nIf we are going to be married and considering how much more money she makes, I think it would be more fair if she at least took on more a little more responsibility in terms of the joint expenses. She feels like she has done a lot for my financially earlier in the relationship, and she deserves to pay off her student loans/make independent investments before merging finances.\n\nI don't think it's fair and feel like past resentment is clouding her judgment, and can't help but feel that she doesn't trust me. Any advice as to how to proceed with negotiating this would be appreciated.\n\ntldr; fiance makes way more than me, wants to keep finances separate for awhile, I think it's because of trust issues/not warranted and need to figure out how to resolve",

        "content": " \n\nWe have been texting for over a year and a half, I have never loved someone as much as I loved her, I could possibly say that she is the first true love of my life, the previous ones lasted a very short time, my love for her is purely personality based, our relationship didn't turn sexual at any stage.\n\nShe shares the same feelings as I do, the only reason she is still married to her husband is because of the children, and the fact that divorce is very frowned upon in her family, she married him quite young, early 20s, and did that for mainly pragmatic reasons, her father was controlling and didn't allow her much freedom, her husband is really a good man ( part of the reason why I didn't try to sexualize my relationship with her), he cares for his family, he loves her, never cheated on her, never beaten her, but she remains very unhappy with him, and it is having a very negative effect on her mental health, it should be said though that he was 12 years older when he married her, I guess there was a mental/cultural gap between them, add that to the fact that she didn't marry him for love and you get somewhat a clearer picture.\n\nShe told me that she thought about divorce for the past 10 years, but her thoughts didn't ever materialize.\n\nIn the past few days we have talked about what we are going to do going forward, and it really feels that I have a very limited options, none of them is satisfactory for me.\n\n1-do the impossible, somehow she gets her divorce and we get together, but she is going to have lots of problems with her family, her kids will suffer, and my family too wouldn't approve a bit of such relationship, we are going to lose really alot if we ever tried to go that direction.\n\n2-I date someone else while remaining in touch with her, but I just can't cheat on my GF, I don't feel a relationship is genuine if it involved lying.\n\n3-stay single on the surface and continue my relationship with her, but honestly it is so hard to continue living like this, I also want to live a normal life, I want to marry someone someday and settle.\n\n4-Leave her, now that is the hardest choice for me, and honestly I don't think I could ever do it.\n\nI feel like I'm trapped in a really terrible situation and I've no idea what to do, she told me that she will be ok with what ever decision I may take, that she will suffer in silence but she also understands that I also have to live my life normally.\n\nHonestly I don't care about the age gap, and I would be the happiest if we somehow got together, but as I said, such option is troublesome for both of us, it also happens that we live in a very conservative place.  \n\n\nTL;DR ( In love with a married woman, the situation isn't ideal for either of us, and we are trying to figure out what we are going to do going forward)\n\nAny suggestions?",

        "content": "Me (23M) and ex (23F) had dated for 4.5 years straight. We had dated in high school as well. I'm torn cause I still love her to death, and have no idea if she feels the same. We broke up after she went to her parents house early one weekend morning when we finally had a day to spend with each other. I confronted her about why she went to her parents house and one thing lead to another about our differences. She doesn't want to waste life sleeping until 9 on a Saturday, and that's my favorite times in our relationship, taking the day slow and enjoying each other. We have kept up communication (partially because of our dog I have) and I've tried to move on but I can't. I've tried to refrain from texting her as I know I relied on her for my happiness too much.\n\nI've gone on 5 trips in the last 2.5 months since we've broken up to try and get my mind off of her; Spoiler alert, I can't. Trips were 20x better with her, and today was the final straw of pretending I can forget about her. We were on our way back from a long day of a snow mobile adventure and I couldn't stop thinking about her head resting on my shoulder after a long day. That was my favorite thing in the world, it gave me so much comfort.\n\nI keep my house in the cleanest state it's ever been in constantly, so when I get the \"can I come grab our dog\" text, she is impressed with how well I've kept up. I lost a few pounds, Never was fat but always could shave off 10-15 pounds. Stopped smoking weed every night, and switched to CBD when I do so I'm more calm than loopy. I had quite a few issues with my family, I started to go to a therapist toward the end of our relationship, and it's gotten way better since she left. I was extremely anxious all the time, especially around my family which didn't help. Never knew what anxiety meant until I went to my first session.\n\nWhere am I going with this? IDK. I want to text/call her right now and work everything out. I would wake up at 4 am every Saturday if it meant she was still with me. When we broke up, she later said she wanted to call it a break. Although she did move all of her stuff out after living together for 3 years.\n\nSorry I sound like a 16 year old but these last 3 months have really tested me. I want to shoot my shot as soon as I get the chance but I'm afraid if I try and come back too early, I'll ruin it. But maybe that's what needs to happen. At the same time, if I wait, I'm just going to keep thinking about her until I know an answer. And who knows if that answer would change in 6 months. Thanks for listening\n\ntl;dr Long time lover and I broke up over seemingly small issue. Few months have passed and I can't forget about her. Should I open up to her soon or wait?",

        "content": "How did this happen\u2026\n\nI (F17) have no clue where to proceed. \n\nTo be clear, the person in question is not an ex boyfriend, nor a current boyfriend. \n\nIt started when we were both 12. I ended up falling for him, now (17), but he didn\u2019t end up feeling the same way about me. I\u2019m not sure if he knows that I still feel so strongly about him, as it\u2019s been 3 years since I told him. He is already in a relationship with another girl (17), and has been for 3 years now. When I told him about my feelings, I wasn\u2019t sure if he was with anyone, but he did the right thing and was completely, entirely honest with me about everything, as he was supposed to. \n\nEven then, I find myself completely unable to move on. \n\nIf it were an option, I\u2019d try to separate myself from him, but now, we\u2019re both seniors in our percussion section of 5, and rhythm section of 3 in jazz band. I plan to go into music education, so quitting band is absolutely not an option. \n\nHe and I get along fairly well, although, I get very nervous around him, and I have a hard time actually talking to him because of this. \n\nTo be clear - we don\u2019t talk much, and usually I won\u2019t talk to him first; However, I will if he starts the conversation. I do this as much as possible out of respect for the fact that he\u2019s already in a relationship.\n\nI don\u2019t want to say anything about any of this to him because he\u2019s already with another girl, and I don\u2019t want anything to happen to their relationship because of something I do or say.\n\nTo be clear - there\u2019s no bad blood between us, I just don\u2019t want to do anything that would 1) make things awkward/ more awkward for him, or 2) cause harm to his relationship.\n\n If anything, I\u2019m trying to find a way to get over him.\n\nTLDR; I\u2019ve liked this guy for a really long time, he did the right thing and was honest about the way he felt - and told me that he was already with another girl - it\u2019s been three years since I said anything about liking him now - even then, I still can\u2019t seem to get over him - I\u2019d separate myself from him if I could, but I can\u2019t, as we\u2019re both seniors in a percussion section of 5 and a rhythm section of three.",

        "title": "I fight with my friend multiple times a week",
        "content": "I (37m) fight with my friend (50f) multiple times a week. How often do you fight with yours? \n\nThese are some of the reasons we fought THIS year: \n\nNew Years Day:\n\u2022 I was going to eat the rest of her fries at dinner, but then she coughed all over them. She got horribly offended because I wouldn\u2019t eat them after.\n\u2022 I wouldn\u2019t give her a space heater I was throwing away that is a fire hazard. She is paranoid about fires and it\u2019s not safe. On top of that, it has my flesh stuck on it from when I seized. She was almost in tears she was so offended. \n\u2022 fought with her for an hour about something after she guilt tripped me, then said \u201cI was just trying to be nice\u201d. I told her she\u2019s gaslighting. She said I\u2019m crazy. Another half hour, she says \u201cI took it the wrong way, I just meant it was a bad idea\u201d\n\nThis week:\n\u2022 she has rolled her eyes, scoffed & made me feel small when I said I had to \u201cwork\u201d in the past. I am a reseller as a side hustle, so I work from home and my schedule is super flexible. Her reaction and statements have hurt me. I called her out on it and she refused to admit she has said it and telling me I had taken it the wrong way. This was an hour argument.\n\u2022 I told her I wasn\u2019t in the mood for a convo, I am sick (flu) and just want to scroll aimlessly. She got angry, fought me with, guilt tripped me (\u201cI bet you just don\u2019t want to talk to me, \u201cI just wanted to ask how your day was\u201d). Note: we had already exchanged 50 or so texts. She got mad that I didn\u2019t text her enough that day. She said she didn\u2019t guilt trip me, I took it the wrong way. \n\u2022 after reading an article she got upset that, she wants to be one of those friends who the author describes as someone I\u2019ll text back day and night. I\u2019ve told her before that she expects me to be at her beck and call 24/7 and she has denied this and I can\u2019t. She says her feelings are valid and I should respect them. \n\u2022 I wasn\u2019t texting enough. \n\u2022 We kinda have plans, I told her I don\u2019t want to commit because I am sick and I don\u2019t want her to get mad if I can\u2019t go because she has done that multiple times before. She said she never did that and that I took it the wrong way. Why would I make that up?\n\u2022 she sent me a text asking me what my plan for something was, but I was walking home and my phone was in my pocket because it was freezing. When I got home I had two other texts, \u201csorry I\u2019m asking too many questions\u201d \u201cI guess if you wanted to tell me yours plans you would have\u201d. I told her those are guilt trips. She denied, saying i took the wrong way. I said again, she wants me to be at her beck and call and if I\u2019m not, she will send guilt trippy and manipulative texts. This is a pattern of behaviour. If we are talking, if I don\u2019t tell her I am going to shower or going to the store I\u2019ll come back with a serious of texts trying to guilt me. She has me I need to just say \u201cbusy\u201d. I told\nHer I\u2019m an adult, I don\u2019t need to tell someone my every move.\n\nThat is it this year, I think. She will say I do the same things to her and when I ask for examples she can\u2019t offer any that isn\u2019t her taking something the wrong way or being over sensitive (like how I didn\u2019t text her good morning when I went out with someone else for breakfast or I didn\u2019t offer her a chicken nugget or how I wanted to walk to the place we were meeting instead of getting a ride from her). \n\nShe has threatened to ruin aspects of my life if I stop talking to her. \n\nI\u2019ve said all this shit is toxic, that she loves to fight... she denies this, asking why she would like to fight? I said I don\u2019t know, maybe you get some kind of high from making up because I don\u2019t fight with anyone else in my life and haven\u2019t fought with anyone in 7 years (ex BF) and can\u2019t even remember a time before that. The fact that I don\u2019t fight with anyone else in my life, but fight with you multiple times a week should in itself say something. When I say I\u2019m gonna ask someone else what they thing of an argument she says, why does someone else\u2019s opinion matter? I\u2019m like because they can see both sides. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I let myself get sucked into these hour long arguements. Maybe it\u2019s all the gaslighting, manipulation and guilt trips, hoping she will she what is really going on. Constantly being made to feel like your wrong. I want to safely distance myself, not ghost. I\u2019m afraid to have parts of my life ruined. I\u2019m too old for this shit, its terrible for my mental health. I honestly feel abused mentally. \n\nTL;DR: I fight with my friend for the stupidest reasons (like not offering her a chicken nugget) multiple times a week. She has threatened to ruin aspects of my life if I stopped talking to them, which has scared me. How do I safely distance myself? I don\u2019t want to ghost.",

        "content": "I have had feelings for Josh (name changed) since I was a junior in high school (16 years old). I didn't tell him because there was never a right time. He was dating someone at the time who he later married and I had a baby the month after our graduation. \n\nAfter we graduated we stayed in touch for the most part but we didn't really spend much time together. I went straight into college to get my nursing degree (I graduate this May!) and he was building a future with a woman he thought he would spend his life with. \n\nThey got divorced after two years because she cheated on him. We started talking again afterwards. He was in a really dark place and I was doing everything I could to help him climb back out. He took all of it really hard and almost didn't make it out the other side of it.\n\nMonths later he started dating a girl who wasn't good for him at all. His mental health started getting bad again. I didn't intervene as it isn't my place to tell him what to do in a relationship. I gave unbiased advice when asked for it and did the best I could to help him with the relationships he tried to pursue.\n\nThe two of them briefly broke up and while I thought they were still broken up, I told him that I had feelings for him and that they had been there for a while. He admitted he felt the same way but he had just gotten back together with his girlfriend a month before. He told me he needed time to figure things out and we lost touch for a little while again. He was busy figuring what he needed to work through and I was busy taking care of my son, school, and working. I didn't have much time to think about the conversation we had with everything I had going on in my life.\n\nHe recently contacted me and told me he has broken it off with her again, for good this time. We've been facetiming nonstop, set a date to spend time together when he gets home from work. I want to tell him how I feel again. It's been almost two years since we've had this talk. I know my feelings haven't changed for him, I don't think that his have for me either but I don't really know how to be sure without actually talking to him. I just don't know how to bring it up a second time. It took me 5 years to tell him I had feelings for him the first time. Now here we are, two years later and I'm just nervous. I'm afraid that his feelings might've changed. \n\nHe's a wonderful guy. I feel so light when we talk. He makes me feel heard, he's dedicated, smart, he has a wonderful future ahead of him, he loves my son, he's always been here for me when I've needed him. He really does make me happy. I just don't know if I am just supposed to accept that friends is all we are ever going to be or if there is a possibility of anything more.\n\nTL;DR - My friend of ten years has reached out and asked to spend time together when he gets back. I think I'm going to confess my feelings for him but I don't know if it will be a mistake or not.",

We moved my parents from NY to FL, and my dad passed away shortly afterwards. My sister never got vaccinated because things blew up in terms of my dad getting sick and passing away and us moving them down to FL. I asked her to get vaccinated since my mom now lives with her (70yo, dementia, got both vaccines but no booster), and since I come up every other weekend to help my sister with my mom. I am an attending OBGYN and I also have asthma. My asthma is pretty mild. My sister essentially said she is not ready and then told me to go listen to the Joe Rogan/Dr. Malone youtube whatever post. I essentially told her that I would not be coming to help her until she gets vaccinated.\n\n\n Unfortunately while I totally believe in what I am doing, I also know my sister is really over her head with caring for my mom, alone. It is me and her in this country so we don't have any help. We do have a home attendant during the day (who comes by, while my sister works from home as well) but given my moms state my sister needs breaks and this is where I come in. TBH I feel like I am abandoning my sister because she is taking this stance, but I also do not want to get COVID nor would I forgive my sister if I got it from her. My sister maintains she does not go anywhere, but the reality is is that she does go to the store, get cigarettes (heavy smoker as well) and doesn't bother masking. \n\nI am just wondering what peoples thoughts are\n\nTLDR: refusing to help my sister with my mom until she gets covid vaccine",

        "content": "This will be a long one, thanks for reading. First love situation. We lived together our first two years of college. We separated amicably when she suddenly decided to move out of state to transfer schools. However, she left me in a pretty low spot.\n\nLast contact with her was August 2019. I texted her to check in after a natural disaster near her home. I had to text twice to get a response, after which she simply \u201cliked\u201d the message. I got the hint and went totally no-contact.\n\nSince then, I've lost a lot of weight and got into the best shape of my life. Just recently I graduated college and accepted a job offer in Europe. The day after my graduation, my mom made an Instagram post with my grad pics that mentioned my new job. Not even two hours later I get an enthusiastic congratulations text from my ex.\n\nI was shocked to hear from her. Two years of silence on birthdays, holidays, a pandemic - and now she decides to reach out when she sees that I\u2019m succeeding? I was convinced we\u2019d never speak again.\n\nI reply a while later and keep it short. \"Thanks, hope everything's well on your end.\" She sends back a paragraph telling me that she transferred into a very prestigious college and is doing great. She also reminisced about plans we made when we were younger and mentioned that she has since visited the country I\u2019ll be moving to. It seemed like she wanted to get a back-and-forth going. I didn\u2019t engage. I \u201cliked\u201d her message and left it at that.\n\nAll of this left me feeling quite confused. I had thought I was over her completely. Now she\u2019s reopened communication and dredged up old feelings. Everyone I\u2019ve shown the messages to says she\u2019s either testing the waters to see if I'm still wrapped around her finger, or she feels insecure and is trying to flex that she's succeeding too. She\u2019s a pretty competitive person, so I could see that. They've also said that if I was still fat and moving to Iowa instead of Europe, I wouldn't have heard from her.\n\nWhat\u2019s most confusing is that I\u2019ve found myself hoping her intentions are pure and that she wants to rekindle things. I know that makes zero sense as we split due to distance and moving overseas certainly won\u2019t improve that situation. The relationship overall was very healthy and supportive. I still have love for her and nobody I've been with since has made me feel the same. Of course, I may also be vastly overthinking this and she\u2019s just being nice.\n\nWhat do you suspect was her motive for messaging me after all this time? Is it worth staying in touch or should I leave it be and save my pride?\n\nTL;DR: After 2 years of silence, long distance ex gf texted me congrats after she found out I'm moving overseas for work. Confused about her motives.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all for your insight. I've decided to leave it in the past and see what the next chapter brings.",

        "content": "So to begin, I [19m] hosted a New Years Party with a small group of friends for New Years. The two friends that are relevant to this story are both [19F].\n\nThe first girl, A, I've had a crush on for a few months now. We've been good friends for years and so I decided to invite her over for my party. The day of, she asked if she could bring her friend (B) who I kind of knew but we had never hung out outside of school. I said sure, as I figured we had enough room for another person and that way A wasn't the only girl. \n\nWell, by about 9 pm, I was hammered. I had had probably three or four drinks and a few shots. I was told about this part the next day by A, who told me that I was being very pushy, and she told me that she felt like I had just invited her to make out with her. I don't remember any of it at all, and I feel horrible that I did that to her. I'm not trying to justify my actions because I was drunk. I was starting to suspect that I have a drinking problem, but her coming forward and telling me solidified that suspicion. \n\nAnd for the second situation with B (which I would assume is the situation I've had a couple of people ask me about what happened between me and B). We didn't have enough beds/room for everyone, so me, my friend C [19m], and B all shared my futon (we were all very very drunk and this was the simplest solution.) It was me on the very edge, C in the middle and B on the far side against the wall. Well in the morning, C went upstairs and must have fallen back asleep up there. I vaguely remember sliding over so my ass wasn't off of the futon and I went back to sleep, now with just B and I. Well at one point B started resting her head on my chest, then suddenly bolted upright in bed, which woke me up. (I think she confused me for C.) She said something about \"Oh I thought you were C\" and just stayed sitting up against the wall. \n\nI think that I've ruined any kind of friendship I would have with either girl, and I even had someone who I hadn't talked to since middle school DM me and say \"What happened between you and B?\" and now I don't know what to do. First and foremost I've cut myself off from drinking until I learn to control myself, but I'm worried that A or B might try to retaliate against me. The selfish part of me wants to just pretend as though nothing happened and move on, but I feel like I need to at least apologize to both people and just be truthful to anyone who feels like texting me about it. \n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Got too hammered at my own party and aggressively hit on one girl and sleep cuddled with another. Should I apologize and try to repair friendships or just not talk to them and move on?",

        "content": "Sorry if this post is very long \ud83d\ude41\n\nFor a bit of context, I am 25F and my partner is 26M. We both live alone but most of the week (4-5 days) I stay at his place. He earns more than double than what I earn - he\u2019s a regional manager at his company, while I\u2019m doing admin work as well having a couple odd jobs on the side. \n\nWe both started out as dating since mid last year. However, a couple things have made me question if our love languages are compatible. \n\nI am a very generous person and love to spoil my family, friends and significant other every now and again. With most of my friends and past partners, we always had a healthy balance of treating one another to something special and vice versa, and never making a fuss over I.O.Us. For example, one of my closest friend would occasionally fork out a hotel room for us to have a girl\u2019s night/slumber party, and I\u2019ll reciprocate by getting us a really lovely dinner as well as nice wine, snacks and small gifts for her. I had another friend who would keep tabs on everything I owed her to the nearest cent, and would make a fuss when it came to splitting bills. (I\u2019m not friends with her anymore, for unrelated reasons). \n\nAnyways, with my current partner, even though he does very well for himself, I find it embarrassing that he occasionally comments how everything is so expensive. Okay, I get it, the city we live in is not cheap at all. Groceries, entertainment, property, bills. But I certainly don\u2019t go complaining all the time, especially not to my friends or S.O. I prefer to keep it to myself and instead look for a better deal. \n\nIt always feels as though my partner never does anything special for me, like my past partners have, and he\u2019s not generous either. He never really surprises me with small gestures or take the initiative to treat me for dinner, save for a couple times and we had only ever eaten in. A couple weeks ago, I suggested that we go out on a proper date for once, which we\u2019d never done before. It ended up being a wonderful evening, and I got us ice cream as dessert. However, late last week, he wanted me to help him with cleaning his apartment and making preparations for his New Year\u2019s Eve party, which - mind you - I was not invited to. Once it was all done, he sent me off on my way and I went home and felt so shitty about it all. He didn\u2019t even offer to buy me a cup of coffee before I left, and he woke me up at 5.30 that morning to clean. \n\nI feel as though I\u2019m always doing him favours and but he rarely reciprocates and if he does, he either never initiates unless I bring it up or seems hesitant. For example, earlier this week he took me out to a nice pub for dinner and paid for the first bill. Later, we got a few more drinks and had a very lovely evening. For the second bill, he asked if I could pay him back $100 of it. I didn\u2019t say anything at first, as I was a little tipsy at the time, although I did pay for the Uber back to his place, which ended up being $55. While I stayed at his place, he asked me to go get groceries a few times as well, as well as items he needed for himself, such as mouthwash, protein bars, scotch tape, shampoo, floss, etc. \n\nI felt pretty insulted that he would not go get his own necessities and wanted me to pay for them, but still wanted me to pay him back for the bill, which he did again when I left his place earlier today. I mentioned that I since had paid for all of our groceries this week, as well as for the previous Uber, we could at least call it even. Anyways, he said I ate half of the groceries and had most of the drinks on the night out (which was bullshit, as we each had a drink every time. The second bill was $120, and I remembered we shared a bottle of wine, a bar snack, 2 more drinks, and then a jug of sangria). \n\nThen he later tells me I haven\u2019t been respectful of his place and I don\u2019t clean up after myself. I felt that was a complete slap in the face as I\u2019ve been nothing but helpful when I\u2019m over at his - I tidy up and make sure things are nice and organised, do most of the cooking, wash and put away the dishes, and occasionally help around the house. Okay, a couple times I have forgotten to put something away but I always made sure to get it done once I realise my mistake. I also remind him when he needs to get stuff done like doing his part or putting away laundry. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just unhappy that he kept tabs on money that I \u201cowed\u201d him on the date. Even though I\u2019m kind of on a budget, I try to make sure that I spoil him every now and again when I could, like with a coffee or takeaway dinner or paying for groceries. He, on the other hand, has never really reciprocated with the same gesture, not even get me a glass of water or offer to do something special for me. I\u2019d love it if he surprised me with something he knows that I\u2019d like, or take the initiative and invite me out more often. We don\u2019t even have to do something that\u2019d cost money; a hike or picnic at a park would be wonderful. But all we do is stay in at his place, sleep together, watch Netflix and cook, which I told him gets pretty boring after a while. I\u2019m very outgoing and love trying out new things; I\u2019ve suggested camping, exploring the city we live in, a mini getaway, etc. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be entitled but I\u2019d much prefer for us to have the type of relationship where we do each other favours, whether that be nice gestures or paying for nights out, in good faith and not make it seem transactional. However, given that he\u2019s not very generous with me and being stingy with money, despite there being a high disparity in income, has actually made me resent him, especially when I\u2019m always helping him around and doing my best to make him feel special. \n\nI did plan a date night for us later next week (painting class, which I paid for) and he offered to pay for dinner and drinks and snacks. Hopefully, it goes well\u2026\n\nSo what I\u2019m asking is: is it wrong for me to resenting him for rarely doing anything nice for me and on the rare occasion he does, he\u2019s not generous about it and has asked me to pay him back for a night out even though I hoped to make up for it with the groceries and Uber and favours I did. \n\nIt has left me feeling quite bitter that I\u2019m paying for him a lot and when he contributes, it\u2019s rare and mostly for himself. I really want to communicate this with him, how the past week has made me feel, but don\u2019t really know how either. \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nTL;DR - boyfriend is not very generous with me whereas I\u2019m the opposite and sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a convenience to him, despite him suggesting otherwise. Need advice how to have our relationship be about favours and paying for each other in good faith and make it an issue about \u201cdebts\u201d.",

        "content": "Started dating new BF (27M) around Thanksgiving; though I've known him.for seven years. I had/have major relationship anxiety, especially after my last ex (we dated doe almost 4 years, I broke up with him start of 2020); however, I told myself I wouldn't be official with someone until I 1) could confidently say I'd reject my ex if he were to try and get me back while dating my partner, and 2) could imagine forever with my new partner prior to being official... so, needless to say, new BF passes both of these qualifications. \n\nBF is already talking about moving in with me (I live 2.5 hours away from him), and that makes me nervous af. My ex and I lived together and it just ended up making us dislike each other b/c jt turned into a \"mother & son\" type dynamic; although I see BF as more responsible than my ex, there are already small traits I see that I know annoy Me that I'm still trying to adjust to (he's very wishy washy, apologizes for everything, is easily defeated). On one hand I'm like \"well, I have nothing to lose. May as well prepare to get married cuz I don't think I can do any better than him.\" (He's way out of my league, and is a really great guy). But on the other hand, I can still hear the little sad voice in my head saying \"but forever with him means forever not with [ex]\", which really aggrevates me because LOGICALLY I accept that (he has a new partner now, he's changed in a lot of questionable ways) but it seems I'm still slightly emotionally struggling with it despite knowing j wouldn't leave my bf for [ex]. \n\nBF knows I still have remnants of feelings for ex, and is rly understanding; bf knows what it means for me to officially Date him. I've voiced to him that I'm anxious about moving so fast; he responds with already knowing he wants to marry me, and he wants to learn how to live with each other and adjust to each other's habits before popping the question. I can see his logic and, again,I wouldn't have dated him if I couldn't imagine marrying him. He has a point, and what have I to lose... ? \nI do struggle with the idea that he already knows he loves me enough to marry me... but then he argued that he's known me for so long as a friend that it didn't take long for his feelings to intensify. \n\nRent would be easier with someone helping... and maybe living together would help me really get past my ex completely on the emotional side of things? But what if it messes everything up...\n\nTL;DR New BF of 2 months (but friend of 7 years) already wants to move in with me and is talking about marriage... im nervous it's too fast, but st the same time what have I to lose? What should I do?",

        "content": "So let me tell y\u2019all THIS story.\n\nWe met on an online forum through mutual interests circa 2016. I was going through a rough time after a death in the family, and turned to my hobbies for a distraction. We started talking and hit it off right off the bat, talking all day every day, particularly by writing together. We got along really well, but she suffered a lot from anxiety, depression, and dissociative episodes. I was there for her through a lot of this stuff, and we formed a real friendship.\n\nCut to 2017, and she tells me she has feelings for me. I tell her that because we live so far apart (opposite ends of the US) with no immediate plans or opportunities to move any closer, it\u2019s better if we stay just friends, but that I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t or can\u2019t eventually see myself feeling the same way about her. Really, I was figuring out a lot of stuff about my sexuality and knew that I couldn\u2019t commit myself to a long-distance relationship like that.\n\nOur friendship has ups and downs for the years after that, as I try to help her guide her life in the direction she wants it to go - not stuck in a dead end job in a town that she hates, but with possibilities for the future. I graduate college and move out to the west coast, a fair distance closer to her, and we finally make plans to meet.\n\nWe meet in January of 2020 and it\u2019s awesome. I finally admit to myself that I have feelings for her, seeing her in person. This event really solidifies the whole thing for me, and in my mind, there\u2019s no turning back.\n\nEnter COVID.\n\nCOVID hits and her life gets really difficult. She takes care of her dad and works what was an \u201cessential\u201d job at the time; she contracts COVID, her dad has COVID and ends up in the hospital, a lot goes down. Contact with me slows to a trickle, and I completely understand and make it clear to her that I\u2019m there for her. I try not to poke her too much, since I don\u2019t want to be overbearing or make her feel like responding to me is a chore. Around April, contact really slows, and by August it\u2019s basically all me, trying to send her funny videos or memes to cheer up her day and receiving next to nothing in response.\n\nI send her a care package at Halloween, since it\u2019s her favorite holiday. I send her an admittedly desperate message at the tail end of October about how I miss her and just wish that she would talk to me, and apologize if there\u2019s anything I could have said to offend her, and it receives one pithy response and nothing else. She disappears.\n\nI send her a Merry Christmas message that gets another short response, and by the first day of January 2021, she\u2019s unfriended me on almost all social media (UNFRIENDED - but not blocked). I find this out when I try to send her a gift on Animal Crossing, of all things, and discover she\u2019s no longer in my friends list. I send her a text asking what happened that is still unanswered.\n\nCUT TO TODAY\nShe\u2019s back on the online forum where we met. I see her buzzing around the old haunts, like nothing happened, and it stings like hell. She\u2019s talking about how excited she is about XYZ, conversations I know we would be having if we still talked. She\u2019s writing and chatting and I can\u2019t help but wonder if she\u2019s seen me floating around, because I\u2019m still there, too, and we have mutuals. I have no idea what happened, and it\u2019s been over a year of silence, I don\u2019t think my pride would let me ask, if I even knew what to say.\n\nI still have a love letter she sent me. Her birthday is next week. It\u2019s kind of driving me crazy since she showed up on the forum yesterday. It was easier when she disappeared from my life completely, even though I was upset. Any advice on what I should do (if anything) or how the hell to get over this?\n\nTLDR; Six years of internet friendship turned something nebulously more + we met in person, she ghosts me during COVID with no reasoning, now she\u2019s back on the internet forum where we met like nothing happened (still not talking to me).",

        "title": "Was I in the wrong in this breakup story?",
        "content": "Hi, this happened a few years ago but I want some outside opinions on whether my annoyance was justifiable.\n\nSo, I'm female and was dating a guy, call him M, and we were both about 27 at the time; I'd just recently moved into a flat of my own. On the night in question he and one of my best female friends, R, were round at my place helping me set things up. I am quite a quiet, introverted person due to my autism, but these two could win medals if talking was an Olympic sport. At about 11pm I indicated that I was getting tired (not for the first time), and so M offered to give my friend a lift home, as her house wasn't all that far away, to save her taking a taxi. I don't have a car of my own, so I wasn't able to offer.\n\nI didn't have a problem with this but naively I presumed he would drop her off and come straight home, given that he was sleeping over at mine and that we had plans the next day we had to set off early for. They left and he told me that he wouldn't mind if I went to sleep, but I decided to do the nice thing and wait up for him.\n\nHe didn't come back until 4am. It's important to point out that R is a lesbian and not interested in men in the slightest so I knew the chances of him cheating with her were non-existent. However, despite the reasons I have already mentioned AND the fact that R had left her dog alone in the house for most of the day already, they pulled up outside her house and just... sat there, talking, for almost five hours without apparently noticing the time. During that time I sent him several texts which he apparently never noticed/received due to poor phone reception, and I couldn't call him as I get severe social anxiety talking on the phone (which he knew).\n\nBy the time he finally returned to my flat I had not slept a wink and was on the verge of hysterics wondering if he'd been in a car crash or something equally dreadful, but he seemed completely confused as to why I would be worried and then got angry at me for it. After a very tense argument, we got maybe two hours sleep, and then had to be up early the next morning to drive fifty miles to a nearby city to help a friend of mine with something, as promised. M was in such a bad mood due to my reaction that he was terribly rude to my friend and embarrassed me. \n\nR was also quite nonchalant about the whole thing when I next spoke to her, and refused to acknowledge that what had happened was in any way unusual or reprehensible. Our friendship didn't really last long after that for a number of reasons.\n\nI broke up with M not long after that (it was one of many signs that our relationship just wasn't working), but he surprised me by lashing out emotionally and claiming I was breaking his heart. He also refused to give me back \u00a370 that he happened to owe me. I haven't spoken to either of them since and I also lost a couple of other friends who apparently sided with R over me.\n\nWas I in the wrong, or did I have every right to be mad?\n\nTl;DR: My boyfriend drove my friend home and stayed out until 4am just talking to her instead of coming straight back to me, and I was really worried because I had no idea where he was or if something bad had happened.",

        "title": "Should I move out?",
        "content": "I \\[23f\\] have been dating my bf \\[25m\\] on and off for 3 years. We dated for a year, then broke up, remained fwb for 4 months, completely out of touch for 8 months and then got back together. We've been together for around 9 months now. This is my first serious relationship, so I feel a bit overwhelmed with everything that comes with moving in with someone. I feel like it's hard for me to be myself when there's someone else in my room and I don't get any privacy at all. Technically I don't need privacy for anything, but I just miss \"me time\" which I don't get as much anymore since both of us are in the same room all day every day (wfh). I'm talking to a therapist about this and working on being more comfortable with being myself around other people. So this is not really an issue with bf; I just find it hard to be myself around others in general. \n\nAnd our schedules are so different - he's a night person, I'm a morning person. He also likes to live in the suburbs so I moved with him but its so restricting for me cos I feel like I can't go anywhere. The closest bus stop is over 15 min walk and any time I wanna go out, I have to spend at least 30 min to reach my destination. If I'm meeting someone, its always over an hour. I can get used to the bus rides but I just feel the suburbs are so dull. I liked earlier when I got out of my apartment and there was a little bit of a hustle bustle, just made me feel alive! Now even if I wanna go to the gym it takes me an hour one way. Which means I can't go unless I wake up at 5am so that I can be back in time to have breakfast and start work on time. Even though I'm a morning person, it's much harder to wake up at 5am after I moved in with bf as our combined schedule makes it hard to be in bed by 8:30pm. And bf can't wake up to take me to the gym (I still can't drive) as he usually sleeps around 1am. I also noticed I'm much happier in the mornings when I can be by myself and be myself compared to when I spend the mornings with him. I do like him very much and love the connection that we have. He's the sweetest, most mature guy I've met. And he tells me I'm the perfect girl for him. But I just wonder if this is wrong timing for me.\n\nAnother thing bothering me is finances - I was pretty much broke in uni so my budget was really low. I would only pay for rent, phone, transport and groceries (rarely ordering out) because I couldn't afford it. Ever since I started dating bf, my expenses doubled. They're still low enough to be considered frugal, and I'm not wasting any money. Still I feel like I've lost any control of my finances since I moved in. I've tried to talk to him but find it really hard to talk about, especially because my budget was so low that I'm ashamed to discuss the actual numbers with him. He's told me multiple times how it makes him uncomfortable when I am visibly uncomfortable with spending more on food but its so hard to explain to him.\n\nIs the stuff I'm complaining about just small things I shouldn't be so concerned about - and I just need to grow up - or is it a valid reason for me to move out? If it's the former, how do I do that? If I move out I think we won't last more than a couple of months. Not sure what to do...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: moved in with a 3 year bf to suburbs and feel like I've become less happy after moving. It's mostly things like having a different schedule, doing things differently, not being able to go anywhere anytime I want, not being able to focus as much on work because I'm spending more time and energy on my relationship (which I didn't think is something I'd have to do but I guess that was just immature) so one hand I feel like its all just very small things and I'm making a big deal out of nothing. On the other hand, I loved living in the city. I felt more lively. Not just that, when I'm by myself, I feel happier. I feel like I can be myself when there's no one else so this isn't bf specific (I'm working on it with a therapist). I wonder if these are just small things I shouldn't be so concerned about - and I just need to grow up - or is it a valid reason for me to move out? If it's the former, how do I do that? If I move out I think we won't last more than a couple of months. Not sure what to do...",

        "content": "Hey, apologies if this gets a bit messy, not the best at explaining things. I've been with my partner for 4 years.\n\nI live with my dad and he has just offered to take me and my partner out for dinner at some point. I believe the reason behind this is because he hasn't seen/spoken to her in years. This wouldn't be an issue in any healthy relationship but I believe mine is far from it.\n\nI've fallen into the bad habit of telling white lies. This is because in the past I believe the relationship has been borderline abusive (I'll add some details below). To protect everyone in the situation I have lied about certain things. For example:\n\n* My parents are not aware of my girlfriend's new job, this is because I was worried it would affect their views on us seeing each other due to covid (she works in a nursery)\n* I've never told my parents about my girlfriend's behaviour in the past because I didn't want to taint their opinion of her\n* My girlfriend isn't aware of the amount of rent I pay my father because she believes I \"already pay too much\"\n\nThere are other trivial lies I've told and I now feel that I myself am living a lie. My partner knows one story, my friends another, my family another etc.\n\nThe reason I started doing this is because it initially made things easy for me (as terrible as that makes me sound). This is because my girlfriend would react badly to trivial things and I feel that she was controlling for the following reasons:\n\n* My girlfriend disliked my sibling and made it clear that if I had any interaction with them, it was wrong. My girlfriend told me that \"she hoped I had nothing to do with them\". She has behaved exactly the same with a female friend too. If I meet my mum for lunch, my girlfriend will often say \"you kept that quiet\" as if I'm doing something wrong.\n* Requesting me to remove social media and to stop watching certain TV shows in case I saw any attractive women. Any time I mentioned I had watched TV I would get \"I feel anxious, what show did you watch?\"\n* Started asking to go through my phone. This would start with pictures but eventually moved on to her reading my messages. On one occasion she had gone through my phone while I was asleep and woke me up, upset about something I had done.\n* She has said in the past that she wants to move out with me so that my \"family aren't a problem\"\n* Has often told me that she feels anxious if I go to the pub with friends or to the cinema - often I will cancel my plans because of this\n\nThere is plenty more that I would label as controlling behaviour.\n\nI basically feel like I'm walking on eggshells, so it is easier to tell small lies and cancel any plans I have etc.\n\nI don't know how to move on from this. I don't know what to tell my dad about going out to dinner as he is unaware of all of this.\n\nMy girlfriend has been better lately but I can't get rid of the memories of how she has treated me in the past.\n\n**I feel like I can't bring up her behaviour now because I missed my chance and should have brought it up when it was happening.**\n\nWhat would you recommend I do? Tell my parents about her behaviour?\n\n**tldr**\n\n**Father has offered to take me (25M) and my girlfriend (21F) out for dinner. This is a problem to me because he doesn't know about my girlfriend's behaviour and because I've kept small things from my girlfriend, due to her reactions in the past.

Her children have been grown for at least 15 years and she is capable of working. Despite this, my dad bounces between near bankruptcy and racking up the credit cards. It's all consumer debt. He owns almost nothing outright and it still affects me to this day. We never have Christmas gifts, my dad cannot budget for it & I was severely medically neglected as a child due to his avoidance of expenses that didn't benefit himself, & have been left with lifelong issues. My mom currently has an infection, claims they can't afford copay to see the doctor, but my dad is buying tools, that he never uses, almost daily. It has caused me to build savings, always work, obtain a college degree (I do have some student loans), never have a credit card balance, and to be extremely cheap. I even repair my own things and make many of the things I need. Even my financial advisor is impressed & says that I don't need his advice.\n\nI 32/f, am currently dating a wonderful guy, 32/m, for the last 6 months that really cares about me. While it triggers the resent I have for my parents, by being so lovingly cared for, it is so amazing to experience a guy that is genuine. Love is occurring. My ex 30/m was a nightmare, so it's refreshing. However, current bf is in debt consolidation. He was able to live in a rent free situation, like myself, until he obtained his masters. Which he has no debt for. He said that he didn't realize how expensive moving out was and he got over his head acquiring things needed to live on his own. My bf complains about being tight on cash often. However, he has expensive taste and eats out daily. Something that I cannot wrap my head around. I have no issue buying dollar store bodywash & driving 1/4 of a mile to save a little on gas. He will buy 10 dollar bodywash and buy gas anywhere. He has to have an iPad & I am happy with a Kindle. He has said that his friends make comments about how he spends. Just about every time he talks about buying something expensive, like a 400 dollar vacuum, when there is a reasonably cheaper option, it triggers me. It makes me feel like he is going to follow the back & forth of debt that my dad has. He says he has one card left, that he keeps paid down. His expensive taste causes me to rant about money, & my dad's handling of it, and he responds that it makes it him feel like I am accusing him of something he hasn't done.\n\nHe has expressed that he just wants his monthly bills paid and I have said that I want savings. I don't feel that, as a situated adult, an unexpected 2,000 dollar expense should trigger fear and panic. Other than this, this guy is wonderful. The one thing my ex and I agreed on was money, and I love talking about money. Meanwhile, current bf tries to avoid the topic. \n\nAm I being too anal or should I have genuine concern? I have expressed to him that I believe money is going to be our biggest issue. If I am not being anal, how should I address this? I don't want it to lead to me being a control freak about money, if we get to a point of sharing expenses. \n\nTL:DR bf and I have different views on money. He is in debt consolidation and continues to have expensive taste. It triggers anxiety in me, due to my dad's similar taste causing constant debt. Unsure of how to address as I am extremely frugal and like to save. Money talks lead to him feeling accused of being my dad and he avoids the topic.",

        "content": "Our relationship has been through a lot of turmoil. Moving, long distance, applying to a super competitive graduate program, finally getting to be together in person again, finally moving in together. We have been living together for 6-7 months and last week I asked him to move out because I don't know if the problems we have can be solved.\n\nIt is kind of hard to describe but I think it all comes down to my boyfriend being a bad communicator. He defaults to being passive aggressive instead of just saying what is on his mind. I'll give an example from the fight that was our breaking point but this kind of thing happens all the time.\n\nBoyfriend woke up in a bad mood about something. I could tell he was in a bad mood so I just let him be. He shut the door to our room and didn't come out to help walk the dog or hang out with me. No idea what was bothering him but I took the closed door to mean \"leave me alone.\" At one point I did open the door and put a cup of coffee in the room for him but didn't say hi or anything. Thought maybe he slept badly and wanted to go back to sleep, or just needed some alone time.\n\nLater in the afternoon after hours of him being alone in our room, I put on a movie. He texted me, \"Am I invited to watch?\" I said \"Yes.\" He stayed in our room and did not come out to watch the movie. Finally after the movie I went into the room and asked what was going on. He said it was very rude of me not to say hi when I brought the coffee in, and not to invite him to watch the movie. I said that was confusing because it seemed like he just wanted to be left alone. He went off on this long rant about how he didn't sleep well, his stomach hurt, he was stressed about all of these things from school, etc etc etc. I was like...ok? But also if you shut yourself alone in the room of course I am not going to go out of my way to talk to and spend time with you....?\n\nIt turned into a huge fight and finally I just told him he needs to move out. I can't live like this. So he is staying somewhere else and looking for his own place. I am trying to decide if the relationship can be fixed or not. To me it seems like the issue is that he cannot communicate. If he had woken up and said, \"ugh, I slept so badly, my stomach hurts, and I'm stressed about all of this stuff with school,\" we could have talked about it and had a normal day. But instead his instinct was to hole himself up and sulk and I was supposed to just like psychically know what was going on with him?\n\nThis is not the first time something like this has happened, and a few months ago we started couples counseling. Couples counseling showed him he really needs to work on himself, so he is doing individual counseling. He just started about a month ago, so I am really hoping he can change.\n\nThe relationship has a lot of great aspects to it...we have incredible sexual chemistry, he makes me feel deeply loved and supported, we have compatible goals and values, and he is my best friend. I just love being with him. Plus he's a great doggy dad and our dog is broken-hearted that he's not here. But can you fix something like this? Should I just cut my losses and move on?\n\ntl;dr: Boyfriend is naturally a passive-aggressive bad communicator. We are doing couples and individual therapy. Can people change? Is this fixable? Or should I just start the painful moving on process?",

        "content": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 3.5 years. I was in a 5 year relationship prior to him and decided to be single and picky about who I dated for at least a year. I ended up being single for over a year and eventually I met my now boyfriend. He was everything I was looking for physically and mentally. \n\nWhen we moved in together that\u2019s when things started to change. I\u2019m a bartender so I work late nights. He would always make comments about me grabbing a drink after work with my co workers- and would always ask about guys hitting on me at work, etc. when I would be honest about the guys that would hit on me he would assume I flirt back, etc. eventually he would blame me for them hitting on me. Saying there is obviously a reason they are doing so.\n\nI\u2019m not a flirt with customers. I just take the compliments and move on. Eventually I told him we couldn\u2019t be together if he didn\u2019t trust me. Things got way better after I told him how exhausted I was by his mistrust in me. I just put my foot down and told him he has no reason to be insecure. I need his confidence and trust. \n\nThe thing is I want him to go chill with his friends and go out for drinks and have fun without me. He rarely does those things. It makes me happy when he does.\n\nFast forward to my new problem. In the middle of the night last night I was still awake on my phone. It\u2019s been a rough year and I\u2019ve had a hard time sleeping. I was scrolling on tik tok for hours with the volume down and he woke up and asked me what I was doing and who I was texting. Obviously I wasn\u2019t doing any of the sorts at that hour and he called me a liar and said I am being sneaky. And he said \u201cI know how you are\u201d\n\nI hate being accused of things I don\u2019t do and it borderline feels abusive and manipulative. Although I don\u2019t want to accuse him of being that. When I have said in the past I feel he is manipulative he gaslights me and says I\u2019m the manipulative one. So I just don\u2019t name call and try to reassure. I\u2019m starting to feel exhausted. \n\nI\u2019m unsure of where to go from here or how to end this behavior because I really do love my boyfriend and despite these hiccups, we have so much fun together and have passion and goals for our future. But I\u2019m mentally exhausted and it\u2019s a huge turn off he accuses me of things I\u2019m not doing. \n\nMaybe this is an excuse, but his ex cheated on him. Maybe he thinks I\u2019ll do the same, even though I have reassured my loyalty for over three years now.\n\nTl;dr So to summarize this, my boyfriend questions my loyalty, and I\u2019m not sure how to reassure him anymore.",

        "title": "How do you respond to your partner saying they love you more than you love them?",
        "content": "Sorry for long post (!) but I thought the extra info may provide some helpful context. I read the rules several times so hopefully I didn't miss anything!\n\nI've been with my (26F) partner (28M) for a little over 2.5 years, living together full time for over a year now. In the past he's made comments here and there about how he loves me more than I love him and that it's ok. He says it a little jokingly so I don't take it too seriously but it also makes me feel badly sometimes. When I was 19-21 I was in an emotionally abusive relationship so knowing what I've learned from going through that in the past I feel that saying something like you love your SO more than they love them is a manipulative statement. Sometimes when he says that it makes me remember times I'd rather forget, when I was berated (sometimes for literal hours) every day for doing one thing or another wrong and I was labelled a bad girlfriend. I truly believe he doesn't realize that it comes across as manipulative, though, and doesn't realize the effect it can have. \n\nTwo nights ago he said the same thing- he loves me more than I love him- in response to me doing something he found annoying and it led to him saying some further things that I found pretty hurtful and wouldn't answer my questions in response to it. Again, he said some of them a bit jokingly so it's hard for me to tell how much of this is really an issue. I'm not sure how to respond to it and really get to the heart of the problem. We talked a little bit this morning about normal day-to-day stuff and I'm not sure if he was still thinking about the conversation or not but I want to get to the bottom of this and move on. I just don't know how to bring it up and I don't understand why people would say these things in the first place. How do you address that kind of statement from your partner? \n\n*Background for and the conversation two nights ago:* \n\nMy partner works long hours running a restaurant, so due to his hours he falls asleep on the couch after coming home pretty easily. I try to wake him up so he can either take a shower with me if he wants or move to the bed, as if he falls asleep on the couch he'll likely wake up around midnight/1AM then go to bed and not be as well-rested. When I try to wake him up he usually falls back asleep quickly. Most of the time it's late and I have to go to sleep as well (I work a regular 8-5 job so need to be up at a reasonably early time) and don't really have time to sit there trying to wake him up repeatedly so we can get to sleep. If I don't wake him up he usually asks why I didn't see if he wanted to shower too or why I didn't get him before I went to bed. At the same time, he gets annoyed with the way I wake him up, saying it's mean and the way he wakes me up when I fall asleep is much nicer as he will give me kisses and speak to me softly. I usually shake him awake as gently as possible but enough to get him to wake up and respond to my questions if he wants to shower or not and go to bed, as when I'm too gentle he doesn't wake up fully and falls back asleep. \n\nThe other night I shook his arm to see if he wanted to shower with me or not and he was super salty about it, acting like I shook him very hard. He again said he wakes me up more nicely and that I'm always mean about it. In the shower he said I was mean, that I had an attitude and if I loved him more I would wake him up like he wakes me up. I've asked him this before when he's brought it up previously and asked him again, does he seriously think he loves me more than I love him and if so, what can I do about it? No response, he just stares at me and he made a face (picture a 'yeah, I said what I said'/'you *really* have to ask?' type expression). He also made a comment about how he's been in abusive relationships in the past (the past 2 relationships he was in were emotionally and/or I'd say financially abusive, so he's not exaggerating) and that must just be how things will go for him in his life. Again, all said in a bit of a joking tone so I tried to brush it off but at that point I was pretty done with the conversation so I got out of the shower. He said I 'slammed' the shower curtain shut and to stop having an attitude with him. I didn't want to keep talking to him anymore so I just got ready for bed and kept the conversation to a minimum. Before we went to sleep he asked if I was mad at him. I said no as I was more annoyed and just trying to process what he said and went to sleep shortly after that. The next morning I was feeling annoyed and a bit sad about what he said; he was sleeping in and I didn't want to talk to him so I didn't say goodbye like I normally would. \n\n*Afterwards/other relevant background:*\n\nYesterday I did some dumb googling about people who love their partners more than they love them and it didn't really make sense to me. I read some articles and threads about people who felt they loved their partner more how it sucked. I just don't understand how you can measure love- apart from seeing your partner obviously doesn't care for you, how do you know they don't love you? I spoke to my mom about this and she also didn't really get it and thought it was weird he seemed insecure about how much I love him. He has been cheated on in past relationships and sometimes has dreams about me cheating on him, about twice in the past recent months (I have not cheated on any partners past or present and there's never been any cause for alarm in the current relationship), so I'm not sure if some of this is coming from a place of insecurity. Again, when I've asked him what I should do to show my love more he doesn't have many answers. I don't know how to fix something if he can't tell me what the problem is. I'm starting to wonder if our love languages just aren't aligned or if there truly is another problem he is seeing.\n\n In the past he has vaguely said he'd like to cuddle more but that's about it. So I'm not sure if he wants more physical affection or if it's something else. My family is not very physically affectionate so that's probably an area I could work on being more spontaneous in, if that's truly the issue. Our sex life is alright but maybe not entirely where he would like it to be, so that could be another thing. Earlier last year I was very stressed from work so wasn't up for it but would try to commit to once a week. Now we're pretty regularly once/twice a week but I think ideally it would be maybe more consistently twice a week or more for him. During the time I was stressed he got on this track thinking it was my birth control and suggested several times I get off it and he would do whatever I needed if I wanted to stop taking it. I've been on this type of birth control for several years so I'm 90% sure it was just my workload stressing me out, which I vented to him many times about so it's kind of sad he didn't realize it was my mental state. Work stresses him often and sometimes he acts like no one else could possibly be as stressed out as him, so I don't know if that colored his view at the time. \n\nIn our regular life, since he works so much a lot of the household upkeep falls to me- I do 99% of the grocery and household items shopping, checking our mail, cooking meals and most of the cleaning and laundry unless he does some on his days off or we clean together on the weekends. I do this because he doesn't have time, won't remember to or is too tired and it's nice for him to just be able to come home and rest after work.  I truly don't mind as logistically speaking, it just makes sense for me to do these things but I don't know if he doesn't realize how much of my time and effort goes to this. I'm trying to take more items off his to do list so when he does have time off we can spend it together, and so he's not taking on extra 'work' outside of work. Obviously not all of those items are for him specifically, like I need food and clean clothes and would like a clean space myself, but if I didn't care about him and his time I'd tell him to f off and do it himself. \n\nOne of the other times he recently mentioned where he clearly loves me more is when he got covid last week. He was not that sick, it was more of a cold than anything. I regularly asked how he was feeling and got him anything he needed. I didn't want to cuddle him as I was trying to not get sick myself. He complained I wasn't taking care of him enough and that he would take much better care of me but I brushed it off. \n\n**TL;DR:** My partner semi-regularly says he loves me more than I love him. I think that's a manipulative statement but he says these things kind of jokingly and I can't tell how serious he is. The other night he was pretty salty and compared me to his past abusive relationships. When I ask if he seriously thinks that I don't love him as much he just gives me a 'look' and won't tell me ways I can improve or fix this. I already spend a fair bit of my own time doing things to help care for him/our home and free up his time so we can spend more time together and he can rest after work. Not sure if our love languages aren't aligned or if there's other problems. I'm tired of feeling like a bad partner when I don't think I am but at this point I'm starting to doubt myself. How should I bring this up in conversation to help get to the root of the problem?",

        "content": "I'm 28F. I am often told that I am attractive and that I am a good catch. My ex is 37M. We come from different backgrounds: I come from a very humble family and have worked extremely hard (and with no connections) to get to where I am career-wise. He comes from a very wealthy family. We dated 3 years and had a beautiful relationship for 2.5 of those years, making things work despite our busy schedules and one year of long distance in between (he had family matters to attend to for some time). Overall, we were solid. Nine months into the relationship, he had even initiated a discussion about marriage. He told me that he would like to get married at the \"2-year mark\". I agreed and we had always proceeded based on this plan.\n\nBut he took a new job last summer. He despises this job. He hates his boss, he hates that he has to work some weekends, he hates everything about what he is doing. He completely changed last summer: he wouldn't speak, could not eat, would vomit in the mornings, and was a shell of his former self. He spiralled out of control. I was there for him every day. I cooked him breakfast, lunch, and dinner, cleaned, and spent hours answering his reassurance questions, even though I had my own hectic work schedule while completing my Masters. We went from having an amazing sex life to virtually nothing all summer. I put myself on the back burner for this man, and without resentment at the time. I thought that we were soulmates and that this was just a phase. In my mind, I was being his rock. After all, he was my future husband. \n\nMeanwhile, he had not even hinted at a marriage proposal that summer. Whenever I asked him about the plan to get married, which was now 6 months overdue, he would tell me not to worry. I just had to be patient. In fact, in August, he told me that by the \"end of the year\", we would be engaged. It had just been a tough year, but \"the plan was still happening, Pooh Bear\". This reinforced to me that everything was fine in our relationship, but that he was struggling because of work. I continued to devote myself to him. \n\nOne month later, he suddenly dumped me. He told me that he \"had not been feeling the relationship lately\" and that he wanted to \"walk away\". He was not ready for marriage, and he was not sure if it was me or just the idea of marriage itself. It turned out that he had never even gone looking for a ring (even though he had purchased a $13k watch for himself). I was shocked and devastated. He also was not fair about his timing: I had just started a prestigious and demanding one-year internship, and I was in the middle of recruitment for my dream job after this contract. \n\n24 hours later, he called me back. Apparently, he came to his senses and needed to \"see if the spark was still there\". I was so blindsided that I was willing to do anything to get him back. We spent the weekend together and he realized that he still did love me. I asked him why he dumped me. He just said, \"that's how he felt at the time\", but that he loved me and wanted to be with me. No apology after putting me through Hell. I took him back. I was too emotionally exhausted to ask any other questions. \n\nI kept quiet and did whatever he wanted for the next two months - anything to make him happy. Suddenly, he was doing better. He still hated his job and had anxiety over it, but he wanted to have sex and had a sense of humour again. Progress! According to him, we were \"better than ever\". On my end, I was too numb to even understand my feelings of hurt and confusion.\n\nOne day over breakfast, I suddenly needed to know if he still wanted to marry me. How could he expect me to forget something he had promised me for 3 years, and which was his idea in the first place? I said: \"you know, we never really talked about the whole marriage thing...\" His response: \"I know you want that. It's not off the table. There is no one else that I would ever want to be with \". I started silently crying, but he didn't care. He went about eating his eggs. The next day, I saw an old friend's engagement announcement on sm. I started crying, not because I was jealous, but because I was feeling so dismissed and the numbness was starting to subside. I was finally starting to feel the pain of my ex's behaviour in the last six months. He initially laughed off my tears. He then got aggressive with me for the first time ever: \"What, we are back at square one? Do we need to talk about this again?\" I was so hurt that I just told him not to worry and tried to control my tears. He did nothing, and again went on as though there was nothing wrong. But I think that he did sense that I was starting to close myself off from him because he started buying me little presents here and there, and treating me to dinners. He then planned a trip to Paris for NYE (this was before Omicron). I appreciated his efforts, but it felt like he was trying to shut me up. Also, it was all on his terms - the restaurants, the meals we ordered (he did not want me eating fattening foods so that I would stay slim, even though I am a size 00), the trip, everything. I had no say whatsoever over anything in the relationship any longer, including our former life plan, which was now an off-limits conversation.\n\nIn late November, my great uncle died. My ex did not feel like coming to the funeral. He did not even bother to express his condolences to my family. At that moment, I officially knew that the beautiful man that I had fallen in love with three years ago was gone forever. I had had enough. I loved my ex, and wanted to support him during his emotional struggles, but I needed to love myself more at this point. Being with him was now tearing my soul apart. That morning, I gathered the strength to leave him. At first, he got aggressive again, saying that marriage was just a trivial piece of paper and that we didn't need it to be happy. But I simply told him that I wouldn't push back. Rather, he needed to figure out what he wants. It was the most painful thing that I have ever done, but also the greatest act of self-love. And I know that I made the right call.\n\nIt has been a month and a half since then. I am starting 2022 feeling stronger than I have felt in months and, while it still hurts, I am hopeful that I will find a good, nurturing, non-abusive love one day. By the way, I got my dream job and I am moving on to an exciting new chapter in a new city (Manhattan!). I hope that one day he will realize what he lost in me and the future that we once might have had (I know his family feels sorry, as I am the only girl he ever introduced to them and they also really thought this was it).\n\nHave you ever found love after losing the person you thought you would marry? How does one ever learn to trust again after such a painful experience? How do I get over the feeling that I just am not good enough for anyone? Please share stories, thoughts, words of advice, anything. Thank you for reading my story.\n\nTL;DR! My boyfriend told me that he wanted to marry me for three years, but he was just cruelly stringing me along.",

        "content": "I don\u2019t even know where to begin. We broke up Monday and my heart is torn into pieces and I don\u2019t know what to do. He was my first ever boyfriend so I\u2019m even more at a loss. To give some back story, we started dating in hs in 2017. I graduated in 2018, he graduated 2020. Throughout the time he was in high school and until the end of 2020 he basically lived a double life. He dated me outside of school, but would date other girls in school and at work. While he was with me, he dated a total of 10 girls and flirted with countless others. I didn\u2019t know any of this and just found out March of last year. I was so hurt and destroyed and was determined to leave him, but he begged me not to, he promised he would change and I eventually gave in because the moments we did share he was kind to me, never treated me badly and I thought he had the potential to change. As time passed I saw he would actually put effort to change and I would see that. We had good moments, great even, but we also had many difficult moments, and in those moments I was always paranoid and on edge. I guess I\u2019m a way I lost myself and became controlling as well. I would ask him if he felt overwhelmed by the way I was being and he would always say no because he understood my reason behind so I didn\u2019t think to change. Monday night, I don\u2019t know why, but I decided to go through his old socials where I found out he cheated on me and found one girl he hadn\u2019t told me out (this was still from 2020 back, not during the time he was trying to change). He insisted he didn\u2019t remember her and that infuriated me. I kept badgering him about it and eventually said that if he didn\u2019t tell me who she was I would break up with him. He still didn\u2019t budge and I eventually in a fit of anger broke it off. I regretted it a few moments later and called him to apologize but he said he was done. And I lost him. I\u2019m in dispare. I know it\u2019s over for good but I can\u2019t stop blaming myself and I don\u2019t know how to move on. He hurt me, but it kills me to think that I am the reason why the relationship didn\u2019t work out. I\u2019m so lost, I have so many memories of him and it kills me, I want him back but I know I can\u2019t. What kills me the moment is that it feels like this break up isn\u2019t even as hard on him as it is on me, he\u2019s carrying on with life as if nothing and even started going to the gym which was something he probably wouldn\u2019t have don\u2019t before. All while I\u2019m at my house crying my eyes out everyday, carrying with a burden of guilt so great I can barely breathe, not being physically able to eat or sleep and missing him. I\u2019ve tried to go out with my friends every day so far, but I end up crying every time I go out. I\u2019m anxiously waiting for school to start again so I could occupy my mind with syllabi instead of him but that isn\u2019t for another two weeks. Was this my fault? What can I do? I know many people will say \u201cyou\u2019re still so young\u201d and things along those lines but this is the man I had planned out my future with. While the world may not be falling apart, mine is and I don\u2019t know what to do. He was my best friend and confidant for 5 years. I want to forget him band move on but it hurts and I don\u2019t have the slightest idea as to how. Thank you for the time anyone who got to this point took to read my sob story. I really would appreciate any advise. \n\nTLDR; my boyfriend and I broke up after years of being together and the guilt won\u2019t let me move on, this being my first break up ever I don\u2019t know what to do.",

I also have ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome (which is related to ASD, I've had that since I was a kid).\n\nRecently, probably due to COVID, my dad and I's relationship has been more strained, but the issues that were present before COVID are still there, if not amplified. (I live in the US btw). My dad has become very overbearing when it comes to my schoolwork but also doesn't know how to treat me when I need to work. He also get's frustrated with me and things very easily, and when he blows up we argue for a bit but he doesn't do anything physically. My dad isn't an alcoholic or anything, he just has a short fuse.\n\nAnyways, when we argue, I usually try to get away from the problem, but that doesn't always work because my dad doesn't always let me go to my room, which is how I deal with stress most of the time. My dad has a tendency to point out everything that I do wrong when he's frustrated, which makes me feel very bad about myself. Sometimes I just need a break from my dad, which I'm usually able to do but recently I haven't had access to my computer room or my phone and I won't have access for about a month (I legally can't go into details about the reason), so I can't contact any of my relatives to have them pick me up and hang out or anything. My dad also doesn't let me work on my schoolwork anywhere except the family room, where he spends most of his time, and sometimes when he's frustrated he keeps pointing out the things I'm doing wrong even if I need to do schoolwork. Working in the family room also has other issues, because people just living their life makes noise, and I can't work if there's any noise around me, but like I said I can't work in my room or anything because he won't let me. It also doesn't help that he recently started dating again and his girlfriend is over about 3 days a week (not including weekends), making more noise.\n\nHere's a recent example of the work thing: My school has a science fair, and we can do it on any topic I want within the guidelines, and my dad kept insisting on me doing one topic even though it didn't fit within the guidelines, and he ended up getting frustrated and arguing about it when I pointed that out to him, which resulted in me not being able to work on the science fair (I still don't have it done)\n\nIt's also probably worth mentioning that my dad is extremely stubborn.\n\nMy dad isn't a bad dad or anything, he loves me and I love him, but sometimes our relationship gets really strained and I don't know what to do to actually get work done around him.\n\nNote: this isn't the only issue with our relationship, just what I wanted to focus on in this post\n\nTL:DR My dad doesn't know how to treat me in regards to schoolwork now that I'm in high school which has caused relationship issues between me and him and I don't know how to deal with it.",

        "content": "Both of us are in our early twenties. We have been friends for at least 5 years now (met at high school), and have been very close for the past 2 or so. We both live in different cities though due to different Universities. We meet in our hometown in person a few times a year.\n\nAnyway, the past year or so I started developing romantic feelings for her. Not to the point where I couldn't date anyone, because I have, but still pretty strong feelings.\n\nAnd day by they they become stronger. I can't hold them anymore. It starts eating me inside and I can't take it, as funny as it sounds. I have started having higher expectations from her simply because I see her as a future romantic partner, which is very unfair. She talks to me about other men and I get super jealous. Worst part, I have to give her advice..Something that kills me. I have to fake it because I want her to be happy no matter what.\n\nI just can't anymore. But at the same time I value what we have. We started as friends purely. We have been next to each other since day 1. We speak to each other everyday. We share everything. And I am afraid I will just destroy everything by being honest to her about my feelings. I don't want to lose her from my life, and I would have said the same 2-3 years ago when I had no romantic feelings developed for her.\n\nI am confused on what to do. This has seriously started affecting my life significantly, and I just want to get it off my chest. I have a feeling and I know for a fact that feelings are not mutual, and that's what hurts me the most, that this will end to nowhere. But I just can't keep them to myself for any longer.\n\nWhat do you think is the best thing to do given the circumstances however? Part of me wants to get it done with. On the other hand, I could simply just keep them to myself for ever so I don't lose her from my life.\n\nI am sorry for the long essay and venting.\n\nTL;DR I have feelings for my best friend. We started purely as friends but the past year or so I don't see her the same way anymore. I have a deep feeling that they are not mutual. What should I do? It has started eating me.",

He\u2019s the type of person who needs time with his games and I\u2019ve accepted it since I\u2019m the type of person who needs alone time to do my work. As with other gamer and non gamer couples, time is always an issue for us. I feel like he doesnt give enough time for me then he feels attacked because I bring up the issue that I dont feel loved because of his games and suggests the reason I feel that is I dont spend enough time with my friends. To an extent, I felt that this was true because I had phases of feeling depressed and isolating myself from people. In a sense it was a wake up call to do better and reach out to my friends. \n\nBut now, I have a big problem since my family is infected with covid and my finals are coming up. I\u2019ve been really stressed about it and I expected to have his support when I needed it since we\u2019re long distance, I\u2019m isolated from other people, and am under a lot of pressure. Now, I understand that he wont be at my every beck and call but I at least expected that he would care or treat me differently as I am experiencing all these problems. He treated it like it was a normal day and would brush me off and tell me to wait since hes still playing with his friends. He tried to make up for it after playing by playing games with me instead. \n\nBefore we slept, I opened up about feeling bad because I told him earlier that day that I needed to be with someone because everything was overwhelming me and he told me to wait an hour or two which was fine. I waited an hour and then he told me that he thought I would wait two hours so I gave up (after all that is when he tried to make it up to me by playing games). He had a bad reaction and was annoyed the same way he gets annoyed when I tell him he doesnt make time for me. He thought that this is the same issue. For me it isnt. He isnt there for me when I\u2019m having problems is the problem. \n\nI confronted him and had a talk with him explaining the gravity of the problem. Then he said he didnt know about the gravity of the problem and doesnt know how to comfort me. \n\nMy friends have offered more of their support and help than him during these times. Is it unreasonable for me to expect him to have done the same if not more than them? \n\nI just feel frustrated because I dont want to be overbearing and dependent. Is it healthy way for me to expect my partner to be there for me? Am I overreacting and expecting too much? \n\nI dont want to be overdependent and I want to be able to do things on my own and not need someone to be there for me all the time.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI (22F) am in a dilemma at the moment with my parents and my boyfriend (24M). We have been dating for 7 months. I have a 6 week clinical placement coming at a hospital up as part of my degree. It is over 2 hours travel time from my house each way by public transport (neither of us have our driver\u2019s licence yet). At first, I was planning on travelling each day from home, however my boyfriend mentioned was keen to rent a place out together and stay with me, and take time off from his work. I was happy with that idea, I mentioned it to my parents, however they said no and weren\u2019t keen on it. We kept pushing for it, and one night my boyfriend came over and we had a discussion as a family, and my parents eventually gave in, to give me some freedom. I have paid for all of it, my parents have not chipped in. I received my clinical placement roster, and my parents looked at it and said you will only be staying there when you have unusual shift times (eg 11:30pm finishes, 12am starts) and we are not going to allow you to stay there the entire 6 weeks. They say it\u2019s unnecessary to be there when I don\u2019t have to, and it is more convenient leaving from home when I have normal shift times (9-5 shifts). My parents were very firm on this and said they will not be changing their mind. They said it\u2019s bad luck you\u2019ve paid for the whole stay because we won\u2019t be letting you go for that long.\n\nI told my boyfriend, and I and he were unhappy as we have paid for all of it already. I think my parents (who are catholic and conservative) are also worried about him trying something on me since we are by ourselves there, so they are being overprotective.\n\nMy boyfriend said he thinks my parents are being ridiculous with how they are sheltering and controlling me, and why would we need to ask for permission to spend our own time and money as adults.\n\nI had another conversation with my parents after this. They are not happy with his response, saying they don\u2019t like him cutting in between us and find it very disrespectful how my boyfriend is not letting it go and respecting my parents\u2019 wishes. My mum liked him near the beginning of the relationship, however my parents don\u2019t approve of him anymore after this argument and said he is not welcome anymore to our house and are sick of him. They don\u2019t want to speak to him. My dad says I\u2019m not ready for a serious relationship with uni and all and should wait until my mid 20s when my brain has matured more. My boyfriend wants to discuss things with my parents however my parents aren\u2019t having any of it right now.\n\nI\u2019m just so upset with everything that has gone on, and I don\u2019t know whether my boyfriend or my parents are in the right.\n\nAny advice and suggestions are much appreciated.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 boyfriend and I paid to rent out a place for 6 weeks while I am on clinical work placement. My parents only want me staying there for half the time, after I have paid for it in full. My boyfriend thinks they\u2019re being ridiculous and I should do what I want to do and not let my parents control me. Parents say he should be ashamed of himself and find it very rude he is not respecting my parents wishes. My parents now disapprove of him and don\u2019t want me being in a serious relationship with him anymore, it\u2019s causing rifts in the family.",

        "content": "I'm currently feeling very conflicted about the way I approach casual sex. I spent a lot of time feeling very insecure about my lack of success with women, but have recently been doing much better with a \"DGAF\" kind of attitude. My 'body count' is currently 5, with 2 coming from relationships and 3 from recent ONS. I am discovering that I don't enjoy casual sex very much - I feel quite disgusting afterwards. However, I feel compelled to keep pushing my body count higher, despite it being in contradiction with my values and the way I view sex.\n\nI've recently had some very candid discussions with my female friends about their approach to promiscuity. Most girls at my university seem to sleep around. My friends told me that they intended to have 'their fun' now with attractive player-type guys, then 'settle down' with more reliable guys in their late 20s. I'm sure if you asked most guys, people want to be the former guy and not the latter that a girl 'settles down with' - and I'm not an exception there.\n\nHerein lies my dilemma. I'd love to find someone with a similar view to myself, but I feel like the odds of finding a girl with a low body count to marry is becoming increasingly low in modern society. As a result, I'm thinking if I also have a storied sexual history I'm less likely to experience retroactive jealousy. In other words, I don't want to feel like a chump who waited around whilst my girlfriend/wife ran through hot guys in her youth.\n\nI guess it at least partially boils down to me having some latent issues with my self-esteem, and worrying that partners with more sexual experience might not find me as physically attractive as they did their past partners. One of the questions I'm trying to figure out is, is it likely that I'm going to be able to fix this insecurity internally without sleeping around? I guess more broadly, do people think it would be a bad idea for me to keep sleeping around? I think I know the answer, but I'm curious to hear additional perspectives.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nTl;Dr Should I sleep around just because I'm worried I'll be jealous of a future partner's high body count - even though I dislike casual sex?",

        "content": "To preface, I (25F) am fully aware that I am also one of the toxic people in this situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. How did I meet this man (45M) in the first place? \n\nI used to model (I was 20F at the time). One of my model friends, Jennifer\\* (20F at the time), wanted to do a trip to NYC for Fashion Week and said she had a friend, Anna\\* (34F at the time), we could stay with who owns a clothing company. In exchange for modeling for Anna's company, we could stay at her & her boyfriend's place. Enter, Anna's boyfriend, Nate\\* (40M at the time). This is who this whole issue is about. Nothing happened the first time we met. Anna and Nate seemed very in love. Another detail: wealth is a character in this whole dilemma. I was expecting to stay at a \"normal\" New York apartment and ended up in a multimillion luxury condo in Manhattan.\n\nI got to know Anna and Nate through staying with them & met up with them in a different city a year later (they both owned property in another city); I learned they were polyamorous. I enjoyed their company and eventually had a threesome with them. It was my idea. \n\nAlso - learned that Nate had a seemingly insatiable sex drive and that he and Anna were hooking up with other girls too. \n\nAfter the threesome, they'd message me occasionally, but we never hooked up again. We reverted to just being friends and I'd meet up with them whenever we were in the same city.\n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer moved to New York and ended up being in a throuple with Anna and Nate and moved in with them. Jennifer mentioned to me that she enjoyed Anna's company, but didn't like Nate and Nate's influence on Anna. Jennifer eventually left that relationship, because she was unhappy.\n\n2. So how did this whole issue occur (the love bombing and manipulation)?\n\nFlash forward to this year. Out of the blue, I get a message from Nate. He wants me to do him a favor: fly his pet from Anna's on the West Coast to his new East Coast home. At this point, I hadn't really talked to Anna or Nate in a long time (other than random texts here and there). I was in a rocky relationship and thought it'd be healthy to leave town for a bit. I didn't mind doing the favor. I made it clear to Nate that I had a boyfriend. I also told my boyfriend at the time (33M), Jake\\*, all the details. To preface, Jake and I lived together and we were in an open relationship that turned into a monogamous one, because of the pandemic. We stopped having sex at some point, as he is on antidepressants and is never in the mood, and he constantly rejected my attempts to initiate sex. At one point, Jake told me that \"sex feels like a chore\" and that he'd rather have me outsource sex & find other men to do his \"chore\", as he does not want to have sex with me.\n\nAnyhow, Jake thought it was weird that someone that wealthy would ask a random woman to do that (Nate could've hired a pet nanny easily), but other that I thought Jake seemed fine about it all. Nate paid for everything (flight from my city to Anna's city and then Anna's city to Nate's city and the return trip, other expenses, etc) and even gave me extra money for helping him with this favor. I was unsure if he was still with Anna, but I never asked Anna what was going on. I asked Jennifer if anything weird is going on between Anna and Nate. Jennifer had no idea, but told me Nate also asked her to transport his pet. She said no. \n\nI get to Nate's city and give him his pet. We had agreed that I'd be staying his his city for a couple of days; it seemed like a fun vacation away from my real life & my problems. He puts me up in a hotel for one night and then moves me over to his home the next day. He makes it clear that he's aware I have a boyfriend and that I'd be sleeping in another room. This puts me at ease. \n\nWe spend 4 days together, chatting and catching up. Nothing sexual happens, but I end up telling him that me and my boyfriend don't have sex anymore. He jokes about my sexual frustration, and he makes me feel safe and taken care of (he covered all our meals, cooked for us, was a really good listener, etc). He mentions that Anna wants a baby, but he doesn't want one, and that he's willing to provide the sperm and pay for the baby, but not take care of it. \n\nI go back home, feeling a little empty inside and missing that feeling of being taken care of and listened to. \n\n5 months later, I'm planning a trip back to Nate's city, because my boyfriend, Jake, invited me on a trip with his friends. I book my flight 2 days earlier than Jake's, because the Friday flights were expensive and I wanted to save money. I tell Nate I'm coming back to his city, because my boyfriend and his friends are doing a trip. He asks me how much my plane tickets were. For some reason, he decides to send me money for my plane tickets and extra as well. I tell him that was unnecessary, but thank him and take the money. Nate asks me if I'm going to stay with him and I ask him if I could stay for 2 days. I fly out to Nate's city 2 days before Jake and let Jake know that I'm staying with Nate. Jake doesn't ask any questions. \n\nNate and I fall into a familiar rhythm; I feel really safe, taken care of, and listened to...except he's flirtier this time. I enjoy the attention, but ignore his advances. We stay in separate bedrooms and he keeps asking about my boyfriend (if I'm happy/sexually satisfied, etc). I tell him my relationship of 2 years is still rocky and that me and Jake still aren't having sex. Nate listens and gives me some life advice. I ask about Anna, and he says she visits him and she has a closet full of her stuff here at his place. Nate also mentions on multiple occasions that Anna is egging him on to seduce me and slaps my ass at some point. At first I'm shocked, but then I realize I'm also turned on. \n\nAfter 2 days, I leave Nate's place to stay at a hotel (in the same city) with Jake and his friends. Jake's behavior keeps triggering and annoying me; our relationship had been rocky for a long time and things erupt. I end up sobbing at brunch in the bathroom and then sobbing in front of all of his friends, but not revealing why I'm so upset. Everyone's concerned about my wellbeing. \n\nI pack my bags from the hotel and end up back at Nate's, still crying. He comforts me and I tell him that his advice really got to me and made me realize how unhappy I am with Jake. Nate tells me I shouldn't listen to him and let him influence me, because he's attracted to me. I text Jake and tell him I am unhappy and want to move out. Nate and I end up having incredible sex; I hadn't had sex in about a year. We had sex six times over the next two days, and I end up head over heels in love with Nate.\n\nI leave Nate's city and go home. The next morning, he sends a sweet message and a few hundred bucks so I could get a nice massage to de-stress. I tell him that's unnecessary, but thank you. Jake asks me if I had sex with Nate. I tell him the truth about everything that's been going on; Jake is understandably upset and heartbroken. Jake tells me that Nate's clearly manipulating me. I find a new apartment and move out. \n\nAt this point, I'm still smitten by Nate. We text and talk about how much chemistry we have and how much we miss each other. He sends me a few grand to help with moving costs and, as usual, I tell him it's unnecessary, but take the money. He reiterates that Anna is 100% supportive of our relationship and that Anna knows how strongly he feels about me; he says that Anna and him are not a couple anymore, but close friends. Nate makes plans for me to come back to his city and sends me more money for plane tickets. He mentions I could stay for a little bit or for forever and to get a one way and play it by ear. We choose a date for me to come back.\n\nI realize I never really talked to Anna this whole time, other than sending a few pictures of Nate's pet to her (Nate actually requested that I send pictures of his pet to Anna). I text Anna to make sure that she's aware of my relationship with Nate and that she's OK with it, and she tells me she's extremely upset. She says she is OK with me having sex with Nate and was OK with our relationship, but she's definitely not OK with getting kicked out of Nate's home. Apparently, Nate decided to kick Anna out of his home when I am coming to town. She said they had an agreement where she'd be able to stay with him whenever she was in his city and that I made it so that she had no place to stay anymore... I told her I had no idea - that I was very sorry, that my behavior was unforgivable, and that I should've checked in with her. I tell her Nate's behavior is concerning and that I will not be visiting Nate anymore. Anna mentions Nate offered to put her up in a hotel after she's \"kicked out\", \"but definitely not a hotel as nice as the Four Seasons, like he did for Sophie\\*, his other girlfriend...\" She also mentions that Nate gaslights her and will blame her for me not coming anymore. She mentions I should still go. I reach out to Jennifer to get more information. Jennifer mentions that Nate was narcissistic and manipulative when they were together; she doesn't trust him. \n\nI am just now seeing all the red flags and the love bombing... the manipulation. I'm aware of my own toxic and unforgivable behavior as well as Nate's. I'm sad that Nate and I hurt Jake and Anna so much, and I know I should've broken things off with Jake much earlier than I did. \n\nHowever, for some reason, I still feel connected to Nate and want to go back to him, even though I know that this is all chaotic and unhealthy. \n\n**How do I move forward and stop obsessing over Nate?** \n\n**How do I put an end to my own toxic, self destructive behavior?**\n\n**TLDR: I (25F) fell for an older polyamorous guy (45M) who was aware I was in a rocky relationship. He love bombed me, seduced me, and then I immediately ended my rocky 2-year relationship, thus breaking my ex's heart. After talking to the older guy's girlfriend (39F - polyamorous) , who is also heartbroken, I finally came to my senses. But I still feel an attachment to this guy. Three people were hurt in this chain of toxic behavior. How do I move forward/stop obsessing over this man/be a better person in the future?**\n\n**\\*names changed for privacy**",

        "content": "Hello, i am what you would describe socially inept. While i had long term friendships, it was hard for me to form new ones, especially with girls. After finishing high school, i started working in my aunts restauran where she worked half-time alongside college. First year of us working together everything was normal, couple of flirts here and there, mostly friendly stuff. In that time i even had my first girlfriend that i met through a shared friend, which didnt work out in the end. One time us two and another friend got drunk and she made some advances on which i was too shy to act upon (still virgin) with our friend being blackout drunk next to us. But after that i started looking at her as potential partner instead of friend. But no matter what i did, everytime after that she rejected me. They were bad attempts in retrospect, not gonna lie, but still, i tried. I would ask her out, she would decline and next day at work be all flirty and nice to me. So id try again and be rejected again and this repeated for good 4 months. As time passed i got bitter and angry for rejecting me and then flirting with me and started sending her bitter messages which she showed to all our friends who didnt want to talk to me anymore and aunt who fired me. They werent threatening messages, but annoying and ill willed, as i perceived her to mentally abuse me so i wanted to do the same to her. I know, i know, im a loser.\n\nSo thats the backstory. One time she told me how she waived at me when we were kids and i ignored her. I honestly dont remeber this and didnt even know she existed until i met her in restaurant. She also told me that she was mad at me for not inviting her to the birthday party at which i hooked up with first gf, i didnt wanted to hurt her feeling as i wanted my ex at that time as i felt more connection with her, in the end i fucked up as i had more connection with her then with ex but young, dumb and stuff.\n\nAnyway, my question is, was this some twisted way of revenge for ignoring her even though i eventually realized shes a great girl and wanted to be with her, or did i just blew my chance to be with her and still thinking about it 4 years later? Shes moved on and has a boyfriend, i have a girlfriend but i cant help myself and regularly think about her. Im afraid ill never love someone as her. \n\nTl;dr: Still thinking about girl with who it didnt work out, i need help with forgetting her and moving on, im trying for 4 years and cant do it",

Due to the nature of our job, we pretty much spend the whole day just the two of us.\n\nHe's not just physically attractive but he's funny, kind, patient, and understanding. I've had a crush on him from the moment I met him a month ago. Pretty much everyone in the store (including our managers) 'ship' us.\n\nThe only problems are: We were both pretty vocal about not wanting to date a coworker (due to negative past experiences.) But I think that he used to have feelings for me too based on some stuff he's said. This made me nervous, especially because I really like him but was afraid to say anything. I purposefully started distancing myself, I started talking to a really cute guy (17m) from my high school. I ended up telling my coworker that this guy and I had spent all of New Year's Eve together and that I \"really liked\" the guy. I think I hurt my coworker's feelings. Since then he's been much colder and more professional compared to when we first met. Today, he asked me if me and the guy were still talking. \n\nAnother problem is that I have pretty much no feelings anymore for the guy I'm talking to. At first it started out great, but we haven't seen each other for over a week due to him getting COVID, and tbh I don't miss him.  Also, I turn 19 a month before he turns 18, which I REALLY don't like. \n\nI messaged my coworker on instagram tonight (sent him a work meme) and he never responded.

I lured him in with my on campus mailbox and hot chocolate and it has been great ever since. We both really click and have been talking pretty seriously about what we want our life to look like. I have a few things that I need help with though. \n\n1. He graduated last year as an Army Officer and is now stationed at a base only 3 hours away from me. He is going to be sent to Georgia in a year and we both have been talking and planning on me going with him to Georgia for the 2 ish years he should be there. My mother thinks we should be married before moving halfway across the country together. Opinions?\n\n2. I have a lot of household items: washer and dryer, couches, practically a full kitchen, 2 queen beds and more that were left to me by my grandparents. He recently got a place near his base and needs a washer and dryer and I offered to let him take mine. He did not ask, at the time he didn\u2019t know I even had the storage unit full of stuff, again my mom doesn\u2019t think it is a good idea since we are not married. I understand her concerns but I know he would return it if I asked. It would also be helpful to have it there since the Army pays movers when ever they send someone to a different base so I wouldn\u2019t have to find a way to haul it hundreds of miles. \n\n3. I don\u2019t know if our dogs will get along. I have a 6 yr old 110 lbs Akita mix and he has an older chihuahua. My dog is semi dog aggressive but that is mostly with larger dogs because he is very protective, he also loves puppies and young dogs. He gets along great with my mom\u2019s dogs and we were able to introduce him to my aunt\u2019s lab. But I\u2019m worried that since his dog is older and kinda a grump that he will snap at the big dog and when mine snaps back one is going to get hurt. \n\n4. How do I bring up the topic of taking the next step and getting engaged, not that it has to be any time soon, but just for us both to think about and to be on the same page?\n\nTl;dr My bf and I are planning a future together, and my mom thinks we need to plan on getting married before even living together",

He is in pretty good shape and works out every day. Meanwhile, I have a chronic health condition that causes exercise intolerance. I have always been on the bigger side but in the last 6 months have gained around 15 pounds which officially put me from the upper end of the \u201chealthy\u201d BMI spectrum to \u201coverweight.\u201d \n\nI work full time in an industry that is very seasonal and gets slower during the winter months. As such, I\u2019ve recently had a lot of downtime while working from home. I recently downloaded an exercise app that helps with low-impact 5-10 minute workouts I can do in my free time. When I mentioned this to him, he seemed really excited and started suggesting more things I can do, talking about physical activities we can do together on dates, etc. He then started talking about how hot I was going to start looking and what a great looking couple we would be. \n\nGranted, I was hoping that doing small exercises throughout the day might help me lose some of this extra weight, but the main reason is that a family member with unhealthy habits is suffering from Long COVID. Seeing how much more transmissible it seems to be, I figure that I\u2019ll end up getting COVID at some point and want to reduce the chance of complications. \n\nAnyway, it\u2019s been over a week now and we haven\u2019t been intimate. I just can\u2019t help but feeling like he doesn\u2019t find me attractive and wishes I looked more like his exes (all petite athletic blonde girls). I know that I\u2019m generally an insecure over-thinker, but am I overreacting? We\u2019ve never argued before and I don\u2019t want to start a fight over what was intended to be supportive. \n\nTLDR: When I mentioned that I started working out, boyfriend seemed overly excited about me maybe losing weight.",

        "content": "TLDR: I ended things because life was going to shit. Moved in with this ex because economy. I still love him and want to get back together. \n\nI F(25) ended things with my ex M(26) in early October. Things were basically going to shit for me - I was extremely overworked (80+ hours a week regularly) and underpaid ($12/hr. for a position requiring a bachelor's degree) in an emotionally exhausting field (inpatient drug rehab) and the burnout/compassion fatigue was too much for me to have anything left over to give to myself or my partner who at the time was also struggling with a major depressive episode. \n\nI also hadn't been on my medication (bp2) for the majority of the relationship due to a 13 month long waitlist at community mental health but was (and still am) actively working on trauma with both my therapist and sponsor (approximately 5 years clean). The icing on the shit cake was a major and necessary car repair that put me two months behind on rent, and dropping out of school because I couldn't afford to replace the required technology that coincidentally also went to shit during all of this and mentally couldn't keep up with the course load due to burnout. \n\nWhen my partner reached out to me for support, I quite literally had zero emotional space left for his stuff on top of my stuff and my client's stuff and told him I couldn't deal with it and that I was tired of suggesting therapy with no initiative on his part (I still think therapy is a good idea, though I could have been more gentle in this suggestion and he wasn't open to it). At the time we lived about an hour away from each other and he said that he didn't feel like making the trip up here so often was good for his mental health. My abandonment fears kicked in and I broke it off - \"before he could\" - is what my defense mechanisms figured. \n\nFast forward a bit...\n\nAfter about a month of no contact, we start talking again, decide to try being friends and go out to see Dune (no funny business) and have a conversation to clear the air about our breakup and where we are now. He says he would be open to FWB (I immediately said that I'm not open to that, because I'm not) but that it would take a while for him to consider ever getting back together. I tell him that I never do the break-up/make-up dance (I don't. In fact, I've never even tried to maintain contact with an ex before) and that when it's done, it's done for me. We discuss our boundaries moving forward and all seems well and good. \n\nI get back on my medication and it's a world of difference especially when it comes to impulse control, sleep regulation, and generally having a more positive outlook, even personal hygiene is easier. I get a new job where I choose my hours, work half as much (40 hours MAX), and more than doubled my income in a field where I still get to help people.\n\nHe closes on and moves into a house he bought here in my city and my apartment lease is almost over. We had talked about moving in together before we broke up  purely out of economic logistics and the fact that he still works an hour away and would like someone to keep an eye on the house. I'm still sick of slumming it in my apartment complex and finally have an out with the lease. We talk it over and decide I'll move into one of the bedrooms at the house.\n\nWho wouldn't want their ex boyfriend as their new landlord? \n\nSo I move on in. And honestly, it's been amazing. I don't think I would have had the guts to do it while in a romantic relationship with him (plot twist, the commitment issues are just abandonment issues in disguise). I have so much fun with him when he is here and I still get my space when he is out of town for work, plus having my own bedroom is perfect. \n\nBad news is I think I fucked up. \n\nThe other day, I accidentally called him babe (to be fair a literal door was falling over during home repairs and my brain short circuited thanks to the urgency of the situation). It was really awkward and then neither of us discussed it ever again for which I am semi grateful for. \n\nBut that's not the main fuck up, the main fuck up was making a run for it when things got tough instead of trying to weather the storm (which did pass). So now I still have feelings for him. Our breakup wasn't an \"I dont love you anymore\" situation, it was more of a \"I dont have room for one more pea on this plate\" situation and I think it really hurt both of us to end things. I find myself really wanting to snuggle up to him or tell him I love him when we hang out. I want to hold his hand and kiss him and play with his hair. The idea of him moving on with his life without me eventually makes me super sad and as far as I know neither of us have been seeing anyone else (I haven't made an attempt to, I don't know if he is searching but there's boundaries in place about bringing hookups back to the house etc.)\n\nI feel like garbage that I wasn't there for him when he needed me to be (but also realize that my circumstances were less than stellar at the time too). I'm worried that if we got back together and things went south again, we wouldn't make it. I don't worry about this truly fucking up living situation either way outside of maybe making breakfast uncomfortable because frankly this person has been so consistently kindhearted and gentle with me I genuinely trust that he wouldn't spite me like that. I think that freaked me out when I was with him as well: this was my first truly healthy romantic relationship and for some reason that made me panic. I think it's because I've felt like he probably deserves better than me. \n\nAnyways, he's working out of town until next Friday and while one solid option would be shoving these feelings into a jar and putting that jar on top of a hard to reach shelf where it will be ignored and left to gather dust until it is completely hopefully forgotten about, I also want to tell him how I feel when he returns to find out if there is ever a possibility of us getting back together. \n\nMost importantly, I don't want to be the kind of fucking asshole who jerks his feelings around and I want to feel sure about mine before I even say anything. \n\nI don't even know if there is a question to this post or if it was just a vent but I am open to feedback.",

He often falls asleep watching TV on the couch then when I suggest going to bed he will suddenly be wide awake.  I have tried getting him to listen to podcast while falling asleep and I am okay with having a light on (we bought a galaxy pattern LED lamp so it's a bit more than a night light).  These have worked with some success and although I prefer to sleep in silence and darkness I can adjust to the light and sound and have slept pretty well with it before.  It really bothers me when he sleeps on the couch as it makes me feel disconnected.  I don't mind if he comes to bed later than me but if he falls asleep hard on the couch he's too tired to come to our room (which is steps away).  He knows I don't like when he sleeps on the couch so he will agree to come to bed but I know he's not happy about it. He has a very \"don't rock the boat\" personality so he doesn't really say much. I feel like I've really put in a lot of effort to find solutions and it seems like it's not working. I don't really want to have a TV in the bedroom as I don't think that's really good for the brain but I want him to be happy and sleep well.  He has ADHD and probably sleep apnea (did the at home test stuff but the office never got back to us) so I'm sure this plays into it a bit.  Should we put a TV in the bedroom? Should I urge my bf to work on his sleep training? I dont want to be overbearing, I just want to sleep in the same bed. \n\nTLDR; My boyfriend can't sleep without the TV which is in the livingroom and I don't like sleeping without him.",

        "content": "I am lost.  And I want to understand if there is someone else's fault in this situation, and what should I do with my relationship.\n This is a long post and a long story.  I tried to mention here only the most basic and important in my subjective opinion.\n I am lost.  I do not understand what is happening and what I should do. I(22M) have been dating my girlfriend(21F) for 5 years.\n I want to try to express my feelings and possibly get a look from the outside.  I think this one can help, When I turn to a specialist about this, But so far I have no way to do it.\n It's hard to start with something specific.  I think the most difficult thing that still affects me is the situation with my close friend.  At school, I was in love with a girl with whom we later became best friends.  I had no love thoughts, she had a boyfriend and we were just great friends.  And I started dating my girlfriend.  After about a year of relationship, I told her that before the dream liked my friend.  And my girlfriends told me to completely break the relationship with my friend.  Despite the fact that my friend went to study in another city, which is far from mine.  I was told to just block her on all social networks.  That's exactly what I did.  After which my friend tried to contact me, and I answered her and tried to explain the situation.  And in the course of this correspondence, I wrote something like \"if my girlfriend finds out that we corresponded I will not be good.\"  My girlfriend found this correspondence, read it, and during the scandal because of this, she put a black eye in the dream.  I didn't talk to my girlfriend anymore.\n A few months after that, she told me to remove all the girls from my friends and unsubscribe from them on all social networks.  I did this and in my dream I had to change my Facebook account, because my acquaintances girls started asking why I removed them from my friends.\n After some time she asked what to change cheating. I replied that I did not think about it and that I probably consider sex cheating and possibly kissing on the lips.  And she wrote to me that she considers physical contact with other girls and communication with them a betrayal.\n This happened in about the first year and a half of the relationship.\n Around her third year, she said she wanted to try an open relationship.  I didn't mind, but I was confused.\n After a while, one seemed to change her mind.  And after some time, she admitted that she had sex with a guy at the beginning of our relationship.  One strongly apologized.  She said that she did not think that our relationship would be serious and therefore did it.\n After that, we lived relatively calmly and there were only quarrels over household trifles when we began to live together.\n We have been living together for 2 years.  It always seemed to me that she might react too harshly to little things, but nothing can be done about it.\n In general, when I don\u2019t do something around the house, or don\u2019t do it completely, or at the wrong time.  Or when I am stuck on a date or a holiday, then I can fly all my things.  Once she doused all my things with water, crumbled on them the cupcakes and sweets that I bought for her on March 8, and broke a vase into this mixture.  Then she wrote to my mom with a request to take me home.  My mother called me, she decided that I could get drunk and do something bad, but the reason for all this was that instead of having a holiday with a girl, I went to work in the middle of the day, choosing a schedule that was inconvenient for my girlfriend.\n In general, all this does not give me rest.  I understand that I am to blame for many things in our relationship.  I hardly give her any nice little things or gifts.  I don't go on dates.  And this is also a shame for her, and because of that there was no concert period in our relationship.  And just as I am bad at household trifles.  And for her it is very, very important, especially since we live in her house.\n In the end, I feel like a bad guy who fucks at everything, but at the same time I feel like a victim.  I can say I'm afraid of her.  And I don't know if I want to continue the relationship.  Simply, I understood that I was guilty in front of her in some things.  But at the same time, all these old cases put pressure on me.  I have no friends left after the incident with the change of the page of tv fesbuk.  Well, that is, I still communicate with 2 guys, but the last time I got along with one of them was a year ago, and I haven't seen the other for 2 years.  And I feel very lonely about it.\n I don\u2019t feel comfortable talking about what\u2019s going on in my life.  And when I talked with friends earlier, the soybean girl said that I had no right to tell my friends about her problems.  I think she\u2019s right, and I just didn\u2019t know and I don\u2019t know where the line passes after which you don\u2019t just share your feelings, but start talking about strangers.  The situation is such that I think once, When I was still talking with friends, I told them that my girlfriend was blackmailing me with suicide.  I'm not sure exactly how I said it, but they once mentioned it in our private chat and she read it.  She sometimes reads my social networks.\n In general, I do not know if I want to continue the relationship.  I don\u2019t understand if I have a moral right to actually feel like a victim, because I myself hurt her.  And how can I even be in such a situation.  Maybe we're just fundamentally different in our outlook on life, or maybe I'm just an asshole.  I didn't get to understand.\n And now I can start hysterics with myself from almost any little thing.  Liuo start crying just thinking about our relationship.  And when I'm hysterical, I often beat myself or just sometimes scream.  But this does not always happen with her.  Sometimes I do it alone at home.  Although before I have always been very calm and this was even noticed by my friends and colleagues at work.\n Something like that.  I don't know if you have any advice, but thanks for reading to the end.  I want to see a psychologist to understand the situation, but right now I do not have the financial ability, so I wanted to do something short squeeze about my feelings and relationships.  I cannot write in my personal diary, so that she had already read it once.  And here she will definitely not find it and I might get some advice.\n Thank you for your attention\n\n TLDR: my girlfriend and I have done a lot of weird and bad things to each other and I don\u2019t know if I want to continue the relationship and should I do it.  I feel like a bad guy and a victim at the same time, so I don't know what to do.",

        "content": "Hello Reddit,\n\nTA for obvious reasons.\nI'm a 27M and our relationship is almost 2 years old.\nMy girlfriend is 26 yo and currently doing her PhD.\nHere's the deal. She's BY FAR the most intelligent woman I've ever known. We can talk just about anything, anytime in great depth. She's curious about the world so she can catch up in any topic real quick. We never fight because we can solve our problems by calm arguments. The problem is, we don't have anything else in our relationship although we've talked about the following problems countless times but we made no changes or some things can not be changed.\n- we don't have anything in common. No hobbies, no interests. She's into biology, academic studies, books and series. I'm into sports (like climbing, via ferrata, CrossFit and hiking), business, finances, tech and psychology.\n- she's into kids and creating a family sometime later, I'm not. I don't even want to get married.\n- we can't agree on date ideas because our needs are very different. She wants to chill, I want to go and do some active stuff. That means we NEVER go on dates.\nWe tried to but haven't enjoyed each other's interests that much ( or at all).\n- we have sex like once a month at best. When we do it's awesome (she has an orgasm, shaking, etc so really enjoys it)\n- she doesn't have any goals and doesn't know what to do after finishing her studies. I always have clear goals which I pursue day-by-day and I'm quite serious about them. Sometimes she's in awe because of my drive sometimes she hates it because I tend to focus on them instead of her.\n- I always want to get to know new people, she literally hates everyone. That's why we never go to any parties or social events. We literally live our lives between the walls.\n- she's getting overweight and doesn't want to change it. It really disturbs me because she only needs to became a bit more healthy and leave binge eating chips on the evenings and maybe go on walks a couple times per week.\n- I pay for everything, she never had put any money into the relationship because she has none. She doesn't want to work because of her studies but she has a lot of free time to watch Netflix. She said don't worry about it, she'll work after finishing the uni. (But she doesn't even know what she'll work with her diplomas)\n\nIt may seem that I blame her for everything but it's not the case. I'm selfish because I put my business, my employees and my mentorees , even my main sports (climbing and strength training) before her.\nI may be superficial because of her weight. I know it sounds stupid but in my previous relationships I didn't even wanted to look at other girls because I was in awe of that partners beauty and body. It was never the case with her. I haven't been THAT attracted to her ever.\nI know I should put more effort into the relationship but I don't see the reason and the goal. I don't know how these things could change because we can really talk about random stuff but we are bad at solving real problems by communication.\n\nI've seen my dad going through 2 divorces and losing every asset he had and worked really hard for. I don't want to do the same, hence I don't want to put a ring on her.\nI want to build something that lasts, help as many people as I can and enjoy the journey of life in the best possible way I can. I'm not sure if we are wasting each other's time or the mental and physical support we give each other is worth saving for a lifetime. I never had these problems before and I don't know what to do. It's like having something mediocre but I want to chase the best possible option which may not exist at all.

He lives in another country for work and is very unhappy there and I\u2019m having my own struggles in my grad program. \n\n\nThings were going really well until this august. He came to visit for a month and we travelled around and met my friends etc. One night I told him I didn\u2019t want to wear lingerie and he got upset with me saying that it\u2019s the one thing he really likes in bed and that I\u2019m ignoring his needs. Lingerie makes me uncomfortable but I wear it sometimes for him. That spiraled into me not being exciting enough and not planning more things for his trip. He also made constant comments about my being unfit and unhealthy. I was food restricted as a child and the pandemic has made it hard to do exercise that I enjoy, but I\u2019ve gained no weight since we started dating and I\u2019m pretty skinny. These things started to pick away at my self-esteem. \n\n\nWhen he came to visit for Christmas things got worse. Again, he went off on me for ignoring his needs when I said I didn\u2019t want to have sex for the second time that day because I didn\u2019t feel well. It was hard to have sex for a lot of the trip because my brother stayed home due to covid. He was also frustrated that I didn\u2019t want to do more things but I was uncomfortable because of the case numbers - we did plenty regardless of my discomfort. I really tried my best to make him happy despite the circumstances and it was a lot of pressure on me. \n\nWhen he got home he said that he was losing attraction to me because  that I wasn\u2019t adventurous and healthy enough and he wasn\u2019t fulfilled sexually. I\u2019m trying to address these but I can\u2019t help but feel embarrassed. It\u2019s really wearing on my self esteem.

It was my 1st real relationship.\n\nI was a very introverted and socially awkward person up until I got to college. I met her in college and we instantly hit it off. It was very obvious that we liked each other and we're always seen together.\nBut during the \"talking phase\" (before asking her out officially) she got really close to this other guy in college. We were all part of the same friends group. This guy was very extroverted and too flirty with many girls. He became very close to my girlfriend on the grounds that he liked her bestfriend and needed her help to woo the bestfriend.\n\n1. They would talk to each other in very flirty ways often blushing, calling almost every day, continuously texting and sending snaps to each other. \n2. I even saw them sending  \"\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf51\" emojis to each other and laughing about it later. \n3. They would hug each other in intimate ways while posing for pictures as well. \n4. She would call him by nicknames and even saved it as his contact in her phone.\n5.  She sat on his lap once because there were too many people in the car and there was no space (which is true and she had no other option but still)\n6. He purposely held her hands once, called her \"hot\" and asked if I was getting jealous\n\nAll of this made me feel extremely uncomfortable, insecure, jealous and I went crazy. I became very clingy and needy. \nAs most of this happened during the \" talking phase\" I didn't know how to tell her any of this.\n\nI asked her out eventually and we dated for 2 years. But those 2 years were filled with me being very insecure, anxious, clingy.\nAll of this really affected me and my thoughts, to the point where I had to break up to gain some mental peace.\n\n\nI confronted her about how I felt about a year later and she denied having any feelings towards him. She also said that being so close to other guys was common in her other friend groups and she had seen it happen with other girl bestfriends and maybe I was being too insecure. Their \"closeness\" did decrease eventually but they remained \"good friends\".\n\nReflecting on all this after the break-up really makes me question myself.\nWas I justified in feeling what I did or was being too insecure? Yes we did have a lovely realtionship and I was happy, but insecurities would always be at the back of my head.\nShould I have pursued her inspite of all that, or seen all that as a red flag and stopped during the \"talking phase\" itself?\n\nI don't wanna go through any of this ever again, and makes me fearful of dating again.\nI wanna feel secure in a relationship.\n\nI know this is too long but please help a brother out, going crazy during quarantine!\n\nTldr; Ex girlfriend's actions during start of relationship made me insecure and clingy.

We then became friends with Sophia when we were in 8th grade. There were some issues between me and Sophia during that time due to miscommunications. We then became very close with Lily. \n\nOver the span of about 4 years, I had forgiven everything Sophia had done to me, however she held a grudge against me. She then proceeded to bully me for weeks, cursing at me both in front of me and behind my back, in group chats and social media (we didn\u2019t meet due to covid). This was during 12th grade. To me it seemed very immature. But it hurt a lot considering we were friends for some time and she knew me very well, ending up with me crying myself to sleep for days. Despite this, Emma and Lily stayed close friends with Sophia, choosing not to choose a side due to being friends with both of us for several years. At this point, Lily actually tried talking to me, telling me she understood my side of things and saying that when she goes to university in another country, she would no longer stay close friends with Sophia due to her being closer to me (in her own words). In the end, I chose to try to apologise for everything as sincerely as I could, to try to relieve everyone from this drama. Sophia did begrudgingly apologise as well, in a very rude and angry tone. After this I decided to just leave her be and she did the same to me. \n\nHowever, my friendship with Emma and Lily changed dramatically. They started hanging out with Sophia and another girl, leaving me out and never inviting me, with the excuse of not wanting me and Sophia in the same hangout. When we planned hangouts without Sophia, it never ended up happening due to one of them being busy with something. They almost never started a conversation with me about anything anymore and we ended up not talking unless I started it after some time. \n\nIn the end, I stopped trying and they stopped talking to me completely. My boyfriend says I should think carefully about this since we have been friends for years. However, I do not feel like this is a friendship that I want to invest a lot of time and effort into since they decided to be friends with people who decide to stay friends with someone who bullied me.

We both work as engineers in  at a household name company, and since I have met him I have started to  drastically lose self confidence in every aspect of my life. Except I  know that he isn't inciting any of this, I'm bringing it all upon  myself.\n\nBefore I met him, I was  secure. I felt that I had the ability to be pretty, witty, talented, and  intelligent. But since I met him, I have begun to doubt all of that.  While we hold the same job in engineering, we have very different  interests. He likes finance and economics while I like arts and culture.  I used to spend all my free time pursuing creative hobbies, but now I  see them as frivolous and embarrassing. I recognize cultivating a better  understanding of his interests helps me, but I'm dampening my own  creativity. I no longer have the confidence or productive urge to work  on my portfolio, to write, or do networking. (Part of this is because  he's translated his interests into huge financial returns, while I have  made far less in comparison.)\n\nOn  the topic of beauty--I don't think he thinks of me as anything but a  friend, but he has lot of pretty female friends for best friends, so for  some reason I have started to reevaluate my old photos with a  vengeance. I had an ugly phase for sure in my life, so it's starting to  get to me again. I'm not as skinny or pretty as his friends, so I've  started to run and take ballet again and look at myself with more  dysmorphia (a problem I used to have).\n\nI'm  also not as naturally talented as he is at our job, even though I am  able to be just as competent. But I feel as though I am less proactive  and more muted in the workplace when he's around, because I become  shier, afraid of looking stupid. This is a huge problem. :(\n\nAll  of these are unhealthy red flags for me (not of him, but of a potential  relationship--he said he would be interested in feeling it out.) I feel  a compounded sadness when I remember that in my last relationship,  which ended last spring, I never felt any of these insecurities. I had a  wonderful boyfriend who made me feel beautiful when I felt ugly and  really treasured me. We broke up due to long distance.\n\nI  recognize that what I have with this coworker is an attraction and that  these fixations I'm having are not healthy. My New Year's resolution  was to cut this shit out and to remember that my self-worth can only be  determined by myself.\n\n....but I'm  still affected when I open up my creative work and feel as though it has  been stupid all along. So I'm letting it out on the Internet. What more  can I do beyond trying to change my mindset?\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr; I'm hurting myself as I crush on someone, and losing confidence in my creativity, attractiveness, and work life",

        "content": "Been in a relationship for 4 years. We both value and respect eachother. We travel together, share adventures together and truth eachother when it comes to serious stuff. All in all it is a healthy relationship in most areas.\n\nThe re-occuring issue is the age old tale where she requires more attention and words of affirmation. This does not come natural to me, but we have discussed this extensively and she acknowledges that I am better at fulfilling her needs in both those areas.\n\nHowever every now and then she will go distant and slowly build up a wall if I do not constantly fulfill those two areas. I will have to fight to get her back and 're-prove' my love. FYI in addition to attention and words we both constantly listen to eachother, share stories, joke with eachother and share a good physical relationship so it isn't like we are lacking. But because words and attention hold so much weight for her they can destabilise everything. I am unsure if I can provide what she needs to the standard she wants.\n\nAnother reason we clash is when she is upset and I don't give her the response she wants. For the last year or so I have tried to listen more and avoid providing solutions till later. It's not always easy because it's not natural to me, but I am conscious of trying to do this for her sake.\n\nLastly, we tend to fallout now because when she calls me out in what to her feels like a minor thing I get defensive and triggered because I find that she could have discussed the matter with me earlier and / or found a way to explain something to me instead of 'telling me' off. I am aware this third issue is more to do with me and how I am framing her critiques of me as attacks.\n\nAn example of this, is when planning an event together I wanted to save costs whereas she wanted to preserve the vision of the event. She got frustrated and called me out for it. I would have preferred if she would have just mentioned that it was bothering her earlier and worked with me to find a compromise (I would have probably just spent the extra money anyway, because this event was more a big deal for her than me). I understand I can't change how people behave, but what ticked me off was that when I got upset at her because she got upset at me she got pissed because she feels she has to try cheer me up when she is supposed to have her time to be frustrated and whatnot.\n\nWe've spoken about this extensively and done therapy etc. and whilst we have seen some improvements I don't see this every fully being resolved.\n\nI get extremely drained and depressed everytime this happened. It takes a toll on her too in the moment, but she rebounds quicklly. I don't. We eventually communicate and makeup and try to create some plans to avoid further conflict, but the patterns repeats itself.\n\nThe reason we haven't ended it all is because we think the positives of the relationship outweigh the negatives. But the emotional toll on our mental health and now physical health due to constant emotional disconnects is becoming quite problematic.\n\nShould we keep working to be better or is this destined for failure?\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR; : Is it unhealthy to be a in relationship where I M (27) am constantly falling out over reoccuring issues with my partner F (27)?\\*\\*",

We aren\u2019t best friends cause we\u2019re not of the same gender but after that, we\u2019re extremely close (I\u2019m like her 3rd closest friend but the only guy (other than a gay guy) that she\u2019s very close to).  We have been friends for over a year but got really close this year.  She was booted from her friend group and I was always there for her making sure she was ok.  I knew she was dating someone and then they broke up in August. She tells me everything about it and considers me an \u201cextremely safe friend\u201d.  She has told me how great of a person I am as well. I know every little detail from her getting cheated on and from her home life (like she was scared to hangout with her friends from home cause they\u2019re friends with her ex).  I just developed a crush on her recently and do not know what to do.  She recently told me that she thinks that guys are only friends with her to get something more from her.  I do not want her to think that because that was not the reason we became friends. I also know she has zero interest in me cause I\u2019m so deep in her \u201cfriend zone\u201d and she tells me about her crushes.  She also told me that she doesn\u2019t want to date someone until she is completely over her ex and she obviously is not rn. She has zero idea that I like her atm.  But my thoughts of her are obsessive and taking over my life.  I really don\u2019t want to ruin the friendship because I love her and she loves me (in a non romantic/sexual way).  I know she would freak out in a bad way if I told that I liked her because she would think I got really close to her and then told her (I know her too well).  I don\u2019t know what to do.  It\u2019s really hard to get over someone without getting \u201crejected\u201d and I don\u2019t want to cut communication cause that\u2019s not fair to her.  What should I do?\n\nTLDR: Crush on a best friend, who I just became a close friend with.  What do I do?",

        "title": "Need advice on moving out that will help my mental health.",
        "content": "I've (M21) been planning on moving out of my parent's house for a long time already, and this year I was about to because I have my own source of income but I'm still worried it wont still be enough for me to suffice myself throughout college (my college has free tuition so I don't have to worry about that and I only have 1 and a half year already left before I graduate), but I'm still worried that I'll just breakeven on my rent and will not be a smart idea.\n\nThe thing is why I want to move out because I'm worried of my mental health while living in this environment with my parents, I love my parents, I'm deeply grateful for them remembering all the good things that they have done for me all throughout my life, but no matter what I do the bad just outweighs the good in terms of the living environment. I was going to just endure it until I graduate college since its only 1 and a half year more, but recently I opened up something and just really couldn't handle it anymore. \n\nI opened up to my parents about me not wanting to be a roman catholic anymore, and idk how to explain it but they despised what I opened up to them since they're die hard christians, they told me I was just out of my mind and I was disrespecting them because what will our other relatives think that I'm the only one in our family that don't want to join in any religious roman catholic gatherings. And they even told me that some person they know tried changing their religion from a catholic to something else and died at an early age, which they think was a \"curse\" (idk the exact term that translates the word in our dialect but that's the closest one I can think of) and even said that the person who changed his/her religion didn't deserve to be in a catholic funeral home to begin with. This is just what I hate the most about some christians I know and especially my parents is that they're so entitled to everything, and they think they're only religion is the only acceptable religion. I just want to be religion free atm to give me time to decide what's best for me or be an agnostic person which is really my preferred choice.  \n\n\nAnd the thing that really ticked me off is because it is my human right to choose my own religion, and I told them that, and I know I should stand my ground on that one and they just kept on telling me that I was disrespecting them especially to our relatives. It just makes me furious because why would they strip me of my own human rights, if they think that stripping me away of my human rights is a form of respecting them, and dad told me as long as you're in my house you'll just listen to me and I'll decide for you. Really made me think that I need to get out of this place asap. My own understanding why my dad is acting like this, its because of daddy issues. His dad, my grandfather was pretty well for being extremely strict, and he's dragging me down with it, I would understand if it was reasonable kind of strict, but it isn't. He just wants me to follow them blindly. And I'm the kind of person who hates that, I want facts, to prove your claim. And I'm also afraid that living in this environment will affect my studies. Ever since I was a kid our home were never really that kind of place that you can study well and be at peace. Especially in this pandemic because we're still not able to have face to face classes in our country.  \n\n\nI decided to just move out because I just don't have the energy to keep on explaining to them and my dad has this issue that every time you fail at something he shouts at you and it has traumatized me for years that I couldn't do something new because I'm afraid I'll fail, but at this age of mine I need a lot of experience, I need to fail to learn. I just don't want to argue with them about it and just leave because I kind of can't talk explain to them properly even though my arguments are valid and are already in my head, but I just couldn't, every time I'm in that position and I know I should defend myself, I just freeze, and my eyes, idk if its because of trauma or there's just something wrong with my eye, I kind of get teary eyes so easily especially when having an argument with my parents up until now and I'm not proud of it. I just can't help myself, that's why I can't properly convey what my stand is to my parents and just choose to leave. I love them to bits, but I think staying here will only worsen my relationship with them. What would be the most reasonable thing to do here if you were in my position???\n\n\nTL;DR: Planning on moving out of my parents house because of their dictatorship like traits and because it affects my mental health. and my studies.  \n\n\nYou don't need to give advice, any encouraging or discouraging thoughts is welcome, and I'm sorry if my english is not that good its not my first language.\n\nEdit: Suggesting side hustles will help a lot too!",

        "content": "So I had a relationship with a girl. We became friends in 2015 and I slowly fell in love with her. We are both bipolar and during the summer of 2017 I confessed my feelings to her. She said she felt loved and we each chose a couple song for us. I chose Company by Justin Beiber and she chose a Lana Del Rey song. Those two weeks we dated were the happiest days of my life. I'll always be grateful to God for just giving me one fortnight where she loved me back.\n\nOne night out of the blue she texted me saying she was having dinner with her boyfriend. I was too shocked to reply. I ghosted her for a while but she's like a magnet for me and I was quickly pulled back into her sphere. I pretended I was OK with her new relationship and didn't ask her why she abandoned what we had. Her boyfriend turned out to be a crazy person with serous anger issues. He threatened to shoot her mother and they broke up. She texted me one day saying she was pregnant. What could I do? She was my friend before anything else so I did my best to support her and I started to send her money so she could get buy things she needed. Even though she broke my heart I'll never regret sending her money when she needed it. \n\nBut of course during this whole time I was still in love with her. Every text was painful to read because I knew she no longer felt the same way. So I would ghost her every few months to recover from the emotional pain of unrequited love. \n\nEventually my best friend and I had a massive fight about her and I ended up blocking her on all social media. I thought I fell out of love with her but I still haven't healed despite two years passing.  But every now and then I still cry about her and certain songs I can't listen to without breaking down. A certain song called 'September' by Roy Blair I always weep when I listen to it. That's the month she was born. I honestly don't think I'll ever move on. I tried dating but it was all meaningless because I compare everyone to her and they don't measure up. I don't know what to do anymore.\n\n\nTLDR; Can't move on from a girl in my past.

        "content": "TLDR: I can\u2019t really provide a TLDR to be honest, I have to tell the full thing to explain the situation properly.\n\nI\u2019m (22m) a overthinker and I have severe anxiety. I\u2019ve been talking to this lass (21f) for about a month now who has pretty bad depression which I feel is important to note.\n\nI am 100% sure she liked me the first 2 weeks of when I started talking to her. The first week we was talking, we was going out together all the time, every 2 days we would do something. The first get together we had she was playing with her hair while looking at me, she was staring at me, laughing at every joke I made even if it was a shit joke. The year before she even hit me up out of the blue and wanted to go for drinks and a chat.\n\nThe last time I went out with her we went for a night out on Boxing Day with her family. Her family loves me and the whole time was great and at the end we ended up spooning and hugging each other. Definitely in the way that friends wouldn\u2019t do. It definitely felt like she wanted something more or it was progressing very close to that point.\n\nThen I caught covid the day after, we was just about to go out and do something as well. Ever since then I feel like things have changed and we\u2019ve not done something together ever since Boxing Day, the text conversations are still the same though like she will always initiate conversations and ask how I\u2019m feeling. \n\nThe thing that has made me start feeling really confused is when she agreed to the plans we made of hanging out round at her house but then she seemed to forget about it. The same day after agreeing to plans she also posted on her Snapchat story picture of a tinder conversation with some guy. Then at 3am in the morning she sends me message replying to my story saying I\u2019m looking sexy and then another after that asking me to come spoon with her. In the morning, she sorta acts like it didn\u2019t happen. That was 3 days ago I think.\n\nI really want something more with her but atm I feel like she\u2019s just using me as emotional support or a friend she\u2019s unsure about. If she does wants to be just friends then I will need to distance myself a little from her because atm the current situation is unhealthy to my mind as I\u2019m always feeling confused . one minute I\u2019m really attached to her and then other confused and upset in a way she might not feel the same way I do about her. I\u2019m not saying I will cut her off, I will still be friends, il just have to not talk as much so I don\u2019t feel attached to her. \n\nI really wish things do get better because I do really like her, I don\u2019t think il find another lass like her. My experience with lasses has always been bad as well I\u2019ve talked to lasses but things would always lead to the friendzone. The experience of talking and being with this lass is the first time in my life I\u2019ve experienced. I really want this to workout because tinder is always a horrible depressing experience for me, my severe anxiety gets in the way of meeting and talking to new people and the situations I\u2019m in is really hard to meet new people anyway. I\u2019m proud of who I am and how I look but being bald I know is a thing a lot of lasses at my age will feel put off by. I just feel like these factors will mean that it will be a long long time before I meet another lass and I really don\u2019t want to spend more time waiting or looking, I\u2019m sick of it. I\u2019m not bothered about sex, Ive always just wanted a gf and to feel love as cringe as it sounds.",

I have pictures/screenshots of 95% of what happened. There is a LOT to unpack here. And I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for formatting and grammer.\n\nOKAY!\n\nSo, my (19F) dad (50M) brought his girlfriend (30F) to live with us around the end of October 2020. She lived in Louisiana before this.\nThey met about 10 years ago on this place called IMVU. Now, my dad (I'll call him B) and his girlfriend (I'll call her Neko for simplicity) met because he was pretending to be a 20sum year old girl.\nIt took him YEARS to tell the truth to Neko because he \"feared she'd leave him\" as she'd have every right to.\n\nHe's also had this little \"friend\" I'll call Dr. B did the same thing to Dr as he did to Neko. Faked being a girl when they met.\n\nAround mid September, B started getting really distant from Neko, hid his screen when she came into the room, closed out of IMVU when she woke up, etc. I didn't notice since I was and have been one to keep to myself and stay quiet, just not bother them. I stayed in my room since when I was younger, my mother always got mad at me for.. well. Simply existing. I've been no contact with her for 2 years. Thats a whole other can of worms for another day.\n\n4:41AM Dec. 26th, 2021.\nNeko messaged me. It was 5 pictures. Three of IMVU (2 accounts Abby and Dal, a 'room', a picture of a new gmail, and  a notepad) and a text saying \"looks like your dads been busy\" it took me a bit to process this since I was just waking up. I looked through everything, processed and sat in my room for a while just trying to make sense of it before it clicked together.\n\nI've always seen my dad better than this (since he knows how it feels to be cheated on. Example; my mother) so I didn't want to believe it.\n\nMoving to a day or so later, I made a new account and messaged Abbys' account. I asked to be friends. We made small talk before I asked about Dal, how long they've been together, etc.\nI talked to \"Dal\" while he was in their room. Abby was asleep at the time. Dal asked if I was just looking, said yes. I asked about Abby, he said they're long distance and were working to IRL.\nI was keeping a level head until I found her age. Abby told me when we were texting. She's 18.\nI. Lost. My. Sh*t. \n\nI asked her if she had discord. She did. I added her. I sent her actual pictures I took of his account, their convo, all that.\nI told her who I was to \"Dal\". I told her who Dal was. It was a 50 year old man, has three kids, living with his girlfriend. Blah blah. I didn't say anything about Neko.\nAbby felt HORRIBLE from all of this. She messaged B and told him she knew Dal didn't exist, how she knows he's a middle-aged man, how he has a daughter and girlfriend living with him.\n\nNeko was freaking out. She didn't want me to say anything about it, but I did. She's a bit of a HUGE pushover when it comes to my dad since he's really bipolar, won't take meds for it and has horrible outbursts.\n\nA few days of B being mad, Neko and I keeping our distance, him sleeping on the couch and me sleeping in his bed with Neko (she didn't want to be alone.), Neko finally said she wanted to get out of the house.\nSo 8:30 I texted my grandma to see if she was up and if we could come over. An hour later, she replied and said we can if we want to but she was going to shower first. Neko and I got ready to leave and we started walking there. It took an hour and a half of walking but we got there. We didn't leave till 10AM and got there at 11:30AM. Around noon, B texted Neko, asking if she and I were out. She ignored him like he had been ignoring her and since we were with my grandma.\n\nShe and I had been texting on IMVU the night before and she had called him a w--re since he's a serial cheater. I've seen a lot of messages when snooping. Men AND women...he swears he's straight.\n\nWhen we were gone, he came into my room and got onto the computer I use (it's an old, monster laptop he used about 8 years ago? Maybe longer? I duno) and got into MY IMVU account. I had been signed into the site and completely forgot to sign out of it. He went through Neko and I's conversation before messaging Abby from my account, word for word, and I quote: I see you broke up. Good. I hope she's sad. I liked but idc. She should have bought me what I wanted when I ased for it.\n\nI completely lost it and went into damage control mode for myself, telling her what happened. That my dad must of sent it from my account and I'm SO sorry. She said it was fine and it didn't bug her.\n\nHe also messaged Neko. \"Okay. Cool. I'll go back to being... what did you call it? A w--re?\"\n\nI felt something in me finally bend and snap.\nI messaged B from my phone.\nThe following conversation is word for word. Copy and paste from texts.\nChanged named of course and half-arse censored words.\n\nMe: Don't get mad at Neko for it.\nI know why you're acting like this.\nYou saw the breakup message from Abby and got all pissy.\nI'm the one who told Abby about everything.\nYou lied to her, Neko and so many others.\nYou have an issue that needs to be talked out with all three of us.\nYou, Neko and myself.\nWhat set me off was the fact she is 18.\nI know its not my relationship but its my issue when Neko comes to me, nearly in tears, upset that you're acting worse and hiding your screen.\nShe didn't care you did what you were doing, she just wanted you to be honest and not break a huge promise you made to her.\nMy mental and emotional health is struggling a lot with having 2 relationships on my hand.\nMy own and your and Nekos cause you two wont talk it out.\n\nIf you want me to pack my sh-t and leave, fine. Whatever.\nI won't put up a fight.\nBut we need to have this talk.\nAll three of us.\nLike adults.\nMe: You're hurting Neko too by doing this to her.\n\nB: Oh, we're going to\n\nMe: Alright. Lemme know if I'm getting kicked out so I know if I need to pack when I get in.\nAgain. Neko didn't do anything.\nShe got upset.\nI did the snooping and breaking to Ari.\n\nB: And lets not forget who kept telling me to send her back an a weekly basis\n\nLittle bit if background to explain this next bit of the convo. As this next part comes in, its horrible.\nI had to grow up fast because living with my mother, I was never in the BEST situation. I was the babysitter, the maid, the one who look care of all 5 of the kids (currently 13F, 15F, 21M, 23M and 30something M) and the one who was suppose to be looking after us. I'd make my mother meals of steak and whatever side and the rest of us had to fend for ourselves.\nI always tried to make sure my older brothers and younger sisters ate first (sisters always came before the boys) and until they weren't hungry which often lead me going to bed only of snacking on a piece of bread. I was never in the best mindset.\nI was and have been depressed since 6 since I had been s--ually abused by my half brother, I've had social anxiety since 9 as I've had to care for my sisters when i got home from wherever. I couldn't do anything.\nBecause of my social anxiety, I couldn't make friends well.\n\nIn 5th grade when I got back from a mental institution (i was sent there because I was on the edge of taking my own life) I made a friend. She was amazing. We made it to almost the end of 8th grade before I got pulled out of school AGAIN since we were moving...again.\n\nBUT with all that being said, I wasn't use to whining since my siblings and I  would get scolded for any complaining.\n\nB: And lets not forget who kept telling me to send her back an a weekly basis\n\n(He did the exact same.)\n\nMe: I didn't actually mean it tho.\nShe knows I do that shit.\nShe knows i get annoyed with her. Thats no secret.\nAgain tho. Lemme know if I'm getting kicked out so i know if I need to pack when I get in.\n\nB: My ass. You were always pissed about her whining and everything\n\nMe: So were you.\n\nB: Yes I was but shes still here\n\nMe: I'm aware.\nBut again. Let me know.\nGrandma, Neko and I are about to be busy.\n\n\n-A bit later when I saw he messaged Abby from my account.-\n\nMe: Did you message Abby from my account btw?\nIf so, oof. Thats low.\nIts fucked and manipulative.\nI sent her the pics of your \"Dallas\" account from your computer.\nI'm dumb but not that dumb.\nI show proof if I do this kind of s--t.\n\nB: Yep. Just dont reply. Im deleting imvu and getting rid of everything having to do with it. Nothing good has ever come from it.\n\n\nThat was that.\nWhen we got home, Neko and I put our stuff away. We always take little bags with us. She has this cute pale pink bag and I have one of stitch with a slice of pizza.\n\nAfter that, he called us in.\nHe spoke TO us. Not at us.\nHe let me know that March 1st, I was out. I had to have my stuff packed and out by then. I told him it wasn't an issue.\nHe said that I was to get a job (i was finishing my GED since I never completed highschool. Thanks mom!), save up and get out.\nI, again, told him okay and it wasn't an issue.\nHe scolded me for about 5 minutes. I don't remember everything as I was shutting down emotionally.\nAt some point when leaving, I told him it wasn't MY fault he was cheating on Neko with an 18 year old girl and lying to everyone he talks to.\n\"Okay! I'm a horrible person, so what? *Asking Neko* What do I do on there?! I find broken people and I make them feel better about themselves!!\" I was livid. I want to say I screamed at him, told him he was a POS but I didn't.\nI went to my room and started packing.\nI messaged online friends to let them know I won't be talking for a while.\nI heard him shouting at Neko about how shes leaving too and all that. Again. Don't remember everything.\n\nWhile in my room, I had a total emotional breakdown. On Dec. 4th 2021, I had just gotten back from PA. I was spending 2 weeks with my boyfriend.\nHe's who I needed. He's who I STILL need.\nI sat there for about an hour just bawling my eyes out, hyperventilating and just letting all the built up anger and pain from the last few years out. (Might vent about it another day)\n\nI ended up falling asleep at some point. I woke up to my boyfriend calling. He asked how I was and I explained EVERYTHING to him. I explained about B cheating, Abby being 18, the stress I've been under with the weight of two relationships on my shoulders, getting kicked out, just..all of it. I was crying as I told him. He stayed quiet and just listened. It felt like a bit of weight had been lifted off my shoulders.\nHe told me to text his dad and ask if I could take over my boyfriends room sooner than expected since we'd talked about it before.\nI did after the call and explained the situation. Just a quick rundown of what happened. His dad agreed to let me stay and I thanked him.\n\n\nWELL. A few days after me packing my stuff, helping Neko pack hers, us talking about her moving back to Louisiana and my going with till I got a little bit of 'Oh fahk' money, dad wanted to talk.\n\nWe ignored his text. (He texted while he was at the gym)\nI went to take a nap since I had been lacking on getting rest and Neko did too since she works night shift (9:40PM to 7AM) at Walfart.\n\nIt took two days before dad could catch us alone. He talked to her (or at as she told me later) about the situation. I don't know what was said.\nHe caught me when I was feeding Nekos dogs. (Lovely girls. A 2 year old white German Shepard and a 8 and a half year old chiweenie)\nHe apologized for everything, said he was in the wrong and that he messed up. I, of course, agreed.\nHe did his talk of how he'll do better and that next time, I need to call him out for being a d--k.\nI listened and agreed. I apologized for snooping and everything.\nWe forgave eachother.\n\nAfter that, I waddled my happy arse back to my room and I fell asleep.\nI woke up around 8 to talk to Neko about it. Told her we all need to talk and set boundaries.\nSpecifically those two. She said \"I dunno.. I'm still sick\" blah blah. Her typical goto to get out of doing stuff she NEEDS to do. I said whatever and went back to my room.\n\nThe next week, the atmosphere smoothed out and they seemed better. B wasn't on IMVU and everything seemed okay.\n\nThat was until today.\nI'd been talking to Dr. Hes a great guy, very charming. Hes 33.\nI had told Dr about B when I told Abby.\nDr had only removed B as a friend. They've known eachother for years and B had this whooole story made up about his female persona. B had Dr fooled for YEARS and they spoke very intimately with one another.\nAnyway.\nB had messaged Dr.\nHe sent 2 messages.\nB: You unfriended me?\nB: Kk then I guess ... good luck with everything\n\nAn hour into talking to Dr, I had asked him to message B back, asking what he wanted. I told him if he was uncomfortable with it or didn't want to, not to.\nDr wasn't sure how to ask so I said \"just ask him what he wants\"\nDr agreed like the amazing guy he is and replied.\n\nDr: What do you need?\n\nTo which B responded \"Nothing ... forget it ... bye and good luck with everything\"\n\nI was and am fed up with all of this. I'm texted Neko we're going to sit down and talk. All of us, it isn't up for discussion.\n\nShe said she didn't know and I told her bluntly \"No. No \"I donno\" its happening.\nI'm not gonna be a ball of rage again cause you two. Won't. F--king. Talk.\"\n\nShe agreed and we haven't spoken since.\n\nI know I'm not in the right, I have my issues and faults here. I also know it's not my relationship but I want to help them. Neko is head over heels for my scumbag dad and I want to at least try to make this easier or them.\nI can't keep having Neko coming to me crying when B messes up. I've got my own mental and emotional issues to deal with. I can't have theirs too.\n\nI'm so sorry for the wall of text.\nI don't know why I'm posing here but it was kind of therapeutic to type all of this out..\nHow should I go about talking to them about this?\n\nIf wanted, I'll post an update on what the outcome is after the talk.\n\nTL;DR Dad has been pretending to be a female on IMVU, cheats on his girlfriend who lives with us, gets mad when he's called out.\n\nEDIT: Fixed spelling and names since I'm dumb and forgot to when I posted.",

The pandemic was long(kinda still is), and we just had a long-distance relationship. It is rocky at times, and we both were frustrated with each other's actions at certain points.\n\nNow we are almost over with our degrees. We are in our final semester, and doing our mandatory internship.\n\nThing is, over this long duration, he had never sent me any presents. I am by no means a materialistic person and hate unnecessary expenses. I also get that pandemic has made our situation difficult for exchanging gifts.\n\nFor the first year of our relationship, we both did not exchange presents. Long-distance, pandemic, you can reason and say yeah it is justified. But then the pandemic was not so severe anymore. I gave him presents for his birthday last year, and I will again this year again. I couldn't send him anything for Valentine's day or other festivals, again, because of no courier services.\n\nI thought I would be okay without the gifts. Turns out, it is chipping me away.\n\nHe was very excited about my birthday, saying he would buy me this ceramic mug I had my eye on. But my birthday came and went by months ago. And he was asking me recently as to why was I not buying the mug soon, it will be out of stock. I was so crushed when he said that and bought it for myself.\n\nMy SO is not financially weak. We have been interning since our second year, and have saved a significant amount. He even keeps investing a chunk into mutual funds and whatnot. And he keeps asking me always, ALWAYS, ah I have so much money, what should I do? And I do not know how to respond to that so I end up sending him suggestions of articles of clothing and electronics, which he sometimes eventually buys. And he praises me for having a good eye.\n\nHe says money is something that should be spent very carefully.\n\nAnd, I have never felt so undervalued in my entire life.\n\nAm I being unreasonable for expecting a boyfriend of almost 2 years to spend even a dollar on me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : Boyfriend of almost 2 years does not give presents, despite always claiming to have nowhere to spend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Seems like most of you are recommending a conversation from me to him.

        "content": "Okay so I'll try to paint the picture here so warning long post. We've been dating for a year and a couple months and it is both of our first relationships . We met on tinder and things started off pretty great. I think we both had ideal images of each other initially ( I put her on a pedestal and she did too). Fast forward a couple months and we both realize we're pretty flawed. I'm pretty introverted and I LOVE my space and it takes me a while to process feelings and I don't try to ask too much of her. I like my love spaced out and relaxed, and I only like to express my feelings with words when I feel like they're overflowing (as to be genuine).\n\nI'm not sure how exactly to describe how my girlfriend is, as she went through a complete shift after a break up scare, but ill try my best. After the first couple months when the love is high and feverish, she'd get very sensitive (id walk on eggshells and shed go silent every time she was upset) and clingy (shed never let me say goodbye and go, e.g. if I'm at her house, I cant leave her side or she'll whine) and insecure at random times where id have to stay on the phone w her for hours reassuring her for her to feel better even though we would text ALL day w discords every night which took its toll on me eventually, and I started asking for space which would cause a bit of a problem. Id try to reassure her that i just needed space to breathe and love and miss her and that it wasn't personal, that it was just how i worked. I believe she'd try her best but she couldn't help rely and codepend on me. This made showing her affection a chore I had to do, until it built enough resentment in me (many conversations were had about this, our fights followed a pattern) and I texted her that i was done. She drove to see me after that text, and I realized that I truly do love her (which I have been questioning), just that I wasn't being given enough space.\n\nWe worked through it and through our conflict resolution and we had a couple of months with absolutely no fights, we were settling in but still having fun, our problems were \"normal\" like how some things id do annoy her or vice versa. She was the chill cool girlfriend now and our dynamic even switched a little, where id have more moments of insecurity. A good measure of how things are going for me was how shed say goodbye after we were done hanging out, where at first (toxic period) shed be visibly upset and it was almost like she had separation anxiety, but later on (chill period) shed tell me to get the hell out her car ( in a funny way).\n\nFast forward to a week ago, I feel like she's back to that state. She mentioned it too and that she's scared and I told her we'll just proceed cautiously. We fought today , and after a prolonged disagreement that caused me to shut down and to tell her that I cant talk and resolve it today , to which she pushed to finish today, to which I lashed out and said very hurtful things that I've been carrying in my heart like \"there's a reason we stopped fighting (her changing)\" \"everything upsets you\". Its back to me feeling like I'm being pushed (my coping mechanism is taking time outs and gaming or reading) and to me in turn hurting her immensely. She, in desperation, suggested a week break (which helped me before, I feel much more free to feel things towards her ) and she expressed wanting to disappear. I don't think she's being malicious, shed call herself out saying things like I'm just being toxic right now. She has some issues with her parents w her being the middle child that gets no attention which of course affects her today. Things to note are she was on the pill for the first toxic period and she got a hormonal iud inserted like 3 weeks ago. (she would say the pill made her crazy, its kind of uncanny with the iud now). Also, during the chill period, she was pretty busy with school and stuff. She had a lot of free time during toxic period 1 and coincidentally, now. Not sure what to do and desperately need some perspective on this(pls dont tell me to break up so lightly) ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR// girlfriend gets into separation anxiety mania mode which pushes me away",

Now i've moved to Germany on placement while he remains in Wales. We've had ups and downs before, even going on a short break in the first lockdown when he was getting paranoid about me cheating (which i didn't). We came back better than ever. The dynamics have now changed and he now seems completely disinterested-i think i'd rather him paranoid! Never any time or energy to call or even text back but when i do receive something, it's usually some reassurance \"i'm sorry i love you etc\" which makes me feel bad for pestering him as i accept university is stressful. We've changed a lot since we were first together, which isn't a bad thing but he can't seem to accept it. We had the same interests but now i'm a party girl who wants to do loads of activities whereas he prefers to skate and smoke with his boys. He's also heavily addicted to weed and coke, both of which i was forced to source when he visited because i did not want to deal with withdrawal, even though i heavily disapprove of his drug use. I'm \\*almost\\* certain i need to end it but i have no idea how. He's always been very sensitive/emotionally vulnerable, threatening suicide before (but he does not do that anymore due to me actually losing someone to suicide but the fear remains) and i do not know if a phone call is an effective way to talk, a text seems too mean and to plan a whole visit just to end it, seems counter productive. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I still love him dearly, but I wonder if men/boys ever change and if they do, how?\n\nTL;DR!:  Been four years together, now trying long distance but getting no attention. Finding it hard to decide how to talk about it as a call seems hard, a text disrespectful and a whole ass visit is mean.

It is possible to some degree at my sister's as she works 9-5 and I work in the evenings, but I have bad memories in that house as I lost my dad there last year so, I don't know if I'd be jumping from one traumatic, toxic environment into another traumatic place.\n\nMy other option is to get into online teaching biz and move in with my close friend. Issue here is, I'm not sure if I can find a proper place I can work as a TEFL teacher, and I'd only be working from home giving online lessons, but I'd have all the time in the world and this is the only \"non-traumatic\" place I can think of, I also love her company. I would have limited economic freedom but this friend of mine said she'd be more than happy to have me as well, free of rent!

        "content": "My wife and I have always been very different. I'm a complex bag of philosophy and thoughts about the future; she's a simpler person who prefers action to conversation, and who reminisces about the past. We've both changed over the past 11 years, but my change has been the most dramatic. My mental health has improved and deteriorated in cycles, as has my weight and self-esteem. I was a devout Christian when she and I met, and now I'm an agnostic, bordering on full-blown atheism.\n\nShe had a really rough childhood. Change scares her quite a bit, so seeing me become someone different hasn't been easy for her. If she was following the church's teachings, she probably would have left me by now; she's tried her best to be understanding. She wears her emotions on her sleeve, but she's a good mother to our two kids, and a good person overall.\n\nThere's no one at fault for anything here. What she and I want from our relationship are just diametrically opposed. We don't meet each other's needs, and we try to make up for that by buying stuff that the other wants, but for me, it only seems to highlight just how desperate I am for someone that gets me. When we do try to address the gulf between us, it ends in unproductive conflict and meaningless apologies. We don't want to hurt each other, we want to be there for each other, but we just don't. After 11 years of increasing distance, I don't see that changing.\n\nI don't want to hurt her. She's said numerous times how much she just \"couldn't do life\" without me. She would truly be in a bad way if we did divorce or separate: she dropped out of high school and doesn't have her GED, my income is comfortable but nowhere near enough to support two households, and she hasn't had a job in the 11 years we've been married. This is to say nothing of the emotional damage it would do to her; I don't want her to feel like she's been abandoned *yet again.* Not to mention the kids: I know my son would probably understand, as divorce is pretty much the norm these days. I could honestly and truthfully explain to him that his mom and I just needed what we could not provide to each other. It would be hard on our autistic daughter, though.\n\nI think the worst part of it is that I'm starting to justify to myself why seeking out an affair wouldn't be the worst thing. I've mentioned to her before that I wouldn't be upset if we needed to see other people while remaining married, but she vehemently opposes that option (which I'll admit has caused some resentment from me, as our sex life has been nearly dead for years). If I could just share a connection with *someone*, I'd be a better partner, I'd take the burden of pleasing me off of her. I know it wouldn't be that way. I'd feel enormously guilty, and if she ever found out, it would devastate her.\n\nI thought I was willing to sacrifice my happiness for her. I thought I could do it to give my kids a stable home with two parents, but...I don't think I can anymore. I hate myself for being so weak, I hate that I don't feel like I can tell her any of this. I'm not even optimistic that I *could* find someone to share a connection with if I did leave her. I'm an ugly, overweight awkward nerd with persistent suicidal thoughts.\n\nAnd I hate that I'm here, spilling out this twisted, melodramatic mess. I'm sitting at work, but I just want to go to the bathroom and cry. There's no good option; I'm going to hurt myself by suppressing all of this, or I'm going to hurt a lot of people *and* myself for saying this out loud.\n\nThe happiness in our relationship is gone, and I don't think it's coming back. What do I do now?\n\n**tl;dr** Long marriage, 2 kids, I've changed, don't want to hurt her, but lonely, bored and feeling unloved.\n\nEDIT: To everyone telling me to talk to her, I am, and I have. I did not mention in my original word eruption, but we're both feeling the distance. We've had countless discussions about our incompatibility, our wildly different needs in mental stimulation, shared experiences, sexual needs, religion...it hasn't been a silent 11 years. Lots of fights (no violence, thankfully). Lots of dead ends. We've both threatened divorce in our own ways at some point during those years. I didn't mention this, partly because I was a blubbering mess of humanity a few hours ago, but because it's impossible to sum up 11 years in one post. It hasn't all been bad, but what is bad feels overwhelming now.",

We are really excited and we're lucky to have the love and support of my wife's family and my mom. My dad, however, is a different story.\n\nMy dad lives out of state, with my stepmom and their children. We're not close at all, almost all of our communication is 1 or 2 calls a year, and the only time I've seen him in years was when my grandmother died.\n\nThis isn't for lack of trying on my part. All of those calls between us are me calling him, not the other way around. Recently, I've tried to arrange another get together where we can see him before the baby comes, because it's starting to get hard for my wife to travel, and because of the pandemic, especially as newborns can't get vaccinated against COVID yet. (That side of the family is antivax. Not trying to be political, just an important aspect of things.)\n\nDespite a bit of texting back and forth, my dad hasn't really committed to seeing us. I know I shouldn't be surprised. There was a lot that happened when I was young between my parents and a lot of those old wounds never seemed to heal, but I guess I had convinced myself that becoming a grandfather for the first time would have changed things for him, even if only slightly.\n\nBut lately the communication has broken down, and it doesn't really seem that he's prioritizing seeing us. And to be completely honest, it's bringing me down, at a time when we should be feeling excited and happy. It's gotten me thinking about whether the relationship (if it can be called such a thing) is even worth the effort.\n\nI've been thinking about the situation for a while now, and as the due date gets closer and closer, I'm starting to lean towards cutting off all contact with my dad and his side of the family. I want to enter fatherhood with as much positive mental health and emotional energy as possible, and I think my daughter deserves to have me at my best. Sometimes, I think I'd rather just end contact with them and have closure, rather than continue to wait and see if it actually goes anywhere.  That would even include things like preventing him from seeing her on social media. I feel like he doesn't get something like that for \"free\" without putting in some sort of effort on his part.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't think my daughter should have to suffer because of things that happened 30, 40 years ago. She should be able to have her grandfather in her life, and it shouldn't really be about how I feel. There's a part of me that thinks it would be a super asshole move to cut ties with my dad right when his granddaughter is born. I really don't want to be the person who does that, but I do think it would be the right thing to do mentally and emotionally. I'm also concerned for how it could hurt others in the crossfire, like my sisters on that side. Even more so, I really don't want to make a harsh decision that would prevent a relationship with my dad in the future, even if unlikely.\n\nSo, would cutting communication with my dad right before my daughter is born be a good idea or a terrible idea?\n\nTLDR: My dad and I have almost no relationship, considering dropping all contact before my daughter is born to improve my mental health.",

Wants to maintain a friendship with both me and the person she cheated on me with.\n\nMy wife of five years cheated by sleeping with a stranger she met in a store. They exchanged numbers, spoke, had drinks, and she took him to her hotel room and had sex with him. She confessed everything to me and firmly admits that the story, as crazy as it sounds, is true. Our marriage had been pretty shaky and this was the reason for her taking a break and booking a hotel room in the first place. She went out on the town and this is where she met the stranger.\n\nWe still love and care about each other however and it would be nice for us to remain friends. Is this healthy?\n\nSecondly, she stayed in touch with the person she had sex with after their encounter and she has developed a strong connection and liking with this person even though she has only known this person for three weeks. She refers to it as \"love at first sight\". She claims to still love me. She has since moved out and now has her own place. I told her that if we were to remain friends in any capacity, then you can't remain in a relationship or in open communication with the person that you've cheated on me with. She's finding this to be a difficult ask because she does not want to lose our friendship but also has somehow developed a deep connection with her three-week old dealings with her \\*male equivalent of mistress\\*. Is this a reasonable request?\n\n  \nEDIT:  Thank you guys for the kind and *not-so-kind* words. I appreciate all the advice. I will seek out a therapist to get through this as it is indeed a painful moment in my life. I guess deep down I know none of this was a good idea but maybe I was \"*shock by her admission and further fricking audacious actions*\" coupled with the reality of the last 5 years of building, traveling, fun & happy times, and my once best friend in life and first true love all coming to an end. I am definitely allowing my emotions to hold me hostage here. The friendship obviously would not benefit me in any resourceful way but I can see how it would benefit her in many ways. A *security blanket as* someone put it.\n\nI also agree that at this point I cannot dictate who she sees or befriends. Knowing that she still wanted some kind of relationship with the guy that she cheated on me with I should have simply declined the mere notion of us being friends.\n\n**TO THOSE SEEKING MORE DETAILS.**\n\nNo we don't have kids.\n\nI have pressed her on the \"met at a store\" story several times but she doubles down on it. Says she understands that the behavior was unsafe and unhealthy but she was in a vulnerable place - due to the marital funk - when she first met the guy and accepted his number and his request to have drinks. Also blames some of her actions on alcohol.\n\nThis woman came into my life when I was in a dark place myself. She is a big reason why I am the person I am today as she's helped build me up in many ways. So it seems to me that one of the reasons why I still wanted to be there for her after what happened was probably to show gratitude. As some has pointed out it probably has to do with not having better self-esteem as well. I'm also aware that she can have suicidal thoughts and speak in really dark terms when she goes through situations like this and she has during this process especially when she thought she was going to be homeless, etc. But I am coming to the realization that the same way I must now seek help to better myself, so does she. She cannot expect me to care more for her than she does for herself. Especially in a moment like this I must prioritize myself and my mental health if I am to move past this.\n\nThroughout the years we've had some marital issues. Typically in the form of verbal abuse on both ends. When arguments occur, some pretty horrible things get said both by me and by her. We tried to change this but it didn't seem to be working out. She claims that this is what drove her to do what she did. The \"*break*\" in question was not a separation. We were having discussions on whether we should call it quits or not after our last big fight. She then said that she needs space for herself and this is when she went out of town for a couple days. She even asked me to join her on the first day/night which I did. The next day is when the situation happened with the 'stranger'.\n\nI still cannot make sense of all of it. Some of it definitely seems made up and like she's lying. Others just seem like pretty irrational behavior of which she's blaming on things that I've said in arguments. Whether it was planned or not. OR done out of anger it's blatantly disrespectful no matter how you look at it. If we were to end things. Fine, let's do that first then pursue your rendezvous.\n\nAs much as it still hurts and as painful as all of this is, I am now filing for divorce, I stopped all contact with her (*except for how to distribute our assets*), and I'll be getting a therapist.\n\nThank you for your time, words, encouragement and advice. It has helped me gain some clarity on things I was in obvious denial about.\n\nTL;DR I'm filing for divorce on the ground of infidelity, we've halted contact and minimal communication and I'll be seeing a therapist soon.",

During that time, we discussed marriage, children, everything.\n\nGiven the high costs of London living, he didn't want to stay there long-term.

He didn't tell me, I saw it on Facebook.\n\nI really loved him, and he gave me no explanation for cutting me off so suddenly. We went from spending every day together to not speaking at all.\n\nI had a complete breakdown; I deleted all of my social media, cut contact with all of our mutual friends, and started drinking heavily.\n\nI always thought of him as \"the one who got away\".\n\nI'm now in a much better place.

My husband shared with me last week that he never wanted to have our second child or move back to my home state (where we met in college). He never wanted to leave the city we were living in 4 years ago (not his home state, but it's where his parents live now). He said he didn't want to lose me, so he just \"went with\" what I wanted. He's been increasingly unhappy over the last 3 years, so it's not a huge surprise. How do I live with this guilt that I made him supposedly give up a life he wanted when he never expressed it at the time? It feels like a betrayal. Instead of lose me, he'd rather make us both miserable... forever?\n\nI'd also like to add that I had wanted another child, but got a tubal because I knew he could not handle a third. We talked about this a lot, and I felt okay about it because it felt like something I did for both of us to be happy. It turned out that I had an (unplanned pregnancy) miscarriage while on birth control, which I didn't find out about until I went in for the tubal and they ended up needing to do a D&C. I grieved that loss (and the guilt of not knowing and possibly \"causing\" the miscarriage) on my own as he told me, repeatedly, how \"relieved\" he was. Part of this feels like he has retconned our life in light of the miscarriage to make it feel like he gave up something bigger, like he has something bigger to grieve.\n\nHe now uses language like he \"lost me to the kids.\" In reality, the way I love, think of, and consider him has only matured and grown. Yes, I have less time and my body has to work so much harder post-baby (which means my sex drive is less); but the idea that he lost me is just silly. I do so much more to support him now than I ever did in our 20's-- he just didn't need me as much because our life was relatively stress-free and he didn't yet resent me for anything. Now, life is harder (COVID, kids, aging parents, his sister's infertility, job stress, etc), so he needs me (my body, my time, my patience) more. \n\nI just don't know how to move forward and not feel like he just has permanent permission to be miserable because of what he gave up \"for me\" and all the things, including me, that he thinks he lost. And before you say it, we are seeking therapy. But it's 2022 and the line for couples therapy is perhaps as long as the line for COVID tests.",

My life lost its meaning and for a long time I felt empty inside and without any will to live. My brother (M23) wasn't even an adult at the time, but he took that role and took care of me.\nOur parents' death caused me so much pain I tried to kill myself once, but he stopped me and saved me (so you're only reading this post because of him).\n\nBefore the accident we were never really the \"close siblings\" type. We argued a lot over silly stuff. But this completely changed us both. He became protective of me, and was very supportive and sweet. He was also going through a lot of shit, but our bond was so strong we became inseparable. He was all I had, and I was all he had.\n\nWe had to live with our grandparents for a few years. They are lovely people, but we never felt comfortable with them. We all agreed that when I turned 18, my brother and I would find an apartment near the city and live together for a while.\nHe found a shitty job to pay the rent (our grandparents helped us pay the rent for a couple of months as well), while I continued with my studies.\n\nLife did improve for some time. We had a lot of fun living like roommates. Even during lockdown. We spent 95% of the time together. Playing boardgames, watching movies, cuddling. We became so close - with occasional dumb arguments every so often.\n\nSince the accident he's been in a few relationships, most of them with girls I didn't personally like. But they made him happy, which ultimately made me happy. However, recently he started dating a new girl who has changed him.\n\nHe's become more cold with me. He spends many nights away from home, sleeping over at either his friends' or his girlfriend's house. We've gone from spending almost all of the time together, to only a few hours a day. I've tried talking to him about it (telling him that I miss him), but he finds dumb excuses like \"oh my friends just needed me\".\n\nHis new girlfriend is very toxic and manipulative. She clearly doesn't like me either. And I get it, I know he has a life too and can't spend all the time with me. I know he really wants and needs a girlfriend, but I love him so much and hate being away from him.\n\nHe's the reason I'm alive, and without him I'm nothing. So what do I do now? Do I try to get over him and start MY own life? Do I push for him to spend time with me like before? Should I do something else? I'm lost.\n\n\nTLDR: My older brother (M23) and I (F20) became very close after our parents' death. Recently he's been pulling away from me because of his girlfriend, spending less and less time with me. What do I do?",

        "content": "Dear Reddit,\n\nLet me get straight into the point, this might be a long one (get a good couch to lay on) and i just hope i can set the scene and scenario as accurately as possible.\n\nI am a 19 year old guy, i usually am not interested in dating and relationships as i have been hurt in the past and everyone else in one i know eventually all got hurt. My childhood best friend recently befriended a girl at his workplace. He one day randomly sent me a picture of him and her holding up the peace sign on instagram with the caption ''Hey here is my friend, she's ready to go out on a date with you 100%''. I ignored him at first since i previously mentioned i do not indulge in shit like this. However i met him the same night and figured to ask around. Apparently he mentioned a lot about his friends to her and she noticed that he speaks about me in a very respectful way and frankly in a way that sets me apart from everyone else.\n\nSo i did around my digging and got to know her a bit from my friend and eventually added her on instagram. She texted me the next day and we started talking, she mentioned her interest was piqued by me and stories my friend told her of me , she liked my pictures and videos and that me she likes me (she is very very open and i am very very shy) and i was dumbfounded. So the next day i decided to visit them in their workplace to catch a glimpse of her and try to have a a vague idea about what she's like (Joe Goldberg style) . I visited, as soon as i saw her and heard her speak, i just had my heart pound so hard and i just knew she might be it, weird i know. She got suspicious of us ( i went with a friend) and was asking my childhood best-friend who we were. On my way back home, all i could think was her, her and her. She messaged me later on asking if i was at her workplace by any chance (she thought my eyes looked familiar) and i couldn't get myself to lie to her, so i told her yes and assumed i fucked up. But she found it really cute and was really chill about it.\n\nOn new year's eve she went to a party but she saw someone who she has a bad history with. She called me at 12:30 to say Happy new year and all, but i could tell something was wrong. I caught onto it, decided to abandon my friends at our new year's remote location hangout and sit in my car and talk to her. She opened up a lot REAL FAST even though we had been speaking for a few days and i helped her get out of her panic and reach home, all meanwhile my friend drove me back home and me being on the phone with her. We spoke more in the following days and we both felt weird on how quick we both were getting close to each other since she opened up and apparently she says that she barely trusts anyone but her gut tells her to trust me, We started talking regularly after that on chat and we started liking each other a lot. My friend was right, she is EXACTLY my type.\n\nWe found a lot of similarities and had endless topics to talk about. We started calling each other cute and all was going great. We decided to meet up again (properly this time) and we both really enjoyed it. Again it was reassuring that she might be the one. She texted me after the day on how she found me really cute and how every-time she caught me staring at her eyes she loved how i got flustered and tried to look away. We met up again a few days later and it went great. One thing i forgot to mention was it went great for her on both the days and she texted my friend on how amazing, cute and how much she's into me. We both tell each other how much we miss each other and thinking about each other. We both have mentioned each other to our friends too. However, for me the day always went great while she was around, as soon as she left i had this dread creep up on me on how i fucked up or said the wrong thing because i am very insecure and frankly i do not understand why she says the things she says to me. Is it that i am just an obsession, a phase for her or is she like this with everyone she gets close to in a romantic sense.\n\nThis girl apparently does not open up easily and i am someone who cant rest until he helps out the girl he's falling in love with and her problems. During one of the scenarios where i was trying to get out what's bothering her, She said she's fallen in love with me and that was true for me too. However me being the pessimist i am, said that i am too but love is a big word and its so early for us etc etc and i would only say it to her on her face but i definitely hinted that it's the same case with me. Now since our first 2.5 extremely quick and abnormal lovey dovey week has come to and end, i am having a few issues.\n\nWe both work and study (im off for a few months tho rn) and we have opposite work schedules. She leaves home at 7:30 am and comes back at 9:00 pm. I work from home and work from 2PM to 2AM. We try to talk during the day but its usually her replying after a few hours since she's busy and recently she's been having a lot of issues in her work life and a bit of personal life too. When she's home she studies for her degree via remote learning. The thing with me is, IT KILLS ME INSIDE when she replies after hourss and it usually is a okay-ish reply, she barely tells me what's bothering her ( i have to extract it out of her) and me being the fucktard keeps waiting for her to reply to the point where my whole day while im out, working or doing literally anything is ruined since im always overthinking and quite frankly getting mad because i feel something is going wrong with us. Right now its me double or even triple texting her and telling her of my day and her just answering with a late un-interested reply ( but i do get she's busy). I told her today how bad my day was and she ignored that fact and only replied to something else that i had mentioned, very late (again i know she's busy) . I dont know am i being selfish, yes. Do i hope she tried to talk to me and distract me for a bit, fuck yes. I just messaged her that im about to work and sleep. And i told myself that im just going to mute and avoid her for tonight and see whatever she says in the morning because i know it will dissapoint me and i want to chill out for the night since ive had a shit day.\n\nI really like her and i genuinely believe she likes me too. I really want help regarding my next move, im scared of fucking it up because she is exactly who i want to be with. But right now i just want to get away from her because im scared if i fall deeper into the love pit, im going to be super fucked for a long time and as i previously mentioned i am not interested in dating and relationships and they all end bad. But she makes me doubt the promise i made myself to stay away from this shit. I cant handle this stress and my overthinking, i think its evident right now that i am a guy who has a knack for wanting to be super close and not respect the other person's privacy and always wanting to know what's up with them, however i do it out of my love and care for them. I know, i am not a good guy, But that is me and me is me and i do not want to change for one person.\n\nNow what i came here for, Do i tell her to set a time for us to talk. Do i just leave this and ghost ( i do not want to get hurt again, however on the other hand i dont want the regret of knowing i lost someone i really was in to). Do i start treating her as normal person and try to fall out of love with her. Do i just go with the flow of things and leave it up to fate. What the fuck should i do, because this is mentally fucking me. Because it really is affecting my work and mental health. Im trying to distract myself but nothing is working. I just need any opinions i can get right now. Im not really sure myself what the problem is right now i genuinely can not word it, ive just re-read what i've written and im embarrassed on seeming this crazy and vulnerable. But that's why i decided to post on here in the first place, be as harsh or real as possible. If you all have any opinions or insights on this situation, her, me or any other advice, It will be greatly appreciated <3. Thanks for taking the time off and reading my shitpost.\n\n\\---  \\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* :  Recently met a girl, we both started liking each other however im having a few doubts on my end.

        "content": "So we met in college (U.K.) and it was very unexpected for us to get together. We are complete opposites and we\u2019d never talked for the entire year until we had to work together on a project and it just went on from there. After a few months I started taking contraception that was giving me some really bad side effects (bad depression, mood swings etc.) so our relationship was a bit rocky which he couldn\u2019t take so he dumped me. After about a month we get back together and everything is great. After about 2 years we get a dog and move in together. It was honestly amazing, if felt like we were really compatible and everything was just great. Until about 7 months in; we get into some argument (which I don\u2019t remember cos it wasn\u2019t that deep) but it was the worst argument we\u2019d ever had but then again we barely argued, we were pretty good at sorting disagreements out. So this argument led to him telling me he didn\u2019t see a future with me anymore and dumping me again (my life right?). So we ended having to give our dog away because we had to move back in with our parents, both of which were very against dogs so that wasn\u2019t an option. It was the last thing I ever though we\u2019d do but it was for the best, the people she went to have a lot more time with her and she seems very happy. Fast forward 2 months later he comes back and tells me he made a mistake, he can\u2019t see his life without me blah blah blah etc. So I decided to give him another chance. The problem is now our situation isn\u2019t great, we barely get to see eachother because I\u2019m not allowed round his house, his dad hates me for reasons he\u2019s never made clear, his brother is a racist (I\u2019m black, he\u2019s white). The story is so long and there\u2019s some details I missed out but you get the gist. The thing is, even after everything, I still want to try to make it work because I still love him and he\u2019s honestly the sweetest guy, it may not seem like it because of what I wrote, but I know he\u2019s genuinely a really nice person who made some dumb decisions. I\u2019m not really sure if I can trust that he won\u2019t pull some shit like this again. Also I\u2019m thinking of buying a house but can\u2019t help but get sad that we can\u2019t do it together since I can\u2019t really trust him anymore. I\u2019m really conflicted on whether I should carry this relationship on or not. Any advice?\n\nTL;DR! Boyfriend of 3 and a half years has broken up with me twice which has resulted in us losing our dog and home. Now we\u2019re back together and it\u2019s not great, I\u2019m not sure if I should stay with him.",

(1-2 cigarettes a day usually, and in secret)\n\nI didn't tell my partner about this, mainly out of shame for doing it.

        "content": "He still lives with his mom, I've been on my own (well, with a roommate) for 2 years. He's got a pretty decent job and the house we're looking to rent is actually owned by my uncle so we are getting a beautiful house for an amazing price. I am so excited. He seems significantly more hesitant than I am. It's not like I'm not nervous but we have to make a decision soon and I'm going to guess he's going to say no.\n\nHe is very nervous, I know it's partly leaving his mom and just the stress of affording the house (which I'm fairly positive he could live there alone and be okay, but we'll be splitting everything.) and I can understand that.\n\nBut he's also been worried about us, he's said he's worried I'll end up not liking him, and he's even said he's worried that he's projecting. We're both insecure, and we just take these anxieties as they come. I'd say he's more insecure (worried that I don't like him) than I am, but his insecurity in this situation makes me insecure lol. The main issues of our relationship is really about his insecurity, he feels like I'm not attracted to him - and subsequently intimacy. Everything else I feel good about. I won't get into that, but the point is there are issues and I know that makes him hesitant. We don't fight about it, but he gets pretty distressed. He has a lot of retroactive jealousy.\n\nAgain, I do feel nervous too. And his doubt regarding us does scare me. In the beginning of our relationship we were both unhealthy and he often jumped to leaving the relationship when things got hard. We're not like that now, but it's difficult for me to not feel that fear. We have touched on this and I have to keep reminding myself he's not jumping to that, we just have to work on it. I do worry I'm taking too long, but he admits he's not doing all that he can, either. \n\nI know he and I will argue. He knows that, too. We've already had one road bump planning what rooms will be for what, but we've gotten through that. I know we both feel we've made each other better people. We have been together for 3 years and I am confident in our relationship. We have worked very hard to get to where we are, and I'm happy with it. It's not perfect of course, but he and I have talked about marriage. Moving in with each other will absolutely take some adjusting but I feel we can work through it. \n\nAnd actually I've \"catastrophized\" with him, saying worst thing is he moves back in with his mom and we end the relationship. Which sucks, but if we can't be together then that's the obvious outcome. That would happen sooner or later if we eventually want to get married. \n\nI don't want him to feel pressured. I have told him I don't want him to say yes just for me. I know I can't stop him. I just think it's not a good idea if he's this unsure. I've worked out some compromises to try to take the pressure off. \n\nI guess I'm spouting all of this off to ask what's in the title. For anyone who has had a successful relationship moving in together, were there any doubts doing so? Was it scary at all? Is it normal and if he says yes should I trust him? Is there any advice you can offer?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; my bf is more worried about moving in together than I am. He's still with his mom so there's obvious anxiety about that, but he has doubts in our relationship that have to do with both his feelings and how he *thinks* I feel. He's pretty insecure, and I can be too but I'd say he is more so. Of course there were some pre existing anxieties about taking that leap with him. But his hesitancy makes me even more nervous. I am realistic with him that it will take adjusting but on my end I'm confident we'll be okay. I'm just wondering - especially those of you in successful relationships who live with each other - is the doubt and anxiety normal? If he says yes should I trust him? Is there any advice you can offer?",

        "content": "There's a lot to unpack here, so I'll try to keep it as simple as possible, please feel free to ask if anything seems unclear or lacking in detail! \n\nPlease excuse all the religion and politics, but it's very relevant to my problem.\n\nOver the past several years, I've found myself feeling increasingly emotionally estranged from my parents. This is especially concerning as I'm their only child and my father is approaching the age of retirement, meaning they may come to depend on me more in the near future.   \n\n\nThe problem is that I've strayed HEAVILY from my Christian upbringing, and I'm no longer able to find any common ground with them, at all.. Here's some details about us for context:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMY PARENTS:\n\n\\- Die Hard Republicans / Protestant Christians\n\n\\- My father owns his own business, a Christian Business. I live next door. \n\n\\- Swearing, Weed, Alcohol, Sex outside of straight marriage, all evil.\n\n\\- My father believes porn should be illegal (which is unfortunate given my career)\n\n\\- They homeschooled me for my entire education to prevent me from being \"brainwashed\" \n\nby our \"atheistic\" school system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nME: \n\n\\-  I draw porn for a living, gay porn. It's very lucrative so I doubt I'll be stopping any time soon.\n\n\\- I'm a bisexual, agnostic, pothead.\n\n\\- I don't consider myself a socialist, but I'm certain they would consider me one. \n\n\\- Basically every aspect of my life is something that they are morally against. My friends, my     \njob, my hobbies, everything.  \n\n\nMost of the things I've listed about myself are things they don't know about me, or at the least, I haven't told them if they do know. \n\nAs for my job, I started drawing porn professionally about 1 year ago now and so far its been a wonderful career decision, right now I make more than twice what I made working for my father a year ago and my income grows every month.  I tell them that I draw custom DnD campaign commissions which are private, but beyond that I try to keep discussion of my work very vague. Note that they also are against DnD, however I'm certain they would find it preferable over gay porn. \n\nI generally visit them once a week. over the past several years I've found it increasingly difficult to share anything with them, it seems like every few months that go by we have less in common. How can I tell them what goes on in my life without causing them pain or disappointment? We can't even watch most current television together as they won't watch anything with gay characters, too much swearing, or sex. \n\nWe seem to have settled into a routine where I come over, we watch AFV and eat, throughout the night we exchange some basic niceties, I go home usually after around 3 hours. I feel terrible as it must look like I'm just coming over out of obligation given how little we talk.  \n\nDespite our opposing views, I love my parents and want them to be happy. But how can they be happy when their only son lives a life they must condemn? \n\nMy parents, aside from some of their religious views, are really very kindhearted and have been very generous to me. They're not very confrontational, and neither am I. In some way I feel like this plays a part in the fact that we don't really talk much. \n\nAlso, I rent from them. Although I'm looking into moving soon. \n\nAgain please forgive all the talk of religion and politics, I don't intend for this to spark any debate, I just posted here in hopes of getting more neutral feedback vs posting in an explicitly religious (or anti-religious) sub.\n\n  TL;DR,   MY parents are die hard Christian Conservatives. I'm a stoner gay porn artist and their only child. What do I do?",

        "content": "I am 27/F. I had a \"friend\" back in high school. He was 2 grades below me. We first met at a dance at school, then we started texting. He texted me for 2 years in high school and then 2 years once we are out of high school. We were never in a relationship. He had tried to pursue me, but I never liked him in that way. He was nice at first. He texted me a lot, greeted me on my birthday and every holidays. But he also didn't seen like a real friend, because he never knew who I was and we never had any conversations in person, and he never wanted to talk on the phone. Whenever we were together in person, something he did bothered me so much. He always wanted to use me for something and touch me. He couldn't control himself from touching me when he was around me. He always wanted to dance, grind his body against me, touch my butt, feel my body.\n\nIt all ended after 4 years when I told him I didn't like him touching me ever again. I told him I didn't ever want to be his girlfriend and that I was a lesbian. He said, \"I see there is nothing for me with you so bye. There is nothing you have to offer me. I used you, but if I have to lie, cheat, and steal, then I will do anything to get what I want.\"\n\nWe got into a fight and he hurled insults at me. He said, \"All I did in high school was protect you in all the behind the scenes you never saw. I never told you that people always made fun of me for hanging out with you. They all said that you are weird and nobody knows what think of you.\" He blocked me on everything and never texted me again. That was 7 years ago. Then a few years after that, I created different accounts and begged him to add me. Unblock me. Message me. And whenever he responded, he was so rude to me. He said, \"**** yourself already **. I can't wait for the day you die so I can * on your grave.\" I even asked him, \"Why did you make me feel like I meant nothing to you?\" \"Because you do mean nothing to me? I do not know what you want me to say.\"\n\nHe didn't even want to be my friend without trying to be my boyfriend or without taking advantage of me. So what happened to those 4 years of texting me and being nice? Did he just pretend that whole time just to get what he wanted? Now all I am left with is regret. I wish I didn't tolerate him longer than I did. I wish I never even gave him my number. I wasted so much time texting him when I could have done productive things. He stopped talking to me, I wanted him to talk to me for the rest of my life.\n\nHe doesn't even care about me and wonder what I am doing in life, where I am in life. He doesn't even remember that I was the person he always texted in high school for 4 years. 27 years old now, and I am still waiting for a message from him. Like one day he wakes up and realizes his mistake and texts me like we did before.\n\nTldr: This guy in high school stopped talking to me for 7 years now. I am still waiting for a message from him. Am I waiting for a message that will never be sent?",

        "content": "I don\u2019t know how to pick a better post title but I will try my best to describe.\n\nA little background, I\u2019m female in mid 30s (youngest)and my sister (oldest) is in mid 40s. Growing up we never got to live together much because of some family dynamics, she grew up at my aunt\u2019s and I with my parents until I left my country to pursue better studies in US. Back in home country there was my oldest, middle sister and my mom. Fast forward, I only got to visit them couple of times while my mom got really sick twice and passed away in 2020. My both sisters stayed with my mom till her last breath and I couldn\u2019t go visit them because of my health issues related to pregnancy and then because of the pandemic. Fast fast forward, she\u2019s now in states and came to our house couple of times and then we decided around new year to go visit her too. She\u2019s married no kids. It was a spontaneous plan. So it was me, hubby and our two kiddos who she absolutely adores. We initially planned for staying 10-15 days ish because it was a long drive of about 18 hours and we were going to visit her for the first time. Anyways, I end up deciding that I\u2019ll stay another week (after already spending two weeks) however few of other family members made comments that it\u2019s not nice to live that long and basically I\u2019m just over staying and not thinking about my sister and her husband (who however did not object to anything about our stay). But then after 2 weeks I started feeling that maybe we are being too much for my sister, we were trying to share groceries with them or buy food whenever we could. My sister having gone through a lot in past years have little low tolerance level, she commented how kids are too noisy and that she can\u2019t eat in their presence, etc, then yesterday for the first time in so many years we asked her to watch kids for couple hours so that we can go out for shopping/dinner, she sort of bluntly told us she can\u2019t manage them for more than 2 hours. We only went to one shop, ate and left as I was feeling indebted to her and got them some food as well as thank you gesture. Meanwhile my aunt calls me and sort of makes me feel bad that I\u2019m still at my sister\u2019s house (in our culture it\u2019s a big no no to go stay at married sister\u2019s house) so I felt bad and started feeling embarrassed. Next day (today) I wake up, go downstairs and my sister told me that how my husband is leaving dishes outside the sink after late night snacking. I know my husband does that at home as well so I was even more embarrassed, she told me not to say this to my husband but I did any way because he has made me embarrassed by not following the rules of a house when visiting my family, my family is very particular about cleanliness and all that so I already feel like an outcast. Anyways this really made me upset I asked my husband to let\u2019s just pack the bags and leave.  \nNow my sister comes to know of this and she thinks that I\u2019m blaming her entirely. Which is not entirely true either because I was already feeling bad because of my aunt\u2019s remarks about our stay and on top of that my sister\u2019s comments about kids and my husband made me felt like that it\u2019s a signal to leave now.\nWe are on our way back to home now but I\u2019m also feeling bad having hurt my sister and leaving in a hurry. I hugged her before we left, my husband apologized to her and then I also texted her.\n\nTLDR; left my sister\u2019s house abruptly feeling we overstayed and from some of her remarks I felt like I was going beyond her tolerance level. But I\u2019m feeling bad and she thinks I disrespected her. What should I do?",

In the past year, there have been numerous occasions where my bf\u2019s roommate, let\u2019s call him Liam, has pulled aside my bf to discuss my bf and I\u2019s relationship while I was there. Despite obvious attempts at being discreet, I have heard these conversations as they occurred within hearing distance. I told my bf that I was uncomfortable with them talking about our relationship/ me while I\u2019m right there, and that I didn\u2019t appreciate his roommates constant fishing for details. Since the last time this occurred, maybe 4 months ago, things have been fine on that front.\n\nToday, I opened up to my bf about my personal financial struggles. I am a student in University struggling with heavy debts and tuition/rent etc. I told my bf that I struggle telling people about this as I have a lot of shame attached to it. Moments later, my bf and Liam went to pick something up in Liam\u2019s car. When they returned, my bf told me casually that he had discussed my situation with Liam. I was unhappy when he told me this, as I did not consent to Liam knowing about this sensitive issue I am facing. Also, Liam is very well off financially and has a history of putting others down for their financial issues, so I definitely wouldn\u2019t have shared that info with him it were up to me. My bf apologized and said he wanted to respect this boundary from now on.\n\nA few hours later, they once again were having a conversation within my hearing distance. I overheard my bf whispering to Liam not to bring up my finances as I was uncomfortable with it. Liam joked about how he would be bringing it up and calling me \u2018poor\u2019 everyday, and they both laughed. I was happy after my first conversation with my bf, but this once again caused me discomfort, though I know Liam was joking about how ridiculous it would be if he actually did bring it up like that.\n\nI haven\u2019t told my bf that I overheard this yet. I wish I hadn\u2019t. But this makes me uncomfortable to be in my bf\u2019s home and around Liam. So, I thought I\u2019d come here for some advice.\n\nTL;DR: my bf told his best friend/roommate about my sensitive financial situation, and after I expressed my discomfort over this, my bf told him not to bring it up and I then overheard them joking about calling me poor.",

        "title": "Should I reach out to erratic sister?",
        "content": "My (30F) sister (31F) and I have always had a contentious relationship. In our childhood, she was pretty cruel to me (name calling, blaming me for things that weren\u2019t my fault, etc), but our relationship has slowly been improving as we move to adulthood. \n\nFor background (it\u2019s long but makes more sense when you know more):\n\nWhen I when I was in college about 10 years ago, my dad\u2019s business went bankrupt and my sister dropped out of college. She says he pressured her to drop out, he says she dropped out anyway and so he asked her to help him with his business. Idk which is true but I\u2019m inclined to believe my dad. My mom (60F) was furious that she dropped out of school and she and my sister stopped speaking for several months because my sister felt my mom was \u201cpressuring her to go back to school and being judgmental\u201d and so on. After about 4-5 months, they patched things up. \n\nAbout 3 years later, as she continued to help my dad and not be in school, She and my dad (74M) cut ties because (from my understanding) she was stealing from him (though she says he made her take out a bunch of credit cards in her name after he declared bankruptcy). Again, I don\u2019t know all the details or who is lying/telling the truth, but I\u2019m compelled to believe my dad\u2019s side since my sis has not been the most honest person to anyone in her life. She moved back in with my mom and my mom believed her, and thought my dad was lying and was eating up whatever my sister told her. \n\nWhen COVID hit, my sister was laid off from her retail job, and, from what my mom says, she became suicidal. My dad helped my sister by sending her money to help with her rent. My sister never thanked him (according to my dad) or even acknowledged that he did anything to help her. My dad will ask about her and I\u2019ll tell him what I know (which isn\u2019t a ton, I mostly get info from what my mom tells me). He says he wishes her well and hope she is doing okay. \n\nFast forward to today, my mom, sister and I have a group chat where we mainly just share pics of our animals and my mom will send photos of her sewing projects. Today, my mom showed a photo of a jacket she is working on. My sister texted back \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck. Please don\u2019t contact me ever again.\u201d I called my mom and asked her what was going on and she said she had no idea. She and my sister spoke a few days ago (they talked very frequently, though I have no idea about what), but she said it was \u201cnormal.\u201d My mom asked if I would be willing to ask my sister what\u2019s going on. I said I wasn\u2019t really comfortable doing that since we aren\u2019t close and I doubt she would tell me anything anyway. My mom said that we fine and she would keep trying her. My mom called my sister\u2019s work and she didn\u2019t answer. My mom thinks she saw my mom\u2019s number and hung up on her. \n\nNow I\u2019m worried because my sister has lost my dad, and is now cutting my mom off (it seems) and she doesn\u2019t really even have me that much. She basically has no one now and I\u2019m scared she will be suicidal again. Idk what to say to my sister or if I should say anything. I don\u2019t want to get berated and insulted like she normally does when she is upset, and she can be very hurtful. Idk if I should get involved or not and really need help. \n\n\nTl;dr: my sister may be suicidal, but idk if I should reach out to her or not, based on past abuse from her.",

        "content": "Hi all. \n\nIn short, I am realising I am performing controlling behaviour and being controlling. It is making me very unhappy and of course makes the recipient even more unhappy.\n\nIn short, when in a relationship I was always very insecure and always wanted to know what my partner was doing and with who. If she laughed at a text message I wanted to know what it was about. I always told myself that this was because I like having everything be shared within a relationship. Sharing all that happens to me is a sign of being close. But in reality, I wanted to know everything to put my insecurities to rest. I was also forcing my view of sharing in a relationship on her which also wasn't fair. My (ex) partner of course did not like this, it made her share even less, which made me more insecure. A couple weeks ago our relationship ended. Not just because of this, but of course it was part of it.\n\nNow we are broken up but we still live together for now. We don't have a good place to stay for a longer period of time so still stay in the same house until we sort our this house and future living situations. In the mean time, I am freaking out even more about who she is talking to, if she's sleeping with other people already, etc. Guess how I'm dealing with that? Of course, by trying to be controlling. I'm trying to figure out who she talks to, who she is seeing, etc. This was unhealthy and unfair behaviour while we were in a relationship and is probably even worse now.\n\nSo, what do I want from you people? I'm mostly interested to hear from people who are going through or have gone through the same. For people that have not experienced this it probably seems very easy: just stop! But it's fking hard to do that's for sure. So, anyone that has any insights on this?\n- how do I stop with this behaviour?\n- how do I cope with the insecure and awful feelings instead?\n- both interested in how I create more healthy behaviour in the long run as well as how to deal with it in the short term.\n\nPlease don't be mean. I know this behaviour is unhealthy and not fair to my ex. But I am trying to improve.\n \nThanks for your insights.\n\nTL;DR I realise I'm having controlling behaviour and am looking for advice as to how to stop it, both for myself and the people around me",

But despite all these friends I\u2019ve surrounded myself with, I\u2019m incredibly lonely. I have no close friends. I\u2019m invited a lot, but never when it is only a close knit group. I\u2019ve never been referred to as someone\u2019s closest friend. I am never the first preference. This itself doesn\u2019t bother me much, but the worst of it is I feel I have no one to lean on. I have nobody to open up to. No one ever checks on me, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable enough around anyone to ever open up because I don\u2019t feel the *closeness* others do.

        "title": "I [23M] am having nightmares about my ex-girlfriend [30M]; I fell sick this morning; she will not give my clothes back.",
        "content": "I wrote other posts here about my break-up, which was somewhat peaceful. My ex-girlfriend was a very confusing person, in which she would tell me she wanted to be a mother and also that she was not sure about her sexuality in the same sentence. Eventually, after a year of this, I finally broke up with her after she said she was not sure if she was a monogamous person or not. Also, she took medicine for depression and anxiety, and she would frequently drink a lot. \n\nAfter our break-up, I blocked her number. Then, I had to unblock it because I needed to get my clothes back. I sent her a message telling her not to worry about sending it through mail since it would be way expensive. She agreed and said she wanted to talk to me about the break-up. I said, sure, come to my house on January 4. I kept waiting for her all the days prior to the encounter, very anxious about it. Then, one day before, she canceled and said she would not be able to be here at the day (she is moving places) and offered me to drop my clothes without a conversation. Since I knew she was actually very busy, I told her to chill about it and just bring it here after she moved. Then, time passed and, as I am on vacation from college, I could not stop thinking about her. Therefore, since I had her birthday present, which I bought before the breakup, I wrote a small letter wishing her the best and apologize for my mistakes. In the letter, I said she should not feel guilty about anything, since we were all confused and broken. I told her that everything was forgiven. \n\nA couple of days passed and she sent me a message yesterday saying that she loved the gift and that she was sorry for the relationship to have ended. Also, she said she would like to meet me in the future, where she would be more stable emotionally and without insecurities, in which she would 'offer her hand to me so we can live our love in the best way possible. \n\nTo be honest, I just want things to break up already. I do not believe exes should be friends, and I do not see myself with her in the future. I spent all holidays by myself since the breakup (read the other post) and went through hell. Still, except for my clothes, I did not message her at all or try to persuade her into staying. Honestly, I just want her to move on with her life and find the best path for herself. I've forgiven everything that happened and just want to move on with my life, despite the enormous pain. \n\nAnyway, I replied to her message with a long one, saying that we should not think about 'our' future together right now, since breeding hopes is a very painful way to move from a breakup. Also, I said that I did not see myself with her in the future. I know it might sound harsh, but it's the truth. I went through a lot of emotional pain with this woman, especially because she would never be sure if she wanted to be with me or have other relationships with people. As our relationship went on, I would always ask, in the most respectful/understandable way I could, if she had made her mind about her sexuality. She would always reply she was not sure about it. \n\nAt the end of my last message, I told her that I just wanted my clothes back, so I could cut ties and move forward. Expecting her messages make me very anxious, and keeps me from moving forward. \n\nAnyway, she has not replied to me since. Actually, I believe she did not even read the message. I know that she moved already and it since her house is close, it would cost very little for her to send me a Uber with my clothes. Yesterday, I kept checking my phone all day, waiting for her to reply. I was very anxious. \n\nShe did not reply to me all day, despite being online. \n\nYesterday I had nightmares of her having sex with other people, which was horrible and, I believe, was the product of me thinking about her and expecting her message all day. I woke up today literally sick, with fever, sore throat, and vomiting. I am not sure if this is related to my event, but who knows. \n\nWhat should I do? Should I call her? I just want my clothes back so we can cut ties completely. This waiting is damaging my mental health since I stay at home all day. Should I be understandable and just wait? She shaved her head yesterday, I am not sure how it impacted her self-esteem since it was also very low.\n\n TLDR: I am having nightmares about my ex-girlfriend and the fact that she will not give my clothes back is not helping.",

        "content": "In advance, I am sorry, this is going to be a painfully long post.\n\nSo.  My relationship with my parents is not good, especially with my mom.  There is a lot here, I'll try to summarize. My mom is a controlling  woman, especially toward my sister (25) and I. This led to several  fights (I already posted about one), especially for the last few years, because I have been seeing a  therapist which helped me realizing the toxic behaviors. The therapy,  as well as my SO (M28) who's been a great support here, allowed me to be  more confident and to be able to stand up for myself in front of my  mom. As a result, she never tried to acknowledge my now spouse (who I  think she holds responsible for stealing her well-behaved daughter and  turning me against her), and pretty much ignored them everytime we saw  her, which has been a real pain, esp for my spouse.\n\nSo  when we decided to get married last year, even though my parents seemed  supportive, they have been quite a pain to work with during the  preparation of the wedding. They wouldn't listen to our wishes, she  wanted to be involved in the prep but only but doing whatever she  wanted, like imposing a color that wasn't on the decoration plan for  example. But most importantly, she projected the frustrations she had  for her own wedding on ours (especially because her mother wasn't alive  for her wedding, and she couldn't do all the thing she'd wished to do  with her). There has been a lot of tension with my parents during this  wedding preparation generally. In the end, on the wedding day, when they  spoke during the ceremony, they managed to read a very sweet text, but  right after that they made some proselytism for what we then discovered  to be some sort of cult. A very misplaced moment, where they handed out  buttons of the \"charity\" to everyone in the room, making sure everyone  would put it on. In a pretty much perfect wedding, they managed to  create the only \"bad moment\". It was invasive, misplaced, and we read  that as a way to impose themselves in our wedding. We decided to talk  for a moment with them the next day and it went poorly. My mom took it  very badly, she asked my spouse to shut up because she wanted to talk to  me, she threatened me to break off all ties...\n\nIt's  been six month since our wedding. Since then, my spouse moved to the US  for their job, which is far away since we are from France. My parents  started to try to build a relationship with them, by calling them from  time to time to get some news. This made me accept to see my mother and  we are on our way to see a therapist together to clear things and maybe  build a healthier relationship.\n\nNow  for the reason of my post : for their coming 30th wedding anniversary,  my father asked my mom to \"remarry\" him on Christmas day. They would do  it next summer, so a year after us. Since I have been spending the  holidays in the US with my spouse, I learnt about it over the phone.  Also, we just got back from our honeymoon vacation in NYC, and they  asked for our recommendations because they want also to go there for  their honeymoon next winter. We feel very weird about all of  this. A  wedding anniversary doesn't have to be a \"remarriage\", and choosing to  do that one year after being such AH at our wedding, it reads as  provocative to us. Even though I don't think this is a mischievous act,  this remains widely inconsiderate imo. Also, I fear that it would become  a wedding to \"fix\" what we did wrong according to them, to fix their  frustrations.\n\nSo we don't really  know how to react. I am going to have a word with my dad about that, but  I am not sure we can do much. I am aware of the toxicity of my mother  and that my father is nothing more than an enabler here, I will keep  standing for myself and my spouse's, but in the meantime I am not ready  to cut ties with my parents. I really don't think the \"remarriage\" has  anything to do with us, I feel like there is an elephant in the room  here only my spouse and I can see. I feel legitimate in my feelings but I  fear my options are limited. I think I can either 1) ignore the thing,  do the polite thing to go to the remarriage and nothing more 2) talk to  them for them to realize the situation 3) refuse their BS and cut ties.  This post is to get some input on the situation. Do you see other  options here ? I know I have the bad habit to grin and bear it but I am  not alone in this and this situation is weighing a lot on my spouse.\n\nThanks a lot for reading and for your input :)\n\nTL;DR!  Last summer I got married and my parents have been a pain during the  months of preparation, and promoted their cult during the ceremony. For  their 30th wedding anniversary next summer, they decided to \"remarry\"  and go to the same honeymoon we went to. I feel weird about all this.",

        "title": "How do I get my [26F] husband [26M] to stop embarrassing me?",
        "content": "My husband is driving me completely insane. Every time I hear him on the phone or speaking to other people, he'll inevitably say something that's embarrassing to me without even clicking that he's doing it. Every time I bring it up, he just says \"oh, I didn't think of it like that\" or \"I didn't mean it that way\" - which doesn't help. He also appears to either pay no attention to our lives or to have some kind of memory problem because he frequently tells people things that are completely incorrect - and, as a result, often it's something I've already told people and I end up looking like a liar or a fantasist when he gives his amended version. It's not intentional I don't think because he does it to himself too - constantly undermines his own achievements or puts himself down without realising at all what he's doing.\n\nA few examples:\n\nI recently won a prestigious competition in my field which will open up a huge number of opportunities for me. It is, without a doubt, the greatest professional achievement of my life so far and I can't see me matching it any time soon. However, whenever he would tell anyone that I won, he'd preface it by completely undermining it and hedging in details that made it sound far less prestigious than it is - things like stating that there were certain restrictions on who could enter the competition. Everything he said was completely true but he went out of his way to add details that made it sound less impressive.\n\nHe also recently got a job offer. It's a very prestigious job, pays really well, I'm really really really proud of him. However, he first applied for the job a year ago and they turned him down in favour of someone else. Now another position has opened up and they contacted him to offer the position. When my husband told everyone about the job, instead of saying \"great news, I've been offered a new job...\" he would start by saying \"well, a year ago I applied for a job and they rejected me...\". It's completely true but he's gone into the conversation by making himself look like sloppy seconds and talking about a failure. His justification when I asked him why is just \"well, it's true\". Well, yeah, lots of things are true but you don't have the phrase absolutely every single thing in the most negative light ever. \n\nToday, he got a phone call from his friend who's getting married. My husband is the best man and our son is a page boy. They were discussing getting shoes for my son and my husband said \"yeah, we really struggle to find him brown shoes\". This is completely untrue. My husband has mixed up when we were trying to find him black school shoes but, because he's only 2, there were none in his size and all the smart shoes were in brown. It makes us seem completely incompetent - if his friend happens to spend three seconds on Google, he'll think we're complete idiots. I know this seems like a complete non-issue but it demonstrates that it is literally every single conversation that he has with someone. There's only so many times someone can hear that their friend's wife is incapable of doing really basic things (like buying shoes for their own child) before they build a picture that she's an out-and-out muppet.\n\nLast week, he was talking to my sister's husband about getting new windows on their place as we'd just got new windows on ours. My sister's husband asked how much ours cost and my husband gave completely the wrong figure (out by many, many thousands of pounds), at which point my brother in law asked him for the details of our window people (who were awful and we had a load of problems and delays with) and my husband went to give him the details. I had to step in and say it wasn't at all the price we paid and we weren't happy with the window people at all so we wouldn't be recommending them. This made me look really controlling and almost like I'm gaslighting my husband - and my husband couldn't recognise that it looked like he was recommending my sister and her husband use our window people (which would've come back to bite us when they get the same service we did and they wonder why we set them up).\n\nOver Christmas, we visited my dad and I was telling him about an opportunity that came up for me recently (as a result of the competition above) and I mentioned how much the salary for that opportunity was. My husband, despite being there the entire time, five seconds later said what the salary was. But, naturally, he got it wrong and said it was \u00a325,000 lower than it actually is. So, I looked like a liar. He was at the table, in the same conversation, he heard me say the salary and still went out of his way to say the incorrect salary. I'm left either looking like I'm lying or that my husband pays no attention to me - I'm embarrassed either way.\n\nIt's been going on for years. When our son was a few months old, we were staying with my mum. Our son had been up all night and it was now 6am - I'd done all the looking after all night. I asked my husband if he could look after our son and maybe take him downstairs so I could sleep. At around 8am, I went downstairs. My mum was there and asked how I was and I said \"tired\". My husband said \"you can't be tired, you've just woken up\". He completely failed to mention I'd had two hours sleep and he'd had a whole night (albeit an early start). And his justification, as per usual, was \"well, it's true\". He doesn't recognise at all that things can be both true and misleading at the same time. We'd been discussing literally the day before how my mother was being overly controlling with our son and was very judgmental of my parenting and, now, he's gone and made me look like a lazy parent right in front of her!\n\nAnother example, about two months ago, I was going for a run and he asked why I was using his water bottle. I said it wasn't his bottle, it was mine. He then ran me through exactly when he bought it - except he'd mixed us up. It was me. I had bought it there, at that time, not him. We'd gone to the gym together (years prior) and I'd forgot my bottle so I bought a new one at the front desk - but he'd managed to remember it that he had forgotten his bottle so he'd bought a new one at the front desk. This wasn't an embarrassing issue but it's the kind of thing I mean, he completely mixes up events he's literally witnessed so when he tells things to people incorrectly, I look crazy if I either correct him or have previously told a different (accurate) version.\n\nHow do I address this? I feel as though everyone in our lives has a shitty opinion of us because every achievement completely undersold, every possible failure is broadcast widely (even imaginary failures) and I'm coming across like I'm a lying, manipulative gaslighter because he can't remember basic facts or events. The generic response from him is \"people just don't care as much as you think they do\" and he doesn't seem to recognise that I care when I'm constantly being put in this position. This isn't a recent issue with his memory or anything so I don't think it's medical.\n\nI recognise I'm probably more sensitive than most in this respect. I'm the youngest in a competitive family and have never, ever been acknowledged for my achievements. I always played second fiddle to my closest brother who, even though I always did objectively better, always got praised. When I got As and he got Cs, he'd get rewarded and I'd get ignored, for example. My husband's family are also very judgemental of me as I've \"married up\" and they didn't really warm to me for a great number of years, and him constantly putting me down without meaning to played a major role in that.\n\nTL;DR: My husband keeps either adding in irrelevant details or stating (often, incorrect) facts that make us look bad. He doesn't seem to care that it's affecting me.",

        "content": "Has anyone had success at friends with benefits?\n\n\nI (M22) recently (a few months ago) got out of a long term relationship (7 years with a 2 year break in the middle) and I\u2019m not looking to find love again right now, however I would like to be romantic with women and not just have meaningless sex.\n\nI plan on communicating this with whomever I have any sort of romance with. The last thing I want to do is lead anyone on.\n\n**TL;DR I\u2019ve had a few FWB in the past, but I\u2019m curious to hear about successes and failures of others. I\u2019ve started talking to someone and we both know that we aren\u2019t looking for a relationship. My goal is to figure out a middle ground of enjoying the time I spend with said person outside more than strictly physical, without getting into a serious relationship.**\n\n\n\n\n*Edit: I think it would be helpful to explain my situation and experience a bit more for those who want to read.*\n\nThe relationship I mentioned above was the only one I\u2019ve had and the only person I\u2019ve ever been in love with. We started dating when I was 15 (she\u2019s a year younger) and broke up when I went to college.\n\nWe were both each other\u2019s only sexual experience.\n\nWe stayed in touch as friends (hooked up every once in a while), but we decided we couldn\u2019t be friends because we wouldn\u2019t be able to move on.\n\nOne of first thing I did was have sex with a random tinder girl, didn\u2019t have a great time but I figured just cause it was random and the first time it was strictly physical.\n\nI then got into a FWB with a girl at my university I grew up with. She was my 7th grade crush who I asked out and she curved me, but it worked out when I tried as an adult lol.\n\nWe had both just gotten out of a long term relationship and knew we didn\u2019t want to date, but we would still hangout a lot (usually with at least one other friend). It got to a point where I thought I wanted to start looking for a relationship (even though in hindsight I wasn\u2019t ready at all) and we had to stop the physical part and remained friends.\n\nIt worked out fine and we ended up hooking up a few more times before I left to go study abroad. Going into my experience I wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship and I wanted to focus on personal growth.\n\nThere were 40 people in my program, and 36 of them were girls. Safe to say my 19 year old hormones kicked in and I started hooking up with some of them.\n\nOne girl in particular (we\u2019ll call her Janet) was hyper sexual and loved drinking/partying so I spent significantly more time with her, but we would hangout besides just having sex occasionally too. \n\nAnother girl (we\u2019ll call her Lisa) was an innocent girl who never drank and had no sexual experience. I had a mini crush on her, but my roommate did too and I told myself no relationships, so I never did anything about it.\n\nFast forward to the last month of studying abroad and Lisa expresses to me that she is really into me. I apologize and tell her I wasn\u2019t looking for something serious, so it\u2019s best if we don\u2019t keep hanging out. I felt terrible cause I really did like her.\n\nBy this time Janet and I were basically girlfriend/boyfriend minus the commitment and title. We would text constantly, went on multiple vacations (one of which was a beach getaway with just the two of us), and I would always bring her around my host family (which I guess is the study abroad version of meeting parents). \n\nIt got to a point where I\u2019d get jealous if she would flirt with other dudes when we were out, and one time I got mad at her and asked if she was gonna go fuck another dude.\n\nI apologized that night and told her that I felt awful about it, we never talked about being exclusive so I had no right to be mad.\n\nFast forward to the last week, and I found out Janet had been sleeping w random dudes at the club. Despite having that conversation a few weeks ago, I was pretty hurt. \n\nWe talked about it and I told her that she didn\u2019t make a mistake as we never talked about being exclusive, but it made me feel like the physical aspect of our relationship meant so much less.\n\nThis was the first girl I had consistent sex with besides my ex, and the first experience I had not using a condom, so it meant a lot to me.\n\nShe was more experienced than me and told me it still meant something to her, and if she knew how it would\u2019ve made me feel she wouldn\u2019t have gotten with other dudes.\n\nI\u2019m still friends with both girls (occasionally check in via text a couple times a year, but they live far so we never see each other), and I learned a lot from these experiences.\n\nThe most important thing I learned besides the importance of communication was that I didn\u2019t like strictly physical relationships, and I felt ready to start dating again.\n\nOf course this is the same time my ex hits me up to reconnect, and we end up getting back together, but in a much healthier way than our previous relationship.\n\nWe end up dating for the next two and half years up until this past October. We were long distance and both need space to work on ourselves. We are still friends and have hooked up a couple times since then.\n\nThis time around I decided to really focus on myself, rather than worry about the next girl. Aside from losing my best friend, it\u2019s been great.\n\nIve been focusing a ton of energy into my physical/mental health, dynamics with my friends, and figuring out my career.\n\nI feel ready to begin romancing again, but the most important thing is to keep the momentum going I\u2019ve worked for in terms of personal growth.\n\nI\u2019ve started up on dating apps, but haven\u2019t actually gone on a date from them yet. About a month ago one of my best friend\u2019s put me on with one of her best friends I didn\u2019t know, and we ended up dancing/making out at the club.\n\nWe went on one date (which went great) and all planned on going on a ski trip together this weekend. I\u2019m also aware through my friend that she isn\u2019t looking for a relationship.\n\nWe go to this ski trip (this past weekend) with about 6 of us, and I end up clicking much better with one of their other friends. We talk about how we are both getting out of long term relationships and are looking to continue focusing on us, but things got very flirty.\n\nI decided to make no moves on the trip and wait to see how things play out, but I plan on pursuing the girl who I vibe with much better.",

Am I being overly sensitive to her criticisms.\n\nMy Fianc\u00e9 and I have been together for a year and a half and living together for 5 months.  Since moving in it has become readily apparent that she is extremely set in her ways and offers criticisms and opinions at a minimum of 3-5 times a day.

        "content": "Let's call this friend of mine \"M\" for now. I'd like to start by saying how sad all of this is making me. I truly have valued M's friendship for years and consider him to be one of my closer friends. One of the things I most appreciated was his respect for me and the fact that everything was (at least it seemed to me) purely platonic. One of the reasons I trusted him initially is that he has been in a multiple year long relationship with his girlfriend and they seemed to be happy and well together. Never spoke ill of her. In the past M and I have worked on class work together just the two of us, and have hung out in group settings outside of class many times which was always gone well. Many times his girlfriend has come out as well and I've met her, enjoyed talking to her as well. Each time I saw them together I was more reassured that M truly only saw me as a friend, and that made me really happy. \n\nThis next part makes me a little sick to my stomach to think about. We went out for drinks just the two of us for the first time last week. I was a bit worried about things being weird, but I decided to go and just see how things went. Now I wish I hadn't. \n\nLong story short, amongst other things became clear that he is planning on breaking up with his girlfriend. I also suspect from everything that happened that he is starting to feel out and act more flirty towards me as preparation for when him and his girlfriend break up. He didn't do anything directly but there were a lot of things that he did that caused me to realize he might want to be more than friends once him and his girlfriend break up. \n\nI can't stop overthinking everything he has done in the past now, wondering if he really meant things as a friend or if he's had other intentions all along. I'm really heartbroken and sad thinking about it. But aside from that, I need to do damage control now. Sadly, M and I will have many classes together in the future. So ghosting is out of the question, I will be seeing him often and would like things to be normal when I see him. I don't know if this is possible, but is there any way to preemptively friendzone him so that things can be normal? He hasn't said anything outright yet but I know it's coming and I'm really stressed thinking about it. I don't know that I can go back to being as close of friends with him as before, but I do really enjoy his company and have enjoyed and valued his friendship greatly before all of this happened. \n\nSo is there any way to preemptively friendzone him, so things can be normal in classes and otherwise next year? I'd really like to preserve our friendship as much as possible. \n\nTl:Dr; my friend has been hinting he wants to be more than just friends, all I want is to preserve our friendship.",

        "content": "My roommate (30M) and I (27F) recently welcomed a new housemate (25F) in November.  Let\u2019s call her Jane.  We had a difficult time screening applicants and chose her after interviewing a batch of bad candidates, thinking she seemed the most responsible and able to pay rent of the bunch.  Although the lease started in December, we allowed her to move in a few days early in November at her request.  On December 1st, the day rent was due, she came to me visibly upset and said she didn\u2019t have the full amount ready yet, and asked if she could pay 1 week late.  I felt really bad for her, knowing full well everyone has a rough time occasionally, and said that I would let the landlord know that she\u2019d be paying on the 7th.  Jane stated that this never happens and that it would be a one time occurrence. \n\nA week goes by and Jane didn\u2019t have the full amount yet, so she asked my other roommate, Kevin, if she could pay in a few more days.  He said that the landlord again requested it on the 7th, so Kevin paid her share by himself and asked that she pay him directly.  She did, one week later.  About a week ago, Kevin informed me that Jane had still not paid her share for January, nor the electric, and had requested another week.  He said he told the landlord, who begrudgingly agreed to the new due date but asked that February\u2019s be on time.  \n\nKevin and I then started discussing how Jane was constantly at the house throughout December to now, and didn\u2019t seem to be going to her 1st job, which she initially stated has a very early morning shift.  She also said she does DoorDash on the side, but we still don\u2019t often see her leave the house.\n\nKevin\u2019s boyfriend, who is temporarily staying with us, has come down with COVID today.  After the boyfriend told us via text, Jane quickly went out to the store for a rapid test and told us it was positive.  In the group text, she then made a point of saying she wouldn\u2019t be able to work.  So far, she is asymptomatic. Kevin and I are nervous that she said this to get out of or delay paying rent.  We\u2019re trying to maintain a good relationship with the landlord since the rent is very cheap for our area ($500 a person per month), but we do acknowledge that if she has COVID, she can\u2019t work.  Still, I\u2019m concerned that there\u2019s a pattern developing here and I\u2019m not sure what to do.  Kevin says that if she\u2019s late in February and/or March that he wants to ask her to find a new living situation.\n\nI\u2019m not even sure if I have a specific question to ask here; half of it is venting, half of it is an open-ended request for advice. Thanks anyway.\n\nTL;DR: Our new roommate has been paying rent and utilities very late while seemingly not going to work regularly.",

        "content": "  \n\\-Arguments about me wanting him to compliment my photos that I send to him. He means I am doing it for him so I shouldn't be expecting anything in return. He said it makes me selfish and that I am doing it for myself and not him. I just want him to acknowledge my photos and motivate me, since taking photos of myself is tough for me.\n\n\\-Arguments where he will say a \"mean\" spirited jokes directed at me, and I take it a bit too personal. It will hurt my feelings and I will reach out to him. I tell him why it hurt my feelings and he always responds with that I am overreacting and that I need to grow up. ''Take a joke.''  \nHonestly, sometimes I think I might be overreacting and our argument usually ends up with me apologizing and promising that I will work on myself.  \nI don't have the best self esteem, and some jokes can really hit home. Jokes about me being useless, stupid or forgettable are jokes most couples would just brush off and play back with a \"oh you are so mean,\" but for me those kind of jokes are hard to swallow. I feel like I am being immature and too soft which creates these arguments where I wish for him to apologize or understand that what he said hurt my feelings.   \nHis opinion is again that I need to grow a thick skin and I cant give this much power to words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Other arguments where I have hurt his feelings, he refuses to tell me why and that I should be more self aware. He is quite mean during these times where he will tell me to shut up, be more aware, selfish etc.   \nI end up going through text messages or thinking about our calls to figure out what I have said or done to hurt his feelings.  \nAnd then I apologize for making him feel hurt after. He has told me that he believes sometimes making the other person feel bad about what they did works more than true communication. I don't agree with this, but he is so set in his opinion that discussing it only ends up with me being agreeable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-I want him to celebrate my birthday with me because its something special to me where I want to spend my time with my special someone. He doesn't see the value in this, and seems very reluctant when doing this on my day. Since we talk everyday, not video call but our voices, he means everyday is special. He has stood me up three out of five times and the two times we were together it made me feel sad because it felt like I was holding him hostage and that he wanted to be somewhere else doing something different.\n\n  \n\\-For me, honesty is very important, so even if it will hurt or worry me, I want the truth.   \nExample: He got very sick but downplayed it as just a headache. I had no idea he had plans   \nof going to the doctor and that he was actually quite ill until I later figured out when we  \nwere watching a tv show together, he was screen sharing and forgot I could see it when he opens another tab, where he googled about his illness. I confronted him about this and told him to please be open about these things with me. He on the other hand, thinks its better that if he knows i will worry about something to withhold information.  \nI asked him if he would promise to tell me whenever something happened, health issues, finance issues, whatever it might be but he refused. He will not change his mind. \n\nThis is something that is reoccurring. I find out he has withheld certain information because he means it will make me have any negative feelings when I hear it. But as I have said time and time again, its the fact that he doesn't tell me that hurts me the most. \n\n  \n\\-Video calling is something I want to do more often, but he refuses to get his own webcam. He comes up with a lot of excuses as to why he cant get one, that I first have to become more comfortable being on a webcam, that its not the same, that it wouldn't work out etc.   \nIn the end I think its him having self esteem issues, and I have told him we can work on it together. He says he doesn't care about his looks, but yet we are back to square one where he wont get a webcam. I struggle with my own self esteem but I have been on video call alone so many times, because I know it makes him happy to see me. Which makes me kind of sad that I do this for him but he refuses to even try for me. He has been on video call 2 times out of our 5 years of dating.   \nI have been on him for awhile here and there but not truly pressured him into it, as I think that's wrong of me to do, but sometimes I wonder if it is my fault nothing is happening because I am not pushing hard enough?  \nThese days when he hints that I should get on webcam or take a photo, I find myself ending up breaking promises with him because I don't want to put in the effort anymore. Which is hard for me to admit and makes me quite sad. \n\n\\-Meeting up. We live quite far away from each other and he cant get free from work. When i met him, i had just graduated high school and I was unsure about what I wanted to do in my life. So i took some time away to try find my passion. I am still a bit lost but I have found something that interests me.  \nI will be starting uni quite late though, and i will be 28 when I graduate. He says I need to focus on myself and get my life together before thinking about planning things like meeting up, our future together etc. He also have said he wants to meet up but in the past, I turned him down where I said I should have my own money when i travel down to visit him. Now its been five years and we still haven't met up nor have any solid plans to see one another.    \n\n\nWe have a lot of good moments together where we listen to music for hours, play video games or just talk about whatever kind of topic. I do feel comfortable with him but we also argue a lot. At least once a week.  It usually makes me cry and he can get quite angry where he hits his desk or throws his headset away. I have told him this anger scares me, I grew up in a abuse household, but he told me that this is his coping mechanism where mine is crying. That I shouldn't be afraid or judge his anger as he would never physically hurt someone but be accepting. That its not fair of me to tell him his anger is too much and then I go crying a lot which he find uncomfortable.   \nHe says to me that I pick fights and that I want to be \"unhappy\", which I don't feel but honestly I don't know anymore. Am I creating fights? Am I being too sensitive ? Sometimes I think I have valid opinions and emotions but I do always feel like I need to work on myself.   \n\n\nTldr: We have a lot of issues and I don't know anymore if our relationship is healthy or something I should keep holding onto in hope of fixing myself, him and us as a whole.",

        "content": "TL;DR my disabled mother is living in poor conditions, and my mentally ill stepfather does not contribute to any housework and verbally/physically abuses my mom. I don't know what to do. \n\n\n\nMy [31 M] mother [56 F] has been on disability since 2017 and has a number of health problems including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, has precancerous cells in her stomach, has survived spinal meningitis, and just basically lives with chronic pain. Because of this, she\u2019s not able to do much around the house, be on her feet for very long periods of time, or drive. I live about five hours away from her so it\u2019s difficult for me to help with anything aside from calling every week and trying to visit for important holidays.\n\nI know she values my weekly phone calls, and usually we just catch up about what TV she\u2019s watching, or the state of politics, or how her dogs are doing, but every so often she hints at and sometimes blatantly shares about how her husband [56 M] / my stepfather treats her.\n\nThey do not share a room and haven\u2019t for years. Since 2010, there has been little to no love between them.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been married since 2002 (it will be 20 years this year). They do not have any common interests. For example, my mom is very into political news and is a democrat, and my stepfather doesn\u2019t like politics, but watches OAN News and hangs out with Trump-supporting republicans that talked about wanting to have participated in the January 6th\u00a0insurrection on the Capitol. This is just one example, but when it comes to disagreements she might have with him, she just chooses to stay quiet because it\u2019s easier to just not argue.\n\nMy stepfather was adopted when he was an infant, and was made to feel not wanted in his adopted family for most of his life. When his adopted mother passed away, she did not leave him anything. When she was alive, she would belittle him and any of his accomplishments. I remember him pulling a gun on my mother and I when I was in high school and we went to live in a hotel for a few days while he calmed down. When my brother was in middle school, he choked him in a Wal-Mart, which caused him to leave and move in with my dad. He lost his job pouring concrete in December 2020 because he was caught stealing gas (something he\u2019d been doing for years while working there).\n\nI don\u2019t like to visit because the whole situation fills me with absolute sadness. The home where I spent most of my formative years is in shambles. Projects that were started years ago are still unfinished, my stepfather\u2019s laundry, dishes, and mail is piled up everywhere. Stains on the floor that I will have seen when I visited six months ago are still there. All my mother and I do when I visit is sit on her bed and watch movies, which she always falls asleep during. Lately, I\u2019ve just been booking different AirBNB\u2019s and picking up my mom and giving her a little vacation from all of it.\n\nMy mother has described my stepfather setting down an empty bowl of cereal directly onto the kitchen floor and telling her to clean it up if she doesn\u2019t like that there\u2019s dishes piled up. She\u2019s mentioned that he\u2019s pulled on one of her dogs by their neck, and then my mom had to bite his hand to get him to let go. She\u2019s tripped on an article of his clothing and broke her wrist which is really dangerous for people with my mother\u2019s conditions. He\u2019s thrown a remote control at her face bruising her eye, and he\u2019s threatened to give her more black eyes.\n\nAnytime my stepfather and I cross paths when I\u2019m visiting, he looks unwashed, wears dirty clothes, and seems either drunk or on drugs, having not slept all night, or is sleeping all day. I try to stay amiable because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done, and I\u2019m afraid to confront him about all of this because I worry about how he\u2019ll react. I\u2019ve put it to her plainly that this is abuse, that it needs to be documented and reported, and that there is nothing left worth salvaging in this relationship. After the last incident (December 2021) she said that she will threaten him with seeing a psychiatrist, or she will leave. This question of \u201cleaving\u201d has been brought up with everyone in my family and no one understands how she is still with him. One of my dreams is being able to save up enough money to buy a house with an extra room for her and getting her out.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m at a loss for what steps I can or should make. I do think that my mom needs someone else other than me to talk about this because I\u2019m beginning to reach my own emotional capacity, and I don\u2019t want to lose my mom. I think I just need some realistic advice from those who have gone through something like this. I don\u2019t like that my mom lives like this, but I feel powerless to help.",

My boyfriend is a great guy and in love with me! Should I play it safe or take the risk? \n\nI have known since middle school of my attraction to people without regard to gender, and have noticed specifically liking women since high school, but I hopped into my first long term hetero relationship at 16 during a traumatic time in my life, then straight into this relationship at 19 without letting myself get to know me and explore my attraction to women. I have been dating my boyfriend for almost two years now, and we have long term plans to stay together, however I have been avoiding words like \u201cforever\u201d and I don\u2019t talk about marriage with him or moving in. He is totally smitten with me, and I go through phases of thinking I\u2019m in love and not being sure. We started dating three months after I\u2019d been through my first long-term relationship breakup, and sometimes I have trouble keeping thoughts like \u201cwas i just lonely?\u201d away when doubt creeps in. I think he is a great guy, and I consider him truly one of my best friends. He knows about my unsure sexuality and of my attraction to women, but I feel like I\u2019ve reassured him enough times that it would still feel like a slap in the face if I came out. I don\u2019t want to lose him or his family from my life, I love him so much, but at the same time i just feel passionate and intense when I think of my experiences with women and my feelings for them that I\u2019ve had in the past, and I can\u2019t stop imagining and longing for a girlfriend of my own and all of my fantasies are with women, I struggle with attraction to any male, sadly including my boyfriend more than I care to admit. I feel like my feeling for my boyfriend may just be platonic, but I\u2019m terrified of hurting him, losing him, his family finding out, and how he\u2019d feel. These feelings about my sexuality won\u2019t go away and have been reoccurring since the beginning. Should I play it safe and stay with him? Or should I risk it and take a leap?

        "content": "My younger sister (30f) and niece (10f) live with us. She pays rent for a room that they share. \nMy family unit includes: Me(35f) Husband who travels for work 75% of the time (35m) and 2 kids (8m & 13m)\n\nWe lived across the country for 8 years and were eager to have close relationships with family when we moved back. Sister is a single mom who was living with hot mess family members in gross conditions. I let her know ahead of time I will not tolerate laziness or filth in my home. \n\nI've mentioned to her several times the things I want changed and they never do so I'm finding it necessary to be more direct. Which I'm not very comfortable with. I know she will cry and complain to everyone that I'm being unreasonable. I know this because I've heard her many complaints about how everyone else she's lived with or been friends is unreasonable. And now I see the common denominator is her. \n\nHere is my list of demands...\nVacuum bedroom weekly\nClean bathroom weekly, wash shower, No water left on bathroom floor/watch for mold\nVacuum hair in bathroom 3x a week\nBreakdown your boxes and dispose of your trash, do not pile trash in garage.\nNo food left in the sink, rinse dished\nNo trash left on counters\nNo toys/trash left in yard\nNo trash bags left on kitchen floor\n\nThey seem reasonable to me but I know she will think I'm being petty. She has said \"my idea and your idea of clean are different\" to which I want to scream \"It's my house, so my idea is what matters\". Some notes on the list, this is our first home purchase btw... she had 20+ bottles in the shower, weighed down the shower head so much it was leaking and had to be cut open and repaired. She leaves water in the corner by the tub, let's mold grow in the shower curtain, leaves hair all over the bathroom floor, doesn't change or wash the towels or bath mats, leaves it all for me. This is our hall bath that her and her daughter use (occasionally my sons but they tend to use our master bathroom) It's embarrassing when company is over and it's a mess. \n\nShe throws all her boxes and trash into the garage and leaves it there for me and my husband to deal with. Some of it is ours, so she thinks she can just add to it. We've had to make 3 trips to the landfill in 7 months and my husband is getting pissed. I've told her we want the garage clear. He wants to put gym equipment in there. But we can't with all her bins and trash. \n\nThere has been a damn donut box on the kitchen counter for 4-5 days. I refuse to throw it away because it's hers. She knows I like my kitchen clean and just dgaf. She left a trash bag on my new lvp floors overnight that leaked trash juice everywhere including under my damn fridge. Because it's my 13yo job to take out the trash. Even though they have doubled the amount of trash we have to throw out. As well as unload the dishwasher, also doubled. While her 10yo daughter is \"too young\" to do chores. The only thing she makes her do is vacuum the hair in the bathroom. And last time I asked about she'd 'been trying to get her to do it for 4 days'... \n\nShe is either completely oblivious or thinks all the cleaning is my job because I'm a sahm. But I'm also a student, a volunteer child advocate and a solo parent most of the time. \n\nShe's got 1.5yrs left to live her per our agreement. But I'm at the point of giving her the list and telling her to get it together or they have to move this summer. That's kind of an exaggeration though. I know she can't afford her own place and I wouldn't leave her homeless. \n\nThere are so many other issues I could go into. Her child is spoiled, doesn't clean up her messes, bosses my youngest around. She let's her stay up til 11pm every night when my kids go to bed at 8 and 9. She's loud and inconsiderate to my kids or I sleeping but complains when my kids make noise. She's late taking the Littles to school everyday even though I've told her she has to leave on time or I'm going to put my son on the bus and she will have to pay for aftercare for my niece. My son would be riding the bus if they weren't here but she doesn't want her daughter on the bus so I pick the kids up everyday and watch her daughter for 3-4 hours til she gets home. She doesn't seem to understand that I'm helping her while she's making my life more difficult than necessary.\n\nSo the questions are: \nHow do I handle this in a way that won't damage our relationship?\nAre my requests unreasonable to the average person? \nHow do I respond to the inevitable accusation that these are unreasonable expectations?\n\nTL;DR Sister is messy and cluttering up my clean house.",

        "title": "My (28m) girlfriend (25f) is feeling like a stranger at home",
        "content": " \n\nHi all, this is a throwaway but I wanted to advice.\n\n\u200b\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been living together for a little over a year, and have dated for about 1.5 years.\n\n\u200b\n\nShe is studying in the U.S. and is from South America. I love her to death and we have a great relationship. However, we had a small issue yesterday that I wanted to get advice on from the group on how to fix, but some quick background:\n\n\u200b\n\nWhen we first started dating (late 2020) she was working on renewing her Visa so she could start her masters. After over 18months of delays from her original Visa submission she finally got it mid last year. But because it was not renewed and took so long she was not able to start her masters or work with an inactive Visa. So in January of 2021 after dating for a few months, facing going back to her country indefinitely and giving up on her life dream of studying and finding a job here, but having no money or ability to work....I offered for her to come live with me (having lived with other significant others in serious relationships). I own my own home, so we thought it would be the best of a bad situation. We knew it would be a struggle, given how relatively new the relationship was but we have both been here before and it's honestly gone wonderful for the most part. We have been able to tackle most of the challenges with a good and fun partnership.\n\n\u200b\n\nHowever, because initially and up until late 2021 she did not have a Visa, she could not work. So when she moved in, knowing she couldn't afford much of anything (she had a small amount of savings she was very slowly depleting to survive until her Visa renewed) we arranged for her to pay $50 a month for rent/bills as a way of giving her a voice in the house and contributing her fair share (more than fair as a proportion of income IMO). The mortgage and bill are over $2k/month, so it was and still is impossible for her to take an equal ownership of those costs. Frankly, I don't need or want her to do that from a financial perspective, but because we didn't \"go-in\" on this house together, or get an apartment together or something more even, she understandably doesn't feel like she has equal say.\n\n\u200b\n\nLast night I invited 3 of my buddies over to watch the College Football National Championship game and they stayed until 11pm, and she got a little upset because we were being loud and kept her up longer than she would like. Totally understandable and I apologized because I didn't ask her if they could come over, which I should have.\n\n\u200b\n\nHowever, the thing that irked me was that she said she felt like she had no ability or voice to express her frustration with me on this. She felt like she had no right to tell me she was annoyed or to ask if we could watch the game elsewhere because she feels like its my house and she is just a guest in it. She is a highly independent person, very much like me in this way, and does not like to be in this position.\n\n\u200b\n\nAnd frankly, I get her perspective. I would feel the exact same way. Realistically it is my house in my name, I pay 98%+ of the bills, and most of everything in it is mine too. She didn't have a lot initially when she moved in. Overtime, she now has her own room and a lot of decorations and blankets and stuff are hers, and she really helped transform it into a warm and inviting home. Before, it was blank walls and a like a TV true bachelor style.\n\n\u200b\n\nI hate that she feels like this. I always tell her that while I technically know its my house, it really is our Home.\n\n\u200b\n\nI want her to feel like she has equal say, but she can't afford to pay half. This is not a condition in my head, but it is in hers. But given this, if she can't afford to pay, is there a creative way I can address this problem? I want her to feel like a 50/50 partner in this way, like she has just as much right to what goes on in this house as I do, but need to set something up that doesn't require her money.\n\n\u200b\n\nI'm just stumped. Hoping you all can help\n\n\u200b\n\n**TL;DR: Girlfriend can't pay half the bills at my house, feels like she needs to in order to have equal say at the house, but doesn't make enough money. How do I make her feel equitable and give her that voice in a different way?**",

        "content": "So my ex boyfriend (25m) and I (28f) were together for 5.5 yrs. the first 2.5-3 went fine. After that, as we both are really anxious and started to think a lot about the future, things have been struggling since then.\nWe\u2019ve met in college. He ended his master degree and, worried about the future, didn\u2019t think our degree would fulfill everything he wanted (as father, partner etc.). So, even if he was one of the best students and got some good oportunities, he decided to do another degree, one that would bring more future opportunities. He is very anxious, and too disciplined to do everything to have a better future. By everything I mean: he wakes up to go to work and then goes to classes or viceversa. He spents almost all his free time studying. For years now.\n\nWe had a great relationship tho, loved it others company, have a lot of similarities and had lots of happy moments together. He treats me really well and genuinely wants the best for me.\n\nBut then, during the 4th year together, he decided to take a break to focus on his studiesand \u201cto grow his maturity\u201d. So we took a 8 month break. \n\nAfter his exams, summer time, we talked and he wanted to get together again. I was afraid he would give more breaks once life would get more difficult, but he promised me he wouldn\u2019t do in a near future. I was not happy with the break, but I decided to give another chance.\n\nOn november, all of a sudden, he dumped me because every time we would go out, he would have his thoughts on the things he needs to do. He is obcessed in doing everything according to his schedule. He also said he was being selfish by keeping me, because I would ask to go out during a weekend, once per monthand he couldnt do it. He \u201cneeded to grow up more\u201d. I have been very parient but I am sick of this, so I am ready to move on even if he wants to get back in the future.\n\nAm I being fair with this decision? I really like him and would love to have a family with him but I am done. I wouldnt trust wether he would give more breaks in the future. My patience reached the limit. I am afraid he did it so I could leave him alone to study. He want to talk in the future, so if he wants to start over I will decline.\n\nEveryone in my family/friends warned me he never knows what he clearly wants and is always working or studying, which isnt healthy. He is always too worried with the future and I am out of his league. But I really like him and thought it could work and later things would get easier.\n\nI am now 28, I am not that young anymore and time is ticking. This is hunting my mind.\n\nDo you think I am being fair by not giving him more chances and move on? Any advice on how to deal with thefuture being single at 28? I really want to have a family?\nAdvices are appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: My 5yr boyfriend decided to end relationship. I don\u2019t know if I should move on. I am getting anxious being single at 28 and think constantly about it. Any advice is appreciated. These thoughts are making me anxious.",

Whenever we are working together he dismissed absolutely any idea I provide and if I ever have to tell him off at our work he gives me the silent treatment and leaves his bedroom door open and will watch my movements around the apartment until he feels \u2018ready\u2019 to talk. This behaviour honestly freaks me out and makes me incredibly self conscious of my movements and makes me feel guilty every time I have to go to the toilet. \n\nAlso he makes fun of my managing style to my friends and my colleagues and I only found out when one told me about a few jokes they made. Completely at my expense.\n\nHe also told me that I need to stop talking about my trauma and deal with it like everyone else does as he has depression and \u2018has things worse\u2019. I\u2019ve since not spoken a word about my family problems and now feel like I have to hide every time I have a panic attack or I get a resurfacing memory. \n\nHe also asks for favours and then will never pay back the favour or pay me back.\n\nI can\u2019t move out and neither can he for the six months and honestly I\u2019m scared of what will happen if I keep having to live with him. He makes me feel unsafe in my own home and when these issues were brought up he turned it on me saying how that my concerns made him feel self conscious so I should apologise to him.\n\nTldr: my roommate is making my life a misery and I don\u2019t know what to do to cope",

        "content": "I often find myself at a loss for words with how frustrated I am with the project manager I assist with a client project. He\u2019s related to one of the presidents in my company. I\u2019m way down the food chain and report to my manager, but not to him. He\u2019s someone I had been friends with outside of work for several years before taking this job. He struggles to preform his work independently and relies on me to figure out the same tasks each month that are directly his responsibility. From his bragging I\u2019ve deducted he gets paid more than double what I do and he has been there less than a year longer. I\u2019ve put up with his lack of leadership with a lot of grace because I wanted to see him succeed if all he needed was extra help.\n\nThe client we work on together is ending their contact in a few weeks. Instead of the focus shifting away from this client, he has ramped up the amount of work we are doing for them. Legit, the amount of time he expected dedicated to them was nearly double what is normal last month. This month he expected me to get my normal work for the client done in a 3 days instead of the two weeks I normally get and never communicated that until the day of this imaginary deadline.\n\nMy manager has told me for weeks this client needs to be at the bottom of my priorities now. So when he started getting pushy about a very reasonable request for more time considering some unforeseen issues with the project and the rushed deadline, I told him that I\u2019ve been asked to move my other clients up to the top priority right now and this task needs wiggle room. Well, he freaked out.\n\nHe messages my manager and his brother in law president a long rant to say that I am not being told how to prioritize my work right and I am going to take several days on a key task. I told him in writing about two days possibly a little longer (like hours longer). I only know this because my manager showed me his messages and told me to keep doing things how I planned after she confirmed my plan was reasonable.\n\nI don\u2019t even know how to talk to this guy anymore. It seems so rude, dramatic, controlling and manipulative to do what he did. Am I overreacting? I was trying to give him a strong hint that he\u2019s pushing for way too much with this client that legit has weeks left with us and has started to move on to meeting their own needs in the area we work in. I definitely don\u2019t see us being friends any more but how can I even continue to work with this guy? I stayed up most of the night just fuming about this.\n\nI\u2019m also worried that somehow I\u2019ve put my manager in a bad position with her boss by saying this isn\u2019t a priority right now. Maybe she didn\u2019t want me to actually tell him that.\n\nTLDR: Coworker and former friend contacts brother in law president because he doesn\u2019t like that my manager told me to deprioritize his client.

        "content": "So, I\u2019ve (M42) have been divorced for about 15 years, ever since my ex cheated on me with her high school sweetheart. We\u2019d been married for four years and had a kid, so the divorce was messy. We had joint custody (week on/off) for a long time but a year ago, I became the primary parent. Ex remarried, had 4 more kids and she can\u2019t deal with the \u201cenergy\u201d of our now-teenage child. Personally, I love it and my high schooler is thriving in athletics and academics, so I couldn\u2019t be happier with our parent-child relationship.\n\nAnyway, my older sister (F48) and her friends have been trying to set me up since my divorce was finalized. I\u2019ve humored her and gone on several dates over the years, some worked out for a while, but most didn\u2019t last past the first date. I really don\u2019t want to waste anyone\u2019s time (including my own) when I find out there are core differences that will eventually lead to a bad breakup.\n\nAll of the women my sister and her friends have introduced are nice people. I want to highlight that part. But there are key differences that would doom any relationship. One was very religious; I\u2019m not. Another was vegetarian; I hunt and fish. Another had shaky finances; I live well within my means and pay my bills on time. You get it. \n\nMy sister set me up on a date with \u201cEmma\u201d (F33). Emma checks a lot of boxes, but she has two very young kids under 4 which my sister did not mention (no, I haven\u2019t met them). I had a nice date with Emma: dinner, coffee, and an evening walk (she talked and I listened). When she mentioned her kids and the rough relationship she has with their father, I knew right then and there I didn\u2019t want a second date. Young kids are a complication I don\u2019t think I want in my life and her emotionally abusive (her words) ex is not someone I want intruding regularly into my or my child\u2019s life which would be inevitable if I was in a relationship with Emma.\n\nLater, when she asked about seeing me again, I told her that I\u2019m not the right guy for her and didn't want to waste her time. I told her the reasons above. She seemed to get it and even said she understood. The next day though, my sister calls me up and yells at me. Telling me that Emma\u2019s a great woman and my wanting a partner with \u201cno drama\u201d is unrealistic.\n\nSo, is it? I'm ready to listen!\n\nTL;DR: Sister keeps setting me up on dates, none have worked out, and sister says what I want is \"unrealistic\".",

I think i just have a tendency to become overly attached and that\u2019s on me. i can\u2019t even try to make new friends because i\u2019m currently staying at home until i start university this september so until then i have no way of getting to know people or keep myself busy. it sounds so pathetic but i genuinely have no life outside of her i have no one else i talk to i have no other hobbies and it\u2019s not good. i can\u2019t stop thinking about what\u2019s going to happen if something goes wrong with us like how am i going to be able to survive that when i\u2019ve put my entire life in her hands, it\u2019s not right for either of us and it\u2019s not fair on her to have that burden. \n\n\nMy every mood is determined by her, if we have an argument i get violently upset and angry. Side note i have depression and i currently take meds for it, i\u2019m also on the waiting list for therapy but it looks like it\u2019ll be another 2/3 months wait. sometimes when we argue or when she\u2019s mad at me it triggers me to feel incredibly suicidal but the minute we make up i\u2019m completely ok again. I know that\u2019s not good i know i should be independent and my mood shouldn\u2019t rely on someone else, i know that it\u2019s not her responsibility to deal with my emotions. she btw is not aware of these thoughts and has never brought up feeling burdened by me or my moods but i still don\u2019t want it to get to the point where it does bother her. and whether she\u2019s aware of it or not it\u2019s still not fair to put something like that on her.\n\n\nI want to work on this but i\u2019m not sure how to do it which is why i\u2019m posting this here so maybe someone could recommend what i should do. Any advice would be welcome.\n\n\nTL;DR - i have an unhealthy attachment to my gf and my moods and life revolve around her. i want to be independent and have a life outside of our relationship. how do i fix this?",

It takes a toll on me but I tried to manage, but I am still just a young adult and I pretty sure I got depression from it dealing with it since High school.

        "content": "I'm a 37F who has been dating a 42M for about three years. We love each other and get along great together, but I've long felt wary of completely trusting him, though he's never done something obvious for me not to. I could really use a gut check on whether it sounds like my caution is warranted, or if it's just the result of anxiety and trust issues on my part.\n\nWe really clicked while dating and agreed to be in a committed relationship after about three months, but for a long time after that, I still felt like he was avoiding intimacy and keeping me at arm's length. I tried to be patient because he was going through some rough times during this period (losing his job, car accident, episodes of depression). Things got much better after that, but I wonder if maybe this first year or so of our relationship conditioned me to feel insecure about it.\n\nAnother reason I felt frustrated and anxious is because I've noticed him looking up exes on social media, liking their profile photos, and staying in touch with a few of them. I realize this is not evidence of anything shady in itself, but I told him several times that his behavior makes me uncomfortable, especially since he has never posted anything about me on his social media. This has never fazed me in past relationships, but when we went on an amazing island vacation a couple years ago, it felt strange to me that he only posted a handful of random photos that looked like he could have been traveling alone. He also wouldn't accept tagging him in the handful of photos I've posted.\n\nWe've had several discussions/fights about this. In one of these arguments, he actually said that part of him misses a lot of his exes, which I found alarming. He maintains that he wants to keep his social media content semi-private and doesn't like posting pictures of himself or about his relationships, especially since it's painful to look at and delete if the relationship ends. He also told me at one point that he barely uses his Instagram and doesn't even talk to people on there, which I know isn't really true. As for the other stuff that stirs my insecurity, he assures me any contact with exes is infrequent and only friendly, that he only wants to be with me, and he's never cheated on me emotionally or physically. He thinks it's unfair that I am suspicious of him because I've been cheated on in the past, but he hasn't done anything wrong or disrespectful against me.\n\nI've tried to assume the best. I wouldn't ask him to cut off contact with anyone because that's controlling and unfair...I'm also on distant but friendly terms with most of my exes and occasionally respond to their texts, but I feel nothing for them. My current BF also just has a lot more relationship history than I do--I was married for 10 years and he's been in many more LTRs. Still, my insecurity has gotten the best of me, and I admit I have gone through his phone several times over the past year when my gut was telling me something was off. I know this in itself is a betrayal of trust, but I'm of the opinion that this is valid if you find something you need to know to protect yourself...but I haven't, really!\n\nDuring one of our rough patches, he did reach out to chat with a former hookup on social media, and she said something like \"oh you always message me when I'm horny!\" He deflected and said something like \"we always did have that connection, huh? But more importantly, how are you lately?\" He or she will message to \"check in\" or \"say hi,\" and catch up a little maybe every couple of months. He's also reached out to a couple of other exes less frequently, and they just talk about new jobs, buying a house, and other updates. No flirting or nostalgia. He's also never mentioned me or \"we\" or \"us,\" so I assume they don't know I exist...in one case, the hookup mentioned she had stopped by where he works and didn't see him (it's a popular service industry type place so this isn't that weird) and he responded a few days later to say sorry I missed you, \"I was on vacation\"...we were on a rather romantic trip together. I've also noticed that he cleans out his texts and DMs every so often, so perhaps he's getting rid of anything really incriminating (or I'm getting deep into paranoia there).\n\nI think it's fine and healthy for people to be cordial with their exes, but at the same time, it bothers me that he seems to seek out these women's attention and not be clear that he's in a relationship. (I should also note that my previous LTR ex of 4 years also never posted me on his Instagram, but that never bothered me in context with his other behavior.) My cynical side thinks he wants to look available so he can keep getting attention from them and keep them on the back burner for later. Honestly, I might not have thought much of it if he hadn't told me he \"misses them\" somehow and was more open about our relationship on the platforms where he talks to them. Is he stepping over the line or am I? How would I navigate further discussion without letting on that I've seen his activity? Is everyone just chatting up their exes all the time and I should just deal?\n\ntldr; I feel like I can't trust my boyfriend because he chats with exes on social media, shows no evidence that he's been in a committed relationship for three years, and admits he misses his ex girlfriends, even though we otherwise have a great relationship and spend pretty much all our free time together. I've gone through his phone and found nothing really incriminating, though he does respond and reach out to these women to check in. Am I right to be wary, or is this just my own insecurity?",

        "content": "Long story ahead. TL;dr: forced breakup by controlling parents, being punished, feeling extremely angry now and cannot get over \"Ex\"\n\nSo I dated this guy. I\u2019m in my early 20s, he\u2019s my age and we go to the same uni. We dated for \\~3 months, not that long I know, but these 3 months literally felt like 3 years.\n\nAt first I was keeping my bf a secret from my overprotective Asian parents and planned on telling them a bit later, once I figure out a way to talk to them about this. Because 1) I wasn\u2019t sure about this guy yet, since it was still very early on in the relationship and 2) I know my parents are extremely conservative, controlling and overprotective, especially when it comes to relationships, so I was scared to tell them\n\nBut of course my mom found out before I told her, because she read through our texts, and she was extremely furious that I had a bf (and didn\u2019t tell her, and lied to her when she asked) and that we had sex (in her mind, virginity > everything) so she screamed at me, called me a whore, and forced us to break up. So my bf and I cut contact for a few weeks but it was so painful that we couldn\u2019t bear it, and eventually found our ways back together and started to secretly seeing each other again.\n\nThings were going pretty well since we started seeing each other again. Our connections got deeper. We said \"I love you\". Things were getting really serious. We were literally the perfect match. I really wanted him to be \u201cthe one\u201d. What we had was something really really special for both of us. I was thinking about ways that I can tell them about this and have them accept our relationship, as I was getting more and more serious.\n\nBut just a few days ago my mom found out that we've picked things up. And this time as you can probably predict, she went absolutely insane because I broke my promises and lied to her again. So she screamed at me, called me a whore, a liar, guilt-tripped me and threatened to disown me. She stopped paying for my schooling so now I'm not even allowed to go to school anymore.\n\nSo basically I have lost not only my boyfriend but also my education and my future in one moment of time. I\u2019m extremely hopeless now.\n\nI also hate myself for the way I handled this whole situation. How did I end up hurting everyone - my \u201cex\u201d, my parents, and myself? I feel so sad and furious that my controlling parents only care about their \"face\" rather than my own happiness. They never cared about my well-being, and honestly that's why I never wanted to open up to them because I know how they'd react, I know how they won't support me, I know all I'll get is criticism. So why do I bother to tell them anyways?? But then they blame me for keeping secrets from them and lying to them, yet it's exactly what their parenting did to me.\n\nOn top of that, how the hell do I get over my \u201cex\u201d? Obviously none of us wanted this to happen because we really loved each other. And the fact that the breakup was mutually undesired, and that it happened so abruptly, made it even more difficult. I guess his approach is to \u201crip the bandaid off\u201d and completely cut contact, and try to get over it no matter how painful it is. He knows very well that staying in this relationship will end up jeopardizing my future, and he didn\u2019t want to be the one who ruins my life. He wants me to have the best life possible. He knows I have great ambitions and potentials. He wants me to be able to live the life I deserve. I understand. So he kind of just walked away. Disappeared.\n\nI know this is what \u201cbreakup\u201d and \u201cmoving on\u201d means. And I understand that he has every right to walk away and take the space that he needs to move on. He\u2019s doing this not just for me, but also for his own sake. But I can\u2019t stop thinking about the possibilities of us getting back together in the future once I sorted my shit out. I know it\u2019s unfair. I can\u2019t make him wait for me. But honestly my biggest fear is that, I will eventually get my life in order, continue schooling, fix my relationship with my family, and be allowed to date again etc. Then I\u2019ll come back to him, only to find that he has cleaned up EVERY SINGLE trace of me and has no feelings for me anymore, perhaps has even found someone else. I really really don't want to become just a figment of his past or a crazy fling he's had or a complete stranger... Just the thought of it hurts so much that I don\u2019t even wanna carry on what I\u2019m doing right now.\n\nIs it normal to think like that? How can I get rid of this false hope and really start to move on? It seems impossible. How do I get myself into the mindset that \"this is over, there is no going back, and I just have to move on\"? And how do I deal with the pain of knowing he might be moving on, he might forget about me, and he will eventually find someone else to replace me in the future?",

I shamefully admit that I pleaded he compromise with me, I mean what was I doing that required such a severe solution (and a solution that would make me feel heartbroken)? I was open to making changes and lowering expectations as he needed more positive support and encouragement from me. Long story short, he largely shut me out for those 2.5 weeks and told me that he was feeling differently about the relationship but was willing to give it a shot again when I was back in the same city as him.\n\nWhen we had our first conversation after being back in the same city he was Covid positive (but didn't realize until he took a test about a few hours later) and now I am stuck quarantining in his apartment since I can't go back to my own place and risk spreading it to my roommate. I wanted (and maybe still admittedly do) want my bf to feel the love he used to feel for me and so I have been using this time to get him to like me  like he used to. I pretty much know how to make my bf happy, but sometimes making him feel happy doesn't make me feel like I am being myself (not in a weird way, just in a way where I am positive in a way that isn't normal or natural for me).  Anyway, I have been making an effort to make light of a ridiculous situation and we were really kicking it off and rekindling the flame.

He really warmed back up to how he used to be.\n\n...BUT...STILL, when there is any issue between us he gets much angrier and I don't feel super stable in the relationship. I tell him this - and I tell him how his actions and behaviors can make me feel and I guess he just doesn't care enough. I know how to act to keep him around - but I am worried it will be at the expense of me not feeling like I can truly express myself and feel loved in the ways that are important to me. That sounds intense, and it is, but my bf also has qualities that are hard af to find and very important to me--he is unusually smart, funny, energetic, fun, kind, and family oriented. we vibe in special ways but also we can be a chaotic disastrous couple :.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr bf asked for space and not sure if we should give relationship a shot again",

        "content": "**TL;DR -** wife and I decided to get married after only a month of knowing each other. I didn\u2019t know how bad her anxiety/depression and attachment issues were (she quit 3 fucking jobs within 2 weeks), she gets frustrated and annoyed at the sight of me, her parents are nosy and I can't stand them, and after 4 years, I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I\u2019m lost, unhappy, and distressed.\n\n**Just for background - my wife and I are Muslim**. We weren\u2019t \u2018arranged\u2019 per se, because we found each other online and agreed to marry each other, but it is still \u2018arranged\u2019 in the sense that we did not date or live together at all before getting married. That was my mistake, honestly. A lot of Muslim youngsters nowadays will get to know each other before they tie the knot, but I rushed into it thinking I locked down the perfect girl after a month. I was fucking stupid, but here's the full story:\n\nI (32M) have been married to my wife (31F) for 4 years. We have a 10 month old baby boy. After a month of talking I flew in with my parents to her house and, her dad asked me, \u201cwhat is your plan now?\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m ready whenever you are.\u201d I didn\u2019t think things would go THIS fast, she agreed to get married too, so I was happy. I just wanted to get married, and she seemed like a great girl, so for me this was fine. I gave her a ring, and 5 months later, we tied the knot.\n\nProblems started almost immediately after our wedding. She relocated to live with me, several states away in the U.S. We moved into my one bedroom apartment. She became extremely homesick, and wanted to work but couldn\u2019t find a job. Everyday she would cry like a baby - she'd never lived without her parents a day in her life. I felt really bad for her, so I started buying her tickets to go see her family every month, for one or two weeks a month. I took up a bunch of expenses, including her master\u2019s tuition, her car payments, furniture, flight tickets, shopping, etc. At the time my wife was very thankful for all this, but now it's like none of that even counts.\n\n5 months after our wedding, my wife asked me if she could move back with her parents, until she can find a job where I live. I hesitated, but agreed to the idea. I felt really bad that she wanted to work, but couldn\u2019t find a job, so I wanted to be a supportive husband. So she moved back and worked in her hometown for 6 months. After 6 months, she fought with me over the phone that I have no plan for us to be together (even though I wasn't the one who walked away), and decided to come back and live with me again.\n\nSomehow, luckily, as soon as she came back, she found a job ! She was extremely nervous about it, more than I thought at the time. I would humor her by saying, \u201cdon\u2019t worry so much, it\u2019s just a job - you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d But on her first day of work, I realized just how anxious she was. She was trembling with fear, shivering. After 3 days of working, she called out sick. She called out sick again the next day. And on the third day, I helped her write a resignation letter to quit the job. \n\nShe just could not do it.\n\nShe got another job after a month - different company, higher pay, shorter commute. She quit this job in 2 weeks. After a year, she got yet another job, and she quit that job as well in 2 weeks. It\u2019s like she can never work again. I had no idea her anxiety was this bad. Truth be told, I would have liked my wife to work to help us get out of debt. But, I supported her regardless, and suggested her to be a housewife, and came up with a plan to help her mental health. I suffer from anxiety as well, and take anti-depressants to cope which really do help me, so I sent her to a psychiatrist. For the last 2.5 years, she has been taking Zoloft (same drug that I take) and has been talking to a therapist regularly. \n\nThe problem is, I don\u2019t see any improvement. If anything, our marriage life seems to have diminished. Throughout the last 4 years, both before and after she started her mental health journey, she has been fighting me regularly. Everything I do annoys her. I do not have any friends in the area, so I do not go out on the weekends. We do everything together, but even then, she says I don\u2019t give her time. I have a few hobbies, like working out, video gaming, reading, but she makes me feel guilty for entertaining myself. I have encouraged her to get hobbies herself- paid for dancing classes, started doing yoga with her, taught her how to make candles so she could start an Etsy business, taught her video-editing so that she could start a vlog (which she did for only a month), bought her baking supplies so she could bake and show off her baking on Instagram (that did not last either), and I\u2019ve told her to volunteer at places too. Nothing seems to work with her. I feel like she wants me to provide her happiness and I don\u2019t know where to find it for her. I keep coaching her that often times, happiness comes from within.\n\nThe root of the problem, to me, are her parents. Almost every step of the way, her parents seem to make things more difficult for me. Her parents have this impression in their mind that I don\u2019t keep her happy, that maybe I\u2019m abusive or something. They're extremely nosy, super involved in our life. They speak to her every single day over the phone, MULTIPLE times a day (I am not exaggerating), and also texting constantly. Her father refused to make an international trip a year after our wedding because he was worried that his daughter (my wife) would call him with some marriage trouble and he would not be able to cope overseas (he told me this directly. At that time, we weren\u2019t even fighting. He just thought of her as his baby, still.). When she quit her 2nd job, my wife wanted to hide it from her parents (because \u201cthey would worry too much\u201d), so she would wake up at 6 AM and text them she is leaving for work. Then, at noon, she would call them and let them know she is on lunch break. Then, a text that she is leaving from the office in the afternoon. Then, finally, a phone call that she has arrived at home. I felt like her parents didn\u2019t trust me or something, and it became really annoying. Even now, after 4 years, her parents call her every single day, and ask about weird, specific questions like, \u201cwhere is husband? Did the baby bother you? Did husband wake up with the baby this morning?\u201d I feel like their adamant proximity to my wife comes out of their own anxiety that they\u2019ve basically passed onto her. And in turn, I worry that she\u2019s going to pass this onto our son as well.\n\nWe had one big argument which leaked over to her parents, and they kept asking my wife if she felt safe, even though I have never done a single violent thing and the most I\u2019ve done is curse during an argument. She has gotten violent at times, not exactly hitting me, but taking her ring off her finger and throwing it at me, stomping the floor really hard, and popping a bunch of ballons by stabbing them with a knife out of anger, yet somehow her parents overlook that in their assessment.\n\nI feel like all the anxiety, depression, and sheer pessimism that she radiates, is beginning to affect me as well. I\u2019m usually a very optimistic and upbeat person. I crack a lot of jokes, which she doesn't like. She and I share very few interests, though I thought initially we had a lot in common, and it's mostly because she doesn't even HAVE interests. I\u2019m tired, and I feel like marriage isn\u2019t what I thought it would be. My wife also constantly brings up separation and couples therapy, like she just wants me to leave her. Yet, she also cannot do without me, and I know that. Still, I see other couples looking so happy, and inevitably I start thinking negative thoughts - maybe I could have done better? Maybe I should have spoken further, to really make sure we are compatible, rather than rushing into it? I love my son so much, I cannot imagine living without him, so I\u2019m really upset that these thoughts are coming now.\n\nAt this time, I live really far away from my family (undoable drive), and about 3-4 hours away from her family. I have no friends in the area, and I'm stuck with a woman who makes my life and her own life hell. I don't know what I should do - is there any remedy to this?",

I talked to my therapist (who I was seeing because husband had me believing I had emotional regulation & communication problems), came armed with research and concrete examples of his manipulative, controlling and demeaning patterns. She was supportive but firm, recommended I reach out to my local DV organization to help me work out a safe exit plan and get legal aid regarding the divorce. She said sooner rather than later. And I trust her. But\u2026\n\nI am stunned. I feel like my whole entire world is upside down. I keep flipping back and forth between \u201cthank god other people can see this too, I\u2019m not crazy and it is that bad\u201d and \u201che\u2019s my best friend, I\u2019m heartbroken and he\u2019s the only one there for me, he needs me and I could never leave him.\u201d\n\nI know I should leave but I don\u2019t know what to do. I just want to talk to him and work it out and this will all just be one big misunderstanding, right? I\u2019m heartbroken. I can\u2019t have kids here, but if I leave I\u2019ll be alone and also probably won\u2019t have kids. And I\u2019ll be broken and ashamed. All those conversations. He\u2019s going to want me back or want an explanation.\n\nI really think that\u2019s what I\u2019m hung up on the most. He has so little emotional awareness that I KNOW he won\u2019t have any idea what I\u2019m talking about. I know he\u2019ll think I\u2019m crazy. I want him to know what he\u2019s done but he just\u2026 he\u2019s not going to. He might not ever understand. \n\nWe\u2019re so happy so much of the time, I don\u2019t know if I can do this.\n\nAnyways, hi, worst update. But you all were right. \n\nFor anyone in a similar situation, Lundy Bancroft\u2019s \u201cWhy Does He Do That?\u201d was very eye opening and described him in ways I couldn\u2019t articulate on my own. He fits the profile of the Water Torturer perfectly.\n\nAdditionally, very very helpful these past few days: The Hotline (looks like I can\u2019t link, but you can search.) They have a text or chat service, and for anyone out there like me, it\u2019s not \u201cjust\u201d emotional/verbal abuse, it\u2019s abuse and they are there to help and support. I spent a few hours over a few days just talking through things with people who really understood and it was exactly what I needed. Please reach out if it\u2019s something you need.\n\nTL;DR My husband isn\u2019t mean, he\u2019s verbally abusive. Don\u2019t know what\u2019s next.",

        "content": "So more background required ig, two years ago when i was 15, i had a huge huge crush on this girl. It was pretty crazy and messed up, i was really cringey and immature af back then, and so emo that i cut my hands over her. So obviously she rejected me cuz of who i was and becuase she already had a man.\n\nI frequently heard people telling me she was an 'easy' girl and just typical slut shaming gossip, but to me she was very different from what they described, plus she was with her man even after he cheated on her. She really loved that guy. But i still kept trying to win her over and pestered her alot, we drew alot of unwanted attention, the whole school saw me as a simp and shit got out of hand.\n\nIt died down through the years but fast forward to now, i lost my best friend,i dont really have good friends anymore, and a month ago, I broke up with my ex. I was truly alone. But one thing led to another and i suddenly started talking alot with her. She kept complimenting me on how I had changed alot from back then and how i had a glow up physically(I lost a lot of weight) and how i was better at talking to girls and not as cringe as before.\n\nWe started opening up alot about each other. She told me about how that guy she was dating was really toxic and how his friends were slut shaming her behind her back and spreading rumours about her. I told her about my ex and she gave me alot of info which kind of helped me understand why my ex broke up with me.\n\nShe said she found me very relatable, and i agree, because she also wanted a close friend, someone whom she could really trust and confide in. And tbh I could totally understand where she was coming from.\n\nEvery once in a while she'd say \"you dont talk much to me at school, people prolly dont even know we talk so much. and recently she called me a 'gucci friend' which, i really have no idea what that means, but reddit told me.\n\nNow, I'd really think that im a good friend to her. But here's the catch. She doesn't want to let people know we talk alot. She sometimes tells me that if someone asks me about us, i shouldnt let them know that we talk alot.\n\nNow I'm kinda lost at what im supposed to feel. I see a person who trusts me and shares all her problems, and someone whom i can share my problems with. but somehow we aren't even supposed to be known as friends. I wanna believe that we're friends but i cant help but think that we're just two strangers talking to each other to get over our problems, and once that's over, we'll drift apart agai\n\nTLDR: Idk whether i should invest myself in a friendship that im not sure would last",

        "content": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years. I love this girl to death and I do feel that my girlfriend loves me. She is my best friend, and I can't imagine life with another girl.\n\nOne year into our relationship, I found out that 5 months into our relationship she actually slept with her ex-fwb. What made it especially bad is that she told me that he was just a friend, and that when I confronted her about it knowing the truth she tried to pretend it never happened. And the level of deciet was just especially bad. And I found out too that this guy had a video of her giving him a bj.\n\nAt that point I was ready to go. But my girlfriend begged me to stay, and did a bunch of things to make me feel better. She showed me her phone all the time, shared her location. Told me that her ex just had a hold on her, and that she needed to grow out of it. And she did everything to block him and all.\n\nWhen it came to marriage, it just scarred me still. Like I love her but I don't have that same level of trust. My girlfriend has been understanding but in the past two years she has gotten super aggressive about it. We live together and do all the things of a married couple. She wants to start a family and I do too. For me, I told her that we would see in the future but I realize that I don't think I will change. I feel like in the back of my mind that anxiety is still there. And I know this sounds petty, but the fact that another guy has a video of my girl doing that on video really irks me.\n\nMy girlfriend is mad at me, told me that she has done all this stuff to make it up to me, and has been nothing but a loyal gf, and that in return I just wasted her youth. I told her that that is nonsense, that I gave her my youth too its not like I was an old man and she was in her 20s. She told me that she wants to have kids that risks shoot up after 35.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI overheard my girlfriend on the phone with her sister, and her fear is that she will never be able to have kids. And that I wasted her good years, that I stayed with her because I was comfortable with her. She also said too that I did this as punishment for cheating that this is the time where I dangle marriage over her head.\n\nI don't want to lose my girlfriend I really love her but not sure what to do here. I make considerably more than her (3x) so if we got married theres a huge financial risk for me. I have thought about doing a prenup but I have heard that its more so for assets you come into before the marriage. And that they don't always hold up in court. What can I do here? I don't want to lose my girlfriend. Should I tell her we can have children without getting married?\n\n**tl;dr- girlfriend cheated on me early on in our relationship. 5 years later I am still not over it.**",

I'm 24 weeks pregnant and we're both relatively happy (I'm over it, he's still trying to grasp it a little). We have pretty good communication, we both trust each other a lot, and this has been the best relationship I'm in, or so I really hope. \n\nI can't help but find myself feeling the sense of dread and the instinct that something is wrong or off, I'd constantly felt it with my last relationship and another one before, both times my gut was right, whatever I was worried about was true. I feel like he's growing bored of me, resents me, maybe is falling out of love with me and in love with someone else. I don't know why I feel these things, I'm aware I don't have a reason to, but the anxious pit in my stomach still remains. Hormones maybe? He's been a little distant, says he's in a \"blank state\", not feeling like doing anything or getting up. Whatever it is, I'm scared to voice my worries any further, as everytime I have in the past, it's pushed my past partners further and further away. I don't want to sabotage this relationship.. \n\nI feel part of the reason is that we still both live apart, his grandmother is very old and needs assistance with many things, she doesn't really like me so I can't stay there, and I'm personally not ready to leave home yet. He does visit, but hasn't for the past week. This usually isn't a problem, but maybe the distance amplifies my worries and it really sucks. \n\nI'm just stuck, trying to reassure myself, trying to be less worried, to no avail. I don't like the separation, and right now it's really stressful. I don't know what to do.\n\nAdding on, I've dealt with insecurity issues in the past, but have overcome so many in the past year and have never once felt insecure in my current relationship until now.",

I've had people consider me as a \"best friend\" to them, but I didn't feel that way towards them. When highschool ended I \"ghosted\" them, because it caused too much problems for me, I'll get into the issue I was having in a second. \n\nI have been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but prior to that diagnosis, it took 6 years to be \"on-paper\" diagnosed btw. Prior to that diagnosis, the professionals I saw said I fit criteria for StPD, SPD and/or AvPD. I feel my main issue is, interaction with people, especially those I would like to interact with, fills me with guilt and major conflict. (I've searched for about 4 years for any literature that specified this issue or similar, and nothing has linked up. I can only think of objects relations/attachment theory, but I don't know where to find literature on those subjects without breaking the bank. I can't work at the moment and rely on the disability pension)\n\nMy previous psychiatrist and their team thought it would be a good idea to put me into a support type of environment. 2 years ago, the support people created a group for others to join. (Not group therapy, more of a place for people to create relations or something like that.)\n\nIn that group was a person I became interested in, I don't know what type of interest, but it was the first time I became interested in a person or even \"thing\" in my life. I didn't interact with this person though. I personally believe I would like to be this person's friend or something along those lines. Anyway, this interest led me to become psychotic to a degree, I thought my dream, which had this person in them, were causing a negative impact on their life and that other people knew that fact about me. My meds were altered and that \"went away\". But now that interest feels like one of the most horrible things I have done in my life. \n\nAnyways, i only went to the group thing about 4 - 5 times, but I found that person's social media very early, I haven't looked into it much, may be around once a fortnight. EDIT: I didn't add them, I thought that would be creepy, since we didn't talk to each other. \n\nSo...

We have been friends for a couple of years now, and I feel like they have become increasingly more into this particular flavor of spirituality.\n\nFor context, I am recently disabled, and a family member I used to live with got into a prosperity gospel type cult and would emotionally abuse me constantly, telling me things like, \"You just love being miserable!\" whenever I would bring up my disability, and implying that it's my fault that I'm disabled and that I could simply opt out of being disabled if I repressed all my negative thoughts and prayed and gave money to this cult. My family member viewed me as \"cursed\" and also stopped talking to me because they thought I would spiritually curse them by being in association with me.\n\nAnd now, to briefly explain my friend's deal, I've noticed that they talk about things like \"manifesting,\" and they seem to believe in the concept of pre-determined fate, and karma, what goes around comes around. They will blog about things with similar messages to the prosperity gospel cult only in more new-agey terms, like \"positive energy only\" or things related to this idea that you can be directly/totally in control of your own fate if you're good in the right ways.\n\nOn its surface all of this may seem like harmless ideology, but if you examine the other side to this sparkly spiritual coin, I feel like there is a non-negligible amount of potentially victim-blaming and toxic positivity behind it - aka, this idea that if bad things happen to you, it's because you weren't thinking positively enough or didn't try to manifest hard enough or whatever. I just worry that my friend sees me, a depressed and disabled person, as someone who is directly responsible for their own mental illness and disability.\n\nI find myself getting uncomfortable talking to my friend now, because some of their spiritual rhetoric reminds me too much of the same rhetoric my family member used to abuse me with.\n\nIs it valid to distance myself from this person?

Around the equivalent of a week of minimum wage on my country. Not much, but not little either. By the time the deadline to payback was reached, lockdowns had started.\nInitially, I was more focused on staying in contact with her. She was, after all, my best friend, and I really didn't need the money. But she got more and more distant. Then she started berating me for things like being rude to BF, being too noisy when it came to her personal life, and at some point she even called me a stalker. Last time we talked she said \"we are no longer friends, not even acquaintances\".\nI decided to just leave her alone. 'Til a year had passed from the payback deadline, I decided to start sending her emails and even letters to her parents house (where she used to live) about the debt (she closed all her socials because of a stolen phone incident).\nShe eventually reached out. She sent me an email profusely apologizing for everything. At that point I was mad, and just went through it as fast as I could. She was blaming everything on bf. I honestly was so mad and hurt for everything, I just replied were she could send the money, else there would be legal action from my part. I know that was too much...but at that point I thought she was just blaming her poor decisions on a toxic relationship; of which she had a long history of.\nWell, a couple of months ago, I was kinda drunk a nostalgic so I went through the email again. And I felt like garbage. In the parts I skipped she explained how her relationship was... bad. The kind of bad that can be a trigger warning. BF would berate her every time she talked to or about me. And whenever she mentioned paying the debt, he would go berserk.\nNow, a part of me thinks I was still justified on not allowing her to explain herself. Not only did she treat me like garbage for almost a year, but she spread rumors about me being a stalker. Even when I suspected BF started them, I thought she should have known better.\nBut after reading the whole story, I feel I let my best friend down when she needed me. Had I read it, I wouldn't have been so aggressive and we would have eventually been friends again.\nI haven't tried to contact her ever since. I think it's the best I can do, I don't want to cause her any more distress. Last I knew of her, was through a mutual friend IG story. She seemed fine and happy.\n\nThis has been eating me inside honestly...was I an asshole?\n\nTL;DR Friend treats me like garbage, refuses to pay money and spreads rumors about me. I refuse to read email where she explains abusive BF was the cause.",

We haven't had a lot of problems in our relationship. The partner's (let's call him Sam) brother (29 M, let's call him Edd) has a history of drinking and borrowing money from Sam. Edd's wife and three kids left him during the December holidays due to his drinking problem. Sam invited Edd to our house one day. We had a fun day with the two brothers, myself and my friend. We were all drinking this day. The four of us were sitting outside chatting when Sam went inside the house. As Sam left, Edd jumped up and started attacking my friend. He continued to hit her with his fists in her face not stopping. I tackled Edd off and Edd came back and continued hitting her again. I screamed at Sam to come and assist. Sam got his brother to calm down. I screamed extremely ugly word at Edd and asked him why he did that. Edd said he doesn't know it was an accident. I asked Sam to please take Edd home and inform him his not welcome in my house anymore. My friend opened a case against Edd, which I fully supported. Sunday afternoon Sam told me that Edd's boss phoned him to tell him he should sort his brother out because he has a drinking problem and tried to cut his pulse (not bad enough to get medical attention) I told Sam he should speak to his mother because we won't be able to assist his brother. Sam told me he doesn't know what to tell his mother. On Monday morning Sam asked me if he can take his brother to go fishing this weekend. I told Sam it is fine, but he should check that they don't drink and he should urgently speak to his mom before his brother gets out of control because he need assistance we cannot give him. Maybe ten minutes later Sam informs me his brother has passed away. He had an epileptic fit and drowned in the bathtub... Edd's partner stopped working about a year ago to look after their three children. Sam has gone now and volunteered to pay the school fees of the 3 children for the next year and anything else they might need. And they can use our house as a store place for as long as they wish. Edd's partner never wanted to go on birth control because it makes you fat... Thus three children... I have made it clear to Sam from the beginning of our relationship that I don't want children at all. Sam feels the same. My problem is, we are getting by on our money but I haven't bought new clothes or shoes in more than three years because money is just enough to cover our basics. I also have some problem at work at the moment and am not certain how much longer I'll be employed. Which is obviously causing a lot of stress.  I told Sam I'm upset that he offered so much money to them because we are already in a tough situation as it is. I think Sam feels bad about everything that happened the week before his brother's passing. Heck even I feel extremely bad. Sam is not speaking a whole lot to me at the moment. When we speak it turns to an instant fight. If I touch him he pushes me away. So basically we are coexisting at this moment.  I also have a lot of pressure and volatile environment at work at the moment which is making everything worse currently.\nMy question is, how do I assist Sam? I want to support him but I'm finding it extremely difficult with everything going on at the moment. I am emotionally unstable as well. When I see Sam I start to cry. When I go to work I'm crying when I leave work I'm crying. I'm supposed to support him at this moment but I feel like I'm making everything much worse than it's supposed to be. I need to get myself together for his sake and I am struggling. I need advice....\n\nTL:DR - Partner's brother passed away, we all have and had a lot of conflict going on. I want to support my partner but are feeling too emotional to do it properly.",

        "content": "  \n\nHi All\n\nLooking for a bit of advice or opinions hence the reach out to this community.\n\nAround 8 months ago me (M39) and my wife (F42) of 18 years has gone through a mutual separation, I moved out and had been living on my own since. She asked for some time to work on herself minimum 1 year as she had been suffering from Anxiety and depression for years and she will see how she feels about me after that time. During our conversation she said that she does still care about me but feels that she can't love me anymore as a husband. In hindsight I've realised that I\u2019ve become complacent and took her for granted over the years and I can understand why she fell out of love with me. This is area\u2019s that I\u2019ve worked on within myself. \n\nDuring those 8 months both of us had been seeing other people. There was a big fight at the beginning of the separation mainly due to a jealous fit from my end however we worked it out and it seemed that the relationship was on amend and there had been talks about me moving back in. However, 5 months ago she asked me again for space as she had not fully \u201cworked\u201d on herself and that she was only processing my emotions and felt that it was emotional black mail. As you can appreciate, I\u2019ve stepped back and did not discuss with her anything that is going on in my life or revealed any feelings towards her. I only asked her about her life and how she is getting on. It was after a party I asked her about that she hit me with a \u201cThis feels like an interrogation\u201d which I then stopped to even ask her about her life anymore and went into a complete no contact with her. \n\nThe only contact I had with her since was about our daughter who was with me most of the weekends and had to do the school runs. There were a few times that I had to take the wife to appointments she could not travel to on her own. But in my mind and lack of feedback from her this relationship was moving to a divorce. However, I had planned a closure date with her during Christmas and new year. But got COVID on the 14th of December and had been in isolation and that did not happen.\n\nFrom the start of the separation, I worked on myself, got out of my comfort zone, went to parties, met friends and most recently over new year\u2019s I met another woman (F43) from another town who fell head over heels for me. The feelings were mutual. \n\nUpon revealing this relationship to the wife, now in my mind the ex-wife, with my plans to move forward with the new relationship. The ex-wife revealed that she had been thinking about us over Christmas and New Year and that she was planning to talk to me during our date about trying to work on our relationship. She confessed that she has changed, got a new job (She was working night shifts for 17 years) and is now in a good place. She was hoping to start slow and go on a few dates to see if the chemistry and feelings was still there.\n\nThat what I always wanted happened but now I\u2019m torn. I was sure my relationship with the wife who I still love was over, but now with the new relationship in the horizon, I\u2019m not sure whether to try and reconcile with the old or move on with the new. \n\nThere is a lot more information regarding my family\u2019s relationship and opinion about my wife and as much as I would try to talk to them about this, they will advise me to move on as they believe that my wife only said this as she now realises that she will lose me and or the benefits she reaped from me over the 18 years and 8 months we had been \u201capart\u201d. As I was performing a lot of \u201chusbandry duties\u201d during that time. Although she did cook for me occasionally as well. \n\ntl;dr:   \n Wife of 18 years, where in separation for 8 months. I met another woman recently. Now the wife wants to reconcile the relationship after learning about the new woman in my life.",

        "content": "My boyfriend (M25) and I (F 20) have been dating for almost 2 years now. I am still in college, and he is working at starting his own business. On weekdays, I am at my apartment at school, and come back to my boyfriend's place to work a shift at my nearby job and then hangout with him until I need to leave again Sunday evening for school. So, We physically have Friday evening until Sunday evening together.\n\nRecently, he has been seeming to game more. He has always liked gaming since I had met him, but for a few months now it seems more than usual. I would love for him to go to bed with me Friday or Saturday night, or have him offer up a date night or something, but it is always me making the plans. And his reply when I request he do something else with me is \"I need to be able to do what I want to do to relax, or else I will feel stressed/unhappy.\" Okay, makes sense, but my thinking is; do you really need to be gaming for hours nightly? Why cant he do that on weekdays and then we hangout on weekends? Most weekends, we will watch a movie or two together, and then after he wants to hop onto the game right after for the rest of the night, him and his friends will go sometimes until 2am. At that point, I think \"I've lost him\" for the night. I don't even bother asking him to hangout with me, shower with me, or go to bed with me after that because I know he will say no. I am starting to miss those things.\n\nFor the new year, him and I agreed we were going to read more, exercise more (we love working out), and just drop some bad habits. For me, I have already finished one book and am on my next. I am doing regular yoga now (new to me), and deleted a lot of useless social media. Him, well, nothing has changed. I would hope he would pick up a book or something because he said he would join me, but that has not been the case. He will only go to the gym to workout if I am going with him, and when I am not there during the weekdays, he finds some excuse not to go. I just feel disappointed. Whenever I call to say goodnight, he either cant talk because he's gaming, or needs to go because he has to get back to a game. I wish I would come back on the weekends and feel like he is eager to do something with me other than game. We could go see a movie that ends at 12am, and he would still go back home and game for 3 hours just so he felt like he got enough time to do it. I just want to understand so I dont feel like this anymore.\n\nHe has explained to me he is unhappy with his job, and he is stressed out because he is not sure if his business will work out for him. I want him to be happy so I have let all this gaming slide, aside from a comment here or there that I wish we could spend more time together. I feel hurt when he doesn't suggest something to do the next day or something and just instead goes \"I'm sorry babe\" and then immediately goes back to gaming with his friends. I want him happy, I want him to feel like I am a partner and not a controller, but am I crazy for feeling like second place in his life? Is there any perspective someone could give me? I struggle with severe anxiety disorder and relationship anxiety/ocd. Anything is appreciated. Thank you!!\n\ntl;dr my boyfriend has shown less and less interest in doing new things with me and spending more time with me and has instead turned to gaming for hours nightly instead.",

        "content": "We have been together almost 2 years. When we first met he was sweet, conversational, fun, cute, etc. I did think he was a little goofy/dorky but it didn't bother me.\n\nFlash-foward, and i think i'm growing tired of him. He CONSTANTLY makes sexually insinuating jokes. It's exhausting. It's not funny. just grow up. I will try to make conversation by making a comment about something, for example \"i just saw a black cat run under the porch!\" him: \"oh really?\" me: \"yea, it was kinda small\" him: \"cant say i haven't heard that before\" (aka insinuating a small penis joke...). I looked at him with a completely unamused, blank face. He was like \"what? it's just a joke\" me: \"yep. I know. just a joke\" and he asks again \"what? i'm just joking\" and i tell him yea i get it, you're just always making sexual jokes. and we were silent for a long time after that.\n\nedit: another example- i came down with an illness during finals week. he wasn't in town so we were just texting. I told him how exhausted i was from studying and that i didnt feel well at all. he literally replied \"maybe if you send a vid squeezing your boob you'll feel better.\" I was COMPLETELY un-amused and basically explained how inappropriate that was for the moment. All i was seeking was comfort, support, reassurance, etc. Not some bullshit about sending my boobs to him. I calmly told him how disrespected this made me feel and how alone i felt. It somehow turned into a huge argument about how \"it's just a joke its not even serious\" and I reiterated that I wanted an apology because it was rude and inappropriate, and honestly disrespectful in my opinion. His apology read as \"im sorry i dont say what you want, how you want, when you want. im sorry for being a misogynist and sexist and degrading person.\" it was completely disingenuous and i simply wanted to explain that i found his \"send boobs\" comment distasteful and inappropriate.\n\nThere are constant penis jokes, thats what she said comments (which can be amusing, but its all the time, even when i'm trying to say something serious or when saying TWSS is completely irrelevant/inappropriate), and just overall constant sexually insinuating comments.\n\nI just don't think it's funny, at all. He just graduated college and works a full time job. I'm still finishing my degree. I would have thought that he would start to mature at this point and grow out of immature jokes, but i'm not seeing it. I would never want to marry someone who makes those jokes continually, and i am starting to think it's NEVER going to stop.\n\nI have tried to lightly bring it up a few times, and to sum it up: He just kind of takes it as me picking on him. Like picking on his personality? Sexual jokes should not be your f-ing personality. So, reddit, is this a deal breaker? Is there anything else to be done about this? I don't think I can ask him to stop.\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend makes constant sexually insinuating jokes. Despite me trying to bring it up and tell him I am completely unamused by it, I don't think he will stop. I thought he would mature, but I'm losing faith. Is this a deal breaker? What do I do?\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention this is a throwaway account, he's on reddit and idk if he looks at this subreddit lol.",

I've had long periods of time where I don't date or see anyone. I've had a couple of actual, serious relationships since her. I've had a few fun flings or whatever.

I feel like a hopeless teenager who read too much Romeo and Juliet but it is the way I feel. I unfollowed all of her social media, and I haven't talked to her in two years. \n\nIt isn't even that she was perfect either. Neither was I. I can acknowledge both of those things. However, we worked very well with each other. I loved her greatly and I know I was a good boyfriend. She treated me well and was a great girlfriend. We definitely had our issues throughout the relationship but we were good at communication and were always able to work through things. She went to a school three hours away from where I went to school. (And I was and am still really happy she went to her dream school instead of going somewhere closer to me.). With my work and school schedule and her school and extracurricular schedule, a three hour drive just did not work and ultimately we ended the relationship.\n\nNow here I am, a (young) adult with a career who would like to start dating and eventually looking for a woman to settle down with and marry and start a family with. But I know that I am not over her and it doesn't feel like I ever will be.

She initially claimed that the fair way to split expenses e.g  mortgage and bills was that the person who earns more pays the majority of the bills and the person who pays less gives a small contribution.sound like she wanted an 75/25 split or something like that. It was clear that she was able to pay 50% of the expenses and still have enough left over to have a reasonably good lifestyle(similar to what she has now) so it wasn't like she wasn't able to afford it or it would leave her in a very difficult position.\n\nI challenged this and after a few days of back and forth arguing which to be honest was very draining and stressful she finally agreed because we realised that actually because my normal expenditure is more than hers, we currently have a similar ammount of income left over after expenses anyway...essentially she only agreed 50/50 because we have the same ammount left over currently...if I had more than her than she would have expected I pay the majority of expenses even though she would live in the same house, eat the same food and use the same electricity.\n\nAnyway so a couple of days ago she asked me how much I earn. I initially felt very awkward and tried to dodge the question but she persisted and asked again so I politely refused to divulge any information. She then asked if I was willing to tell her the ammount when we get married and I said no. We then had a few intense arguments and she then threatened to end the relationship if I wouldn't tell her. I then asked her to make a comittment that if I told her my income, she wouldn't then use the surplus money to make demands or argue with me about what we spent the money on and that she would allow me to spend it the way I wanted(albeit I made it clear that the vast majority would end up being eventually  either spent in a charitable way or on the good of the family unit). She then told me that she would only demand I spend money on specific things that were  important issues but said she didn't want to guarantee that she wouldn't ask me to spend it on a non important issue because there was a \"1% chance that she might change her mind for whatever reason\"\n\nI then asked her to define what important issues were e.g. if by important issue there is a leak and she can't afford to pay 50% for it from her income that's fine I'll pay for it..but if she wants to spend tens of thousands on a new kitchen and I feel there is something better we should spend the money on, I want to be able to have the final say in it..she basically didn't end up giving me an example of what important is..in addition her lifestyle is more lavish than mine so I felt it unfair to tell her how much I earn in the future because if there is a leak for example and she can't pay for it, the only reason she can't pay is because she was more frivolous than me and spent her money on enjoying herself instead of saving for a rainy day because her husband has it covered..\n\nYesterday she broke up with me saying she couldn't be with me if I wasn't willing to share how much I earn when we get married.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts. Is it reasonable for me to want to keep this private as long as I keep up with the actual financial commitments we've agreed on? \n\nAnd is she being rash by ending this relationship considering it was going so well before this argument?\n\nP.s. Full disclosure she did tell me how much she earns fairly early on but I didn't ever ask her to tell me, she randomly bought it up.\n\nThanks",

Not to mention she sees kids and staff that are visibly sick all day in a 200% capacity school where the hallways turn into standing room only concerts between periods.  There's also no hope that they'll go remote again.  \n\n\nWe are both double vaxed and boosted, but she is still deathly afraid of getting covid.  It's causing her massive stress and she frequently comes home destroyed.  Every day she comes home and anxiously explains every instance of possible exposure she had and wants me to reassure her that she'll be okay.  She's been looking for jobs with less exposure, but it's difficult to find jobs of equal or greater pay with a teacher skillset (which is dumb, but a whole different conversation).  \n\n\nWhile I agree with her that she's in a high risk environment, it is scary, and job prospects are minimal, I'm struggling to continue to be supportive.  It seems that her stress levels are increasing by the day and it's just becoming more crippling and I'm running out of sympathy/empathy to give.  I'm not upset with her about it because I love her and truly understand that it's a difficult situation, but I just feel my patients running out and I'm becoming more dismissive of it which makes me feel like an asshole.  I especially feel like an asshole because now I think the cumulative stress/anxiety are giving her migranes and GI issues.  \n\n\nI also feel like I'm becoming more of a caretaker and less of a significant other/romantic partner which sucks too.  I feel like I'm taking on more and more house responsibilities while pampering her more to help reduce the stress, but I'm just exhausted and I'm not seeing anything improve with my efforts (not that I think that I am capable of or responsible for \"fixing\" this).  \n\n\nOur sex life has also gone completely out the window because I'm guessing her stress levels are preventing her from feeling anything that resembles arousal.  I try to keep in mind that this is temporary and it's not that I'm not wanted/attractive or whatever, but you know...the whole \"I have needs\" thing.  I sometimes feel like I have to convince her to have sex or she does it to appease me which is a huge turnoff and I don't want that to be how sex works in my life.  Basically, if I didn't flirt at all or gesture toward sex, it would not be a thought on her mind and it would not happen at all.\n\n\nShe talks to a therapist about her anxiety and stress and such, but I've promised that I will never listen in or ask about it unless she wants to talk about something.  It got better for a few months, but as soon as omicron hit, it's just been getting worse and worse.  I've talked to her a few times about how its difficult to constantly be the \"strong\" one but it seems to just make things worse. I feel completely drained and struggle to tell her how I feel because it destroys her every time I let on that I'm having a rough time especially if it has anything to do with her.\n\n\nIs there anything I can do to help this situation?  I'm fresh out of ideas.\n\n\nTL;DR My partner is continuously overstressed about covid exposure to the point where (I think) it's causing her physical/mental health issues.  I am struggling to continue to be strong and supportive after more than 2 years of this and feel awful thT I feel like that.  I feel like I have turned into a caretaker instead of a romantic partner.  Help!",

Although we\u2019ve had our moments and a couple of close calls, we have a great relationship and continue to grow together as we get older. I love him more than anything. Whenever I suggested we live together once our leases end, he would stay silent so one day I called him out and asked why he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. He responded with \u201cI want to live you with you but I don\u2019t know.\u201d This essentially translated to \u201cnot yet\u201d. I was crushed and I feel like I love him a lot more than he loves me. Additionally, I believe my current roommate will be moving in with her boyfriend at the end of our lease. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll have to move back home. I\u2019m scared that if that happens I\u2019ll resent my boyfriend and we\u2019ll end up breaking up. But at the same time I know I can\u2019t force someone to be ready to move in with me. Help!\n\nEdit: I should add that when we talked about it he mentioned he didn\u2019t have a lot in his savings but I argued that it wouldn\u2019t be any different financially from his current living situation, and that in fact, we\u2019d end up saving more money. He also has bad anxiety and depression and doesn\u2019t do well with change. Not excusing it, but wanted to add context. \n\nTL;DR boyfriend of 7 years doesn\u2019t want to move in with me which means I\u2019ll potentially have to move back home.

My sister (21F)  has recently graduated with a bachelors and is ready to enter the workforce. She asked almost a year ago if when the time came she could move up here for work. I encouraged this as my city has a lot of jobs in physics and engineering that could prove good for her, but was hesitant and made sure she really wanted to live with me. In her words \"your crazy matches my crazy,\" plus we have lived together before and enjoyed it.\n\nAs we get closer to the reality of the move, I've had to sort of bring her down to earth with this move. I have a very limited income and being able to afford a place with her in this area is going to be hard. I have a friend (24F) who is also looking for a place to live and could assist with rent. They have both agreed to meet up on a day off and go through an escape room to see if we can work under stress together. Everything on that side is great, we will be meeting in 2 weeks to do this. \n\nMy concern is with Sister and where she is on jobs. If I'm the only person paying the rent the first month while she waits to get paid or find a job, this will be an unsustainable rooming. I keep trying to get the idea across that I am stressing about this but the stressors are not something I can control, and their reassurances haven't been great for me. I was told (by Friend and Sister) that we need to find a place and move by February. That is now looking like March.

It's his first relationship, so it was his first everything, and It's going really well, he's helping me deal with a lot of bad experiences from past relationships, and we really love each other, we lived in the same town for a while and so we spent just about every day together. \nI recently started studying and moved to a different country, I've done long distance before and there are no real issues in the relationship, he's expressed that I'm his priority, that he'll follow me abroad and wait for me if I want to do a year of Erasmus, and expressed that he wants to move in together at some point in the future. He is in his last year of university, so by Summer he will start working and he's thinking of joining me abroad. We have had very different experiences growing up, and currently are in very different parts of our lives; him ending university and starting his career, me having worked before and only now managing to enter university. \n\nI love him very very much but the longer I am abroad the more I notice our differences, and our different outlooks. Wether it's our motivations to work or study, or just our way of going through life, he is very serious and studious with a goofy side, he has his stuff together so to say, he wants a stable life to move in together and eventually have a family. I'm chaotic with fluctuating mental health, moved around all my life and more passionate or I guess impulsive about things, I couldn't imagine living in one place for the rest of my life or settling down in the near future. \n\nIt is a very mature relationship, theres no fooling around about the fact that we want a future together, but more and more I find myself disillusioned.\n\n I have this craving to just be single again, to be a student and experience things from scratch again; to have short relationships or flings and not have to worry about what will happen to him if I want to move to a new country, I also don't want him to have to uproot his life everytime I decide I want to go somewhere else. That's not fair to him. \nTo sum it up I want to have no responsibilities other than myself for a while. \nIt's the perfect relationship, if only I were a couple years older, if I were done with studying or trying to settle it would be perfect, but currently I want everything but that. \n\nI dont know whether to stick it out for another while and see how it goes or express my feelings to him. Although I know it would crush him. He knows my want to travel and 'independence' and constantly mentions he doesn't mind as long as he can be by my side. I feel so guilty for feeling these things and don't know what to do. \n\ntldr\nShould I continue my stable relationship or follow my feelings and break it off to be able to travel and experience things without responsibilities? \n\nShould I stay in the relationship and see where it goes or make the decision to break it off?",

        "title": "How can I help my flatmate without hurting myself?",
        "content": "Hi! So lately I (19F) and one of my other flatmates (20F) have been having some issues with our third flatmate (22F), who I will call L. We all met in our first year at Uni, and we moved into a flat together for our second year. We have signed the flat together for our third year next year as well. Unfortunately, L struggles with depression and ADHD, and this often negatively affects her studies. Previously, she had dropped out of 2 different unis, and this is the first time she has ever made it into the 2nd year. We're extremely proud and supportive of her, but living together has caused some issues we did not predict. \n\nDue to her depression, L often sleeps late or naps throughout the day, which causes her to miss classes and fall behind on work. Due to her ADHD, she cannot focus on completing her assignments, and she often finds herself extremely overwhelmed to the point where she cannot focus on anything. My other flatmate and I try to support her by inviting her to sit and work with us (as this is often helpful for people with ADHD), by listening and offering advice, or even washing her dishes/cleaning for her when she can't get the energy to. I do not mind helping her or listening to her vent AT ALL; I love supporting my friends, and I know what she's going through. However, I'll lay out the issues we've been having because I need some advice.\n\nI myself have struggled immensely with my mental health in the past. I'm currently in recovery from an eating disorder, I have an anxiety disorder and panic attacks, I'm in the process of being diagnosed with OCD, and I used to suffer from severe depression. I've managed to pull myself out of that enough to function well most days and I'm on the path to happiness. However, living with someone who is extremely vocal about their struggles is proving very difficult for me. She often wanders the house sighing and yelling, throwing herself on the ground, or saying things like \"I wish I were dead!!\" I understand it isn't her fault, and I know that any stress it's causing me is minimal to the stress that she feels. However, sometimes knowing that she's upset makes me feel physically ill, and her comments about \"stress eating\" make me not want to eat. Our other flatmate is often annoyed by L cancelling plans due to a lack of energy, and I try to explain to her that L cannot help her depression, and while the other flatmate knows this, she can't help feeling upset. It's turned the house into a tense place where we all desperately want to help but do not know how we can.\n\nWe constantly tell L to phone her GP and get medicine/therapy, but I understand from years of refusing help that it's not always that easy. She is in the process of getting medicine for her ADHD, but other than that she does not seem to have plans to get help. Her behaviour is, unfortunately, becoming harmful to the household, and I do not think she is aware of how her actions are affecting all of us. I just want to know how to help her without allowing her struggles to drag us both down to a very dark place. \n\nTLDR: My flatmate, who struggles with depression, is beginning to bring me down with her. I struggle with my mental health as well, and I need to find a way to help her without it being to my detriment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thank you!!!!!",

        "content": "Hey world,\n\nI\u2019m writing to you because I feel like my hands are tied and after a long time going around in circles on the same-ish issues I keep coming to the same conclusions and not knowing what to do about it aside from build a nasty habit of codependent overthinking, and valuing myself based on how much I do or don\u2019t disappoint others. Actually, codependency is a good place to start. I recently learned in 2020 through working with my therapist that I was very much a codependent people-pleaser. Realizing this made me realize how often I had been used by those closest to me, willingly. I noticed I allowed myself to pine and pine after my romantic interests, and allowed myself to be used for free work with my \u201cbest friend\u201d and \u201cbusiness partner\u201d, noticing that \u201cwhen was the last, or first, time she ever did something for me?\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s two relationships I\u2019m struggling with. As I move through this long-winded resentment stage of realizing I\u2019m codependent. \n\nMy ?partner? who ,for about 1.5 years, I\u2019ve \u201cbeen on the cusp\u201d of making it \u201cofficial\u201d with, and my ?best friend? who I run a creative company with that is for \u201cdiverse creatives\u201d but for some reason, somehow, we\u2019ve only been making her work. She also only seems interested in talking about me when its demanding I do something or its about her. Or gossiping. Anyways, I live with these two people (and my best friend\u2019s partner). We are all in our mid-late \u201820, btw. They are also friends, and how I met my partner (for lack of a better term).  \n\nI don\u2019t know where to start or what to say/not to say, but without including years on end of context\u2026 here\u2019s kind of a taste.\n\nI\u2019ve always felt that I didn\u2019t click with her as friends, she\u2019s more uptight, aggressive, and self-centered. I\u2019m more passive, people-pleasy, and goofy. I don\u2019t want to let go of our business because I am finally about to allow myself to make my own project instead of just hers, and I want to utilize the following I have (nearly) single handedly built through my social media work and online media. But, while she may say we align, we don\u2019t. We just don\u2019t. I also know for a fact that she judges me for having ADHD or not being more rigid. She hates the boundaries I\u2019ve put up since beginning to unlearn people-pleasing tendencies, and is taking me taking time for myself during unpaid projects as personal.\n\nWith my partner, we\u2019ve clicked from the beginning. And we\u2019ve had a \u201cthing\u201d basically always. Though, even though it has lessened and lessened, it has always been me pursuing him and him rewarding me. But we handle stress differently. He also worked on the project with my best friend and I that we did recently, and was just hell. Our house felt like an office at all times, and still does. He gets really angry and defensive, and I shut down and attempt to be honest and it doesn\u2019t work. He has a little bit of that uptight hustle thing she has that I don\u2019t have. Though he is generally more like me. \n\nAnyways, the core reason of me writing this is, I feel like neither of them like being around me. But they love hanging out on their own (not in a romantic way, just a friend way). For example, he was gone for two weeks visiting family, and she ghosted me the whole time in our own house minus sending passive aggressive emails. He gets back, she lights up and acts \u201cnormal.\u201d He does too, and when it\u2019s just me and him chatting, he\u2019s solemn. But with her, it\u2019s all fun and games! \n\nAre they picking up on how absolutely depressed I am and just don\u2019t want to deal with it? \n\nI don\u2019t know. And I feel like with him at least, I\u2019ve tried SO many times to have \u201ca productive talk\u201d about an issue and it never goes well. I feel like he\u2019s tired of it and I\u2019m tired of trying.\n\nI want him to want me and want to be around me. And I want her to be at least friendly. And I hate feeling like I\u2019m being judged constantly for not being as \u201con top of things\u201d IN HER OPINION as her.\n\nOur lease is up in 4 months. So whatever I do then, I am at least stuck in this dynamic for now. Walking on eggshells in different and same ways as both of them.\n\nTL/DR: I live with my partner and my best friend (and her partner). He\u2019s kind of my partner and she\u2019s definitely not my best friend based on how she treats me.

It has been only a month, the relationship kinda progressed faster than it normally would. He treats me like a princess even though he say that it's just him. He reassures me everyday that he loves me and buys me gift. \n\nHe is pretty honest and so am I. We basically don't hide anything. And have already made plans to meet up and if all goes smoothly, we will move in together after graduation and stuff like that.\n\nHowever, we have been fighting over small things for 3 days. We both always try to talk it out, and it's fine now. We always hang out with his friends, but the past few days we just don't know what to do. He has a female friend who is 18, he always say that she is a child to him. However, I always get jealous when he laughs more with her yet he is really quiet with me.\nI'm really insecure about all these. So I start to over think things, but he always make sure that I feel okay. He mentioned that he felt like something is not right because we fought for 3 days continuously.\n\nI just wanna know if it's normal to like have nothing to do as a couple.

        "content": "So about a year ago (sometime around Christmas, 2020) I had the very uncomfortable experience of giving shelter to an acquaintance who had been kicked out of her flat by her partner. That day I was hanging out with my friend, and we were out for a walk when my aquaintance called my friend about it, in panic (my friend was a bit closer to her, whereas I had only met her a couple weeks back..logistically speaking, it was very lucky that I live very close to the aquaintance lady). We went to meet her and helped out giving support, we had food at mine and chilled out for a while. Her partner was also a very new aquaintance to me, but my friend had known him for years. In the end the lady manages to sort things out with the partner and is able to go back home. However, while the lady is with us, she confesses a bunch of things about the relationship (including secret drug use/overdose from her partner who has part custody of his minor daughter, which for me was too much to know), but I did my best to make her feel like she was safe. In general, if i end up finding out about abuse and criminal behaviour of an acquaintance, I'm sorry you can't seriously expect me to act nice and friendly because I can't move past that in my head (even if I still did say hello hows it going each time I saw him through last year). These kinds of things are very serious to me. The sole fact that the dude kicked her out from her own home made me so angry that i found it very hard to keep my mouth shut. I was ready to call the police myself, but she wanted to wait it out a few hours. \n\nOk, so that's the important incident in this story. I'm not done, though. Another \"incident\" that happened was between me and the dude. This happened a few weeks prior the aforementioned afternoon. As I mentioned, my close friend had known the couple for years and I was introduced to them through her. Personally, I never really liked the guy, I sensed danger, but I never acted upon it. Besides, after the guy found out that I run a small business (I make tailored and customised bags for cycling and more), he was interested in a backpack. For people that I meet in person, I am always happy to provide \"special\" service (which I stopped because of too many bad experiences), and he wanted to \"discuss\" about a special backpack at my flat. Ok...I assumed that he had already checked out my (very extensive) online shop, prices, and details. He didn't. Ok...I still engaged in small talk, showed him what I do, and explained to him my models. He said \"ok let's go for this bag, I'll pay you when you start it\" (thank god I did NOT start it). One thing about me btw is that I hate when aquaintances pretend to be my friends, he wasn't my friend, and he wasn't respecting me as an actual business. But I never said anything. A few months go by, and since I never made the bag, I wasn't too bothered, but the situation still pissed me off big time. In the meantime I see him around at group hangouts, and he mentions the bag (\"sorry about the bag in the end I didn't need it\"), but I just smile and nod.\n\nRecently he messaged me again about this bag idea (1+ years later? Like nothing happened? Is this normal? Am I crazy??) And I'm not having it. I'm not only busy with two jobs, I'm also studying, and I'm struggling with delibitating mental health illness/trauma which all take a huge toll on me. I know it's rude, but I didn't feel like replying. I don't know what to say, and I do feel offended. \n\nI don't want to turn it into \"drama\" where he potentially talks back. I'm not mentally stable, I'm not confident, and I don't want to deal with it. I don't want to share to other people what happened last year, I don't wanna be an a**hole, but by now I have told everything to another two people (yes, I know it's wrong, but neither know each other). I kept quiet this whole time, I would never want to use it against him (I never said anything negative about him or \"warned\" anyone)but I never experienced anything like this in my life, so I'm open to the thought that I may be wrong to judge...but it doesn't sit right with me, to me that incident was too serious. The guy never apologised nor showed any sign of shame to me. I may be a bit extreme, probably...everyone makes mistakes, nobody is perfect, so I shouldn't hold grudges...but I can't move past it. I'm not sure whats the best thing to do, because I will see him in person at some point if I go to any social event. Im thinking to contact his partner, but we have not spoken since and I feel weird about it.\n\n\nTL;DR: I feel uncomfortable about an aquaintance who I know too much about and wish for him to respect my boundaries and stop acting like we are friends, but I don't know how to communicate it and I'm scared of the possible outcomes or consequences (emotional toll, possible social consequences/drama talk/gossip, stress, anxiety) if I message him about it myself.",

        "content": "Before COVID, my wife was having business trips abroad every month. She developed some kind of relationship with a colleague from another country with which she started texting. At some point I started feeling that this is going too far and let her know about it. She stopped talking about the guy and he disappeared from her \"recent chats\". I thought that she took corrective action. But I was wrong.\n\nAt some point I discovered that her guy is hidden under a female's name. Instantly,\u00a0 I realized that I do not know what is going on, ego and trust shattered, emotions skyrocketed. I immediately started collecting information to see what was going on and to see if there was any physical relationship. I saw a huge amount of texting with the guy and some texting with other guys she was meeting on her business trips. Mostly talking about how about their day to day business with occasional light flirting. I found evidence of her going to dinner with the guy. I've also found that she met other guys to visit tourist attractions on her business trips. It seems that she was seeking attention, validation and compliments from other dudes. She was discussing with her girlfriends a lot about her adventures. She was sharing what compliments she received, discussing if she should go to dinner with a guy, sharing her experience that it was great and she received a lot of compliments and so on. However, I could not find evidence of any physical cheating. Nowadays, you have a lot of tracking devices: cell phones, smart watches, laptops. With some IT skills you can recover a lot of information from those devices and social interactions on what was happening most of the time. If there was physical cheating, she did an amazing job in hiding it. I do not feel well that I checked on her but I felt like I had to dig through that shit in order to understand what was going on and if we have a future together.\n\nI started confronting her by carefully asking who that lady was. I thought that she was going to lie to me about it. However, she immediately admitted\u00a0 that it is that guy and she changed his name wanting to protect me and fearing that I will not allow her to continue her communication. She said that I was too much into computer games, she felt some void and she thought that it is nothing wrong to fill that void if you do not go physical. Now she realized that it was wrong, apologized and stopped doing it.\n\nWell, even after a few years it is hard to let it go. Occasionally, I could not stop myself from bitterly reminding her about her adventures. It is detrimental to our relationship. I did not realize that the emotional cheating concept exists and how devastating it can be. If it was to happen in the beginning of relationships, it would certainly be a deal breaker. With kids, common property, mortgages it is not so easy to walk away. So, our marriage still continues but now it feels slightly rotten.\n\nI would appreciate if you could share your similar experiences, opinions and advice on how to let those hard feelings go away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Wife caught using female name to hide her texting other guy to seek attention, validation and compliments. How to let hard feelings go away?",

        "content": "  Obviously NSFW. \n\nMy husband and I have been together for ten years. He\u2019s a genuinely wonderful human being: loving, funny, smart, supportive. We\u2019ve been able to work through issues and grow together over the years. Truly the biggest issue left is sex. \n\nMy husband has always had difficulty coming during sex when he\u2019s inside me. He needs a long time and to be in a certain position. In our decade of fucking, I think he\u2019s come in a different position twice. Sex usually lasts 30-45 minutes, 20 or more of those with me just lying on my back waiting for him to come. \n\nThis is not an issue when he\u2019s masturbating, which makes sense to me. It\u2019s a lot easier getting there when n you control all the variables yourself. \n\nI\u2019m not just lying there like a dead fish \u2014 I\u2019ve tried a number of things both in the  moment and during foreplay to speed him up. I\u2019ve also asked him to masturbate  less. I think part of the problem is he\u2019s so used to coming that way is he can only come if it feels the same way. \n\nwe had a lot of arguments about this early on in our relationship. I physically could not have sex for that long, he\u2019d just keep going trying to come, I\u2019d dread having sex and put it off, he\u2019d take even longer. After a bunch of not super fun conversations, we got to a good place. We had sex for fun and to bond, but both of us were okay stopping it before he came. \n\nYou may be asking, OP, you haven\u2019t mentioned you coming at all! Couple reasons for that. I come from a conservative religious upbringing, I\u2019m on antidepressants that seriously dampen my sex drive, and I\u2019ve only ever been able to come with a vibrator. I would love it if my husband took the time to learn what makes me come, but I don\u2019t quite know myself. Whenever I\u2019ve tried to give him directions, he kinda sucked at following them. Several times I\u2019ve suggested using a toy during sex and he blew me off.\n\nLately I\u2019ve been really sick of this situation. If I\u2019m having long sex sessions, I want to enjoy it. Instead I feel like a fucking sex toy just getting pounded. I don\u2019t know how to fix this or even bring it up. It\u2019s not like I can say \u201cI\u2019m so bored during sex that I\u2019m composing Reddit posts in my head.\u201d\nHe\u2019d be devastated and shut down, and nothing would get better. \n\nSo, Reddit, what can I do? How can I bring this up gently and productively? What can I do myself to learn my own body? \n\nTLDR: Sex with my husband is boring, repetitive, and overly long. How do I bring this up, and what can we do to solve this problem together?",

        "title": "My [52M] marriage/relationship with my wife [54F] (20 years) is an emotional roller coaster and I'm exhausted",
        "content": "We have been together for 20 years but we are pretty different people, which has caused us problems but is also interesting and exciting when it works. She is very emotional, and I don't mean that in a bad way, she is just completely driven by and lives and breathes emotions, first and foremost before anything else. I have emotions of course but am more analytical, to be honest I don't trust my emotions and take steps to keep them in check. I think this difference is something that attracted us to each other to begin with.\n\nShe has always been expressive, exuberant, and extroverted, and despite our differences we have had some fun and have two kids (now teenagers). Our relationship has had challenges and we've had fights and blowups but we always bounced back. However over the past couple of years things seem different to me, probably some combination of both of us but to me it just feels like an emotional roller coaster with crazy highs and lows that changes by the day sometimes by the hour.\n\nFor example. Monday morning she is in a great mood, gets up early, exercises by herself before I even get up, brings me a cup of coffee with a big hug. I work a full day which was a bad stressful day. During dinner prep later the same day she bursts into tears over something one of the kids that she teaches said to another, and is really upset that I didn't fully support her in this moment (I also bad a bad day), and we have a fight over it. Dinner was a stony silence and after we watched TV separately and went to bed. Tuesday morning she kind of avoids me and goes to work. I got a few perfunctory texts about groceries. She says she wants to have a glass of wine together after work. But after work she's on the phone with one of her friends for 45 minutes apparently forgot what she said earlier and we don't talk. Through dinner she's distracted and unavailable and we don't really talk. Wednesday morning she gets up grumpy and it's stony silence all morning until she goes to work. After work all of a sudden she's \"back\", open, happy, chatty, gives me a bug hug and says \"I love you so much!\" out of the blue. From my perspective it looks like an emotional high, low, and high in less than 3 days. I have my ups and downs but not like this. On other days, if I have a bad day, she will be the most wonderful and supportive person you've ever seen, listen to everything I say, give me a back rub after dinner, etc. whereas a week prior she would have reacted completely differently to the same situation.\n\nA few weeks ago we were at dinner for her birthday having a great time, eating, drinking, chatting, a great date. As dessert arrived I said something about going out again and she starts to freak out about covid, not only the potential future date/location but starting to grill me about places I've been, how many people were there, how worried she is about covid, that her parents might get sick, etc. In the space of 60 seconds she went from having a great time to freaking out and we finished dinner in silence. \n\nSometimes we will be in the middle of an argument and she is stern and angry, and someone will call or knock at the door and in an instant she'll flip to a happy, friendly person to talk to that person, and when she is done, she'll flip right back to stern and angry when talking to me, even in the space of a few minutes.\n\nShe struggles to talk about things that are on her mind, difficult things, but even good things, because she feels like she can be overwhelming when she's \"too much\". I can tell when something is on her mind, but can never coax it out of her. If I ask what's on her mind she says \"nothing\" or \"I'm fine\" even when it is clear she isn't. But then, usually after 2-3 days, it will come out, usually at some very inopportune time, like in front of the kids or when we're rushing to go somewhere or, sometimes, during foreplay (the rare times that happens). But it seems like there is always something on her mind, some problem she can't express.\n\nIt is just an unpredictable roller coaster, from day to day or even hour to hour I have no idea what I will get whether it be happy, angry, distant, distracted, loving, etc. and it is utterly exhausting. It's the unpredictability that is most stressful for me, and I never realized that I needed someone that is just more reliable. People talk about having \"no filter\" which is part of it. When I try to mention this to her (which I have tried many different ways, directly, indirectly, hinting, after asking if we can have a talk, etc) she absolutely files into a rage, totally offended by the idea that I think she is \"crazy\", and she is unable to even talk about it, and this usually leads to the usual 2-3 days of stony silence.\n\nThe past 2 years have been a weird time with covid and spending a lot more time in the house and around one another. But I am just completely worn out. It is to the point that if she says or does something nice I don't take it in, and literally just give it a few hours to see if her mood turns. And if she starts to get grumpy, I mentally plan on avoiding her for 2-3 days until she comes back. I avoid talking about anything weighty or important because her reaction is completely unpredictable. Forget about counting on her for love or support or all of the things you hope for from your life partner, every time we talk it's a complete roll of the dice.\n\nShe's a few years after menopause and I would probably sound like a dick for suggesting that has something to do with it. But I have honestly wondered if she is bipolar or some other condition. I know bipolar, depressed and anxious people but I'm not around them every day to know if this is their normal. She has been in therapy on and off for most of her life and sees her therapist at least once or twice a month. What they talk about I don't know but it certainly doesn't seem to have any positive effect on this. At one point about a year ago she tried taking an anti-depressant (Zoloft I think, half dose), which did nothing for the emotional highs and lows but 100% killed her libido (which is shaky to begin with) so she stopped it.\n\nI am not sure what I'm asking for but maybe just some ideas or validation or suggestions or maybe someone who has had a similar kind of experience.\n\n\n---\nTL;DR my wife has always been emotional but the past 2 years have been a roller coaster so bad that I want to go live by myself in the woods.",

        "title": "My (22F) grandfather (81M) is treating my grandmother (80F) horribly and I can't bear to watch it",
        "content": "Let me start off by saying I love my grandfather very much. We had a wonderful relationship when I was growing up, we had a few shared interests and we would talk about them from time to time. He was very sentimental and enjoyed the time we spent together. He said so many supportive and wonderful things to me growing up and I am very grateful I had this time with him. \n\nFlash forward to present day,  I moved off to college and started seeing him a lot less because I lived very far away. Over these past couple of years, especially during the time of the pandemic, he has changed dramatically. He was diagnosed with diabetes 30 years ago and has been managing the illness all this time, but my grandmother was really the only one encouraging him to take his blood and his medicine and eat right and get plenty of exercise. He has gotten very weak recently, very frail, and hardly does much. Now, I understand. He's very old and he has a serious illness. But here is the problem and the part that's making me deeply upset: My grandmother is doing every last thing for him and she's getting verbally abused along the way. \n\n To elaborate, she has cooked him every single meal since they were married (he cannot even boil an egg), puts the plate down in front of him, and he doesn't even clean up, or even the BARE MINIMUM like putting his dish in the sink, or push in his chair after he's eaten. Every day consists of this: he wakes up, turns on the tv, gets called to breakfast, takes the medicines that he doesn't even know he's taking (as in he couldn't recall them to me or a doctor if somebody asked), goes back to watch tv, gets up for lunch, back to the tv, gets called for dinner, back to the tv. The TV is in their bedroom so he's watching TV lying down. He does not leave their house. He cannot drive. Now all of this would be perfectly within reason for a man his age and with this illness, but he is SO mean about it. He refuses to shower, he doesn't even cut his nails, he doesn't cover his mouth when he coughs so he coughs all over food, he has no manners anymore, he uses the same fork he is eating with and takes food out of someone else's plate (I would never refuse him food, but I wish he'd just ask, and also with COVID it feels very risky to do this), he yells at my grandmother when she calls him to dinner, something like \"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? I'M COMING, JESUS CHRIST!!!\" after she's simply just called out his name and said \"dinner's ready!\" The only reason she's speaking loudly is because he can't hear very well. \n\nI could go on forever, but the worst part is she's just trying her best to keep him alive. He's had two serious medical episodes this last year (he passed out after not taking his medicine and he had a mini-sstroke after not taking his medicine on Christmas Day). The doctors all tell him he needs to manage his medicines independently and make serious lifestyle changes if he wants to live. Yeah, if he wants to live at all. Not live one more year, just live period. He will die if he keeps this up. But he is incapable of caring for himself and my grandma is taking on a lot. This would be fine if he was sweet about it but he is anything but. He rolls his eyes at her but he usually yells and verbally abuses her whenever she tells him to take his medicine or his blood. And to add to this he cannot stop eating sugar! My grandma is allowed sugar, she works hard to feed him and her and to keep the house in order. She is allowed a treat so there is some sugar in the house (ice cream, maybe some hershey's kisses). But whenever she has it out, he finds it and forcefully asks for it. Once I was eating some hershey's kisses and he pulled the bag from me even after I said \"you can't eat this, you just had bread (which is bad for a diabetic)\". If we entrust him to take his medicine for a die (giving him independence and control in his own life which he needs to have) he forgets and that's why the episodes happen. Or he gets very sick and soils his pants and refuses to change out of them. He sits on the couch and chairs like this. His personal hygiene has gone out the window. My grandmother's home, which she works so hard to keep nice and homey, is no longer an enjoyable place for her to live. She is cleaning and cooking and decorating for two adults without so much as a thank you. \n\nMy grandma does everything. She always has. And I just hate to see her in so much emotional stress over keeping him alive and also being made to feel so awful. My heart breaks for her because I feel like she deserves to be taken care of in her older years too. She deserves to be given a wonderful life, with a loving and protective partner. Someone who will drive her to doctor's appointments and organize fun dinners out. Instead it's always her and she doesn't even get a thank you. I just want her to be okay. I hate seeing her suffer like this. I hate seeing my grandpa deteriorate like this but I also hate seeing him be so cruel and so belligerent. How do I help them? What can I do to ensure my grandma is living a better quality of life and not taking care of my grandfather like this? How can I tell my grandfather his behavior is upsetting everyone? He is still coherent and understands us just fine. I don't know what's happened to him. It's alarming and it's unfair to put my grandma in this situation any further. She needs relief.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: my grandfather's health has declined severely in the last couple of years and his primary caretaker has become my grandmother. his verbal abuse towards her has increased and her role as abused and caretaker is destroying my grandmother's quality of life",

We both finished our undergraduate degrees and moved out of the area we went to school in at the end of last summer. I went to a different state to complete a post-baccalaureate and my girlfriend moved back in with her parents. We have plans to move in together later this year when I move back to our home state to start graduate school. \n\nMy girlfriend found a retail job once she was back at her parents house but the environment was hostile so she quit after 2 months (reasonably so in my opinion). She has not been able to do much since she quit. She\u2019s been looking for remote job positions but hasn\u2019t secured one and it\u2019s been very frustrating for her. On top of that, she doesn\u2019t have any friends in the area she\u2019s living so she doesn\u2019t get contact with anyone outside her immediate family. I think not having any social interaction or mental stimulation is getting to her and she\u2019s become quite depressed. I try to help her in any way I can. I let her vent, I suggest ways that she could make friends, I talk about the different treatments for depression that she could try and I just generally try to be uplifting in a non-patronizing way. But it hasn\u2019t worked. She shoots down my ideas or doesn\u2019t pursue them. I think she is purposefully sabotaging herself in a way I\u2019ve seen people with depression (including myself) do previously. \n\nOn top of all of this, I\u2019ve noticed that she\u2019s checking out of our relationship.

Even if we do hang out half the time she acts like she would rather not be there.\n\nEarlier today, I told her all of this and that I was worried about her and our relationship.

They're pretty traditional \"1950s gender role\" types and I'm *not* so I had pretty much no expectations this was going to go well. But I agreed to play nice because I love my boyfriend and his family's important to him.\n\nWell we're setting the table and the topic of school comes up because I might be moving about three hours away for college. His mom makes passive aggressive comments like \"I guess my grandchildren aren't important to you\" and such. At this point I'm pretty much livid and trying really hard to keep my calm for my boyfriend's sake. But she just keeps pushing.\n\nThey're about to say grace and I just sit there in silence, hands in my lap. His mother makes a comment about how I don't even pray like I'm an animal. Like she literally basically called me a savage. So I snapped. I tried to keep the peace, she clearly wanted a fight so she's getting her fight.\n\nI go off on her about how she's a \"miserable old crone\" and went to cry in the guest room. My boyfriend tries to comfort me and we go to bed.\n\nWhen I wake up, it's a new day and a new leaf. I go for a run and decide to make breakfast for everyone with my boyfriend (who's a fantastic cook) and his mother comes down to join us. She makes a comment about my attire being inappropriate. I was wearing a sports bra and leggings btw, you know... comfortable running clothes. I ignore it and continue on with my day.\n\nWe're eating breakfast and she just flat out says she doesn't like me and that she's positive I'm \"just a whore\" for her son. Who says nothing to defend me.\n\nI just want to be civil at this point. Fuck getting along. I just want to find a way to exist in the same space together without devolving into a shouting match. Is it even possible? And is it even worth it or is it a waste of energy? How do I bridge the divide?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend's mom hates me because of generational differences, I want to try and be civil but I'm not sure it's even worth the effort.",

        "content": "My boyfriend (34M) and I (22F) have been together 8 months. We started dating in May. \n\nAt the beginning of the relationship I had NO trust issues, I seriously thought there was no way he would every do anything wrong. He expressed that he had been cheated on and how it was an awful feeling for him, which in a way made me feel like he was above that.  \n\nWe both know each others phone passwords. I decided to look at his messages and found texts asking a girl to go out to a baseball game the day he dropped me off at the airport. This was July 10th. Another message was him swiping up on her story saying her hair looked beautiful. I confronted him and his answers were all over the place. That the text was meant for his sister, she\u2019s not even in the same state, and he was just being nice. I figured I would give him the benefit of the doubt and brush it off. \n\nHe always tells me \u201cLet me find out.. Let me find out there\u2019s someone else.. etc\u201d Sometimes this is a joke, sometimes not. He has awful trust issues, but at the same time this raises my concerns. Why is he so worried about ME cheating? constantly saying \u201clet me find out\u201d when he could be doing it. So I looked at his phone again, this was last month. He had messaged another girl. She wrote back asking if he had meant to text her. He said \u201cyes\u201d and there wasn\u2019t much more to the conversation. From what I know, it\u2019s his friends wife but the husband passed away last year. Again, brushed it off. Maybe he was just reaching out to make sure she\u2019s okay or maybe i\u2019m just ignoring the red flag? \n\nYesterday I noticed he changed his password, so I look one more time. He swiped up on another girls photo saying \u201cGorgeous, very nice.\u201d She said thanks and that was that. There was no more conversation. \n\nI\u2019m so confused. I know if I did it he would be livid. Am I overthinking it or crazy for not acting sooner? \n\nI plan on ending the relationship because of many things, but ultimately the fact that we are not compatible. He is very close minded, not the best listener, and really just talks about himself. \n\nWhy does he go out of his way to tell me he loves me and that he thinks about marrying me but does that? He\u2019s gifted me many nice things, I know that means nothing but he doesn\u2019t have to do it, so why does he? Just yesterday he told me he wanted to buy me the vanity I wanted for my beauty room and told me to start planning a vacation for us. WHY?\n\nTL;DR Found my boyfriend messaging other girls. Goes out of his way to tell me he loves me, talks about getting married, buys me expensive gifts. WHY?",

        "content": "TLDR; My girlfriend told me she doesn\u2019t love me the same anymore, unlike the first few years. Says we are different, she doesn\u2019t feel like herself, and does no look forward to our conversations.She was getting distant for about 8 months prior. Long distance started 4 months ago.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my SO for about 7 years now. We\u2019ve been each other\u2019s everything. Talked about being soulmates, marriage, and best friends through our initial years, and now.\n\nI was from across state and she was local. We met during undergrad as friends, started dating a year later, and when I graduated I decided to move home to save money. We were about two years together at this point.\nWe decided to make it work because I was applying to higher education near her, about 30-40 min drive away. A year later we were near each other again. That year was still was tough, but we made it work, we were able to see each other maybe once a month and spoke everyday through the phone.\n\nShe\u2019s been a blessing to me for being the nicest, humble, and loving person I know. She is also one of the most understanding and unselfish human. My education would be an extra 3 years full time. She spent majority of the time making the commute to me since I lived in my own apartment abut once a week or every other week we\u2019d see each other. I also made the occasional trip to her. We decided this was optimal since she preferred being away from her parents, and I got to study a little more. Around a 3:1 - 4:1 ratio of her visiting me vs me visiting her. I supported her as well in our relationship with her conservative parents since they would always keep tabs on her and provide a lot of stresses towards her. Essentially controlling parents. \n\nThe last two years we were beginning to talk about living together, our future, and marriage. Which I know were were excited for. However our parents would rather us be married before even moving in together (my family brings little traditional as well), which I understood. So my plan was to move home for another year, save up some money, and that\u2019d give her a chance to get things together since she had just started a new job. Moving out for her at the moment wasn\u2019t a choice for her at the time and we both understood that this decision was for our future. Mid way last year, I really started to sense a little distance, she attributed it to mental health, which I know she deals with. I was supportive of her and tried to assist in getting her some help. Once I moved home, I sensed distance being put between us. Conversations were pretty dead, she was too tired, I would be the only one to imitate phone calls or messaging. This time she really leaned into mental health decline, and was actively looking for help. She does have an initial meeting with a therapist later this month. Which I\u2019m happy for her to start.\n\nA few nights ago, we were talking and I was reminiscing about something her and I did during our two years together, and she started to cry and admitted her decreasing love for me. She says she\u2019s been so unsure of what she\u2019s been feeling and thinks the way she\u2019s been acting towards me was because she had less love for me. She said she wasn\u2019t herself, would sometimes not look forward to talking to me. She also claimed that we were too different. However I think people who are different can be together. The last year she\u2019s been keeping her feelings to herself and she finally had a cathartic break down. I was too speechless to say much towards her.  We agreed to gather our thoughts and talk about it at a better time this week.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m not the best boyfriend in the world, I\u2019m a pretty simple person, and my idea of a good time is cooking food together, finding a good restaurant to try, hanging with some friends, or staying in. I haven\u2019t done any huge grand gesture dates in a while, but we\u2019ve gone on trips together when we get a chance. There have been times where I\u2019ve thought about what it would be like to be with someone else, however deep down I know I love her more than leaving her to try other relationships because I feel like this love may not be trumped. \n\nAnyway, I posted this because I feel so lost of words. I wasn\u2019t able to say much to her except to tell her to think about the future we talked about. I hope I can get help to talk to her with a more clear mind. I\u2019ll try to answer any questions in the morning. I\u2019ll be going to sleep now.",

        "content": "Just some backstory:\n\nI met my [29F] old best friend [28F] way back when we were in elementary school. We were two peas in a pod- hung out all the time, went for coffee on the regular, went to the same high school and university... She was like a little sister to me, and we would confide each other in pretty much anything. I was also a bridesmaid in her wedding- I thought we were inseparable.\n\nThree or so years ago that changed. Slowly she changed a bit in terms of interests and that, but that's the norm also considering how people grow and change. Some things include:\n\n- Her telling my ex that I was dating someone new on my birthday to the point where he called me/texted at all hours until I blocked him as he was a neutral party.\n\n- Inviting said ex to a friendsgiving instead of myself and my partner because they \"felt bad\" and the two of us were backup.\n\n- Telling my husband to tell my boyfriend she didn't like a comment we made about her (It was in a joking manner and we apologized afterwords)\n\n- How she posted something on a public platform, and I gave her constructive feedback on the public platform. I apologized and explained to her my viewpoint, but she scoffed at me and said I shouldn't have done it in the first place.\n\nThere are more examples but I cannot recall them at the moment.\n\nWe just stopped talking when I kept trying to reach out an olive branch for us to do stuff during the pandemic (online drawing dates, Animal Crossing hangouts) but she ignored or said \"Sure\" and never went further than that.\n\nSince the last time we talked, I have moved away out of the country and married to my wonderful husband. Obviously with covid I haven't been able to visit my hometown, so I have kept busy with online friends and that while the pandemic is around.\n\nThis leads me to my conundrum. I miss my friend. I don't know if I should reach out and ask to reconnect. I don't know *how* much has changed. I don't know if she even wants to reconnect or not.\n\nWhat do I do? What do I even say if I decide to reconnect?\n\nTL;DR: Haven't spoken to an old friend in about two years. Do I reach out?",

Furthermore, I think their gaming addiction is coming back and it's \"impossible\" for me to have a genuine discussion with them.",
        "content": "I had to create a throwaway account to post this. Allow me to provide some context as I get into the severity of this situation.\n\nI (23F) have been with my partner (24M) since late-2017. They enjoy tabletop games, D&D, video games, and (overall) any activities that can keep their mind going, since they have ADHD. While I myself also have ADHD, it's not as intense as my partner's. For clarity: *When my partner hyper-fixates on something, it will either be very intense or moderate...there's no \"in-between.\"*\n\nIn 2019, my partner had to drop out of college as they became addicted to video games; this was my first relationship, and to go from in-person to long-distance dating in just a few days was a nightmare. My partner was an emotional wreck and even mentioned feeling suicidal due to their failure and familial expectations. Nevertheless, we kept our heads up and our relationship actually became stronger. But this is where a significant shift happened.\n\nHere's the timeline:\n\n* **February 2019:** My partner returns home to their small town, thirty minutes away. They decide to go cold turkey with gaming. They uninstalled Steam, limited their activity on Discord, etc.\n* **March 2019:** I visit my partner for the first time since they left college. Things seem fine. They mentioned that it's hard for them to leave the house due to their parents (early-50s) having full-time jobs that require both of the family cars.\n* **Mid-summer 2019:** My partner participates in online D&D campaigns during their free time from household chores. I'm not worried; they've enjoyed D&D for years and it never got as bad as their addiction to video games.\n* **December 2019:** My partner finally decides to find a job. There's limited options, and they still don't have a car. I realize that they haven't really left the house unless it was to play D&D at a mutual friend's house. (First red flag: barely getting out into the real world.)\n* **March 2020:** Pandemic hits. I move back into my own house; a job seems \"near-impossible\" for my partner as I continue my education online. During this time, my partner suggests that we \"use Discord instead of FaceTime.\" (This should have been my next clue.)\n* **September 2020:** I'm able to visit my partner in-person for the first time since the pandemic started. I've noticed that they're trying to find new hobbies, but they're starting to use Discord for more than our daily calls (D&D sessions, chatting with online friends, etc.) Unfortunately, I didn't think much of this.\n* **October 2020:** My partner has a new fixation-- TikTok. They experiment with their online persona on this platform, as well as Twitter.\n* **April 2021:** Partner finally gets a well-paying job where they can work from home.\n* **August 2021:** I visit my partner as we celebrate their 24th birthday together. Everything seems normal. I'm not really worried about the Discord situation, but I'm concerned that they're still not leaving the house that much unless it's to run a quick errand for their parents.\n* **October 2021:** My partner decides to get back into gaming. At first it's a once-a-week thing. I express minor concern. Because it's been so long, I trust their judgement. They also reveal that they have enough money to finally buy a car...but they put off looking for one.\n* **November 2021:** I'm monitoring how often they game without being overbearing. Around this same time, they begin experimenting with their identity due to the \"overwhelming support of their online friends on Twitter.\"\n* **December 2021:** Partner makes a decision regarding their identity. I'm taken aback but they assure me that *no major changes* are going to happen. They \"come out\" to their Twitter followers and then proceed to tell me a few minutes later.\n* **January 2022 (now):** My partner is a completely different person from the one I began dating....\n\nAllow me to elaborate: They started a new job that's full-time (45 hours a week). Still barely leaves the house unless it's to run an errand. Still can't focus on getting their own car. They're gaming for at least four hours a day, every day of the week now. They're beginning to change their identity, starting with pronouns (and this is a significant concern because there's no \"stability,\" they're contradicting themself, changing their story, very impulsive, acting like transitioning isn't a big deal, etc)...\n\nI don't know how else to explain my concerns. But the biggest red flag of all is the fact that, this past Monday night, I asked my partner if we could set aside some time to have a genuine discussion about my concerns for their overall mental health and behavior.\n\nTheir response? **\"Babe, I already know what you're gonna say. I'm fine. I've thought this through, on-and-off. You need to stop worrying about the negatives. What's there to even talk about?\"**\n\nThey said all of that, right to my face, while holding the video game controller. Now I'm stuck on what to do, and apparently I'm not the only person in their personal life that has concerns. I fucking love them and I'm so scared about what's going to happen. I'm currently co-ordinating some sort of \"intervention\" with two of our mutual friends. And for additional clarity, I'm finishing my final year of college; we don't physically live together yet... I've noticed all of these things over the time our relationship has been long-distance.\n\n**TL;DR:** My partner's video game addiction led to them flunking out of college. They moved back home, had trouble getting a job, and barely left the house; it got worse when the pandemic started. At first, they went cold turkey and didn't game for over a year. Our relationship, while mainly long-distance, has stayed strong. Over the past few months, however, there's been a shift and my partner has started gaming again. Not only that, they don't limit their time on social media and rely on the validation of online strangers to \"prove\" their apparent new identity. The fact that they \"came out\" to strangers on Twitter before telling me makes me more upset than I initially realized; not only that, they fluctuate and can't keep their story straight. I suspect an underlying issue at hand. Whether it's unspoken depression or something else, I don't know. But a lot doesn't add up. They're currently not in counseling or any form of therapy. The fact that they don't see a need to have a genuine discussion with me about all of my concerns is very upsetting. I'm currently planning an intervention of sorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: spelling",

        "content": "\nI (26M) am a nurse who recently graduated nurse practitioner (NP) school and recently got licensed as an NP. I decided to pursue NP school right after breaking up with my girlfriend of 5 years to cope. \n\n\nFor the two years I was in school working full time on the front lines with COVID, so some could say it was a rough time for me. I fell into a deep depression battling a breakup, finding and rebuilding myself, on top of full time school and the hardships of caring for COVID patients. \n\n\nDuring that time, I told myself that things would be better after I graduated and that I would move to California from where I lived (NC). \n\n\n-side note I chose this place because all my lifelong friends live here, and Im in love with his place-\n\n\nI believed that a new location would be my source of happiness where I actually realized that it would not bring me the immediate gratification of happiness solely due to a geographical change. I was okay with this concept as I learned that this new location would bring me better opportunities to restart and find myself. \n\n\nI have since then graduated and am fully licensed as an NP. I took a travel nurse contract in California to get my foot in the door and make my transition there career wise easier.  This was something I have been looking forward to for the past two years. I had my sight set on this move; however, this is where it gets difficult, as I meet (21F) someone about 4 months before I leave. Disregarding knowing that I would be hurt once I left, I continued to see her. Despite the short duration of this relationship, I fell in love and the feeling was mutual for her. She is everything that I was looking for and possibly more with her kid being in the future.\n\n\nWe both were aware of the situation, but with just how life goes we continued to pursue our hearts and deal with the repercussions later knowing I had to move. \n\n\nI now have moved, and now I\u2019m realizing was this the wrong choice? She is willing but is on the fence about coming with me. Ideally that would be the perfect situation\u2026her moving with me to this place and we both figure things out. BUT can\u2019t ask her to come with me as her family is all here, and from her perspective this is a huge move for her for some dude she met only a few months prior\u2026 so it\u2019s only fair I don\u2019t put this pressure on her.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I could finish this contract and come back and we build our lives together back home. She also had a 1 year old son, who I\u2019m not going to get into as this will make this post longer than it should be. \n\n\nMy head is going around in circles. I just need help from the world right now. I\u2019m exhausted. Thank you guys in advanced.\n\nTD;LR :\nShould I stay here and work on myself as an individual and not come back, and have her decide if she wants to come with me? Or should I just finish this 13 week contract and come back to her. She is willing to wait for me to come back, and that seems to be the easiest for her. But she\u2019s also willing to possibly come with me here.",

She got very, very upset with me. \n\nThere was also a situation with her recent-ish boyfriend, but I don't feel like going super into it. Basically, I don't really trust him, and when he came to visit, I'm pretty sure they were doing drugs, etc. I also think he love bombed her (he's a soundcloud rapper lol and he got her an Apple Watch within months of dating). Despite being on my lease, she informed me that she was moving out. Luckily, a new partner was moving in, so I wasn't totally out of luck, but she said that she would continue to pay a portion of the rent when she moved since she didn't want to deal with breaking the lease. I tried to get her out of the lease, but she was very adamant about staying on. We got into a fight over her leaving her stuff there. But when she moved, it was on decent terms.\n\nWe haven't talked very much since as the tension is still definitely there, and it's usually to borrow money or ask favors. Well, she asked for one today. She asked for money to cover rent. She said she's getting paid today or tomorrow, but her bf's mom needs the money tomorrow morning or else she'll kick them out. I obviously don't know his mom but I find it hard to believe that she would kick them out if she didn't get it within a day. I also feel like, if she couldn't save $200 for rent... \n\nI'm nervous because I don't want her to think she can take advantage of me like she has done before. I'm trying to set boundaries but I am also nervous because they know where I live, and I am a little fearful of her bf.\n\nI suppose I'm just looking for advice about what to do/how to say it/etc. I think I am going to say no, I don't have the funds for it right now, as I don't want to start a fight over not believing her, etc.\n\nTLDR: Issues with my niece and money have been consistent. She's asking for money again and I'm trying to set boundaries.",

        "content": " Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s0qoy2/my\\_35m\\_wife\\_of\\_five\\_years\\_29f\\_cheated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s0qoy2/my_35m_wife_of_five_years_29f_cheated/)\n\nThank you guys for the kind and *not-so-kind* words. I appreciate all the advice. I will seek out a therapist to get through this as it is indeed a painful moment in my life. I guess deep down I know none of this was a good idea but maybe I was \"*shock by her admission and further fricking audacious actions*\" coupled with the reality of the last 5 years of building, traveling, fun & happy times, and my once best friend in life and first true love all coming to an end. I am definitely allowing my emotions to hold me hostage here. The friendship obviously would not benefit me in any resourceful way but I can see how it would benefit her in many ways. A *security blanket as* someone put it.\n\nI also agree that at this point I cannot dictate who she sees or befriends. Knowing that she still wanted some kind of relationship with the guy that she cheated on me with I should have simply declined the mere notion of us being friends.\n\n**TO THOSE SEEKING MORE DETAILS.**\n\nNo we don't have kids.\n\nI have pressed her on the \"met at a store\" story several times but she doubles down on it. Says she understands that the behavior was unsafe and unhealthy but she was in a vulnerable place - due to the marital funk - when she first met the guy and accepted his number and his request to have drinks. Also blames some of her actions on alcohol.\n\nThis woman came into my life when I was in a dark place myself. She is a big reason why I am the person I am today as she's helped build me up in many ways. So it seems to me that one of the reasons why I still wanted to be there for her after what happened was probably to show gratitude. As some has pointed out it probably has to do with not having better self-esteem as well. I'm also aware that she can have suicidal thoughts and speak in really dark terms when she goes through situations like this and she has during this process especially when she thought she was going to be homeless, etc. But I am coming to the realization that the same way I must now seek help to better myself, so does she. She cannot expect me to care more for her than she does for herself. Especially in a moment like this I must prioritize myself and my mental health if I am to move past this.\n\nThroughout the years we've had some marital issues. Typically in the form of verbal abuse on both ends. When arguments occur, some pretty horrible things get said both by me and by her. We tried to change this but it didn't seem to be working out. She claims that this is what drove her to do what she did. The \"*break*\" in question was not a separation. We were having discussions on whether we should call it quits or not after our last big fight. She then said that she needs space for herself and this is when she went out of town for a couple days. She even asked me to join her on the first day/night which I did. The next day is when the situation happened with the 'stranger'.\n\nI still cannot make sense of all of it. Some of it definitely seems made up and like she's lying. Others just seem like pretty irrational behavior of which she's blaming on things that I've said in arguments. Whether it was planned or not. OR done out of anger it's blatantly disrespectful no matter how you look at it. If we were to end things. Fine, let's do that first then pursue your rendezvous.\n\nAs much as it still hurts and as painful as all of this is, I am now filing for divorce, I stopped all contact with her (*except for how to distribute our assets*), and I'll be getting a therapist.\n\nThank you for your time, words, encouragement and advice. It has helped me gain some clarity on things I was in obvious denial about.\n\nTL;DR I'm filing for divorce on the ground of infidelity, we've halted contact and minimal communication and I'll be seeing a therapist soon.",

        "content": "My mum can't take constructive criticism, particularly around her behaviour. I have just witnessed an incident between her and one of my sisters, who asked my mum to stop lecturing her, and my mum immediately launched into defensive victim mode, claiming that she knew we all hated her, think she's horrible, don't like her etc. My mum uses deflection, insults, name-calling, victim mentality, general defensiveness, often comes back to the thing of 'this is my house!' etc in order to get any attention away from her.\n\nThe real issue is that, as a mature family, between the ages of 18 and 59, all of us besides her have developed better communication skills, emotional intelligence and etc, but she has not. As far as I know she's still how she was when my father met her. She often acts like a teenager in that she often has mood swings and is very unpredictable so may have been this way for ages.\n\nI think the worst incident of this happening would be recently, she forced my dad to go to therapy, or she would divorce him, claiming the issues all come from his side, which is not the case in me and my sisters' opinion. And so again she has escaped personal responsibility. This is a very common theme in our house, along with the mood of others being dictated by her.\n\nMe and my older sister are only back here temporarily, and I believe my younger sister has plans to move out soon, but I am struggling to see a future where we are ever able to be together as a family harmoniously because of how my mum behaves.\n\nWhat can I do here?\n\nTLDR; Mother can't take constructive criticism about her behaviour, its ruining what is potentially a nice adult family dynamic, what can I do?",

        "title": "In a foreign country, can't speak the language, few job prospects, and husband is on the verge of asking for a divorce",
        "content": "Alt account because he knows my other account. I'm 27F, he's 30M, we've known each other six years, been married half a year.\n\nSo,  as the title says, I'm living in a foreign country-- I moved here spring 2021 to marry my husband-- and now we're on the verge of breakdown. I have been pouring everything I can into this relationship: I  love him, I am not a financial burden (barring the mortgage on his house and home repairs, we split all expenses 50-50, I don't currently have a job so I'm living off my savings), I do the majority of the cooking, cleaning, and errands while he works full time (sometimes this means long hours, though usually it's a typical 8 hour day). However,  he's unhappy because of two things that have started to dominate our  relationship:\n\n1. We live in his house. There are several things around the house that need fixing, maintaining, or updating. I am not very good at figuring out these kinds of things: if someone shows me what to do I can typically do it no problem, but if something starts going wrong, it takes me a long time to figure out what to do about it (if I can figure it out at all).  Google is my go-to. He, on the other hand, is pretty mechanically-minded and understands systems quickly, even if he's never seen anything like it before. This frustrates him on a few levels: he feels he's the only one contributing to planning out the house maintenance, and when something starts going wrong I usually start trying things that won't help (not knowing they won't help), while he's able to think of more effective things, so he views my attempts as stupid (important: he does not view \\*me\\* as stupid) and I just get in the way when he expects me to be more effective. Then he gets angry with himself for this expectation and for reacting poorly to the situation. I get irritated with him because I know it is not my fault that I don't understand these things as well as he does, I am actively trying to improve but it doesn't happen very fast, and I have a lot of other stressors on my plate:  learning the language, finding work, and getting all of the paperwork of my residence here settled, which is still an active and ongoing process. My brain reacts poorly to stress and I become extremely forgetful and unable to focus-- I actively feel, every day, that I'm losing my mind. This, obviously, does not help the situation when we're trying to do a renovation or install something, and does not help me learn things quicker.\n2. Number 1 is also exacerbated by our language barrier. We both share English,  and he's fluent, but it is his second language. Him trying to explain concepts and technical things to me in English is extremely frustrating to him because he can't do it in English as he can in his mother tongue,  he can't remember all the right words, and even if he explains it as best as he can it's likely I won't understand anyway. I don't mind taking things slow (in fact it's better for me), so I do not consciously pressure him on it, but I know even just having someone waiting for you to finish stumbling over your words is uncomfortable even if they're the actual Dalai Lama. The other aspect of this is that his mother tongue is exceptionally blunt and straightforward, and English depends a  lot more on politeness and implication than he's used to doing, so frequently he's saying things that hurt me and then not understanding why I'm hurt.\n\nWe have  talked about both these things many, many times and tried to work them  out, but the conversations all boil down to me saying, \"I understand  you're stressed, but can you please not act like \\[x\\] toward me,\" and him  saying, \"I feel like I should not have to temper who I am and change my  personality for my relationship partner.\"\n\nIt's become obvious that we think in different ways and need different things from our relationships: I need verbal care and to feel that I'm special and my contributions are valued. He needs to feel that he's not the only one in charge and capable of all of the house problems, he needs someone who can do that without needing to be told what to do.  It's important to note that my contributions to our daily life (managing errands, cooking, and cleaning) are not valued by him-- or rather, it's not a relief that someone else takes care of them now. He's very independent and would have no issue going back to dealing with all of those things on his own again (though he has said that I do them better,  his own level is fine by him as well). So while I try to pick up the home maintenance slack in the other ways I can-- we used to split cleaning 50-50, but I've taken on all of it and do the majority of the laundry as well-- it doesn't feel like actual partnership to him. Even though I'm 100% willing to work on the bigger house problems with him,  it still means he has to take charge on them and tell me what to do.\n\nAll this to say that divorce seems a likely possibility. Which is tearing me up for many reasons. I want, so much, to be better at big home maintenance issues because it seems like such a ridiculous reason to split, but I can't just wish that into existence and actually making it happen takes time. We have similar senses of humor and have a lot of fun together when we don't have to work on something, and it kills me that we don't work together well when the shit hits the fan. Over the course of our friendship and relationship, none of this was apparent, but once I  moved and we married it all started creeping in (our relationship was long-distance for two of the three years we were involved before marrying).\n\nI have no idea what to do. My staying in this country is dependent on our marriage. I don't want to go back to the US, and if we did file for divorce I would have a couple months in which to find a job (I haven't had any luck with this up till now), but then I would need to apply for a different visa, which is a whole mess on its own and takes a ton of time and money-- I'd likely need to return to the US anyway just to wait for my visa to be approved. I do have some savings. I would much rather save the relationship, though, I just don't know how to do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I have 0 technical skills and my brain hasn't been working right due to the amount of stress I'm under, and my husband may file for divorce leaving me without a valid residence. I love him and also don't want to leave this country.",

        "content": "TL;DR Is it way too fucked up for me to try and end things with my current BF because I'm starting to like his friend? \n\n\nTo start I'm at a point where I'm mainly doing all the housework, pet care, financial support, and general life management (nagging in order for him to do things) for my boyfriend. He plays PC online with friends as soon as he wakes up and right until he lays down for the night. So that's when I mainly see him/get to spend any time. Usually I am asleep or about to fall asleep. When I get up I do chores take care of the dog, anything else adulty that I venture out for, dinner and then games/movies/hobbies. So our world's and priorities are just very different.\n\nI've tried so many times and broken down crying just wishing he'd either help around the house more, or give me money he owes me, or basically anything that would forward his life. I've sobbed that I just wish he wanted to be with me like I want to be with him and wanted to go out and do dates or I'd be fine with just matching what I've been doing buying appliances paying bills taking care of our one car. I need help and he's just content with doing nothing. I know it's because I'll just do everything. I know for a fact he gets upset and everything I lose it because of lack of help he just gets upset and I effectively push him away become a negative in his life that he needs to appease real quick.\n\nThere's more to our aspects I hope that gives a picture. Lately I've been so sad and depressed but the one thing that I can't get over is the fact that for the past 4 days I've been struggling with COVID and boredom and my boyfriend has been the same old. I keep asking him to do things coming up with fun dinner ideas asking to play a game together (not with the online friends that's not quality play time to me, but he won't) and not only does he have no money to do anything so I have to pay if I want to do anything but he shot down all of my chances to do something together or acted like I was dragging him away from something far more important.\n\nI really feel like he hates me deep down and that he just likes me around to use me. Maybe he does \"love\" me but this love feels like more weight on my shoulders than I can even bear at times. It's making me cry as I type it up. I'm just a young woman my job is not great I need help. This seems more abusive than when I was dating an angry drunk. \n\nI just hung out getting stoned watching movies playing music and just being COVID positive and lazy with someone really close to my boyfriend. This person just decided to come over as we all caught it together and I always welcome this person as a house guest he's a friendly enough person. He's quiet and stoic type while my boyfriend has a loud voice and isn't afraid to voice his concerns, they are a little bit opposites. This person just came over and hung out with me doing jack all for 4. Straight. Days. And I loved it. I needed it. I can't believe how starved I am for affection, or just someone to sit in the room with me and listen to me babble and remember old songs to play. He sat there through every one. Laughed and shared other movies. We did all this right in front of my BF who never turned away from his PC. And that's been the usual for months now.\n\nI have friends that I hang out with and I love them and go see them about once a week sometimes more. What I'm craving is just a partner, I guess. Someone who actually likes spending time with me or who is available. This feeling for this person has been with me for some time because I fear that I have a crush on him and it's growing. It's all so fucked up. I know it's not right and I'm not even 100% sure I'm seeing this other person clearly. I guess I do like what I see, he has a car and money and does some responsibilities although he is younger. He's quiet like me reserved but still enjoys gaming and anime and food. It's just not right for me to feel like this for someone so close to my current boyfriend.\n\nAnd a little part of me wonders what he thinks, like why did he just stay here for 4 days when my boyfriend and everyone else just ignored him (and me) for four whole days. It was just us on our own. I didn't mind it. Obviously the fucked up part of me was thrilled. He left now and I miss him. Thinking about my boyfriend at his PC again today is making me cry. Thinking about leaving to where ever this other dude went is making me want to go with him.\n\nIs there any way that I can eventually address whatever the fuck is going on with that dude?\n\nAnd how do I end things with a man I just went in and bought a home with? We live with roommates too. And I don't have any money for another place and wouldn't want to ever abandon this place I literally alone bought (all my money he got to be 50/50 because property is in his family)",

I broke up with him, regretted it, but he had moved on. \n\nAt 24, he messaged me on Facebook and we reconnected. Now I am 29, and we have been together for almost 5 years, with a six month break after the first year. We have been living together for 3 years.   \n\nAfter high school, he went away to university and lived in the dorms, which his wealthy parents paid for. He changed his major a lot and after several years failed out of university. Some time in there he also started smoking pot. He moved in with roommates and worked restaurant/retail-type jobs. At 24, he decided to move back to our hometown, back to his parents house, and start culinary school at community college, because he didn\u2019t like that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere in the uni town and wanted to finish a degree. That\u2019s when he messaged me, after almost a decade of not talking.\n\nWe talked, met up, it was awesome. I soon went to his place in his college town. His place was a filthy mess, decorated with toys and posters of semi-nude women. His car was also a mess. It bothered me a little that he didn\u2019t bother cleaning up anything for me. He was very sweet, cute, charming. But I noticed a tendency to play the victim, he had a lot of sob stories about his past romantic fails and pouted that no one wanted to be with him. He complained about having responsibilities and said he wished he was a kid. But I also found him comforting in some way, so familiar, he was my first love, and meeting again was amazing.\n\nAfter high school, I went to community college, lived with my dad, and worked. Graduated 2014. I finally moved out of my dad\u2019s at 24, in April 2017. A month before I moved out into my own apartment, is when he messaged me.\n\nWe started dating in May 2017. I noticed debt collectors calling him all the time. He had bought a pocket watch for hundreds and didn\u2019t pay back the loan. He owed his old roommate rent money, but was buying weed and random stuff instead of paying it back. I also found out that he was hiding/lied about seeing a female friend and had been going hiking with her several times over months. He was also trying to move in with me in July 2017, complaining about how he hates living with his parents, how his basement room was tiny, and I felt he was hinting that he wanted to move in with me without paying his share, since he was in school. So after a year, I realized the red flags (my mom picked up on them and over time I realized she was right), got angry, and dumped him. \n\nA few months after the break up he said he missed me. I said I missed him too but made the right decision. We started hanging out again, having sex. He had paid off his debts, started exercising, and lost weight. I started feeling attached to him again, and told him I wanted to be together again, but he wasn\u2019t sure because he didn\u2019t want me to leave him again. But a few months later we got back together, and then a couple months after that my lease was up, and we moved into a new place together in Feb. 2019 and have been here since.\n\nWe have been living together for 3 years. He finished culinary school and now has a catering manager job, where he does a lot of work and has a lot of responsibility, he gets up from 4-5am and is home around 2:30, has never missed a day of work, he makes a tad more than me, and we split bills in half. \n\nOver these three years, there has been some areas of concern:\n\nChores:\nHe said from the beginning that he doesn\u2019t want me having all the chores. It has ended up that I cook, do dishes, clean the house if I can, take out trash. I also work from home so I can do some things during the day. He does all laundry, cleans the litter boxes every week, makes the dog food every week or so, feeds cats. He used to offer to help with stuff, but then get upset/put out when I would accept the offer. Until I told him that bothered me. But he does keep saying he can help with cooking or cleaning if I ask. He sometimes helps with cooking prep. Maybe there isn\u2019t any issues here but I do wish he might take initiative in doing things around the house, but he will do whatever I ask him to do.\n\nAddiction/weed use:\nAnother thing that I don\u2019t like is that he smokes weed allll day every single day and has been doing so for many years. He smokes from 5am before work, during work, after work. He says it helps him with his ADD related focus issues and anger. I got mad because after we got engaged I wondered how much of his money has been going to weed. I was about paying for a wedding. He said he spends $220-300 a month on weed. He doesn\u2019t see any problem with smoking weed, says it doesn\u2019t affect him much and that no one can tell when he\u2019s high (I can\u2019t unless he\u2019s very high), most around him smoke it, but agreed that it was expensive and said he is cutting it back by half and has been progressing fast towards that. \n\nClingy friend:\nAnother problem I brought up after we got engaged was that his clingy friend was coming over about 5x a week to get stoned and game, sometimes while I work from home during the week. The friend will even get to our house at 6am on Saturday and Sunday and stay until around noon to get high and game. I was getting internally angry at this friend who barely pays any mind to me, but clings to fianc\u00e9, is always over getting high, and eating dinner with us sometimes (used to be often). He lives with his parents, but doesn\u2019t like it, has enough saved to buy a house but is waiting. Fianc\u00e9 did always ask before the friend came over and I never said no, until recently I told him it\u2019s way too much and I said 3x a week is more acceptable. He\u2019s been complying, after initially disagreeing there was an issue, he also said that he sometimes thought his friend was over too much and he wanted some time away, but that he gets bored without his friend. He said that having his friend over while I work from home is good because then he doesn\u2019t bother me because he\u2019s bored and I can work in peace. His friend also calls him several times a day, they talk hours a day, and fianc\u00e9 will frequently be walking around the house with his friend in his ear (his friend may or may not be talking, and his friend will sing sillily or curse and scream up a storm over traffic/minor inconveniences), while having conversations with me, so I feel like he\u2019s not giving me his undivided attention, and his friend is on the phone during tons of our conversations, a lot of times I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s on the phone so I am careful what I talk about. \n\nNot interested in adult topics or future planning:\nHe also doesn\u2019t have any interest in adulting things, no interest in personal finances. He doesn\u2019t have any debt which is great, but little savings and no retirement. But he has a bad credit score (500 something) and his friend mentioned to him years ago how to improve it, but he\u2019s made no efforts. He has nothing saved for retirement, when I talked about retirement with him, he said his work doesn\u2019t offer a plan, he guesses he won\u2019t retire. I told him he could sign up for his own plan. He doesn\u2019t have any interest it seems. Never googled how to do anything like this. A month ago I signed us up for a personal finance course because I was freaking out about how we were going to be able to afford a wedding, new cars, etc. He has since been budgeting for the past couple of weeks and seems to be doing well with it now, which is great. Maybe it'll be okay? But I feel like, if I wasn\u2019t worried about this stuff, we\u2019d be living paycheck to paycheck unable to do anything. But maybe it\u2019ll be fine now that he is budgeting and learning.\n\nAnger issues/negativity/constant complaining:\nHe also has anger issues. He gets bad road rage, unless he\u2019s high. He gets angry or anxious in crowds. I visited his work and there were dents in the fridges from when he punched them due to being angry, I believe because people ordered food shortly before close. He gets extremely mad at the neighbor who parks in front of our house and takes \u201cmy\u201d spot, I don\u2019t really mind though. One time the neighbor had parked in front of our house and as soon as we parked behind him and I got out of the car, fianc\u00e9 was screaming extremely loud high pitched beating on the steering wheel extremely hard, it made me deeply uncomfortable. I\u2019ve told him many times that I don\u2019t like him showing that rage around me, so he hasn\u2019t done it in a while, he says the weed helps him not be angry so that\u2019s his reasoning to keep using at all waking hours. He seems to think it's not fair that he can't show anger around me. He is a sore loser. We were on a bowling league, and he would stamp his feet and get super pissed if he didn\u2019t knock down all the pins he wanted. I told him it is embarrassing and makes everyone uncomfortable and he has gotten much better. He also complains all. The. Time. About so many things. His stories about his day are almost always just complaints about people, traffic, work, etc. It gets exhausting and I dread his calls while he's working honestly :/ he used to call me and just complain about traffic while driving and I couldn\u2019t stand it. He says his friend and him rage and complain and vent together and that it helps them, he thinks I should listen to him.\n\nHe does have ambition in physical goals. He ran a half marathon every month last year. He is working out a lot this week. He wants to go on hikes this year.\n\nHe neglects to change his car oil, going on 9 months without a change, doesn\u2019t go to the dentist ever, stuff like that.\n\nSince I told him we don\u2019t have strong hobbies and never really do much together, he\u2019s been more proactive about trying to figure out fun things to do. Tomorrow he wants to cook me dinner and I said we can do a YouTube painting class. He also never really plans dates on his own, always asking me what I want to do each evening. I don\u2019t plan them either much I guess.\n\nOh, about a year ago, I mentioned that I\u2019d like to save for a house, he said I could do it mostly by myself, since I\u2019m much better at saving and he\u2019s not good at it. It feels like he thinks it would be acceptable for me to save for a house for us while he blows his money. But also we weren\u2019t married or anything. So it was probably inappropriate to think he would say he\u2019d save too.\n\nAlso, he used to ask me if I needed him, or wanted him. He\u2019s asked a few times if I got along financially when I lived by myself for two years (it was very tight, but now I make more money). He said that he decided to propose when I lost my job last year and he offered to help financially but I didn\u2019t need it, and never took anything and was jobless for 2 months, because it showed him I didn\u2019t need him or depend on him I guess.\n\nOver the past couple of weeks we have been having talks, sadly I got really angry because I was fed up with his friend always being at our house, the constant weed smoking, etc. I asked him what he sees for his future, at 40 or 50, what does he want to accomplish. He said he doesn\u2019t know and seemed to think it was ridiculous for me to ask where he saw himself at 50. He said he isn\u2019t good at thinking of the future. I asked if he wanted kids, he said maybe, but they are a lot of work and expensive, he doesn\u2019t want to have kids if he can\u2019t afford it. He has said he could go either way. He then said he would have 1, maybe two, and that he knew I wanted kids before he proposed because of comments I\u2019ve made and how I act around kids. He said he proposed before we turned 30 so we could start working on goals etc. \n\nI want marriage, kids, a good career (I work in supply chain), a house in the countryside, financial stability and security, and want to work on building more fulfilling hobbies and relationships. \n\nIn my fantasies I want a Man, who is mature, has principles, is driven and works hard, does the right thing, wants children and a wife, and someone who will be a great father to my children and teach them how to be strong, capable, moral adults.\n\nAnyways, I DO love him. He has the sweetest smile, is so cute, he really has done so much to please me and change for me\u2026 and yet here I am still unhappy, and it makes me feel very very guilty and like I\u2019ve made some big mistake. But maybe my problem is my thinking. I\u2019ve been with 3 guys long term, and which each one of them my mind is telling me to leave. Will it ever tell me to stay?\n\nI have some fun with him to, but other times I feel like I do try to avoid him, and get annoyed with him. I feel like he just doesn\u2019t understand me or what I want out of life or even how I conceptualize the next decades of my life, he doesn\u2019t think of that and has no concept of the future, it feels like. He has been sensing that I am pulling away and having doubts and has been on top of all his chores without prompting, telling me he loves me so much. offering to help with stuff, giving me hugs, etc. He had said that if we weren\u2019t together, he would move back with his parents and find someone else like me. \n\nI just want to make the best decision I can for myself on whether to marry him. He has improved A LOT since I met him five years ago, really fixing the things I told him he needed to fix, but it annoys me he didn\u2019t see the need to fix before, like ignoring debt collectors, etc.. He says that I am the reason he wakes up and works everyday, but I want him to have bigger purposes in life than me. But, I feel I am being codependent trying to \u201chelp\u201d and \u201cfix\u201d him, trying to mold him into my concept of an adult man. The better part of me just wants him to be who he wants to be, and he can learn whatever lessons in life he feels he wants to, and he deserves someone who will accept and love him as he is. Maybe someone who smokes weed and wants to game with him and his friend and doesn\u2019t want kids would be better for him. However he has stated that with me he feels himself grow. That\u2019s good but I\u2019m not sure how much is growth if he\u2019s only doing things that I tell him I need him to do so our relationship will function better. I don\u2019t want to hurt him but also don\u2019t want to hurt myself. I am 29 and time is ticking and I want a family in this next decade so I need to make some decisions.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m guiding him to adulthood. I feel like if I stopped trying to progress we would remain in mostly the same situation and not really move forward. \n\nAre these things workable or are we better off separating?",

        "title": "Needy Friend Advice: Direct is not working and blunt will cause too much damage",
        "content": "I (39 F) made a friend in college (38 F) (10 years). We have a college friend group who all moved away. She is single and was not from the area but stayed after college. I brought her into my local friend group that I have had since childhood, and a separate friend group my husband and I have from college. (who stayed local). Friend and I also share childcare, which means friend is at my house daily.\n\nFriend messages constantly, all day and all night. Friend will stay for 30 minutes nightly when picking up her child--even though it causes her child to miss his nap. Friend gets upset if I see any friend group without her (but will do things with them alone). Friend expects to be invited on every vacation, whether we go with other friends, alone, or even sometimes with family. Our one shared family vacation was miserable for me and my husband (however our \"girl's vacations\" are fine).\n\nI know that the normal advice is to set boundaries in a direct manner, but I struggle with this. I have said multiple times when she does child pick up \"I can't talk, I have to do X\" but she will stay and follow me. I started avoiding her, so she does it to my husband (who does the same thing). I have explained I can't respond to her messages all day. She says things like \"I don't expect a response\" but she will then say \"you haven't responded to me\" \"is something wrong\" etc. It is worse with the childcare issue, as things will happen and the nanny will tell her and she'll come to me about how I don't tell her anything. I have also tried making it a point to schedule hang out time--but it doesn't appear to be enough and I just don't want to do it all the time. I barely see other friends once a month or once every two months. Things are busy and I'm just not that type of person.\n\nShe is not unstable or manipulative (but perhaps a bit passive-aggressive), just a single needy friend in a group of married people. I don't speak to my other friends weekly, let alone daily. If I am more direct, I think it will damage the relationship and have serious repercussions in the friend group and the childcare situation. I recognize that going on like this will have a breaking point (it's like having a second husband--the only thing we argue about is whether or not I told her something). I just don't know if I can say \"I don't want to talk to you in person everyday I have things to do. I don't want to chat while I'm at work, and often I don't want to nightly. We can plan something occasionally.\" And if I did say it--I don't think it will go down well, it will destroy several worlds. Help!\n\nTL;DR How do I deal with a needy friend when a too direct (blunt) communication of boundaries will damage the relationship, other friendships and childcare, but other types of direct communication \"I cannot talk now; I can't talk at work\" etc. are ineffective?",

He married Emma about ten years ago and they have a son together.\n\nA few nights ago I got a call from him. He was at a local bar and was obviously pretty drunk and asked me if I could come and pick him up. It was a little ways away from me but I didn\u2019t want him to drive so I said sure. \n\nWhen I got there he just hopped in the car and the drive home was pretty quiet. When I drove up to his place, I noticed because it was pretty late that Emma\u2019s car wasn\u2019t there. I asked him about it and he suddenly got emotional and started talking. \n\nHe said that Emma and him were getting a divorce. This surprised me as I never suspected anything. \n\nWhen I asked him what happened, he said as two decades approached since he was deployed that it has all been hitting him. He said he did horrible things and had to make horrible decisions and as a result he started drinking more and fighting with Emma. \n\nI asked him to elaborate but he wouldn\u2019t and I took him inside and put him to bed and stayed the night. I had to work the next morning so I left early but when I texted him later that day he said that he was fine and just hungover and thanked me for picking him up as he doesn\u2019t remember much.\n\nI don\u2019t know how or if I should bring it up with him what he said?? He\u2019s never really talked much about it before and certainly not in this way. \n\nWhat do I do here?? I don\u2019t even know where to start.

We are both set to graduate this May and I am currently in the process of interviewing for jobs and already have 1 offer. The problem is my bf is the complete opposite and is not even thinking about what he is going to do when we graduate. It stresses me out bc I would like to know where he is applying so I can look in those areas too or somewhere close. Even if we can\u2019t stay in the same place I still want him to be able to find a job in general bc he has 80k in debt and no relevant experience and his gpa is below a 3.0. He has never been studious or conscientious and he is very slackerish and has no motivation when it comes to school and work. He does work part time as a cook at a bar for spending money but that\u2019s about it. And his degree will be in Data science so his part time just is completely irrelevant and idk if that will help much. I\u2019m so worried he won\u2019t find a job especially with his low gpa, his lack of experience, and his low motivation.

I myself grew up very low income and was only able to go to college on a large scholarship-so I have a very small amount of debt and i am terrified of being broke and struggling as an adult bc that was my entire childhood. He grew up in a six figure household and is only in so much debt bc he chose an out of state school and he had to do an extra year bc of being on academic suspension his freshman year. I don\u2019t want to breakup over this but my fears of everything that could go wrong is just toppling over.

My parents won't allow me to marry this I fell in love with because of status difference and I'm already too broken and weak mentally to manage to let go. \n\nI met this cute girl online about 2 years ago, as time went on, we both became good friends, met in real life and eventually fell in love. \n\nThe thing is, I had a terrible experience of having sincere and trust worthy people in life. My first highschool crush turned out to be a slut, my first gf in college was caught on camera making out with another boy. Apart from love life, my parents are separated and my brothers live abroad so have no real link of love and closeness with my family. As for friends circle, I lost my best friend to suicide and since then it's been years and I couldn't find a proper and sincere friend ever since, only those who backbite, secretly betray and stay in limits of closeness (bad luck I guess :/)\n\nAnyway, I'm from Pakistan and here, the consent of parents is a big thing and my girlfriend isn't the most ideal girl in the eyes of my parents. I'm a med student and both of my parents are highly educated and same for my brothers. My gf on the other hand is a physiotherapy student and her parents are poor and uneducated and I might find it really hard to convince my parents to accept her as a family member. \n\nI honestly don't know what to do, this girl loves me like crazy, the only real love I felt all my life, I don't know if I'm going to find it ever again. I fear that if I drag her along till I graduate, giving her hope that I'll marry her, it might break her heart If I fail to make it happen and in the 2 years till I graduate, she might miss some good proposals and chances of finding better boys who might be interested in her (P.S in my country, girls find it hard to find proposals for marriage past 25 years of age).\n\n I've tried to let go off of her but it hurts too much. I just can't seem to do it, but on the other hand, clinging on to this relationship gives me daily anxiety and keeps me up at night as with every passing day, I'm falling more and more in love with her and it will be too brutal to break her heart by saying I can't marry her because of superficial reasons that she has inferior degree in the eyes of society or her parents are poor. \n\nI need an advice on what to do, should I leave her and somehow suffer through all the loneliness with hope to find someone else or take a stand and fight for her even if it means breaking family ties to get her. Or should I do something else. I'm open for any suggestions.",
