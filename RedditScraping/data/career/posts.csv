2025-02-27 22:36:02,1izskad,Is it normal nowadays to have job shadow during interview process for SW Position?,"I've worked in the social work field for around 15 years (mostly in addiction trwatment field). I was recently was laid off. I notice a new trend with hiring process - job shadow aka free labor. It feels ethically questionable and exploitative. If I was in management position I wouldn't want to expose an unsure person to our clients. Is a new thing?  

I've had 8 interviews and 2 had a job shadow requirement. One was for a group counselor role.  After a phone interview, they had me come in, teach a topic of my choosing for 15 minutes, be interviewed by clients then moved to an interview with staff of the treatment agency.  No background or reference check before meeting clients. They ghosted me.

The second situation was after a phone screening, and passed the first round of interviews. They asked me to job shadow their social workers for 5 hours to see if I ""really want this role"".  Same day I would have a 2nd interview with leadership.  This position had me do finger print testing prior to the job shadow. A week before my scheduled job shadow, they rescheduled the 2nd interview for the next week after the job shadow.

I spent money on childcare and parking to do this job shadow. It felt like the other SW staff were checking me out. Then the next day I woke up to an email saying that they're ""temporary pausing"" my supervisor interview.  That they will reach out again when they have a clearer picture of their current needs. I don't know if they're brushing me off or their funding is impacted.  

Money is so tight and I feel frustrated wasting money. ","Is job shadowing a common practice in the hiring process, and is it ethical?","The individual has approximately 15 years of experience working in the social work field, primarily within addiction treatment. They have recently been laid off from their job. They have gone through eight interviews since that layoff, with two of those interviews requiring a ""job shadow"" where they were expected to perform tasks without pay. The person has expressed concerns about the ethics of this practice in their field. Financially, they are experiencing tight circumstances, which has added to their frustration with the job application process, especially after incurring expenses for childcare and parking related to the interviews.

2025-02-27 22:35:46,1izsk2s,How should I navigate the dumpster fire my workplace has become?,"Hello fellow Redditors! I come to you to today humbly seeking advice on how the hell I navigate my way through the current situation at my workplace or if the consensus from others is that we're past the point of no return and my only option is to jump off the ship. Here's the background...

I manage specialized/paratransit for a Canadian municipality (middle manager, one notch below the senior manager who reports to our director). Over the past approximate year, it feels like our senior manager has lost total control of our division, and I have taken the brunt of the stress. We've had some massive software projects to contend with, and in the midst of that, one of my coworkers - who was also one of our best managers, and my best personal friend - died suddenly. Things have continued downhill since then, as resignations from our other managers have come in one-by-one; the majority of them upset with the intense workload and expectations imposed upon them by our senior manager, as well the senior manager's proclivity to prioritize strange and unreasonable tasks over more critical ones, and to suddenly without warning change direction on key tasks, requiring large amounts of rework. As a result of this trickle-down effect, we've also lost frontline supervisors and entry-level staff in numerous areas of our division. 

At this stage, we are down to our senior manager, myself, and one part-time semi-management role we were able to bring on as a term, and we are drowning; myself in particular. My inbox generally sits at around the 2,000 unread messages mark, because I can no longer keep up with the speed at which they come in, while having full days worth of Teams meetings. With each successive manager leaving, most of their primary tasks have fallen to me, and my personality lends itself (fortunately in some cases, unfortunately in this case) to overworking. This has led to me working inordinate amounts of overtime (to the tune of 300 or so hours in a period of a few months), and a growing resentment towards our senior manager; not to mention recognizing the health toll the stress is taking on me in various areas of my life. I am becoming quick to anger and over-reacting with friends and other coworkers, and I know the path this is going to take me down further if I don't do something soon. 

I have tried getting my senior manager to understand how over-burdened I am, such as with requests to defer certain non-critical plans to later dates, etc. - and although they feign understanding, generally they continue to push me and disregard my opinion, or add new tasks to the list. I don't believe this comes from a place of malice, but rather a place of they really are in over their head (they are a relatively new senior manager) and they do not possess the skillset to manage our division. 

For those who have made it this far, I am eager to hear your thoughts on what to do next. In my opinion, we do need a change in senior management to properly re-prioritize this division's tasks and immediately push hard to on-board key resources. But in my organization, HR doesn't review or take action from the results of exit interviews, and no level of the organization pays any attention or care to determine why so many resources have left the environment in such a short period of time. Do I try and escalate to a higher authority? A final frank conversation with the senior manager? Or when things get this bad, is the best option just to get the hell out of dodge?

Cheers, all. ","What should I do next: try to escalate to a higher authority, have a frank conversation with my senior manager, or is it best to just leave my job?","The individual manages specialized/paratransit services for a Canadian municipality, holding a middle management position just below the senior manager. They have experienced significant stress over the past year due to a lack of control from their senior manager and the sudden death of a close coworker and friend, who was also a valued manager in the division. This event led to a cascade of resignations from other managers, who cited an intense workload and unreasonable expectations as reasons for their departures. 

The current team is now reduced to the individual, the senior manager, and a part-time semi-management position; the individual feels overwhelmed and unable to keep up with the demands of their role, accumulating around 2,000 unread emails and working approximately 300 hours of overtime in a few months. They have developed a growing resentment towards the senior manager, recognizing the adverse health impacts of their stress, including anger and overreaction in personal interactions. The individual has made attempts to communicate their burden to their senior manager, but feels that their concerns are not genuinely acknowledged or addressed.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1izsk2s/how_should_i_navigate_the_dumpster_fire_my/,careerguidance

I travel for one month every year, but the trade off is usually only a day or two off for all 11 other months. Usually make $27-29/Hr, no benefits.

2025-02-27 21:40:04,1izra37,Career path advice?,"I have run into an issue regarding choosing which career path to study right now. I dont want to choose the wrong one and waste 4 years of my life studying a topic that i wont use. I am a very creative person who really enjoys doing anything creative, making presentations, designing etc. I have the following options to study: 
》Interior design 
》Graphic design 
》Audiovisual design

My opinion on them: 
• Interior design - since I am a student I haven't actually tried anything physical to do with Interior design, besides playing designing games and making online Interior. The only reason this is my main option to choose is because I feel like creating a space for people, where they want to feel a certain way, is something I will enjoy in the future. Everyday, when I stare at a blank wall and I already envision a full design, that could be added, to make the space look a certain way. Since I live in Latvia the pay for Interior designers isn't that great, but it's more than the other listed careers.

• Graphic design - The only reason I believe this might be a great career path for me, is because I enjoy making designs and creative things. BUT I can already tell, the downside is the LOW pay for graphic designers here in Latvia. I have noticed that many Graphic designers struggle to find a well paying job or clients, given the many competitors in this field as many Graphic designers are self taught and thus making my point of wasting 4 years to study something that could be self taught...

• Audiovisual designer - This career path came to me recently, as i looked more into it i realised that this career consists of making ads and marketing stuff using movement and editing. Taking this career path i could potentially go into ad making and might aswell study UX/UI design after i finish all the studies. The pay for this varies but it sure is better than Graphic designers. I enjoy editing and movement as well as photography so this goes handy.

》 As you could tell, i am a very creative person, and i want my future career to be something creative. As i enjoy doing all of the previously mentioned career bits, the only main criteria for me is the pay. Since Latvia is one of the poorest countries its very important that i find which of these creative career paths will pay the most. (I know artistic careers naturally get paid less than others)

If anyone could actually help me with this decision or just give some advice, it would be greatly appreciated!

+(after these studies i plan to study media and communications or marketing as I currently have got a certificate in digital marketing basics that I quite enjoyed. Another possiblity is buisness manegment as i could start my own firm or just evolve in my career)","Which of the following career paths—Interior design, Graphic design, or Audiovisual design—has the best potential for pay and job stability in Latvia?","The individual is currently a student based in Latvia and has a strong interest in creative fields. They are considering three career paths: Interior Design, Graphic Design, and Audiovisual Design. They express a particular affinity for creating spaces in Interior Design, despite having limited practical experience in that area. 

In Graphic Design, they appreciate the opportunity to make creative designs; however, they are concerned about low pay and competition within the field, noting that many graphic designers in Latvia are self-taught. Audiovisual Design is a newer consideration for them, as it involves elements of advertising, editing, and photography, which they enjoy, while also potentially offering better pay than Graphic Design.

The individual is conscious of the economic realities in Latvia, acknowledging that the pay for artistic careers tends to be lower. They have a future interest in studying media and communications or marketing, having recently earned a certificate in digital marketing basics.

2025-02-27 21:34:49,1izr5s4,How do you quit a job that is barely surviving and killing you at the same time?,"I’m a manager at a small company with 15 employees. I’ve been here since 2023, and on top of handling day-to-day tasks, HR, and payroll, the owner recently added another major responsibility—finding more business to keep us afloat.

Our original contracting company was bought out last year, and since then, our revenue has tanked. The owner has been fighting with the new company to send us more work, but it’s barely making a difference. He’s maxed out his credit just to cover expenses. Last month, he finally admitted that we have two months left to land a new contract, or we’re done.

This company has been around since 2016, and in the past month, I’ve had to apply for/acquire a CAGE code and try to navigate SBA processes—completely on my own—on top of my usual workload.

I’ve been wanting to quit. My family wants me to quit. I stress about work constantly, even at home. I can’t take any days off because of how bad things are, and I’m exhausted. I dread going in every day, and I feel trapped here. I’m the only one capable of handling the managerial tasks, the only one who knows how to fix computers and printers, and the only one who understands basic technology in the office.

To make things worse, the owner is having back surgery tomorrow and will be out for 4–6 weeks. So quitting now feels impossible. We’ve tried hiring office help, but no one has made it past the interview stage.

I’ve been in this industry for over eight years, and I’ve never worked for a company in this bad of a situation. And now, I just found out that when the owner started the business in 2016, he was only making money because he was related to the owner of our original contracting company. He never bothered to diversify or secure additional contracts, certifications, or revenue streams. Now that safety net is gone, and we’re scrambling.

I want to quit, I know that I need to. But when? Or how do I go about it, being in this situation? ","When should I quit my job, given the current situation? How do I go about it?","The individual is a manager at a small company with 15 employees, where they have worked since 2023. They have over eight years of experience in the industry. The company was established in 2016 and was previously running well largely because the owner was related to the owner of their original contracting company, which is no longer the case after the contract was bought out last year. This change has led to a significant decline in revenue for the company.

The person is responsible for managing day-to-day tasks, HR, payroll, and, recently, finding new business to sustain the company after the new owners' acquisition caused financial strain. They have taken on additional responsibilities, such as applying for a CAGE code and navigating SBA processes without support. The owner of the company is undergoing back surgery, which adds to the pressure on the individual, as they feel solely responsible for the managerial tasks and basic technology maintenance in the office. 

The individual feels trapped and is experiencing high levels of stress, affecting both their work-life balance and family dynamics, as their family wants them to quit. They have considered leaving the job but are unsure how to do so given the current challenging situation at their workplace.

Where I live now, it is a competitive job market, especially since many people and transplants keep moving here.

It is so bad that I even decided to enroll back in school to get my bachelor's. I originally finished college with an associate's. There wasn't much else to do with my life but try to gain more education I guess.

I began looking out of state, and I was having more callbacks and email responses that showed interest, but some jobs do not offer relocation assistance. It surprised me how I am getting more out-of-state calls than my local employers, where I am ghosted. I have savings that could be enough for a short-term lease in case it doesn't work out in the long run, and I suppose family to fall back on, but the city that I am looking at is also where my school is located.

I want to find a career where I won't be extremely stressed out, will pay enough for me to eventually afford a home, and I will feel fulfilled doing so.

I'm hoping to find a career that makes at least $70,000 a year so that I could start saving up for a home. I just moved out of my parents place, and have realized that I would prefer to live on my own instead of with family or with roommates. However, I just can't seem to find anything that sounds appealing to me, and even when I do, I talk myself out of it because I start feeling like I won't be good enough.

I've found that I do best in jobs where I can either listen to music/podcasts/audiobooks while I work, as it helps the day go by quickly and leaves me feeling happy at my job. I also injured my knee pretty badly recently, and would like to avoid jobs that require hard labor or heavy lifting (team lifts). I've been told I have a good voice for narration, but I just don't know if I would be good enough to become a voice actor or audiobook narrator...

Here are some other jobs I've considered but have given up on over the years: * Author * 911 Dispatcher * YouTuber * Twitch Streamer * Audiobook Narrator * Voice Actor * Lawyer (I can't afford college) * Therapist (I can't afford college) * IT Work (I don't know how to code and am intimidated by coding)

I don't really know what I want to do with my life, but I need some advice on careers I could follow that could possibly help me afford a home in this world, despite how ungodly expensive housing is nowadays...

I currently work as a housekeeper for a hotel/casino, and actually really like it because I am on my own most of the day and can listen to music while I work. It gets very stressful though when they assign too many rooms and I can't get them all clean before I start working overtime because of it. Whenever that happens, supervisors aren't happy because the higher ups don't like people working overtime, and then get angry at my supervisors.

I am autistic, easily overwhelmed, have ADHD, had asthma issues in the past, don't like being pressured by coworkers or bosses, love working with animals, and a lot of other stuff, but despite being 25 (almost 26), I still don't know what to do with my life, but I could really use some help on finding something that could be a good fit...","What career options could I pursue that would allow me to earn at least $70,000 a year, avoid extreme stress, and be fulfilling, given my interests and limitations?","- The individual has a family situation that does not provide enough financial support for college.

2025-02-27 20:42:07,1izpxkh,"Current MBA Student at a low tier college, didn't make great decisions in my undergrad, should I finish my degree or bail on it?","Hi everyone, I know the title is kind of broad but I'm seeking advice so that I can make better decisions moving forward with my career, given that I have made pretty bad choices thus far, for context; here are the decisions I've made that I've regretted, so that you can understand my current situation

1. Graduating with a Bachelor of Communication; I struggled to adjust to university lifestyle living on campus which messed up my GPA a ton and got me put on academic probation, the only way I could've stayed at the college is if I agreed to stick to a major, and so I chose the one I had the most credits towards
2. Not getting an internship; I'm a first generation student, didn't think internships were that important or common
3. Going to grad school (MBA) a year after graduating; I understand most people take a break of 3-5 years before getting an MBA but I couldn't find a decent job and felt it was better than nothing (I was a mortgage banker between then, which I hated)
4. Going to a low-tier MBA school; I know about the T7 or T20 MBA schools where people consider those to be only worth going to but I didn't want to wait a year to get in, and with my undergrad performance I probably wouldn't have anyways.

So I'm here currently halfway through an MBA program at Wayne State University; and I feel regret for the decisions I've made to get here, the school is easy and not competitive at all but I'm inclined to follow through and complete the degree.

should I finish my degree, potentially even settling for a very entry level role in Finance or PM and climb the ladder from there. Or should I leave Wayne State, get a common job and try to get into University of Michigan (restarting my MBA) after 1-3 years?","Should I finish my MBA at Wayne State and settle for an entry-level role, or leave and try to get into a better program like the University of Michigan after a few years?","The individual is a first-generation college student who graduated with a Bachelor of Communication. They struggled to adjust to the university lifestyle while living on campus, which negatively impacted their GPA, leading to academic probation. To remain in college, they had to choose a major, opting for one where they had accumulated the most credits.

After graduation, they did not pursue an internship, as they were unaware of its importance. They then enrolled in a Master of Business Administration (MBA) program just a year after completing their undergraduate degree, as they were unable to find a decent job and considered further education a better option than being unemployed. Their work history includes a position as a mortgage banker, which they did not enjoy.

Since it’s a small business, the owner is always around micromanaging us and asking us to clean the washroom, doors, rooms, windows and much more. Recently, he cut my hours (from 70 biweekly to 55) because according to him I’m not doing a good cleaning job and he is over paying me for the position (I get paid 1$ more than my coworker due to my experience). He said that in the end of the month he would check if my performance improved to give back my hours. I tried my ass off and it’s still not enough, he said it would take me 3 to 4 months to convince him that I can do the job because “I always get better and get worse again and again”.

I wanna quit so bad, I can barely afford living and even though he said I improved I have to go through a bunch of tests and step on eggs to have my hours back.

I previously went to cosmetology school, graduated, got my license and worked in makeup and also as an assistant at a hair salon in hopes of getting a chair. However, after putting up with the toxicity that’s in the industry (school included) I had enough. I was broke and led on for far too long and decided that I couldn’t do it anymore. So I decided to still pursue something creative but in a more office like setting. So I enrolled myself in an associates program for graphic design because I felt confident in my creativity and business skills. In the meantime, I’ve just worked an administrative job that’ll pay my bills and get me through my program. Fast forward now, I’m nearing the end of my program and have been applying for graphic design jobs since mid July and …nothing. I either get rejection emails or no answers at all. I understand that the industry can be tricky to break into but I’ve just felt so defeated recently. 

Even though I’m in school, I’ve taught myself basically everything on my own time because unfortunately my program focuses more on the ‘art’ portion rather than what is actually needed in the industry. I just feel like I’m trying so hard and nothing is coming out of it. The job I’m currently at is not fulfilling at all, and I know it’s only suppose to be temporary but lately I’ve been feeling like I’ll never leave. Was going into graphic design a mistake? Should I stick it out a bit longer or transition into something else? Does anyone have any suggestions for other careers to consider with the skills I already have? I have administrative experience, plenty of customer service, experience in the beauty industry and some freelancing as a designer. Any help would be appreciated!!

2025-02-27 20:03:24,1izp0ou,"Should I swap my relaxed, flexible role for a high-pressure growth opportunity?","
TL;DR:
I'm a software engineer who wants backend experience but has been stuck on frontend work. After a reorg, I'm managing projects that don't align with my growth goals, and my manager hasn't supported my backend ambitions. I recently had a chance to join a promising new team with leadership opportunities, but that team is high-pressure with fixed hours, unlike my current flexible team that supports more family time. I'm torn between comfort and growth.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated—I've only been in the corporate world for two years.

Context:

I work as a software engineer at a company. I got promoted last year; the work was satisfactory, and I got to work on multi-quarter projects. However, during a reorganization, our projects were transferred to other teams, and my entire team was assigned to a project from the USA—except for me.

I have worked exclusively on the frontend throughout my career and have always wanted to work on the backend as well. Luckily, I had the opportunity to work on a backend project, but it only lasted for one quarter.

Then there was another UI project, which led to a team member leaving due to strict deadlines and high pressure. The project had been delayed multiple times, and eventually, she resigned. My manager then told me to take over the project and drive it to completion. I became overwhelmed because, firstly, the project did not help me gain new knowledge as it was similar to my previous work, and secondly, it was such a critical project that it would be easy to pin any failure on me if I missed the deadline.

I feel that my manager neglects me—she never really asks what kinds of projects I would like to work on. I have told her multiple times that I want to work on backend projects, and she says she will keep that in mind, but nothing ever happens.

Because of this, I considered switching teams. Since I was promoted recently, I thought I might move to a team with similar or lower work pressure. I matched with a team whose product I really liked, and the manager seemed good, even mentioning that I would get to lead projects. However, the catch is that the work pressure there is very high, and the team has a startup-like culture.

Another factor is that my current team is very flexible regarding office days and work hours, while the new team has fixed days and working hours. I also tend to feel homesick quite often; my current team allows me to visit my family frequently (about six times a year, for 2–3 weeks each time), whereas the new team would likely allow only three visits per year, each lasting between one week and ten days.

After matching with the new team, I rushed and asked the manager to proceed with my application. Now, however, I am hesitant and unable to decide.

Should I stay on my current team—with a manager who doesn’t really care about my career growth, but who offers a relaxed environment and manageable workload—or should I switch to a team with better manager who actively supports my professional development and offers leadership opportunities, even though it comes with a high-pressure, less flexible work environment?
Or should I stay in the current team and wait for a better opportunity?","Should I stay on my current team, which has a relaxed environment but lacks support for my career growth, or switch to a new team with better management and leadership opportunities, despite the high-pressure and less flexible work environment?","The individual is a software engineer who has been in the corporate world for two years.

2025-02-27 19:57:39,1izovi7,Do you think I should transfer?,"Today during a zoom team meeting my boss had this awkward conversation with me that felt like it should have been private. He told me our CISSO was building a DFIR team for the internal network/company and that the CISSO suggested that I should apply to be over there. (Right now I'm the cyber forensics person on the customer facing team.)

This confused me as normally when work is slow I'm farmed out to help other teams so I asked why I wouldn't I stay on this team and go help him when needed. My boss wasn't sure, he said he didn't have all the details but he'd check into it more, maybe the CISSO has some reason to keep the team separated. That maybe it'd be better to have me there and help here when needed. He said he would follow up on details. The conversation ended with one of my other coworkers wistfully saying 'dont leave us!' ..which, again was super awkward that my boss had this conversation in front of the whole team.

But now I'm really confused. Should I take this as a hint towards the current team going in a different direction?  Why was I even brought up like that between my boss and the CISSO? 

My biggest fear in this is messing up my trajectory in the company. When I was hired I was told more work would come in and eventually I'd be able to build a team under me. That hasn't  happened yet, but if I go to the other team, I'll just be a member on that team. Yeah I'll get more work, but I most likely won't manage it. 

But at the same time It's been 4 years with no growth. Just that empty promise of 'one day you'll be a manager too!' About 6 months ago our company was picked up by an investor which renewed my hope of more work as now they've been building out our sales team. But at the same time, I've only seen my boss have meetings with sales to sell cyber intel services (his background). I'm not invited to business development meetings. Sometimes it feels like unless they start including me so I can advocate for myself/services, I'm going to be forgotten about. So maybe staying this track is a dead end. 

I'm not sure what to do. Do I follow up with my boss? What do I say? Should I reach out to the CISSO himself to see what's going on? I do know him, he used to be my bosses' boss a few years ago but got moved up. We still talk sometimes. I'm kinda surprised he didn't come to me directly since he was talking to me about that same team last month, different context.","Should I follow up with my boss about the potential opportunity in the DFIR team, or should I reach out to the CISSO directly to discuss it?","The individual in the Reddit post has been working in their current position for four years as a cyber forensics person on a customer-facing team.

I got laid off last week. 

I had just started this job fresh out of Masters 6 months ago, I took it since I was job hunting for 8 months before I got this offer. 

Last week I got laid off with the reason given to me as - 'Restructuring' (VP gave me the same reason when I started the job on why this position was created). 

I handed off the signed termination papers 3 working days ago. And today I see a new job posting by my old company. New job title, but the responsibilities are exactly what I was doing at the job. 

I got a stellar review from my VP and he even wished me all the best for my future endeavours and said that he would be more than willing to be a reference for me on my future job applications. So I don't understand why my role was abruptly eliminated, and now they are rehiring for it. 

Got pay in leau of notice and 2 weeks severance as a part of the termination. 

Would really love some advice from senior professionals on why this could have happened and how can I avoid myself being in similar situations.

I’m married and I feel bad that I’m taking so long in school because I just want to be done and be able to help my husband pay bills lol (he’s the only bread winner and paying for my college rn)

I started my career in a two year intern program with the government, but when I moved, I decided to take an entry level position and did that for another year. I moved on and I took an intermediate job at another company where I was there for 2.5 years, but was also stuck with the entry-level tasks because my position was at the bottom of the org chart (not to mention the job title is something you could assume was entry-level). I took on a senior portfolio one year into the job when the person went on mat leave, but still had the same title, still doing the grunt work. After a year of doing that, I asked for a promotion - but was told it wasn’t in the budget and that they wanted to reserve the senior spot for another candidate they had in mind. 

In my job search, the only jobs I could land an interview with were intermediate level, despite applying for senior positions, and some of these intermediate positions were still at the bottom of the food chain. I decided to take another intermediate level job in the meantime, still taking on similar level tasks to the senior person, but thankfully not at the bottom of the org chart at this company. 

While I don’t mind it, I see my friends securing senior level positions in their jobs and in the same field. I can’t really figure out why I can’t seem to grow - they know I have the skills, I’ve grown my experience in strategy development and planning, and usually these senior positions don’t actually require leadership or managerial skills - and I’m certainly not trying to be a manager. Sometimes I think a job title is just a job title, but other times I get frustrated because I know hiring managers can make assumptions.

Currently working as a 1 year contractor through a staffing agency, with the potential for contract to hire at a life insurance and financial retirement services in the financial services sector. They are growing. FWIW, many of the contractors end up converting to full time here. Actually, many of the current FTEs were on a contract initially. However, there's 17 contractors who joined before me and its a FIFO queue as to who gets converted to FTE whenever the organization gets budget. Learning opportunities are good and there is mentorship which I desperately need as I am not a good developer, on all fronts. I've been here for a month. I've been laid off twice in the past 2 years.

Contractor job

$85/hr, no benefits. Currently on COBRA. Potential to be converted. Commute to the office 1-2x/week. Work on C# and python, AWS, Terraform, Docker, event driven systems

Offer 1:

Fulltime at Blue Cross Blue Shield. 130k, 20 vacation days, fully WFH, benefits. Not much room for growth. BCBS has had layoffs every year, sometimes multiple layoffs within the year, if profits aren't met. Newer hires tend to get the axes compared to senior hires. No real stability, although this can be my anxiety talking here. Manager here is not technical at all. I would be coding, professional growth and opportunity to learn form others to upskill isn't as high. Most of the work is done by contractors and FTEs are left to clean up the mess

BCBS is a “non-profit” that conducts layoffs when profits aren’t met or coming in. BCBS is only for my particular state(I’m in California) when the current company is nationwide and growing.

Getting a fulltime offer at my current job would beat a fulltime offer at Blue Cross Blue Shield, which beats my current contractor job (FTE conversion > BCBS > current contractor). My biggest concerns are obviously job security and layoffs. I'd rather have a job than no job as my mental health went to shit while I was unemployed. I've compared the two(along with potential conversion) via an excel sheet and it's really a tie.

2025-02-27 16:15:04,1izjh9r,Would it be a bad decision to leave my job after 2 months?,"Burner account cause I don’t want to risk it

I graduated in December, and started at my first full time role a little over two months ago. There’s a lot to like about it. The pay is pretty good - great for the average 22 y/o, decent for my major. My coworkers and my boss are super chill and nice to get along with and it’s a relaxed work environment. Benefits are meh but not horrible.

What I don’t like is I don’t feel like my technical skills are really being utilized. So far I haven’t really done anything I find interesting, and the more technical work I’m going to be starting on is better, but still not exactly within my preferred niche. The company is also located two cities away from where I’d like to live.

I knew all this when I accepted the job, so I had planned to stay for 1-2 years then find a new position, except I had a mentor recommend it’s better to leave early then to get plugged in with them then jump ship. So I sent out a few applications to positions in my preferred location and that better matched my interests.

I got an offer for a 15k higher salary that’s exactly the kind of work I want, better location, more pto, and more potential networking opportunities. The caviet is it’s a startup (a few years old), so there’s more risk involved. I do have a safety net, so if the company goes under I wouldn’t be on the streets. 

I’m struggling with this because on paper, this new offer is better. But I’d be giving up a job I know is stable, good pay, and a pleasant work environment for something that is higher risk, both because it’s a startup and I won’t know if I enjoy the work environment until I start. I will say I haven’t seen any red flags so far though.

2025-02-27 21:36:34,1izr770,Management insists I'm not a potted plant.  But should I become one?,"I'm wondering if it ever makes sense to just succumb to micromanagement, under certain circumstances.  I appreciate any advice!   

For context, I work in a department that supervises other departments.  I have many projects on which I'm nominally the lead (e.g., management presents me to outside partners as the point of contact for our department, I'm told that I'm responsible for leading meetings and getting projects over the finish line). 

Over time, I'm come to realize that Big Boss functionally makes every decision.  There's not much of anything that I can do or say that doesn't require pre-approval in some form.  In a few instances, it's gotten so bad that partners will copy my supervisors on email chains to get faster answers

About a year, I tried to focus on providing recommendations.  If I'm asked to do something, I'll send an email up the chain that outlines my thinking.  Or if a document requires revisions, I'll preemptively send over a redline with my suggested approach.  I thought that might allow me to feel like I'm contributing in the way that management insists I'm supposed to be, consistent with our hierarchy.  But I don't really feel like anyone cares about my analysis, and sometimes I feel like I'm actively wasting time providing it. 

Simply put, I'm wondering if I should just lean back in a big way.  Another way I could increase my job satisfaction (at least in the short term) is by not working very much at all, frankly.  And it seems like there is indeed a version of this job where I largely just forward emails to the right people.  I'm slightly worried that I'll get dinged somehow for not contributing, but maybe I should give the potted plant life a shot?

2025-02-27 21:09:11,1izqkb9,Got laid off but not as upset as I thought,"

So, I got laid off from my Civil engineering job today. Funny thing is, I’m actually relieved. The workplace was pretty toxic, and the role never really aligned with my background (mechanical engineering).  

They told me that energy modeling “requires a different mind” and that I wasn’t asking enough questions… even though in my last meeting, they said I was asking TOO many questions and taking up too much of the team’s time. Can’t win, I guess. 

I gave it my best shot, documented everything (weekly) and did my part (especially taking up extra work) basically everything I have done when they said I was doing well but on steroids. 
In the end, it just wasn’t the right fit. The bright side? I get an extra month’s pay while I look for something more in line with my skills, specifically mechanical engineering, CAD and product design, which I love the most.  

It’s a weird feeling, but honestly, I think this was for the best. Time to move on to something better and more in line with my skills this time. At least I have half a years experience. The director said that he would help me with a reference (unsure if I should trust this). 

Yesterday I was even explaining a building model in full depth and how it passed for a standard to my supervisor. For some reason, he thought it was okay to cut me off and speak to the directors daughter for what seemed like forever, then said to himself loudly “that was a nice distraction. So what did you want to tell me?” I have never felt so disrespected by a colleague before. 

He said thank you that I got to the root of the problem and re modelled what was needed to be done on time.

Thank you all who gave me the confidence to still stick with engineering even if it means not with this particular company. The only reason why I took this job was because I needed something to do, anything at all. Now I now whatever I did there (energy modelling) was not for me nor was it my initial interest. 

I will not let this blow my confidence. I have been mentally preparing for this day anyways. It’s a tough market but thankfully I know a guy who’s in the field so I will hit him up later.

2.) I just finished my first interview with a job that is a pretty similar role.

Here’s the dilemma:

	1.	If I accept the $65K job now, would it be unethical or bad form to leave within a few months if the $90K offer comes through?

	2.	Would this hurt my reputation or future job prospects?

	3.	Would it make sense to stay in the $65K role for stability and experience, or should I take the risk and wait for the higher offer?


Bonus: should I even risk pushing for a different salary? They said 65. Could I realistically get it to 70-75? It’s a risk and compliance position, I have a Juris Doctor and about 9 years work experience, 3 of which are from leadership roles in healthcare fields.  These are both healthcare jobs.

Then after that he would set up a meeting with me, him, and the HR generalist to go over everything. To me it sounded like he was ready to give me the job I just needed to reach out to him.

I have a good amount of previous experience (from my career prior to ambo) in sales/training/marketing in FMCG and tech but I am at a bit of a loss as to what to do next - I quite like the sound of doing something in the specialised classic/upmarket/leisure motor trade but have ZERO experience in that area so financially that would most likely not be viable. Other healthcare jobs don’t particularly appeal to me and most are now out of reach regardless of my experience as I don’t hold a healthcare degree (a must as of 2021). Just wondering if anyone has any previous experience of leaving a healthcare/emergency service job (partic ambulance) and what they did next or if anyone has any advice on what jobs/career paths may be suitable. Since the ambulance service has become such an unsustainable career over the past few years I feel there’s a huge career black hole for staff/ex staff to fall into and feels a bit of a waste.
Thanks for any thoughts/advice. ",What jobs or career paths would be suitable for someone leaving a healthcare/emergency service job like an ambulance clinician?,"The individual has worked as a front line NHS ambulance clinician for the past 8 years. Prior to this role, they have experience in sales, training, and marketing within the FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) and technology sectors. They qualified in their ambulance role before the introduction of the degree requirement for the position, which limits their transferrable qualifications. They do not hold a healthcare degree, which has become a necessity for many healthcare jobs since 2021. The individual is currently in the early stages of resenting their job due to the working conditions and the potential toll on their health if they continue in the role for another 15 years. They are exploring new career opportunities but feel uncertain about where to go next, especially since they have no experience in the specialized motor trade area they’re interested in, and other healthcare roles do not appeal to them.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1iznivn/job_advice_for_ex_ambulanceemergency_service/,jobs
2025-02-27 18:53:40,1izncgj,"Junior programmer, and I wasted so much of my companies and coworkers time over a dumb mistake","So Ive been at the company for 9 months now, Im still learning a LOT cause the field it pretty wide (Im an abap junior consultant), and I got a ticket that seemed fairly simple. I needed to get some info and put it on a form.

Didnt know where to get the info from, and eventually I got told about a specific table I should get the info from.

But mistakenly, I though I couldnt use it, cause I was convinced I needed to get a single entry from it, and witht he data available that wasnt possible. I did know that in the end, I was supposed to have several dates on the form, but I though each one needed to be retrieved seperately, instead of all at the same time.

I try finding another way to get the dates, waste a lot of time on it. Eventually im told this problem needs to be solved quickly, and by this time Ive learned a lot about the form and how the program works, but Ive completely forgotten about the table I got in the first place (cause if I had remembered, I would have fixed it in 5 minutes). I involve my coworker, he spent like 4 hours in total trying to get the date. And today I talk with the people who know more about the functional aspects and realize I could have just used that table after all.

I feel so bad. I wasted so much time of our company, I wasted so much time of my coworker, and I wasted so much time of the client.

I received an email from someone saying they say my resume on Job board and they'd believe I'd be a good fit. The typical recruiter email.

So I went on the website to check it out. It honestly seemed legit at first glance, but then there LinkedIn page seemed off, not a lot of customer reviews and it wasn't BBB accredited. 
I attached some photos for a better reference and I also did check their website for employees and i did see about 10 employees, but I'm pretty sure they're AI generated people.

I've worked for my College dining hall for 3 years now (dining services are not owned by the college but by a separate company- I won't be naming names bc I need my job lol). I get paid the minimum wage of the state, and I have for the entire time I've worked there. I've frequently been told I'm the best student worker there (not trying to toot my own horn, that's what my supervisors and the chefs have told me), I get along with my coworkers, and I do work that is not in my job description in order for my station to run properly (prepping, etc) because 1) yes ofc it makes my work easier in the future but also 2) I don't want the person who takes over for the next shift to be floundering bc they don't have what they need. I've asked for a raise from the manager (who came in after I was hired). She thought I was already making 25 cents higher than minimum, but then never brought it up after saying she would ""talk to the people in charge of that"", and when I brought it back up 3 weeks later to check in she said ""I've decided not to give it to you (the 25 cent raise that she already thought I was making) because you've missed so many shifts"" (I missed 2 and a half because of a diagnosed medical condition). That was for the whole semester. Is it wrong that I'm pissed about this? I'm doing more than what's asked of me (and I still will because I don't want to make things harder for my coworkers, I love them), but I just want to know if this is normal? This is not my first job, I'm not unde 18, I'm efficient and safe with the food- I just want to know if I should give up on trying to get this raise or not. I have a lot of medicines, some of which are really expensive, and for context, over January I ended up having to spend 1300 on doctor appt. Copays, medications, and tests. I just want to be able to help my mother out- even w scholarship and financial aid, I'm already 15000 in debt, and I don't want my mum to have so much stress on her.
Sorry if it seems like a rant (kind of is, but I also wanted to give good background). If there are people who have had more experience than I who can weigh in on this, I just want to know if this is normal and I should give up, or if there's anything I can even do, even if that's not ""normal"".
(I should mention that I am part time, since I'm also an upperclassmen student, but there have been other part time student workers who have received raises in the past).

An offer. Then I read who it was from. A company that I won't name but had NEVER interviewed me.

To give some background to not be too vague, I did apply and started going through the process, so my information was in their system. Then they emailed me stuff that included a microphone test and having done scripting before I wasn't freaked out. Until I read the quotes.

Now the first one wasn't bad by any means it quoted a very famous book, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to work somewhere where I was quoting that for someone using it out of context for their purposes, but the second one. No way was I quoting that one. It was more opinion than fact and that opinion was very one-sided to stuff I do not agree with personally. So I just deleted the email and moved on.

2025-02-27 18:04:02,1izm4z0,Recruiter told me no - but I think he's wrong??,"I am happily employeed. But I had a FAANG recruiter reach out to me. I applied for the role. I was a PERFECT fit. I have done everything on the roles/responsibilities of the posting. In fact, I'm a Director now running this type of program. The FAANG position was an IC. It was a 'step down' in title, but a step up in brand/company recognition and pay.

I felt like I nailed the interview. Every question I gave a STAR response. Not only have I completed nearly every component of the job requirements, I have trained and lead teams to complete these tasks as well. This role was mine.

Interestingly, a couple days after the interview, but before I was told the results I made an educational LinkedIn post around the primary subject matter of the role. The post ended up getting 100+ likes and 60+ comments from other leaders and experts in this field. INCLUDING the FAANG Hiring Manager, and the Hiring Manager's Supervisor. They both supported the post.

Then today, the recruiter tells me I didn't make it to the next round. I KNOW faang is competitive. I know there is a lot of tech talent available. But.... this is my jam. This is what I do, and I am regarded as one of the best in my field (and in fact won an award in 2022. Not one of those fake pay to win awards, but a peer nominated and peer voted award)...

Anyway, it just seems like the recruiter may have made a mistake?? Idk. there's nothing left to do. Just figured I'd have a reddit word vomit. Be kind. I'm still kicking myself.","Did the recruiter make a mistake by not advancing me after my interview for the FAANG position, given my qualifications and positive feedback from the hiring managers?","The individual is currently employed as a Director, running a program that is directly related to the job they applied for at a FAANG company.

2025-02-27 18:00:05,1izm15u,How do you deal with a boss who won’t engage with the team,"We used to talk quite a bit, have bi-weekly or monthly meetings, or go on lunches with the team sometimes, something I was told they’ll do more of. I can’t walk very long distances but it’s a hybrid office job


But in the past year, nothing. At all. Even before that there was trouble following up with performance reviews or stuff the company made mandatory. 

All I can do is remind a couple of times but essentially we are not talking. They’re in a cubicle now and everyone can hear, and also they’re busy so I get dismissed or “email me” or “we will talk later” or “we will meet next week but I have to check my schedule” a lot. They also routinely miss my actual emails but hang out every lunch with one of my colleagues. I can’t join as they’re walking really far. I don’t think I’m the only one left out, at least 2 more of us are. 

It’s affecting my perception of having a stable job. Though I haven’t had any complaints from anyone about my work. 

Also it’s been a few years and though I have learned or done many new things, everything is stagnant, same level. I’ve been promised certain tasks since the very beginning. Every year it’s being brought up and I got very little of that outside of what I just take over. 

Is this in my head? I think they’re afraid I’ll ask to do more. I am enrolled in an accounting designation program which is now expiring. I couldn’t press too much about it because  I feel I lost jobs in the past as people felt threatened maybe at simple mentions of submitting experience progress reports to the organization and things were made hostile for me. 

Otherwise everything here is great, but I’m still not doing the half of my job description which would give me the designation and my boss is doing 3 people jobs ( including a lot of what I should be doing)  so we simply can’t communicate? 


Task wise, I’m picking up bits and pieces of things I won’t be allowed to do then I don’t have the knowledge to use that info in detail ( which apparently I have to do)  so there’s also that ",How can I effectively communicate with my team and seek more responsibilities at work when I feel excluded and stagnant in my role?,"The individual describes a work situation where communication has deteriorated over the past year, although they previously had regular meetings and lunches with their team.

Despite being in the job for several years and having taken on new tasks, they feel stagnant in their career, with unmet promises of new responsibilities that are essential for their professional development. They are currently enrolled in an accounting designation program that is nearing expiration, but they have been hesitant to pursue this actively due to past experiences where their requests for more responsibilities or updates led to a hostile work environment. 

Overall, it seems they are struggling with a lack of support and communication in their workplace, which is impacting their job stability and professional growth.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1izm15u/how_do_you_deal_with_a_boss_who_wont_engage_with/,jobs

2025-02-27 17:59:07,1izm0bz,I don’t know what to think about my career or life anymore.,"Got my first job 10 months ago as a data analyst. My father kind of pushed me to find any job possible after graduation, i know the job market is terrible now especially in the tech field. This one was quick to offer… after one as an engineer that got cancelled entirely, so I felt I had no choice to take it.

I don’t exactly know why im writing this post other than the fact I just want to cry. 

It’s true my mental health is down the toilet for other unrelated reasons, which makes everything 1000x worse, and I haven’t had any actual vacation to myself since I’ve joined. Just forced family trips and Christmas during the worst mental breakdowns of my entire life.

The job is not up my ass, my boss is like a father and the work is remote except for one day. However, the quality of work is depressing and I feel so mediocre as an applicant to further positions (data science), like I’ve messed up a good chunk of my career path in a job with no technical team, terrible data quality and 0 coordination. I’ve been manually copying and pasting sales data for months, since we have no online sales consolidation, redoing it billions of times for billions of ridiculous errors from again, no coordination and no team across regions. Hardly any analytics is done, just a PowerBI, some customer segmentation, and a proposal for an online end to end data warehouse and BI platform that would solve all of these issues. Boss hasn’t even replied to my detailed email about the plan after a chat we had. 

I need to be honest with my director, but if it doesn’t change in some months I’ll start applying elsewhere. Just not emotionally prepared to get nowhere as a data scientist from lack of technical modeling experience now. I also need to take language classes after work because I’m not fluent in the local language, and figure out how the fuck I’m going to get a social life because I’ve lost 100% of any friends I’ve had in university.

I am not living a life. I hope this is normal for just starting out, but I can’t open LinkedIn without seeing my peers already being “AI engineers” and I’m just pasting data for the billionth time in a row for some incorrect input. 

My parents are also pushing me to get a mortgage, which I get why, but it’s like I got a job for the sake of some work experience and suddenly I have a first huge debt and all hours of the year is sucked into redoing the same fucking dataset. 

How do people have kids??!!! Genuinely what the fuck ??? I will never have a child I don’t even know what the hell im going to eat for dinner. My bedsheets still need to be washed. 

Not a single friend I can go have a drink with. I can’t even date because I feel like such an isolated loser and so not proud of my work while he’s just Ai EnGiNeErInG. I get the world is so brutal, I just wish I didn’t feel so out of control with every literal single aspect of my life and not being proud of the 8 hours of work I need to put in of being able to really work well from lack of coordinated data.

2025-02-27 17:49:29,1izls1z,Should I take the job?,"Should I take this job?

The jobs I currently work are crazy hours, usually 50-60hrs / Wk. I feel like I don’t have a life outside of it. It’s a lot of early mornings thru days thru late nights stacked together. But I also have the ability to make my own schedule technically… But I end up with a lot of work stacked up that’s hard to say no to. But I COULD get better at that. I travel for one month every year, but the trade off is usually only a day or two off for all 11 other months. Usually make $27-29/Hr, no benefits. It’s customer service and operations based chaos that is a lot of time on my feet/some physical labor. 

I got offered a 4-6 month long gig that has the potential to turn full time. It’s $22/Hr, but a consistent schedule… 8:30am-5pm. Weekdays. A desk job but learning something that’s kinda an adjacent interest of mine. 

This would be a significant pay cut for me, as I wouldn’t be able to combine really any of my usual gigs with this one very often. I would just be hoping that I liked it, that it turned into a full-time gig, or that, if neither of those things happen… I would hope that the old gigs would take me back. 

Now I’m questioning myself though. Do I want the stability? I’ve been applying to jobs with no luck for over a year, it feels dumb to turn this one down. But it’s not even a job, it’s a gig that COULD lead to one. Really wrestling over this decision and would love some advice.

I oversee a sales team that sell our products at a retail location and trade show events around the state. I’ve had this job for about 2 years and was recently informed that if sales numbers don’t improve I will be terminated. Seems reasonable until you look at the numbers. 

The company as a whole lost roughly $50 million in revenue in 2024, is facing overwhelmingly negative reviews on products launched in Q4 of 2023, and has continually tried to solve the problems in the same ways that are proven to be failing. I’m being blamed for the companies failures.

I broke down all of the numbers from my time in this position. In 2023 I averaged $68K in sales per month. In Q4 of 2023 we launched 3 new products that were met with overwhelmingly negative reviews and returns costing the company millions in revenue and in my opinion permanently damaging the companies name. The issues with launch have still never been publicly acknowledged by the company, which I think is a mistake and makes it look like we don’t care about our customer experience or satisfaction. In 2024 I averaged $58K in sales per month. However, I noticed the drop in sales early on and compensated for this by attending industry events and hosting training days for our products for consumers on the weekends. Something that was my idea but was met with backlash. I did it anyways and this helped increase sales to an accumulated average of $71K in sales per month. I had a small individual yearly growth while the company itself dropped nearly $50 million in yearly sales. 

The company is now refusing to advertise in an effort to save money, our social media presence is almost non-existent in an effort to reduce necessary staff, and we’ve resorted to cold calls with roughly a 1-2% success rate bringing in only $2,000 on average a month. 

I understand the industry we’re in very well. I’ve been told by numerous other employees and even the higher ups within the company including the CEO that I’m one of the most knowledgeable employees on our products and the industry we’re in. Yet none of my ideas are ever considered and I’m being blamed for the company losing money despite the fact that my personal revenue contributions rose in the last year. 

I feel very unappreciated and disrespected. I worked hard for the position I’m in and get paid well for what I do. I lost my job in 2021 and started from the bottom of this company and worked to get promoted to my current job. I feel like if I leave I’m a failure. I can’t find any other jobs interested in my resume despite it being strong for my age. I’m really not sure what to do and would like advice from anyone that may have been in a similar situation. Thank you!

If you don't want to watch the video, this was the basics of what was said:

He said there was a ""shortage of skilled worker"", yet he fired about 80 employees that weren't good enough. He wants ""experienced"" workers, not willing to have on-the-job training. He said he fired those that ""were no good.""

Company was making $14 million a year. Wanted ""competent"" and ""capable"" workers with ""experience"". 

Apparently the industry needs over 400,000 to meet demand. But training is non existent for this employer. 

He doubled their salary to $40 an hour for the best workers. Which means he was paying them only $20 an hour when they started. I wonder how many he fired just didn't put forth everything at $20 an hour? Quiet quitting, maybe?

2025-02-27 15:50:09,1izivat,Manager is always extremely rude when I ask for help,"Hi all,

As the title states, my manager is always extremely rude when I ask for help. 

For context a few months ago I started my first post grad position. It’s in a job unrelated to my degree and it’s been a tiny bit of a learning curve but I’ve been doing pretty well and have made pretty minimal mistakes. 

Anyways a major issue I am having is one of my managers is known for being very rude in the office and talks down to everyone. 

I recently asked her for advice on a very specific situation I’m dealing with. I’ve been dealing with a hyper-specific work situation that I’ve never dealt with before and I want to make sure I go about it the correct way to ensure that I make no mistakes. 

I approached her attempting to explain the issue but she responded to me with “we’ve been over this five times already” and didn’t help to answer the question. 

I asked her once before about this situation but decided to ask again because the first time we spoke about it was only in passing and not a sit down conversation. I’ve also never encountered this issue before which is why I went to her for advice. 

It’s frustrating because this seems to be the pattern any time I ask her a question. It seems like they don’t want me asking questions but then get mad at me if I don’t talk to them before I move forward and make decisions. I’m damned if I do damned if I don’t. 

She also has a habit of sometimes when I ask a question she will be sarcastic and hit me with a “well what do YOU think” and then it puts me in an awkward position because the entire reason I’m asking her is because I don’t know the answer so I just stand there and try to guess what answer she wants me to say. 

She will talk to me like I’m five years old and say things very slowly as if I’m a child. It’s frustrating because I feel like they almost are setting me up to fail. If I ask her questions she talks down to me. If I don’t ask her before I do something then I will get bombarded with questions and anger from her “why would you do that” “why didn’t you check with me first”

2025-02-27 15:40:06,1izimgc,Move or Stay? Workplace recently became toxic.,"Context: 
1. i live in Southeast Asia. 
2. Current company is called Company A. 
3. Day shift work hours. 
4. I was a performer until recently (6-12 months). Im already 4 years into my work. Got promoted once. 

5. Recent Manager/Boss is very impatient, although very good at the usual Job (technical analysis), manager make me constantly feel dumb when I am with him/her. There were already multiple instances when I felt like a failure because of the constant treatment and it has been affecting my Mental Health. 

6. Manager now is threatening to put me on a program to regularly track my progress and the such (which is called PIP, and can be a means for them to fire the employee) 

Problem:
1. I am now actively looking for opportunities outside work, and I have one potential employer, same set of job responsibilities and skill set, but the gist is it is in NIGHT SHIFT work hours.

Question:

1. Given the current situation at Company A, is it worth it for me to “prove to myself and everyone” that I am not a failure (even tho i know i am not) and fight for myself and continue with the program that is designed for them to fire me? 

2. OR should I pursue COMPANY B, even though its night shift? ","Given the current situation at Company A, is it worth it for me to continue with the program designed for them to fire me, or should I pursue a new opportunity at COMPANY B, even though it involves night shift work?","The individual lives in Southeast Asia and has been employed at their current company, referred to as Company A, for four years, having been promoted once during this time. They were previously a performer until approximately six to twelve months ago. Their current role involves day shift work hours. The individual has been facing challenges with their recent manager, who is described as impatient and skilled at technical analysis but has made the individual feel inadequate, negatively impacting their mental health. The manager has threatened to place the individual on a performance improvement plan (PIP), which could lead to termination. Consequently, the individual is actively seeking new job opportunities, including a potential position at another company (Company B) that would involve night shift work hours.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1izimgc/move_or_stay_workplace_recently_became_toxic/,jobs
2025-02-27 15:38:24,1izikzb,"Professional way to tell your boss ""you told me to do it this way""?","My boss has a lovely habit of giving me specific direction on how to solve a problem (after I gently suggested a better alternative approach) and then later asking me why I would have done it that way. 

I would love to say, ""because you told me to do it that way, moron."" However, I also would like to remain employed, and openly disrespecting my boss isn't very conducive to that. 

Does anyone have a more professional and respectful way to get this message across? ",How can I professionally and respectfully communicate to my boss that I followed their instructions when they question my approach to problem-solving?,"The Reddit post does not provide any background information or context about the individual's education, family situation, work history, or personal factors that may have contributed to their current crisis.
