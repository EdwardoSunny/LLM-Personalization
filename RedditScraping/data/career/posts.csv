1j4qeto,Background in aerospace engineering but working in controls. How to get into the industry I want?,"I graduated college in 2022. My degree is in aerospace engineering. I then got my first job out of college in the automation industry as a commissioning engineer. Did it for a year. Then got my current job as a lead control system engineer for the past half year. Mainly working on controls systems and electrical systems in data centers and other sites. It’s a cool job and provides stability and I don’t mind it but it makes me feel my degree and career is not headed in the right direction. 

I’ve been endlessly applying to aerospace companies the entire time but never get called for an interview or anything. Made it past some recruiters but eventually it doesn’t go anywhere. I’m worried I’ll end up working in this specific industry 

I always wanted to work on aircraft design, or as a structural or test engineer for aircraft/spacecraft. I think it would be so cool to work as a propulsion engineer for example. I’ve tried applying to Blue Origin. They auto reject me. 

Ever since I was in college, I was looking to find a long term job at Lockheed Martin, Collins Aerospace, Boeing, SpaceX etc. and I’m even open to other smaller private companies / defense contractors or less well known ones.

1j4qc7t,Any chances of getting in ?,"Blackstone off cycle internship

Hey guys 

I just done my assessments after applying to blackstone for off cycle internships next semester, and I really aced them, but I don’t know if I will actually get to the interview, as my resume is quite weak I think:

-I am a bba student at NUS (entrepreneurship major) and I don’t have any gpa as I only have one semester where I S/U all my courses (wasn’t in class for 1 month because of health issues and I wasn’t able to catch the late I’ve got). Also, I am an international student from France, so I hope this unusual profile makes me stand out 

-only have one semi related internship in a law firm specialised in AIFM in Luxembourg. Middle market firm but I’ve published an article about private equity while working there so hope that helps.

-I’ve started a student led hedge fund (30k aum), but working on it since 3 months only and it isn’t PE-related.

-started a startup, received fundings and managing a team of 7 people across Asia, Europe and the US, but is not finance related 

-president of student finance newspaper, we sometimes have PE related articles but still, clearly not directly finance work 

-Blackrock apprenticeship, investment and sales processes explained etc 

-some certifications linked to accounting and finance 

On one hand, I am a second year so I’ve technically wasn’t able to get into a BB or EB as I’m not in my penultimate year, on the other hand, I’ll be in competition with people who have some work experience (1-2 years in IB)

My dilemma is that, there are maybe a week  before knowing wether or not I’ll get for the first round of interviews, and that either I work a lot for these interviews (maybe for nothing), or I am playing it safe and focus on my classes and projects (lot of assignments), even if that means probably fail the interviews if I have them.

Like most people here, I really just want a decent job and salary while maintaining a healthy wlb. Yeah, wanting all 3 is ludicrous i know

The thing is, I'm really questioning if I should really choose finance or accounting and instead pivot to something like medicine and healthcare instead. The business school I was hoping to attend is okayish, but not reputable enough to land high finance jobs. So it's highly likely I'll choose accounting once I go there.

A majority of accountants go on, get a master's, and study for a thing called the CPA to get a decent salary.

1j4pm30,Is it worth to optimize task at a job?,"TLDR: Jan optimized pipeline, potentially saving 1000 of hours to the firm. Should Jan publish his findings or be selfish with it?  
  
Story:

Project: A

Team consists of 3 people, Jan(main character), Ana and Dean(Lead). Dean is PHD, Jan is Masters, and Ana is Bachelor. All 3 are working on same project, Dean wrote most of the code. And part of the code which Dean wrote could run up to 120 and not get 100%, more like 95% of results only on test A and no test B. Jan got assigned this run of code with different data but same amount of data. Jan found the issue with the code, fix it and now you can get 100% of results all the time within 15 hours of runtime, on test A and test B. Ana was assigned the same amount of data but different data. Ana run the same code for full amount of 120 hours, using resources of company and her time, didn't even bother to look for issue. This code should be run more then 30-40 times in future.



Project B:

Jan already showcased his skill of optimizing the different pipelines. First time on project B the pipeline took more then 12 hours to run, which would mean that if request came Monday, Tuesday would be done. Jan optimize it so it runs under 3 hours.



Project C:

Second time on project C he showcased his skill was once he took over the code from another colleague Tony. Tony code run for 3 hours for each use case. Jan optimize that to run under minute. That code should be run over 50 times, resulting in saving more then 150 man hours.



Both times he optimized the pipelines all he heard was good job and got a new task right away. 



Jan joined company 2 years ago, didn't get any promotion or significant raises. 

Keep employee Jan in best interest, and be strategic, and leave morals out of this. Employee Jan full year review is in few weeks, but they should already sent out the targets last week, before Jan found a solution for optimizing the biggest pipeline. 

Jan brought up his achievements of project C and project B on last year review, and was told that sometimes he take too long on his tasks, even tho he saved time on both projects by high margin.

Should Jan bring this up, or is it best to keep it to himself since he won't get any benefit from it, and just get more job to do.



Could Jan reach out to his boss with potential optimization in mind. Asking if he can optimize Project A, can he be rewarded. That's kinda like blackmail and could backfire on Jan saying that he should do that in first place.

If Jan shuts up about it Dean could raise some questions because of potential test B results.

  
What would you do as Jan?

1j4pcv7,How can I ensure I get credit for my work at my job?,"Hi all! I am currently on a team of two, reporting to the same manager and working on a big program with lots of other teams and employees. I am a junior employee (\~2 years at the company, right out of college) and my team mate is a senior employee (3 years at the company, but 15 in the field). I am an early 20's female in a male-dominated field, and the majority of my coworkers (including senior employee) are men. Up until recently, the senior employee was the ""Project Leader"" for our specific part of the program, and I reported to him. 

Last year, I discovered that the senior employee has been getting credit for a lot of behind-the-scenes work I had been doing to support our project. I have been running certain meetings he was technically responsible for, coordinating a lot of our work, identifying new opportunities and solutions for efficiency, and I came up to speed on the project very quickly, to the point that he often came to me for ideas or solutions. I noted a few cases where I suggested ideas to him and he took credit for them. I also often felt that he unfairly questioned the quality of my work and my expertise. I didn't say anything about this to anyone at the time because nothing seemed severe enough to mention, and I also was relatively inexperienced with team dynamics and thought maybe that was just how it went.

I discovered that I was doing an inappropriate share of the work (and not being recognized for it) when the the senior employee had to take some time away from work unexpectedly, allowing me to fill his role as Project Leader (which is very atypical for someone at my level). In doing this, I realized I had already been doing a ton of the work he was responsible for. Things came to a head when, in a conversation with my manager, I learned that my manager had no idea I ran one of our project's highest profile meetings - instead, he thought the senior employee had been doing it. I realized that, at the very minimum, the senior employee had not been appropriately representing my scope of work to our leadership. I felt incredibly betrayed by this and it destroyed my trust in the senior employee. When the senior employee returned, he exhibited some behavioral issues that management noted and has since resolved, including speaking over and repetitively interrupting others (including me) in meetings and getting belligerent. These issues have since resolved. However, during this time, he was removed from the official position as Project Leader and I no longer report to him.

At this point, we still work together, but from my end, I feel that our working relationship has been irreparably damaged, and things are a little tense. We are now essentially both individual contributors, and I report directly to our manager and have independent tasks that I fully own. However, it seems this situation has not been conveyed to others on the program (which I somewhat understand, given that it was very personal). The rest of the program still treats the senior employee as the project leader.

I'm not sure what to do here. I feel like I am not getting the visibility I deserve from senior leadership, because - even though my manager is now aware of the work I was doing and has put things into place to give me more independence and authority - the majority of the program has no idea and still thinks the senior employee is running these meetings/completing these tasks/fulfilling the role of project lead. In reality, I do a ton of the work of project lead, but there is no way for anyone higher up to see that because they still assume it is the senior employee.

What can I do to make myself more visible in my role, and ensure that I get the credit I deserve for the work I do? Is there anything I should ask for from my manager to support me in this? I kind of feel like they just want me to brush everything under the rug and play nice, but this entire situation has honestly been so distressing for me. My management has recognized that the situation was wrong enough that I should no longer report to the senior employee, but I feel like the fact that the rest of my coworkers don't know this is standing in the way of my ability to truly be acknowledged for my work.

Any advice is much appreciated!",What can I do to make myself more visible in my role and ensure that I get the credit I deserve for the work I do?,"The individual is a junior employee with approximately 2 years of experience at her company, which she joined right after graduating from college.

1j4ovx6,Advice on Breaking Into Clinical Research/Med Tech Startups in Germany as a Recent Grad?,"Hi all,

I’m a recent grad (BS in Human Biology) who moved from the U.S. to Germany and have been job searching in healthcare/med tech for over a year now with no success. In the meantime, I’ve been working and improving my German, but I still don’t speak at a native level.

I’m mainly targeting med tech startups due to the availability of positions in my city, and my interests lie in project management and operations. However, I’m open to other roles to get my foot in the door with room to grow.

I’ve had interviews but haven’t landed any offers yet. I suspect a few reasons for this:
	•	My German skills—I’ve interviewed in German but can’t express myself as well as in English.
	•	Lack of direct industry experience—My background is in direct patient care (EMT certification, jobs with transferable skills), but I don’t have formal clinical research or med tech experience.

So far, I’ve been:
	•	Searching for companies (both big and small)
	•	Cold messaging HR/C-level employees
	•	Sending initiative applications
	•	Applying to posted job openings

Since this approach hasn’t worked yet, I’d love any advice:
	•	Are there specific companies/startups worth looking into?
	•	Are there better ways to network or get my foot in the door?
	•	How can I leverage my background more effectively?
	•	Any other general tips from those who have broken into the field?

1j4o2pb,Should I be concerned?,"Promotion Question

Hello!

I work for a commercial bank in operations. We used to do raises/bonuses in December of each year. Starting this year, the bank will now be doing raises in June and bonuses in December. I received both a bonus and 6% raise in December. I was given a promotion to a new department that I have no experience in this past week. I had expressed interest in this department in the past and it happened to work out that they are wanting to expand. The position allows me to showcase my talents to more people in the bank, and has much more opportunity to move vertically than my current department. I was told by my current manager to just wait until June to expect a salary increase. He also said it’s best to play it humble with this company, as he’s always not asked for anything but always received more than he expected.

The same salary raise sentiment was echoed in my meeting today with the COO and my future manager. They said the raise would reflect my new position as it requires more work and involvement, but wouldn’t happen until June with the rest of the bank. My wife and parents think this is weird. That if I am moving locations, leaving the comfort of what I know, and expected to work more, I should get an immediate raise. I would agree with their position in normal circumstances. In my scenario, I just received a raise a few months ago, and was told to expect a sizable increase in a few months. I have also seen people lose momentum/leave the company when asking for too much money. Obviously that’s not a great culture, but it’s not something I can change. I know a lot of people might say take that promotion and find a new job, but in this case, I would only be able to look for my prior role, as I have no experience in the team I’m moving to. 









","Is it reasonable to expect an immediate raise when moving to a new position that requires more work, especially after just receiving a raise a few months ago?","The individual works for a commercial bank in operations and has expressed interest in a new department, which they have recently been promoted to despite lacking direct experience in that area.

I’m currently a lab tech at a hospital but it doesn’t pay well especially since I have no qualifications other than a phlebotomy license.

Maybe I’m just being a whiny bitch. 

Anyway, also considering if I’m going to spend 6 miserable years in school why not do it getting a different degree that will leave me with a better paying job?

Now I’m thinking of changing my degree to become a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner but I’m afraid of all the math and super hard classes that would bring, deep down I think I’m dumb due to years of bullying and idk if I could handle trying to get that degree.

1j4n6mh,Am I getting fired? XO,"
A lil bit of background, I studied as an international student at a foreign country. I’m a year out of school and got a job 4 months ago in a corporate company. Lately I’ve been very stressed thinking about how badly I’m performing at work and how bad my output is (even though nobody points it out). I struggle with digesting information fast or even in general, since english isn’t my first language and on top of that there’s a lot of processes, jargons and industry standards I’m not familiar with. 

I think what’s making things worst is that I’m terrified to ask my manager/co-workers about how I’m really doing. So I’m just going around my head overthinking everything, even the slightest things like ‘would I get fired using chatgpt to check my grammar in my emails because of the information I put in that it could breach company information.’ Everything would just snowball and my mind would just make up hundreds of scenarios of ways I could mess up and get fired. I won’t be able to focus on my job because of how scared I am to make a mistake (even though I know I’ve made a handful since I’ve started there).

It’s just a very new environment for me. I just want to know if this feeling would ever end, and if I’m ever going to feel better and actually like my job?

1j4n52c,Should I accept the job?,"Hi friends,

I have been interviewing for this job and i’m pretty sure that I will be receiving an offer. While I know there’s always a chance of not getting this job, i’ve been faced with this predicament a few times now and I would love to hear another person’s perspective. I graduated from a great public university in So Cal with a Sociology degree. I was on a law school track before I realized through internships that law was not going to be a great fit for me. 

I have worked retail my whole life throughout high school and college, and this led to becoming a sort of assistant to a designer in my home town. I loved working there and stayed for about 9 months before deciding to leave and participate in a local arts festival where I had applied on a whim and somehow got accepted (very hard to be even interviewed). This was summer of 2024. 

Before the festival ended, I got a job at a very well known surf/skate/outdoors fashion company with many amazing and reputable brands under this parent company. I started there in September of 24. Unfortunately, the company is now dissolving and I, along with hundreds, will be laid off in the next week. I have been applying and interviewing non-stop since the news of the dissolution in December. 

I am in the process of interviewing with a fantastic company who has been opening a lot of stores lately and seems to be doing well. I would be in their corporate office. The job, however, pays significantly less than my previous position. On the up side, the role seems to have a path into a field that I am very much interested in (more so than previous position). The pay cut is severe and would mean moving back in with my parents. I have made more working retail in 2020. 

Should I take the job relying on career growth or is it too late for me to take a step backwards? Or should I hold out for something with more pay? I would make more money on unemployment 😭. The kicker is, according to the job qualifications I would need both a college degree and two years of work experience… for a wage that is barely over minimum wage. I just don’t know what to do.. the market is atrocious. 

I am 24 and two years post grad. Any advice welcomed (except another complete career pivot let’s please be realistic). ","Should I take a job that pays significantly less but has potential for career growth, or should I wait for a better-paying opportunity?","The individual who wrote the Reddit post is 24 years old and graduated from a public university in Southern California with a degree in Sociology.

1j4n1e0,Follow the path I want or the path I should?,"Hi!

I'm a junior in a prestigious undergrad program and I'll graduate with a dual major in film and education. Being a cinema studies professor has been my dream for ages and still is. I've done ample research and educational work through internships and similar opportunities and I'm entirely convinced it's the thing that would bring me most joy.

Unfortunately, I feel like I can no longer ignore the fact that this career path is highly unsustainable and perhaps unachievable. Humanities profs make little money, tenure is disappearing, jobs are disappearing, and even grad school offers are disappearing. It's gotten to the point where professors who have mentored me, my friends, my family, and my career counselor all tell me that it's a bad idea.

Law school has been my backup plan, not just for the money (though I do understand they (usually) make more than humanities profs) but because I think I would get some enjoyment out of it. I wouldn't like it even a fraction as much as I would like teaching, but I'd like it more than a lot of other career options.

I'm getting to a point where I need to make a decision and I'm just absolutely torn. I want to follow my dream but I don't want to commit career suicide by pursuing a lengthy grad school program just to graduate and be unable to find a job / unable to make any money.

1j4m7ae,Should I pursue nursing or interior design?,"I’m a mom of six. Yes, six. Ages range from 16 down to a set of twin toddlers. My background has always been construction accounting (primarily job site certified payroll and project accounting). I hated it and won’t return. I’ve been home raising babies now for 7 years and since I don’t want to go back to accounting, I’m finding myself at a crossroads regarding a career change. My passion in life in interior design. I have loved it since I was a little girl and am pretty good at it. Obviously to make a lucrative career, I’d need to pursue a bachelors. The only caveat is I live in San Diego, the most expensive city, and an interior designer salary isn’t very lucrative. I’d love to follow my passion but I’ve got six kids to care for. I have been in school slowly chipping away at my prerequisites for nursing over the past 2 years and am down to just my prerequisites labs before applying to an RN program. The drawback is the nursing program here is so insanely competitive: about 500 applicants and 40 seats a semester is average around here. I adore caring for people and would likely be happy in my career but it’s not interior design. The plus with being an RN is the much higher pay and ability to work shift work so my husband and I (also shift worker) would be able to work opposite schedules so one of us is home with the kids/school/sports, etc. and could even afford us hiring help. I’ve pursued nursing because it’s the safer alternative. Medicine will never be in short supply where a down turn economy will axe the interior design space. What should I do?

So After taking a 7 month break,  I got a job offer at one of the best firms in the country based in NYC, which I accepted and is where I still work today. 

After almost 4 years there, I find myself conflicted, at a crossroads… I love what I do, the projects I work on, I LOVE my bosses, I’m pretty successful, I get to travel, work on projects with huge budgets, I have great clients, and my creativity is definitely being used which is awesome. I mean, I’m pretty damn good at what I do. 

It all sounds great, right? 

Well, there’s a bigggg BUT.  

My problem is the VERY unhealthy work life balance which at my highly competitive firm is not only considered standard, but is glorified. I find this to be common industry-wide among architecture and design (Architects have it even worse in my opinion….). Plus the “hustle” culture in NYC is many people’s entire identity… I subscribed to that for a while but IM TIRED. I’m 35…. I feel like im missing out on my life, on the little youth I have left… I’m being worked TO THE BONE. I see my husband for like two hours a day, I barely have time to workout and I just feel like this career has consumed my life. Working hours at our firm are 930am - 630pm… whenever i leave the office at 630 I feel guilty… many stay until 8 or 9 every night… I’ve been there all night sometimes to meet deadlines.  People in my office eat, sleep and breathe interior design, and while I love it, and while we create absolutely STUNNING and BEAUTIFUL spaces, this is becoming untenable. 

I see a lot of my friends in other fields working half as much as I do who get paid double, triple my salary… I’m not talking about doctors or lawyers or finance bros, but rather in tech…. Maybe there’s something in that industry to which my skills apply? Or maybe elsewhere? I’m willing to learn, take courses, go in entry level…. I know there will be trade offs and it will be different, but entry level jobs in tech pay more than I make 12 years into my career… I have no idea where to even look or who to talk to… I’m obviously not afraid of working hard and dedicating myself to my career - I take pride in that! I have genuine passion for what i do and I’ve achieved a lot in my field… I just feel like my TIME is more valuable and worth more… time is the one thing you can’t get back…

All that being said, is there anyone out there who transitioned out of interior design for a career that was more lucrative (and maybe just as fulfilling)? Maybe tech, maybe marketing, ux/ui?? 

I’d LOVE to hear your story, especially if you found something you can do remotely (would love to live abroad). 

Looking for insight!! 🙏","Is there anyone out there who transitioned out of interior design for a more lucrative and fulfilling career, possibly in tech or marketing, and could share their story?","The individual is a 35-year-old interior designer who is currently making approximately $150,000 a year in New York City for one of the top design firms in the country. They have a background in architecture and initially worked in construction management for the first four years of their career. Despite achieving success in construction management, they found the work boring and transitioned to interior design in 2016, starting as a project manager for luxury residential and hospitality projects. In 2019, they established their own design firm, working on redesigns of restaurants, nightclubs, and private homes until the impact of COVID-19 shifted their focus back to residential projects.

The individual has faced a personal crisis due to a devastating loss, which affected their ability to run their business. After a seven-month break, they accepted a position at a prestigious firm in NYC, where they have been working for almost four years. They express a love for their work, including the creative aspects and the projects they handle, but feel overwhelmed by the unhealthy work-life balance and high expectations at their firm. This has led to feelings of guilt for leaving the office at a reasonable hour and a sense of missing out on life, including time spent with their husband, as well as limited time for personal health and leisure activities.

1j4l0ba,Do I negotiate salary when the promotion comes?,"Title may seem obvious (I see people saying to always negotiate salary) but I feel my situation is unique enough to warrant the question.

I (26M) work at a financial institution. ~$3.5 Billion in assets and the largest FI in the area. In 2023, I was working part time at a branch. I decided to move to full time and a position opened at our headquarters for a back office position reviewing mobile deposits/processing online apps for our online banking. 

The state of the department was a bit of a wreck when I got there. The manager had just left for FMLA reasons and another seasoned employee up and quit right after. All of this just weeks after a complete overhaul of our online banking system, leaving the Director and VP to pick up way more work and being way more involved than they were ever anticipating being.

Fast forward to 2024, and of the five people in the department, I’m moved to department lead (despite being the newest person in the department). Not a manager role, but intended to take some responsibility off of the director. This decision was a joint decision between the director and VP. Pay raise from $40k to $50k.

The VP and I have a really good relationship, as he feels I work hard and he sees “a lot of me in him”. He has put me in charge of a few significant projects that would look great on a future resume, and has openly told me that I could realistically move into a AVP role in the future at a different FI if I were to get my degree. He feels that I could do the same where I’m at now, but told me it would likely take longer than just moving to a different place. It just feels like he genuinely wants me to succeed. He’s very much a mentor to me.

Well, he also recently told me that he’s working to make me the manager of my department, and that it would come with another $10k pay bump but he’s not certain on specifics. The thing is.. I feel that he keeps moving me up because I’m so good at what I do. And in my opinion, I feel that I am worth closer to $70k, rather than the $60k being floated.

With everything I feel he’s currently doing for me, I do think that I would feel guilty about asking for more. I don’t think I’d be in any position like this if he weren’t putting me in positions to succeed but I also feel like he wouldn’t be giving me the opportunities if I wasn’t doing a great job. 

Should I salary negotiate? I really love my hometown and would love to stay here. A higher salary gives me a better chance of staying. I think I mention that if I do end up negotiating, but what else? 

Would it even be a bad idea to just be honest with him and say, “hey, you are someone I look to as someone I want to model my professional career after. I feel that I am worth 70k in this new role, but I also don’t want to put you in a difficult situation. Is this a reasonable time to negotiate salary?”

Would love feedback as this is all very new to me.","Should I negotiate my salary to $70k for a new managerial role, considering the opportunities my VP is providing me?","The individual is a 26-year-old male who works at a financial institution with approximately $3.5 billion in assets, the largest of its kind in his area. He initially worked part-time at a branch in 2023 but transitioned to a full-time position at headquarters in a back office role that involved reviewing mobile deposits and processing online applications for online banking. 

Upon joining, the department was experiencing instability due to the manager's leave for FMLA and the resignation of a seasoned employee shortly thereafter, following a significant overhaul of the online banking system. By 2024, despite being the newest member, he was promoted to department lead, a role intended to relieve some of the director's responsibilities. This promotion came with a raise from $40k to $50k.

He has developed a strong mentor-mentee relationship with the VP, who admires his work ethic and has recognized his potential for future advancement, even suggesting that with a degree, he could move into an AVP role either within the current institution or at another financial institution. The VP plans to make him the manager of the department, which would include an additional $10k salary increase.

The individual feels he deserves a higher salary (around $70k) based on his performance and contributions, but he is conflicted about negotiating due to his gratitude for the opportunities provided by his VP, believing that his progress is tied to the support he has received.

1j4ku6e,How Are You Growing Your Skills (Without Burning Out)? Seeking Real Experiences!,"Hey, I’ve noticed a lot of us want to level up our careers—maybe pivot into new roles, learn advanced skills, or just feel more confident at work—but we also want to keep our sanity intact. I’m curious how you’re handling this balance.

* **Microlearning** (short bursts of training each day)
* **Group Accountability** (teaming up with peers or coworkers for encouragement)
* **Personal Growth & Reflection** (building your own mini “development plan”)

It’s basically about focusing on what *you* want to achieve professionally (like a new certification or a leadership angle) rather than a one-size-fits-all training plan from above.

1j4kq37,Should I leave a job due to a bad manager?,"
I’m 26F engineer in biotech. My company recently has been having layoffs through all levels of the org. So much so they laid off my manger and made a different person manager of my team + 3 other additional teams (he now manager 25 people) 
I’ve worked with this guy previously and have serious issues with his management style. 
Hes judgement, rude, he purposely tries to catch people in tricks. I’ve been at the company 4 yrs and he has not promoted a single person on his 15 person team since then. I’m worried he’s going to really stop my career growth while driving me crazy.
I’ve been trying to give it a chance but he randomly left for India in January and has not returned to work or spoken to me since his departure. He didn’t delegate any responsibilities to anyone and didn’t give a return date. 

I do really like my day to day work 75% of the time.
I also like my other teammates and mostly enjoy my company. But I’m worried layoffs will also really stop any opportunity for internal growth opportunities or moving to another team. 

I have an offer at another company. I really liked the manager there; the pay is 10% more with similar benefits and the commute is 20 min each way vs my 1 hour each way commute now.
I’m just worried the job role itself isn’t the perfect fit for me and I’m nervous I’m going to choose wrong.

I have tried keep going- my leads are like Spinal Tap drummers. First one basically didn't work, moved teams and got fired. Second one had no idea what our job was or the product, and after I got back from maternity leave, she had been fired.

So they put this other guy on as our lead, and he uses AI for everything, is good at being political- will have these long conversations with us and then put whatever we told him in his AI written posts to claim as his work.

After a company buyout, we lost a team member- and honestly it was just a weird time- the buyout happened twice and I didn't take it because I make a decent salary and have benefits for my family.

I fell behind on a few things because my other teammate had a medical leave so I was pretty much holding it down with my lead. At no point did he tell me I wasn't meeting expectations. 1:1s spent with me explaining things like Agile and demo sites to him.

I go to move teams to try and get out of my funk, cause I am absolutely over my lead's BS- and he blocks my move, excoriates me in feedback I received 2 months late, and gives me zero constructive feedback on how to
improve. He implies that I am not an equal contributor even tho I was literally the only person on the team for over a month.

I have been working my ass off to the point where I have to go to physical therapy for tech neck and am having severe anxiety and depression. I have been nailing every piece of work...and he goes in on me again and says that I haven't improved enough.

I have to take a medican leave now due to my neck. But when I get back I don't know how I am supposed to keep going.

I have applied to a Masters program to switch fields entirely. I am also a mom and my husband's business is finally off the ground, so I could swing being a stay at home mom for awhile- but I just have never not worked.

Beyond that I don't see myself wanting to follow this career path as the trajectory is supposed to take me.

On the flip-side however I potentially have a new opportunity at a much smaller company that I find very exciting. Not only does it pay a lot better but it also is very much in line with my future career goals and in a sector of the industry that is niche and very interesting.

My main hesitation is around job stability. I made some dumb career decisions when I was younger working for a company that was fully commission and got myself into a good amount of credit card debt. Although I have been steadily working to pay off between my bills and rent it very much weighs over me. My worry is taking the new job, the company goes under and I put myself in a hole that may be to massive for me to ever recover from. (so to speak - although maybe a little dramatic)

Either way, I am 24 years old and feel as though now is really the time to take a career risk like this however I don't want to take this chance without throughly weighing out all the possibilities. I would greatly appreciate any and all advice as I am very much torn but leaning more towards the new opportunity. Thank you very much in advance.

1j4iwgt,What should I switch my major/career to?,"Hi all! I've been having this dilemma for a while and I'd to open to hearing outside perspectives/opinions. 

I've also posted this to r/findapath just as a heads-up.

I just completed an associates degree in science from a community college with the intention of transferring to a far away school to become a Registered Dietitian. Unfortunately, I didn't research the field as much as I should have and realized it may not be for me due to the ROI, length of schooling, and the state of the field in general. To be honest, it combined my interests in food, science, and health/fitness, but I feel like I just enjoyed taking classes for it as an interest/hobby rather than actually seeing myself working in the field, which I admit was bad on my end for lack of preparedness.

In addition to the lack of research, this change of heart came recently after a visit to the transfer school, where I was intimidated by living away from home to major in something that would cost time and money when I'm very uncertain about my future in it at this time in my life.

Luckily, there is a nearby state school within 20 minutes from my house that I could transfer to instead, but I'm having serious doubts in what I should major in now.

Important info is that due to my college credits from my degree and high school, I can't be undecided when transferring to the new school and have to declare a major, which adds to my anxiety about this decision. 

Option A: Make the most of the science classes I've already taken and major in Biology/Chemistry/Biochemistry etc. I'm worried about the upper division classes and the saturation of the science field in general nowadays, especially with needing to get a Masters to get sufficient pay. Also worried that this is just the path of least resistance. 

Option B: Make a practical choice and do something in business. I was thinking about accounting because I like Excel and organizing things, which from my understanding seems to fit somewhat well. My brother is currently in accounting and he seems to think I'm capable enough to do it, but I'm apprehensive about committing since the switch from science topics to business might be too drastic a change, and the material may be a bit drier than I'm used to. Con to this is that I will definitely be behind in terms of getting an internship.

Note that these options would likely take me 2.5 years to complete based on my current transcript.

Tentative Option C: Don't go at all and figure out exactly what I want to do before committing. I feel bad about this one because I'm currently not in school right now and taking time off may not be the best when it comes getting back to my study habits and academic mindset. But college is expensive, so I think rushing into this would be a bad idea due to how quickly and recently I changed my mind before.

Not sure if this info about me is needed, but I'll put it in anyway. Currently 20F years old, 4.0 GPA, have 65 college credits, and living with my family. Live in a HCOL area. ROI and job stability are important to me because I'll be paying for school myself and I don't want to go in debt/rely on loans.

Any thoughts would be apreciated!

1j4iljr,"For those of us who TANKED undergrad, what can we do?","Hey yall, I’m in a big career crisis. As of now, I am a 26F, I am working as a case manager for a nonprofit for homelessness prevention. I fucking hate this job. I graduated with my bachelors in psychology in 2023 (7 years!!) with a 2.89 GPA.

To be quite frank, I was violently depressed in undergraduate, and was fully in survival mode. I did a bit of tutoring, worked 3 months as a cognitive trainer, and that’s basically it. I would sleep at 6am and wake up at 2pm generally, I was in a big funk. I’m still in a big funk but all day; 24/7 I am plagued with the thoughts of “If I could just go back to 20….21….22 year old me….HELL EVEN 24 year old me and slap the shit out of her…..” I tanked undergrad, I barely floated by. 

I have no idea what the hell I want to do anymore, all I know is I hate social services and I am trying my ass off to get a job elsewhere. Even if it pays less. I’m interested in potentially health, research psychology, clinical, but to be quite honest, I have NO clue exactly what. My dream would be to be that professor you’d see as a principal investigator in a psych study with a huge research lab. I also could see myself in a laboratory. I could also see myself as an NP. I have no fucking idea wha to do, and for every single think I want to get into, I need more experience. I’m talking even an entry level psych research job, I NEED experience…..where the FUCK am I supposed to get that if my degree is closed?  

I am so cooked from this job and I am so mad, I look at other peoples LinkedIns (around my age 24-28 for example) in the fields I want to be in…..and man….these people REALLY have been building their fucking resume since like 2016 man. Volunteer 2016-2019 here, certification in 2018 there, conference they presented at in 2020, research lab they were in from 2019-2022. Is what I want even a reality? Is it a possibility? I should’ve been building myself from 18-19, and I wasn’t, I was smoking cigs behind the classroom, binge drinking, and stuffing hot Cheetos down for dinner and watching Bojack horseman until 5am…..how I wish I could slap myself. I was just surviving. It’s too late now.


I don’t want to be in social services, I hate this— I love academia, I love science, I love medicine. 

Some dream careers for me for example would be: Laboratory scientist, Psych researcher (ultimate dream), Psychologist, Nurse Practitioner (mental health/aesthetics/hormonal), a Dietitian (makes too little for where I live)….I have no idea what else. Hell. Maybe I’m made for graphic design? Or Physical Therapy? Or maybe I’d be stellar in Public Relations? I have NO clue and nothing is hiring me bc I need 3 years experience in EVERYTHING.

I wanted to share my situation and see if anyone has been through something similar.

I graduated two years ago with degrees in Web & Mobile Development and Creative Computing. Since then, I’ve struggled to find a traditional programming job. Instead, I’ve taken on freelance clients, mostly working with MERN stack, LAMP, and WordPress. But even in freelancing, I often feel like I don’t fully know what I’m doing, which makes me doubt my skills. I never know what should i know and how to practice i feel like i am in a loop of not knowing how much i really know. I graduated also with high grades and considered my self to be relatively good, but not excellent. Now i am too tired to even read a requirement and my brain can't work, it's like i don't brain anymore.  

In my spare time, I work on personal projects like building a NAS due to personal needs, making my own website and sketch ot apps or a couple years ago i got into robotics and started to make self-drawing robots, but none of it really helps me land a job. And since LLMs and GPTs became  available, I find myself writing less and less code—I just prompt, fix, and move on. This makes me feel even more disconnected from the idea of working as a programmer in a company, or be interview ready.

On top of that, I’ve gained 40kg since graduating, and I feel drained. I taught at a university for six months, but it didn’t lead to anything long-term. I thought maybe to do a PhD but got lost and could not find an valuable opportunity. Lately, I’ve been trying to get better at deep learning, but the learning curve feels endless, and I’m too stressed to actually undestand and learn. I also got a math certificate but i feel like i can't reember anything of what i learned and the feeling of ever be good enough to get hired in the field is stronger.

Also the truth is, I’ve always wanted to do graphic design, arts, and music, but I ended up in computer science because it was the only offer at the time when i mover into the country, even though i wanted to pursue a more creative study. I had to pursued this field more out of necessity than outt of passion and not doing it led to move back to my home country, so I just kept pushing forward. Now, after nine years and two degrees, I feel completely lost. I am working in a restaurant to maintain but i feels even worst, crazy hours and I am losing sight of what i am becoming.

Right now, I’m working in a restaurant just to stay afloat, but it’s exhausting, and I feel like I’m losing sight of myself. I’m considering switching to graphic design by taking some courses, but it feels daunting to start over. At the same time, programming doesn’t feel right for me anymore, even though I keep making plans to improve—but I never follow through. I even had an AI-related interview recently, and I couldn't even program a simple MNIST classifier. That really hit me.

Any advice would be really appreciated.

I worked hybrid/remote for 18 years. I am an only child and live a few towns over from my parents (dad has dementia and mom isn't really self-sufficient) but they get some home health aide.  I live in an area that doesn't seem to have many options for jobs.  I was a final candidate in 2 local positions in December and haven't seen any opportunities since then.  I searched Built In for companies in my area that I could cold contact on LinkedIn and there just aren't that many.  No one is biting.  Companies keep pulling out of the area.   I am interviewing for a few job positions a few hours away (near my wife's family) to see if I can work out some kind of hybrid situation and keep my home for long weekends.  Kids are 4 hours south of me (last year of college and married).  I don't forsee them coming back north to us (its very unlikely).   I feel like I am trapped in an awful local job market.  I need to carefully think about my next move(s).  

At age 49, when is my last chance to get in with a company until retirement?   Is now my last chance?   Is a remote job my only option at this point?  6 companies are interviewing me because I am very marketable.  But they are all underpaid or not senior roles.  Sadly, I got turned down today for the remote role that I really wanted (I think bc its not a senior role and they are worried I am going to leave).  So lets play out the following hypothetical....if I do a temporary gig to build up my experience for the next 2 years, how difficult is it going to be find that next big role in 2-3 years when I am in my 50s?  I feel like my only option is to hold out for a remote gig....and its so hard to find and land those with so many people vying for them.

1j4pn1q,Is it worth to optimize task at a work?,"TLDR: Jan optimized pipeline, potentially saving 1000 of hours to the firm. Should Jan publish his findings or be selfish with it?  
  
Story:

Project: A

Team consists of 3 people, Jan(main character), Ana and Dean(Lead). Dean is PHD, Jan is Masters, and Ana is Bachelor. All 3 are working on same project, Dean wrote most of the code. And part of the code which Dean wrote could run up to 120 and not get 100%, more like 95% of results only on test A and no test B. Jan got assigned this run of code with different data but same amount of data. Jan found the issue with the code, fix it and now you can get 100% of results all the time within 15 hours of runtime, on test A and test B. Ana was assigned the same amount of data but different data. Ana run the same code for full amount of 120 hours, using resources of company and her time, didn't even bother to look for issue. This code should be run more then 30-40 times in future.



Project B:

Jan already showcased his skill of optimizing the different pipelines. First time on project B the pipeline took more then 12 hours to run, which would mean that if request came Monday, Tuesday would be done. Jan optimize it so it runs under 3 hours.



Project C:

Second time on project C he showcased his skill was once he took over the code from another colleague Tony. Tony code run for 3 hours for each use case. Jan optimize that to run under minute. That code should be run over 50 times, resulting in saving more then 150 man hours.



Both times he optimized the pipelines all he heard was good job and got a new task right away. 



Jan joined company 2 years ago, didn't get any promotion or significant raises. 

Keep employee Jan in best interest, and be strategic, and leave morals out of this. Employee Jan full year review is in few weeks, but they should already sent out the targets last week, before Jan found a solution for optimizing the biggest pipeline. 

Jan brought up his achievements of project C and project B on last year review, and was told that sometimes he take too long on his tasks, even tho he saved time on both projects by high margin.

Should Jan bring this up, or is it best to keep it to himself since he won't get any benefit from it, and just get more job to do.



Could Jan reach out to his boss with potential optimization in mind. Asking if he can optimize Project A, can he be rewarded. That's kinda like blackmail and could backfire on Jan saying that he should do that in first place.

If Jan shuts up about it Dean could raise some questions because of potential test B results.

1j4ojzw,How many people have seen this ?,"I'm someone who went RIGHT into the trades after highschool (no not trade school but on the job training).     And i FUCKING REGRET IT.    About 10 years later I regret it     I'm 27 now my eyes are shit.       Constantly fighting for a living wage dealing with employers who don't give a shit about you.     And I know that trade school doesn't really help you.    Im speaking as a welder who worked in a ship environment.      Most kids came out of trade school expecting big bucks like these posters say    and what they heard in school  ""you'll make 6 figures"".        They would walk in the door get offered $17 an hour and be mad and hear that EVERYWHERE.     I would then have to teach them all over how to do certain things because trade schools teach you in an ""ideal environment""      especially welding.  

Most of the people that push the trades don't understand the trades at all.      It's always the match teacher or the school counselor.      20 years ago yea when $20 an hour was a FORTUNE but wages haven't really moved.          You can get lucky and find a niche.      Or in a specific area a certain trade may be better off than another.  I hear HVAC tends to pay halfway decent but again that could be a select few.   

A big problem with the trades I think is people keep coming in and expanding to make big bucks get disappointed and still take the low wage because what else are they going to do.  (It really falls on the employers) 

But I'm 27 now.    My eyes are going to shut.    My right eye can't see further than 6 inches from my face and my left eye takes forever to focus on things.        I used my PPE I wore a welding hood (an expensive one as well and at the darkest shade)    I did everything I could to be healthy.    And not destroy my body but it still happened really fast and I have NOTHING to show for it.    


This post is sort of a rant.   Meant to be an education post for the people not in the trades.      And trying to push them. It's almost always someone who ""knows someone"" in the trades  that gets ""good money"" from my experience that's from working 70 hours a week until you drop.        I had a coworker die and they company replaced him in a heartbeat (died of COPD related something or other) because he welded for 60 years.    He couldn't see either. His wife picked him up and dropped him off.    

My main point is don't blindly listen to someone who just says ""go into the trades"" ESPECIALLY if they have an office job.      Talk to people in their field around you or around where you live.        Everything I've seen the people that make the most in the trades have a specific specialty (like welders it's pipeline and underwater welding that makes the good money.    At one point really good tig welders could work in aero space but I don't think that's common anymore with robots.

I received my offer yesterday of $65,000 a year, decent benefits, but it’s consulting which requires me to hit billable hours and potentially ride the bench for a while. I never pictured myself doing consulting and the whole billable hours thing and potentially being let go because they can’t find you work terrifies me. It’s hybrid, mainly remote but depends on the client they assign you, and it’s fairly close to home.

After reading reviews of the company, there is a common theme that there is no room to grow, no raises, no promotions, multiples ceos in 3 years, frequent layoffs (but somehow makes 400 million in revenue?) the people are great but the senior management is said to be terrible. 

Overall, I don’t really want this job, it does not excite me, the people seem great, I can’t complain about the pay when I’m fresh out of college (though I had higher expectations and got paid more as an intern) so do I bother negotiating?

1j4m2im,Hired as part time but scheduled for 55hr? Advise please?,"So I just started my first transitional job (I’ve worked for Uber Eats for a while but this is my first job in a transitional team based setting with managers and whatnot). I started last Thursday and was hired part time as a car detailer. On Tuesday they gave me the day off since it was so slow but I checked the hours I worked from Thursday to Monday and it was 34hr (but for some reason I was scheduled for 45hr). I thought it was because the hours would be split between the weeks when it rolled over to Sunday so even though I was working everyday, Thursday to Saturday would be 21hr and then from Sunday to Tuesday would be 24hr (but since I had that day off I worked 13hr from Sunday)

But my schedule was just updated and I see I go back in tomorrow morning and I’m scheduled for another 55hr over the next 6 days…. Is this normal? This basically has me scheduled for 100hr in 2 weeks of working there

It’s very physically demanding as well. My legs and arms are covered in about 30+ bruises in different stages of healing (that is not an exaggeration either. I am covered in bruises, some very large and painful. My skin is ugly right now from the discoloration). I’m expected to run from point A to B to show customers how hard we are working. 

Several times now I’ve been scheduled to start at 9am but when I show up I’m told to not clock in for another 30min because it’s not busy yet. When I told my fiancé this he said that’s wage theft since they are trying to have me clocked out so they don’t have to pay me for that time even though I’m scheduled for it and they want me available to clock in whenever they are ready for me. But that’s technically having me “on call” and not being paid for this. When I was told to wait to clock in until 9:30, I went home (I live about a 4min drive away) since it was warmer than I expected and had thermals on under my pants. I took the opportunity to go take them off. When I came back a few minutes before 9:30 the assistant manager said he went to come get me to clock in but I wasn’t there and was unhappy about that. So basically they expect me to wait on the premises until they want me to clock in but I’m not being paid to be there. 

Another thing was when I was signing the employee paperwork there was a form talking about how we can get health insurance benefits if we are full time. Then another page to fill out if you qualify but are declining the benefits. I didn’t fill out that page because I didn’t qualify as part time. But when I turned in the paperwork the next day the manager told me to fill it out. I was confused since I don’t qualify but he said he needed it. But now I’m being scheduled for full time hours and since I signed that paperwork they won’t give me benefits since I “declined” them. I feel like that was to screw me over.

I feel like I’m being taken advantage of here. People with more working experience, what are your thoughts on this?

They even told me they wanted to hire me on as a part time artist contractor to work with them until I was ready to reach out about full time work again.  

They told me to contact the art director about onboarding as a contractor, but that’s where things took a turn. The art director never gave me any paper work or gave me any assignments, they just kept responding they would reach out to me if they had any projects that they thought I would be a good fit for. I felt something was off, but I focused on my other job. Then the New Year came and I reached out, letting them know I was ready to prioritize their company and join as a full time team member.

I both regret not accepting the job, but I’m glad I remained at the other company during the holidays because it is a family company and they suffered a devastating loss as the mother and owner of the store unexpectedly passed away.

Seriously, I don't understand these interviews anymore... I'm a VP/Senior Director level in Product Management in tech.

Last month, I had a lot of interviews. I reached advanced rounds in several companies, but it didn't work out for whatever reason.

There was one of them that looked very promising. I reached the final round. They told me it would be on-site and I would meet 6 people.

When I arrived, they put me in a conference room with glass doors in the middle of the office. And then I did 5 Zoom interviews back-to-back without any break. Each one of them was a full hour of interrogation on a different topic. It was very difficult to focus in the fourth one, but I continued and remained professional. I felt that the whole day was one of the best interview performances of my life.

Today I got rejected.

I don't understand what the point of all that was. Since most of them are Zoom calls anyway, why didn't they let me do them at home and take breaks?

I've been looking for a job for 10 months and I need to take a break.

I've done a lot of interviews, but they were all weird in some way. Not one of them was a normal conversation where they ask me typical interview questions. Most of them were like an interrogation and I was asked difficult questions about a specific thing.

Back in December applied for a job at a casino and got to finally interview before I was turned down. I was told that I need just a bit more experience and that they would love to hire me at a different role at the casino. When the position became available, I applied immediately. Within a week they sent me an email saying I needed to take a General Optimism Test. The test is extremely confusing to me.

1j4l1i7,10 Job Search Tips,"Since we are all looking for a job, I wanted to share valuable tips that have helped me in my interviews. Although I haven't landed anything yet, certain aspects of my job search have helped me secure interviews and even advance to third or fourth rounds.

We all know the competition out there is brutal, and the tiniest factor could be a game changer. When it comes to culture fit and personality, please don't try to fake it, just be yourself. Even if you try to mimic others, you'll eventually burn out by not being authentic.

As I say, the right opportunity will find you. Below are the tips and tricks that I'd like to share. You can take them into account based on your specific needs and situation. I discovered some of these helpful questions here, and they led me to the following stages because of their creative nature.

P.S. I target the tech world and the marketing domain.

1. **Avoid using LinkedIn's Easy Apply feature** alone. If you do use it,  you should also apply through the company's official website.
2. **Tailor your resume** carefully for each job posting to include relevant keywords you might have overlooked. Please be sure to put in the effort to make it strong, but never lie about your skills or capabilities, these misrepresentations will become apparent.
3. **For technical and behavioral questions**, you can find plenty of examples here and online, and you can use the STAR method that everyone is familiar with. To improve your responses further, I highly recommend using ChatGPT to help refine your answers, not to invent experiences you don't have, but to articulate your actual experiences more effectively. You can also use ChatGPT to generate thoughtful questions for the hiring manager or recruiter. These questions stood out for me and I am grateful to the Reddit community for sharing them: ***Think about your best day at this company, what happened that made it so great?*** **I*****f you had to describe what you love most about working here in just one word, what would it be***\*\*?\*\* (Additionally, you may add here: ***do you think the whole team would say that?****)* ***If there’s one thing you can change about the company, what would it be and why? What’s one challenge you occasionally or consistently face in your job? What’s different about working here than anywhere else you’ve worked?*** 4.
4. Please do some **research on the company** and its product or service. Based on what you know, you can quickly answer tech questions they may ask you or even provide suggestions or complements on their approach towards creating X. Track the company website updates, social media, podcasts, and news.
5. One of the valuable ideas I've learned is to create a comprehensive record of your career. They call it **a career dump document**. Include everything you've done, such as your projects, successful ideas, feedback you've received, and anything you can remember. This is helpful if you apply to different roles and have difficulty remembering specific examples of your experience. For example, suppose you are a writer but have experience organizing events, etc. This can be particularly helpful when answering behavioral questions like, ""Can you provide an example of when you demonstrated leadership?"" or ""What is a mistake you've made?” By the way, I always prepared success stories and didn't focus on my failed projects.
6. Never underestimate **the power of your portfolio**. Take the time to create an impactful website that showcases your skills. I cannot stress this enough. Include your writing samples, examples of campaigns you have made, and even if you haven't worked on a specific project, share your potential approach and ideas. People appreciate seeing examples of your work, and I believe that PDFs no longer leave a strong impression. There are many website-building platforms available that you can easily use to create your portfolio.
7. You can also **be active on LinkedIn** to create your portfolio. Share posts, insights, and key learnings regularly. Posting and writing is far better than leaving a blank page, even if you have a significant career gap. I have been unemployed for over two years but consistently post updates. By the way, include titles in your header so recruiters can find you easily.
8. **Answering Tell me about yourself**: Please do not repeat your resume, even though you can walk them through it. I usually describe my personality, why I love marketing, what I bring to the table, and even mention my hobbies at the end.
9. I always **write thank you emails**. They are usually short and emphasize what I liked in that conversation. However, when I ask for feedback, it’s usually radio silence, and I am sad I can’t learn from my mistakes because I am being ghosted.
10. One of the most essential pieces of advice I learned is to **take care of your mental and physical health**, especially when you are being ghosted. Do not take it personally; it does take a toll on your mental health, but I try to say I dodged a bullet then because such an attitude is unacceptable. The job search can be very stressful nowadays, so taking breaks, immersing yourself in your favorite hobbies, and going for walks is crucial. An excellent comment I received not long ago emphasized that the best preparation for an interview is to get a good night's sleep beforehand for energy and to eat a nutritious meal before the conversation. Focus on consuming protein, grains, and vegetables, and avoid ultra-processed foods, as sugar can disrupt your nervous system and lead to exhaustion, particularly if your blood sugar levels drop significantly.

Good luck with your job search. I believe we will all land our dream roles eventually!

1j4kxa4,I need help deciding which job to take,"I worked at a tour company for about 8 months until I got into a car accident and had to take 3 months off. When I tried to return, there were no positions available. I eventually found a job at a smoothie shop, where I’ve been working for about two months now.

1j4kdrz,Advice needed,"I need help. Any advice please. So about a year ago I started with this company and they trained me to become a medical assistant to work upstairs with an optometrist while the ophthalmologist are downstairs. I work down there once a week and I HATE IT.  I make $24 an hour with health insurance and retirement. A year in and I’m really struggling and not enjoying being an MA.

I work by myself upstairs with the optometrist which is okay but sometimes she’s very catty and needy.

1j4juzt,I got an interview for a job but just found out I may need to relocate for personal reasons in 6 months - HELP,"I am interviewing for a job that would give me a significant raise but it is listed as hybrid role.  However, my spouse is trying to get into a graduate program.  Her top choices are local in state schools, but we have decided we will move if the only program she gets into is out of state, so she is not denied this opportunity.  Should I bring this up in a job interview and see if they are open to me relocating and working as a remote employee? Or not say anything in case she gets into the local program and it is never an issue.  

For additional context, I am having the second round of 3 interviews at the end of next week.  I would likely get a sign on bonus that I would need to pay back if I quit and I will find out what program she gets into in about 5 weeks.  I also work in a white collar field where in theory I could do the job remote if my employer allowed it.  It would make a huge difference for us moving from 2 incomes to 1 if I got this raise, but it would also be a huge issue if I lost my job because they won't allow me to work remotely if this situation occurred. 

My initial thought was to ask once I am offered the job to avoid the potential of them not hiring me based on this fact.  But I have not ruled out not saying anything or finding a different way to gauge their comfort with remote work.  Another option would be to try and slow play the interview process so If I got a job offer it would be around the time we found out what school she got into.

1j4jp6a,How to ensure I get promoted? Leadership said I was performing in that role but isn’t taking action,"I am at an industry job in a corporate strategy function for a large company. My role is Senior Associate and I want the Manager promotion. I got promoted last year but am still catching up to my level had I not lateraled to a new function (analytics to strategy). I am doing really well at my job since it’s a blend of both. We have two managers. I am blowing the managers out of water with them reporting directly to me for some projects and I often add more value than a lost senior manager on my team as well. I feel like I deserve the manager promotion. Both my supervisor (Director) and skip-level (Chief Strategy Officer) agreed that I was performing at the Manager level but have recently had conflicting points and a changing tone. 

The Director holds me to a much higher standard than the Managers and even admitted to it. He said it’s bad for optics for the rest of the team to promote me so quickly (in just one year). I can see him trying to find faults to justify not promoting me. He keeps pushing that I need higher tenure at the company for a promotion.

The Chief Strategy Officer is dealing with this in a more sophisticated way. He keeps pushing out the conversation saying he needs to see how the business is doing and what his budget is. He has also admitted that I’m performing at that level already and well.

The other tricky component is that I applied to MBA programs and if I get accepted, I will be leaving this job in August and they know this (they wrote my letters of recommendation). 

My question is - how do I get them to promote me? What is an effective way of going about this? Should I be aggressive and share the projects I am leading when other Managers aren’t even doing that? Do I push back on the “faults” they find? ",How do I get my managers to promote me? What is an effective way of going about this?

1j4jiyh,Had been asking for promotion since June 2024 & Feb 2025 I was told no because of mistake,"So, I have been working at this place since November 2022. When I was originally hired I was told I could move up and I could within a year. I was starting as hourly which hated but it’s fine. (No overtime) 

It didn’t happen, and so I waited. 

Got a new manager Feb 2024. I told her in June during my review that I’d like to be promoted. She kept saying she was going to ask her boss. 

A month would go by, I’d ask again, and she’d say she forgot. 

Then she unfortunately found a cancerous nodule so I didn’t ask again Dec-January 30. 

We had a big external surprise audit of submissions to regulatory body. And an internal one that is once a year and it’s supposed to be non punitive. 

At the internal meeting, I was not present and my coworker who does same thing I do but she’s been there 10 years. She kept saying “I can’t remember I didn’t do the submission”

Then the big external audit, looks like when I was submitting closure to something, I missed submitting an important document. This other coworker said “she can’t baby sit and make sure I submit the right document. “ but the unfortunate thing is this was my first  closure that was more complicated, and the only one I did was an easy one with barely any documents. And coworker who has been there 10 years didn’t teach me that, just ASSUMED I’d know. 

So asked manager again about promotion, and now she says due to the many mistakes I made, they think I need to wait 6 months then they can reevaluate if I can get promoted. 

(But then tell me, how manager has to ask my coworker what she thinks I need to work on because she’s not sure…)

So I stopped going on walks with them, because I was worried that the walks were causing me to make mistakes too (get up when I wasn’t at a good stopping point) but I’m sure that looked bad. 

Prior to all this I had been deciding to apply internally to another position on a team that is the one above mine. 

I had been nervous to tell my manager about it, bc I thought she’d be mean. 

Today I told her and she’s like “ I had an inkling this would happen after our meeting.” 😒 & “ I was so ready to work with you and help you improve” and so I responded I was already thinking of applying prior to our meeting and I will happily work hard on anything you give me to improve. Because regardless what you help me with now will help me in any other job in my future. So I do appreciate your help”

But she still seemed annoyed because we’ve had 4 people leave under her. So maybe it’s her problem. But was wondering if you guys thought I handled it wrong.

Thanks!

I even moved across the globe (from Europe to the U.S.) thinking it would improve my chances, but I still can’t land anything.

I have a degree in Biomedical Engineering and a master's in Medical Physics, plus internships in relevant fields (MRI, radiotherapy, biomedical engineering). But despite all of that, the only jobs I’ve managed to get have been completely unrelated—customer support, freight transportation, interpretation, etc (I even tried to take the exams for air traffic controller in Europe because they didn't require any qualifications, they offered the training, and I failed it, God dammit). I feel stuck in this loop where I’m either overqualified (maybe) or don’t have the “right” experience.

And to top it off, I cannot apply for medical physicist roles here because I can't get the certification from their radiology board. I'll have to pursue another master degree or PhD to get certified. 

And the fact that I moved to a new country doesn't help either. I don't know anyone here.

1j4i9le,Finally Found Success After Years of Job Searching!,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my journey because it’s been a long road, and maybe it can give hope to anyone still struggling.

About six years ago, I went through an anoxic brain injury that left me on Disability and government assistance. A few months after my injury, I decided to go to community college and earned my associate’s degree in Business Administration. One of the most useful parts of my coursework was taking a couple of classes on writing resumes and cover letters—having that foundation really helped in the long run.

After graduating, I started applying for jobs, but it wasn’t easy. I was working with a vocational rehabilitation coach who was, to put it bluntly, terrible. She constantly forgot meetings, made mistakes, and had endless excuses. I tried to be patient, but after years of no real progress, I finally had enough and contacted her boss. I honestly wasn’t expecting much since I had complained before with no results, but this time, things changed. Within a week, I had a new coach, and from there, everything started falling into place.

In the past year, I landed a seasonal job as a customer service representative for the winter, which was a great step forward. But even better, I just secured a full-time position as a Customer Service Representative 2! It comes with top-tier health insurance, dental, vision, and a 401(k). The only downside is that the hourly pay is a little lower than my seasonal job, but since it’s full-time, I’ll actually be making more money overall. Both positions are WFH positions.

It’s been a long, frustrating road, but I finally feel like I’m moving forward in my career. If you’re struggling, keep pushing. Advocate for yourself, don’t be afraid to demand better support, and keep applying—success can take time, but it’s worth it.

Wishing you all the best in your job searches!",How can I effectively advocate for myself when seeking better support in my job search?,"The individual experienced an anoxic brain injury about six years ago, which left them on disability and reliant on government assistance. Following the injury, they pursued higher education by attending community college, where they earned an associate's degree in Business Administration.

In their job search after graduation, they encountered challenges, particularly with a vocational rehabilitation coach who was ineffective, which added to their frustration. After a prolonged period of no progress with this coach, they escalated their concerns to her supervisor, which resulted in being assigned a new coach. This change proved beneficial, leading to a more successful job search.

Recently, the individual secured a seasonal customer service representative position, and subsequently obtained a full-time role as a Customer Service Representative 2, which offers comprehensive benefits such as health insurance, dental, vision, and a 401(k), although with slightly lower hourly pay compared to the seasonal job.

1j4he0m,"Left out at work, losing my mind. help!","
30/F. I have lived in Italy for 5 years and worked in my current company for 2,5 years. On my first day in the office, I met with my colleagues however, they did not initiate any conversation except a cold ""welcome"". I had worked alone (my old position was not sociable) for 2 years and nothing changed. I was not invited to the lunch or breaks for smoking (I am a smoker also, they know that!) and instead, when I see that they are preparing to go, I ask them, ""oh, you are going for lunch/smoking? I am coming too!"" like a looser... Because I wanted to try, I did not want to isolate myself. I tried my best to open conversations, even on nonsense topics. Maybe I seemed awkward, I do not know... My manager acted better, but again, from a distance... He is closer with the team, tho.

Then, my position was closed. My manager asked me if I would consider a new position. He also added that I am quiet and passive, but everyone deserves a chance. I answered yes, of course. With the new position, I would improve and collaborate with the team. However I just had 3-4 basic sessions of my new position, and when I asked questions to one of the colleagues, he told me ""how you do not know this? what will we do with you? i cannot believe!"", and when asked my manager how to do it, he explained with 2-3 sentences, as I know everything! My old position was a completely different and passive role!

When I try to do something, I am judged as not knowing the business terms. How should I know?! It is also an entry-level position, and no one taught me anything- no shadowing, no mentoring, nothing! Also, one of my colleagues told me that no one teaches job; I have to learn myself (but how) I don't want to work because of this, I can't work anyway. I turn on the computer and mostly don't do anything, and no one says anything to me except for the meetings. I talk nonsense in performance meetings, I try to say something.

I feel like a ghost. As I have lived abroad, my psychology is down. Now at my job, I still try to do something, but I am sure I seem and also I feel awkward, stupid, weird, and depressed. mentally disabled and socially awkward.

Since I've started, 2-3 colleagues started after me, but they were accepted by the people. Because they make jokes, they are not sensitive or calm like me, but rather, confident, funny, and outgoing people.

I should add that no one tells me what I am doing. I mean, if I do not do anything, it's also okay. But I do not feel comfortable because I am a responsible person. I am looking for a job to jump, but I cannot find one. I have some interviews tho, I have it will be alright anyway; otherwise, I will be crazy. I regret that I accepted the new position because I thought that it was because my old position was generally passive.

And now, my manager acts careless, answers my questions with 1-2 words, that's all. I think he is disappointed because he was right.

I asked myself if it was my mistake or not. I do not know. But I criticize myself too much.

I should also add that I have fought with social phobia since my childhood. However, I overcame this situation by socializing, and I got better. I had also used fake it until make it technique too. This workplace seems to have destroyed all the social skills I had acquired and the social phobia I had fought. Now, I am lost, and I do not know what to do. :(

It started off pretty well, I nailed most of the technical questions, honestly most of them were basic first/second year level stuff, one of them was tough though, and I didn't know how to do it right away but I eventually got to the correct answer. After that, we ended up talking about the job, and also about him. He seemed pretty chill, we were talking about hobbies, and he says he loves video games. I was like cool, what games you play? He says he mostly players counter strike. I was like cool I play CS as well. Big mistake.

He then goes on to ask, do I play faceit? What rank am I? How often do I play? I said man I don't play much maybe one or two games a week. He was like okay whats your faceit rank. I told him I was level 9. Then he starts laughing and he was like I'm nearly 3000 elo. I responded, cool man you are really good at the game. And he starts giving me tips, says he has a daily 90 minute practice routine. I told him thats great but I don't have much free time and I don't really wanna spend all of it practicing counter strike.

1j4gbus,Eternity Interview,"I lost my job due to “position elimination” almost a year ago.  In fact I find out the old company is doing very poorly, unfortunately (but fortunately it confirms that it wasn’t performance related).  Director level.  I have been on a mad search since with very little response - something I have seen from job searchers across many platforms.  

I land a solid interview in December - initial HR screen, then a few days later the HR Director, then about a week after that the CEO.  CEO tells me while we are on the call that he is “excited to have me in” for an in-person interview after the holidays, so I’m feeling pretty good.  

Into the first/second week of January and I haven’t heard back so I reach out to the HR generalist with an inquiry - told that the position is temporarily on hold while they complete budgets for the year and that they will get back to me by the first week of February to schedule my in-person interview.  Well the last day of January I see they reposted the position on LinkedIn, so I start to worry.  Reach out to HR again and ask and they said yes, I am still in the running but they wanted to “survey the candidate pool”, and will follow up shortly.  Ok, not the best news but I get it.  

They do finally get back to me about 1.5 weeks later and say they DO want me to come in, fast-paced, round robin interview with VP Sales, CFO, VP Finance, CEO again, and HR again.  This was about a week and a half ago now.  Went in, felt like I did the best of my ability and left feeling good about my chances.  HR said they would follow up by the end of last week or the beginning of this week, even got a nice note back from the CEO (from my thank you email) stating he was pleased with my background/abilities.

Fast forward to today and we are past their “deadline” for getting back to me IMO.  They also have not reached out to any of my references.  Starting to think the worst here - but maybe I’m worrying too much.  Figured I would reach out to HR tomorrow for an update, but curious if anyone here has experienced these extremely long interview processes, and if I could get some feedback on experiences - should I suck it up and move on?

What’s making it even more frustrating is that some of these were internships. Yes, internships!

It’s honestly baffling. Like, how do I not qualify for something that’s supposed to be entry-level? I’ve been applying to both full-time and part-time positions too, but getting turned down for internships just hits differently. It’s hard not to take it personally—like, am I not good enough?

1j4g010,Any tips on next step after I spoke with recruiter but he isnt messaging back?,"Hi,

Wanted to get an opinion about interaction with a recruiter I recently had.

I applied for a job a few weeks back and within a week got a call from a recruiter to chat about a job for Software Engineering. During our chat he asked me my experience and what the position was looking for. It was a great chat and the recruiter told me that he wanted to try and get me the job as he had preference in getting someone who already lived in the city of the position because espeically in this economy he has had cases of people willing to relocate but then go back on it the second they get an offer in their current city of residence.

I thought it was great and felt like I had a good shot at it. One of the questions he asked it seemed he didnt understand how to ask it so I gave him an answer based off what I thought he was looking for. After our initial meeting (on a friday) he stated i should hear back by middle of the following week (last week). On sunday I check a few emails and he sent me an email on saturday night. He stated I got rejected because of that question and me not having the experience in that area. The thing is I do but the question was stated differently. The recruiter admitted his mistake and asked I send a 1 paragraph response stating my experience, which I did. I sent in the response immediately that sunday. I heard nothing for a few days so I decided to send a quick email on Tuesday just to make sure he received it. Still nothing then I responded again on friday since it was past the date that I was told Id get an official response. Still nothing, until two days ago (Monday) I got a response and he just said ""sorry for the delay, i should know by tomorrow (Tuesday) at the latest."" I had a pretty busy day that tuesday so I didnt reach out but this morning I decided to reach out again. Still have not gotten anything back.

Should I just assume this job isnt going to work out? Ive been unemployed for two months and this is the best thing I currently have so far which is why im worried.

1j4fwn0,Illegal but Favored,"Help! So the company I work for is a franchise and the CEO favors the branch I'm in particularly because of the owners. I will try to be as vague about the company as possible because I don't know who there gets on here. But, over the past few months I've been here, I've noticed a lot of things that could get the store I work at in serious legal troubles. Like, health and financial trouble.I will state that I live in Texas and I'm well aware that it is an at will state, but I am also aware that it still has protections in place for employees through the labor board and health organization. 
So, back on track. This branch has this thing where they require all employees to respond and interact on a business messaging app (like Google teams), before their next shift. Which would be working on the clock since they pay hourly not salary. And there are a *lot* of messages throughout the day, everyday. Asking for this is illegal since there is not compensation for unpaid time off the clock. I'm talking fifteen messages throughout the day, and maybe one message every month is a genuine critical message about meetings and such. The rest is simply, 'make sure you do this right'. It's bonkers, and there's no communication outside of these messages in person after that. But that's a whole other ball game. 
I also just recently found out that the 'work interviews' they do are also SUPER illegal. IRS kind of illegal. Because they do not pay for these people for the work they do during this interview. Which is also a safety hazard given my job handles 40lbs+ of items and sharp objects like needles. There is also the problem of having them work with hired employees among customers without any formal background check done. 
Another part of health concerns is the lack of concern with handling the previous said heavy equipment. It's often expected for employees to get these items down from a ladder by themselves. Think the equivalent of the weight and size of a solid metal children's wagon. Am I just overthinking this stuff or is this an honest concern to have? And what should I do in this situation? The job field in my town is not great and I've been looking for another job since I got hired to this one. I only took it to have a job since my last one made cuts to their company, and I can suffer through till I get another but it's really starting to effect my mental health.

1j4fk52,"Recruiters in India, real or fake? Worth my time?","I'm trying really hard not to generalize people in India, but some things have been happening that are starting to make me wonder if I'm talking to fake recruiters. 

I'm getting more and more calls from recruiters that are very obviously in India.  I've had probably 10 in the last 4 months of my job search, and not a single one has resulted in anything.

The main reason I'm wondering is the amount of scam calls and pig butcher attempts I've been receiving has been off the charts over the last month. In addition, the scam calls usually call me by my name now and today, I had 3 different pig butcher attempts address me by name today alone. I know this can be a coincidence, it's not difficult to get caller ID info, but I'm starting to get suspicious. It sucks even more because I feel I need to answer because I'm trying to get a new job and recruiters have texted me in the past.

I'm addition, I'm wondering if they're even worth my time. 90% of them have no clue what they're talking about. For example, let's say I work on cars and the job wants someone with experience repairing cars.  If my resume says, 5 years as Toyota Mechanic and 7 years as Honda mechanic, it's pretty clear I know cars. These guys are calling me and saying ""your resume doesn't say that you work on cars.""

Are companies really using these guys or are they just harvesting data to sell to scammers and pig butchers?  One asked me for the last 5 of my Social and I left it blank and he never responded. 

I'm kind of getting to the point where I feel like if a company is using recruiters from India, I don't want to work for them, but I also realize they may not be aware they are.","Are companies really using recruiters in India, or are they just harvesting data to sell to scammers?","The individual is currently in a job search and has had a work history as a mechanic, specifically mentioning 5 years of experience as a Toyota mechanic and 7 years as a Honda mechanic.
