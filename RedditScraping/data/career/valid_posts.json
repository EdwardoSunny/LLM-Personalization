With these clients, I have made 300k in these 4 months. I was freelancing even when I was working in the company. I took the decision of quitting job and doing freelancing as this company was not giving hike to anyone since last 2-3 years. Also, I wanted to something of my own and accelerate my career. I made 200k in first 2 months and rest 100k in the last 2 months. I mean last 2 months was kind of dry. So I got tempted to search for jobs paying 60-70lpa. But I see most of the HRs ready to come at 35lpa and it would be hybrid model. I am kinda confused whether to go back to full-time job which pays 35lpa(a decent money, not the expected) and then work on a building a product of my own side by side or continue working as a freelancer, scale it meanwhile if good product idea clicks to mind and work on building it. I have savings for next 1 year, but my family is worried about me and pressurising me as I am not working as a full time employee and this is creating more confusions in my mind. Should I go back to full-time job? Or keep freelancing ? Can anyone guide me how I can get find new legit clients ? I am on upwork, but I feel it is crowded. Fiverr is even worse than upwork. In case of reaching out startups directly on linkedin, I felt they look for agencies than individuals.",

The most fulfilling aspects were the technical and numerical ones, but these were few, and I came to feel that I was pursuing a humanities degree within the biosciences.\u200b\n\n**Post-Graduation Experience:**\n\n* After graduation, I applied for associate consulting roles at various clinical research organizations but rarely heard back. My peers have corroborated this by also struggling and the sentiment is that chances are very slim for entry-level positions without further qualifications, existing professional experience, or networking connections.\u200b\n* My relevant academic experience includes a statistics module, a mathematical modeling module, and analysis of lab results. I have experience with Excel, Prism Graphing, and some elementary calculus and statistics.\u200b\n* Notably, I undertook an informal project with my neurologist, where I was tasked with forming a mathematical model for the EEG spike waves presented by patients experiencing absence seizures, aiming to infer aspects of the neurophysiology of time perception. This also familiarized me with MATLAB and Origin.\u200b\n* Over the past seven years, I've had various service jobs and currently work as an after-school science club teacher.\u200b\n\n**Current Pursuits and Questions:**\n\n* I'm aiming to transition into a more technical role and am considering whether pursuing a master's in data science is feasible and reasonable compared to online courses and continued job applications.\u200b\n* Data science appeals to me due to its relevance to the biosciences. Over the past year, I've been enhancing my tech skills by learning Python, SQL, and the basics of computer science.\u200b\n* My options for master's programs are limited due to a lack of relevant experience and qualifications, with 'The International University of Applied Sciences in Berlin' being a potential option.\u200b\n\n**Seeking Advice On:**\n\n* Am I being too naive in my approach?\u200b\n* What is the best course of action to transition into a data analyst role in the healthcare/clinical research sector?\u200b\n* Where should I look for positions and qualifications?\u200b\n* My underlying drive has long been in combating substance abuse as a public health issue, and the single best and most fulfilling piece of work I produced in my 3 years was a probabilistic feasibility assessment for developing novel compound methocinnamox as a rescue treatment for opioid overdose and a long-term therapy for opioid use disorder. How can I align this interest with a suitable position?\u200b\n\nAny advice is really appreciated. Please let me know if any points above need clarification or should be restructured. Thank you.",

I was just offered a new role and I have no idea if I should accept it. I have a few days to decide. \n\nCurrent Role - Client Side Project Manager\n\nI currently work in a federal department as a client side project manager in healthcare standards. \n\nThe role is a mix of large scale national initiatives, strategies and smaller capital projects. \n\nPros\n\nIt\u2019s meaningful work as I feel like everything I work on translates to improvement\u2019s for patients long term, which makes me feel good about my job. \n\nI know the department and federal services well, and it\u2019s a comfortable environment. \n\nMy current department is flexible and understanding with my chronic illness (It\u2019s the deliverables that matter, and that they are delivered on time).\n\nCons\n\nThe workload can be very significant for infrequent periods (50h+ weeks) and as a client side PM there are parts I don\u2019t get the full project remit for. This makes it difficult to form a career portfolio for advancement and I lack experience in those areas. \n\nThere are also less and less opportunities to learn new skills as I have been in the role for 3 or so years. \n\nCurrent Salary\n\nEarly six figures. \n\nProposed New Role - Project Manager \n\nI was offered a 12 month contract (extension likely) as a Capital Works Project Manager with a portfolio in technical infrastructure (Engineering, IT). The role is in an adjacent department to my current one.  \n\nProposed Salary\n\nMid six figures (Significant increase, especially with costs of living). \n\nPros\n\nThere will be lots to learn and room for growth. Engineering and IT is an area I have wanted to move into for a while due to the flexibility these projects can bring. \n\nCons\n\nThe scope of the work is very defined, contained and linear project work. Think cell tower or power line refurbishment.\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nBase degree in sciences and engineering. \n\nI have a chronic illness that significantly  limits me physically and can impact me mentally (severe depression) so stability and job self worth is important. I am currently in treatment and it\u2019s expected to improve in the 18 months (Not looking for sympathy). \n\nI am concerned about not feeling like I am doing meaningful work and that the new role could feel very limited in comparison. \n\nI am concerned both about the new departments flexibility even through it has reassured me, it doesn\u2019t always work out in practice. \n\nI would be leaving a permanent appointment for a fixed term contract. Always a concern with a limiting chronic illness. \n\nThere are no opportunities for advancement in my current department, it just went through a restructuring.\n\nThis would give me the ability to create a detailed project portfolio for career advancement. \n\nAs I work with the adjacent department, any rejection would have to be delicate to avoid burning bridges. \n\nSo what are your thoughts? Is it worth the money and opportunities for the risks? Or better to focus on stability at the moment? ",

Not sure what to do.\n\nTo preface, im 22 years old and i\u2019ll be honest, i\u2019ve wasted a majority of my life doing nothing but staying inside and playing video games. I have not experienced much in life aside from wasting tons of money going for a degree i didn\u2019t want / need, working jobs that absolutely killed my mental and physical health, and overall feeling like i don\u2019t really have a purpose. \n\nI just landed my first \u201cprofessional\u201d job so to speak, and it is scaring the life out of me. Before, I was working in a factory, then working as a car detailer, and they were bullshit jobs just to help me get by and pay off student loans. I could quit these jobs whenever I wanted. This new job is something that I have family ties in and it is not something where I can just up and leave without making some of my family members look really bad and disappointing a lot of people.\n\nAnyway, I guess where im getting with all of this is that I feel like the jobs in my past or even the job im starting soon make me feel like im making the wrong choices. If money was not a factor, I would quit and go buy a camera tomorrow to start a career in sports / general cinematography, but i have no experience in that and with me starting this new job, it almost guarantees that i\u2019ll never be able to accomplish that as i wont have the free time anymore to do so. I\u2019m scared that im never going to have the experiences that i want to experience in life and that i\u2019m now putting myself in a position where i\u2019ll never be able to chase my dreams. \n\nAm i just panicking for no reason or should i jump ship and start doing what I think would fulfill my life even though i dont know where to start? Would this be a detrimental decision to quit sales before i even start to go TRY to be a cinematographer? \n\nIf you read this entire thing and decided to give me some advice, thank you.",

My uncle recently opened a workshop which is booming and he is a great mechanic have been in the industry for 20+ years now so a really senior guy, I've wanting to ask him to hire as an apprentice or intern just to teach me how to work with cars and all since this is something I want to do and I think I'll enjoy this maybe I could be wrong idk. The problem is he is in a different country and I'm in a different, will it be a wise decision to leave my comfy life and risk it all for this. In my opinion maybe I could be wrong, I think you get to live once so why not enjoy it while you can because I don't want to regret that why I never took that decision when I'll be on my deathbed.\n\nPS.

I have no idea what I want to do with my degree.\n\nI'm studying in France, and I'm not even sure if the degree is equivalent to the American ones. Our curriculum covers a lot: American and British civilization (which includes social and demographic trends, history, politics, economics, and culture), American and British literature, grammar, phonetics, discourse analysis, oral expression classes, etc. I don't really love it because I'm not learning a lot, and I get bored.\n\nHonestly, I chose this degree because I had to go to college and had no idea what I wanted to do. My thought process was basically: \"You like history, you like reading, you like debates, and critical thinking \u2014 even when watching shows. So why not?\"\n\nIt's been five years, and I still can't figure out what the hell I want to do with my life. I genuinely have the ambition and the need to know what I want and excel in it. I value storytelling (but I'm not a writer), advocacy, justice, practicality, individuality, and personal fulfillment.\n\nBut I'm also chronically ill, so I have to choose a job that'll grant me financial stability. That's why I thought about doing a BS in Nursing right after my English BA, and the upside would be that I could help people as well. Every day would be different, and I could afford to support myself. Maybe I'd finally get to settle down in New York (I know it's clich\u00e9, but I really do love the city). However, I still have this fear of not being that carefree and creative person.\n\nIt's just frustrating. Time feels like it's running out. I've been thinking about this for years, and honestly, it's kind of tiring.\n\nThank you for bearing with me. Any piece of advice would be greatly appreciated :)",

Additionally to this, in the past years there have been people reporting on the high percentage of discrimination, verbal abuse and bullying going on in architecture offices worldwide\n\n\nI've been on sick leave for burnout since 2months ago now and it has been really hard for me to grab myself on to something to build my confidence again and think of going back to work as I feel I'm good for nothing (I know this is ridiculous because I received honors and recognitions when studying, but my work life has been a different story). \nDuring this time I've been considering shifting into illustration and visual design which is something I've loved since I was 12y.o.

I completed my BTech in Computer Science with around 64% and worked at HCL Tech for a few years before transitioning to government exam preparation. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t make the cut after 3 years of trying.  \n  \nEventually, I gave the GATE exam, studied for about 3-4 months, and got a decent score that helped me get into IIIT for my MTech. I completed it with an 8.5 CGPA, which is good but not outstanding. After that, I joined a startup, worked for about 4 years, and eventually got laid off when the company shut down. During my career, I\u2019ve contributed to open-source projects and was mentored by a\u00a0 guy who\u2019s a maintainer of a well-known cloud native\u00a0 project and also from Stanford. This has made me seriously consider pursuing a Master's degree from top schools like MIT or Stanford.  \n  \nThe challenge I'm facing now is that I feel I have a low academic record with my undergrad percentage and grades (10th: 70%, 12th: 70%) and 4 years spent at a relatively unknown startup. I\u2019m not getting good job offers right now and am considering taking the plunge into a more structured, prestigious environment like Stanford or MIT to build a more stable and impactful career. As far money is concerned , unfortunately , being the eldest son of old age parents i had to build the home and put necessary amenities in it and give regula rmoney to parents to sustain , hence i have no savings whatsoever. I am broke.  \n  \nSo my question is:  \nGiven my background and non-traditional career path, what would be the best way to prepare for and increase my chances of getting into an MS program in Computer Science at top-tier schools like MIT or Stanford? Should I focus more on building up my profile through projects, research, or other areas? And any advice on how to present my experiences and credentials in a strong way despite the low academic scores?  \n  \nWould love to hear your thoughts and any advice from those who have had similar experiences or know the best way to approach this!Background: BTech in CS (64%), worked at HCL Tech for 3 years, quit to prep for govt exams (unsuccessfully), then cracked GATE, did MTech at IIIT (8.5 CGPA).  \nWork: Spent 4 years at a startup (now closed) and contributed to\u00a0a cloud native\u00a0open-source projects. Met a Stanford grauated maintainer who inspired me.  \nCurrent Situation: Laid off, struggling to land good roles, and considering a top-tier MS to stabilize my career. My Challenges:  \n  \nLow academic scores (BTech: 64%, 10th/12th: \\~70%).  \nAge: 40 hence\u00a0 Worried about bias against older applicants.  \nStartup experience at a lesser-known (now-defunct) company.Literal Broke : no savings.",

        "content": "I'm a 21F and I've completed my Bachelor's in Physics last year. I don't like maths. I've hated it since 2nd grade. After 10th I was adamant to pursue arts especially psychology and everyone knew I was gng to do that but I went for career counselling and the counsellor told me I'm good at maths and I'm just avoiding it. So she told me to take Science. It was all gng fine until COVID and 12th grade. I sucked at it. I couldn't do the online classes and my grades went down I started cheating my way through. After 12th I still did career counselling because I was confused and I wanted to see if there are any options other than psychology. I was told to pursue Statistics. I tried that but I couldn't secure a seat through merit and hence I had to continue with Physics. I forced my parents to let me take a gap year to figure everything out. My mom was not happy at all. I also started therapy (my therapist told me I need to get checked for ADHD). I decided to take the career matter in my hands and chose LAW all by my self. I gave CLAT but my mom wanted me to do MBA and she was very angry when I told her I couldn't fill the form because the date was gone. I've done a corporate law course, human rights law course and a distance learning psychology course. The psychology professor told me I have high visual aesthetic fine motor skills and I should choose a creative field. Everyone who knows me has said that. They all want me to pursue something in arts because I'm very good at that. I don't know what to do because I have information overload and no practical knowledge. My mom is very strict that I find the correct career field for myself this year itself or she'll throw me out. Not that it's a big issue but it's very hard to concentrate when you have parents like mine. She keeps saying I'm wasting my time not doing anything at all and I'm not successful like my peers and I'm also wasting their money by being home. My genuine goal in life is to be independent, buy my own stuff, live at my own place and do everything on my own without any interference. I really want to do something that I'll enjoy and I won't get bored halfway. I also want to move out because I can't deal with the toxicity and feeling stuck and delayed all the time. (if you read this and you think you know me IRL please ignore it I'm gng through a hard time dealing with all this and mental issues lmao) ",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I hope you\u2019re all doing well. I\u2019m a 26 year old male who recently completed an MSc in Finance from a mid-ranked university in the UK. While I had offers from better high ranked universities, I chose my current university due to financial constraints, as taking on a large education loan felt like too big of a risk. Although this decision made sense at the time, I sometimes wonder if graduating from a top-tier university would have significantly improved my job prospects.\n\nI finished my course in February 2025 and have since had interviews with a few middle-market investment banks and smaller firms. As an international student, my visa is valid until June, after which I\u2019ll need to apply for the graduate visa. I recently returned to my home country for a break, partly because I didn\u2019t want to overburden myself with part-time work just to cover my expenses.\n\nNow, I\u2019m at a crossroads. I have a couple of job offers in India, and in terms of purchasing power parity, they equate to roughly \u00a330,000 in the UK. Since I wouldn\u2019t have to pay rent or major expenses, it would allow me to save significantly. I\u2019m starting to lean toward accepting an offer in India, but the thought of completely giving up on London is unsettling. A part of me still wants to stay in the UK for another year and keep trying for roles in investment banking or corporate finance.\n\nI\u2019ve been actively applying for jobs in my field but haven\u2019t considered roles outside my domain. At times, I feel like my degree hasn\u2019t added much value, making me question whether studying in the UK was worth it. On top of this, I\u2019m also pursuing the CFA and preparing for my Level 2 exam in August.\n\nI\u2019m really struggling with this decision, should I stay in the UK and keep trying, or should I move back to India and build my career here? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!",

Big salary right out of college (~80,000) and great benefits with work from home; in a niche(ish) industry at the age of 25 (Certs in multiple business technologies and 3 degrees). I don\u2019t know much about the industry still and frankly I don\u2019t know if I want to.\n\nI\u2019m bottom bitch right now, take on the grunt work as expected (I get it, new guy); but I have 6 years of management, inventory, and overall business experience as I worked full time through high-school and college, working up to a director position within a medium size company. I also applied my experience to clubs while I was in college, growing them exponentially and setting up process where they still today are growing to new highs.\n\nThis change to \u201cgrunt\u201d status has really caused my confidence to fall drastically as well as my drive to work; especially considering everyone in the company is tenured and promotions are looking to be YEARS out unless something crazy happens. I just can\u2019t keep sitting at a computer screen all day everyday doing my base job and taking requests from everyone under the sun; while getting asked to do more and more and more, it is driving me absolutely nuts. And I can\u2019t bring it up to my manager because he will just shrug it off and push me harder, I can\u2019t talk to his boss about it because he will tell me to take it up with my manager, and I can\u2019t tell my bosses boss about it in fear that I will just look like a lazy young kid trying to get his top guys in trouble.\n\nOn top of that, I\u2019m one of the only people in the company without a science degree and I\u2019m the youngest by 10+ years, so I feel out of place at times; my coworkers are great people and great conversationalist but for some reason I feel I don\u2019t fit in.\n\nI have been here for about 8 months now and I really don\u2019t know if I want to do this anymore, but I also feel I\u2019m stuck between a rock and a hard place as I have no savings because of student loans and don\u2019t think I will find a job with pay and benefits as good as this one. I also have a wife who is not willing to move away from where we are in the northern United States so I am super limited on opportunities. Maybe this is a vent session or maybe this is me asking for any ideas or guidance, at the end of the day I hate it the way it is right now but I don\u2019t see a way out. I always saw myself as a salesman, a business owner, or even a business manager for another company; but this? This is not what I expected nor is it what I want to do for the next 3+ years.

I am not seeking pity, i am seeking everyone's brutally honest opinion and what you would do if you were in my shoes. I am a 24 year old man, living in North Dakota, USA. I dropped out of high school at 15 years old and got my GED the same year. My girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months and she is a school teacher, while i have a been a wrench monkey in the oilfield since I turned 18. But upon her showing me her college, sharing all her experiences with me, all the good memories and great friends she made and still has to this day, its really inspired me to look into going back to school. I dropped out in 9th grade, got my GED, however I have not attended any sort of schooling for 9 years now. I would like to clarify that I do not lack to the intelligence or drive to be more smart, but the know how and the experience. Over the last 9 years of working I have almost always had at least some type of manager position in almost every job I had, previously having been a field supervisor for a housing company for 2 years. That being said before I dropped out, I always wanted to be a lawyer, specifically study corporate law. I understand it would take roughly 8 years of college, with the last 4 i have to attend campus for and cannot do online. However I would still need to have a full time job to support the girlfriend and myself as we live together and I have a 5 year old daughter who I will now be taking care of in the summer time when she is out of school and must still support in the form of child support while I do not have her. I desperately want to do more with my life than be a wrench monkey for the rest of my life, as well as show my daughter that you can fix your life no matter how bad you messed previously.

If I don't get a job in IT now which starts low around 22k mark I won't be on track to be on a 30-40k salary by next year. It's important I achieve this asap because my girlfriend is 26 and in our culture, women are taught to get married and have your first child by at least 30. I am worried at how I'll get this dream of mine to happen. I work at Tesco now and have this goal to get into IT. Save 10k, marry my girlfriend and rent a flat together. I feel like I have delayed her life because she's now waiting on me and the sad thing is I don't and can't tell for certain how soon I will land a IT job and when it will start to set off and where I'll be earning a decent living. By 35? If so then I feel like I have failed because then my girlfriend will be 32 and we won't have time to go holiday and enjoy marriage because she'd feel she needs to have children. Due to that age. I'm stuck and hopeless and have told her many times that I feel sorry for her for being with a person like me that's so behind in life. At the same time I'm desperate for this next chapter in my life because living at home with my siblings is hard. We always argue and there isn't enough space in the house. I don't see how I will ever be happy because it feels like I will be old by the time I get a an IT job that pays enough for me to be able to get married comfortably and if it takes too long then it means my girlfriend and me will just have to start having kids straight away and won't have time to enjoy ourselves as couples. I'm going mad and I feel depressed at even being so behind in life and that someone I love is waiting for me.

        "content": "I know the title sounds dramatic but let me explain why it's true.\n\nI've spent 4 years in SaaS sales jobs hoping it'd bring me wealth but it never and I also have left that career path due to me not simply liking it. It burnt me out. I had a divorce at 26 and now I'm 28, turning 29 in July. I'm desperately in search for a junior IT support role so I can begin the promisisng career path that IT has to offer. If I don't get a job in IT now which starts low around 22k mark I won't be on track to be on a 30-40k salary by next year. It's important I achieve this asap because my girlfriend is 26 and in our culture, women are taught to get married and have your first child by at least 30. I am worried at how I'll get this dream of mine to happen. I work at Tesco now and have this goal to get into IT. Save 10k, marry my girlfriend and rent a flat together. I feel like I have delayed her life because she's now waiting on me and the sad thing is I don't and can't tell for certain how soon I will land a IT job and when it will start to set off and where I'll be earning a decent living. By 35? If so then I feel like I have failed because then my girlfriend will be 32 and we won't have time to go holiday and enjoy marriage because she'd feel she needs to have children. Due to that age. I'm stuck and hopeless and have told her many times that I feel sorry for her for being with a person like me that's so behind in life. At the same time I'm desperate for this next chapter in my life because living at home with my siblings is hard. We always argue and there isn't enough space in the house. I don't see how I will ever be happy because it feels like I will be old by the time I get a an IT job that pays enough for me to be able to get married comfortably and if it takes too long then it means my girlfriend and me will just have to start having kids straight away and won't have time to enjoy ourselves as couples. I'm going mad and I feel depressed at even being so behind in life and that someone I love is waiting for me. She is happy to marry me even whilst I have a small salary but my point is where is the fun in that? We won't be able to do fun things couples do together in marriage like go on holidays etc. I will just be a bit tight living human.

I have been working since I was 17 years old managing restaurants then Covid hit so I managed an auto body shop for a year then I moved states, I worked at a factory for a year then went back to restaurant work for a year and a half before lending a sales job. I did that for about 8 months. That was December 2024 \n\nLife has been kind of crazy since December. I started a job doing solar sales in December, but after three weeks, the brand new company shut down since their office in my city was not making enough money then I was unemployed till the beginning of March where I got hired for an account  management position, but since I was not enthusiastic enough, and because I was tired at work because of the new schedule I got let go. \n\nCurrently been a week since the let go and I just feel a bit lost, last year around the same time I was unemployed for about two months before I got that sales position.\n\nI\u2019ve started to realize especially after leaving fast food in 2023 that since I have the privilege of living with my parents I work these jobs for experience but as soon as it starts to feel pointless; ex: no growth, stagnant promotions and no future. My work ethic goes down the toilet and I start showing up late, doing the bare minimum and only coming in for the money. This has caused me to constantly switch jobs every 6 months to a year which does not look good on a resume \n\nI don\u2019t know how to change my behavior, but I have been going to therapy so I\u2019m definitely going to talk to him about that. \n\nMy question is, I\u2019ve decided to start a bachelors degree online since WGU informed me that I could get it done within 19 months. I feel like it\u2019s a good use of my time since I\u2019m  going to spend another two months just aimlessly applying for a job anyway might as well use some of that time to get a degree done that will hopefully open more doors. \n\nSo should I carve out a schedule to apply for jobs and go to school or just stop applying and focus solely on school ? \n\nThank you, sorry for the long post. Feeling kind of lost and since I\u2019m realizing that I have this bad habit of giving up on jobs I don\u2019t really know what to do or where to go from here. I am thinking of just going back to retail or fast food, which I think is gonna be the same cycle again. I Would love some advice. \n\nT.L.D.R - should I keep applying for jobs aimlessly while going to school online Or should I carve out a schedule where I go to school and apply for jobs ? \n\nShould I add it on my resume that I am hopefully going to finish the degree next year to better help land a role ?

However, for the past 3 years, I\u2019ve been thinking that I\u2019m in the wrong field, but I kept telling myself that I would finish my degree and then pursue a field I love. I am currently in my 4th year + 1 additional year. I don\u2019t feel motivated to study, nor do I want to become an engineer. My family (I\u2019m sure like most of our families) has been doing everything they can and supporting me. But after all this time, I can\u2019t just say that I\u2019m going to switch to another field.\n\nSo why is this post under this title/community? You\u2019re absolutely right. Here, the fraud... just kidding. I\u2019ve been in a youth program at a company (about solar panels) for almost a year. I also tried to upload designs on Redbubble, create content on social media, and know SketchUp and Fusion360. And tried to logo design and photography at freelance sites . I\u2019ve tried to make money through freelancing with these skills. With the company I mentioned, we can arrange jobs and earn commissions, but I haven\u2019t received any response from any places I reached out to by email. My main goal is to save some money so I can at least switch to another field and have my own budget while studying. As a 25-year-old, it feels hard to depend on my family for allowance, buy things, and make the decision to switch fields.\n\nYou might say something like \"Is this the right place for that?\". You\u2019re absolutely right, but after seeing a few posts and comment sections, I guess I just wanted to open up a bit. What can I do, how can I create a budget, what else can I try, I don\u2019t know. Yes, maybe you might say \"Is yours a problem too...\" and I totally understand. But this is a process that psychologically stresses me. The field is really tough, especially since I\u2019m not passionate about it, which makes it ten times harder. There are about 200 people in my department, I estimate, but only 2 or 3 graduate, and with 3 extra exams, that number goes up to 5 or 6. But in the final year, there are at least 100 of us. This is really stressing me out. Overall, I just want to get some comments, ideas, or support other than from my friends and family, I guess that\u2019s why I wrote this long post (and I still have a lot inside me :D). So, this is it. I guess :')",

I'm still on the fence about online certifications, but if it's helped you please let me know!\nI think I would love to aim for a high-paying job that is less physically intensive, maybe something like HR?

        "content": "Posting on behalf of my Husband who is searching so hard for a new path. \n\nHe is part of a family business that began when he was 10 years old. His parents owned very successful restaurants in the south of France. They moved to the USA five years ago when he was 17 and opened a bakery business. My husband gave up his entire childhood to support them. For the last three years he has almost entirely managed two locations that are extremely high volume in South Florida. \n\nI wish you could call him an owner but his parents never gave him shares or a part of the business. He has basically acted as General Manager. Neither of his parents speak good English so as you can imagine he truly played a pivotal role in growing the business from 100k to 1million plus revenue in 4 years. \n\nAt this point his father has cheated on his mom. Is destroying their entire legacy and seems like the whole thing is about to blow up considering they are here on a strict investment visa. \n\nMy husband is a green card holder through our marriage and we have a baby girl on the way due in June. \n\nHe is one of the most mature 22 year olds I\u2019ve ever met. Highly intelligent with a great caring personality. The opposite of his psycho French dad. \n\nNow he\u2019s making probably 130k a year right now which is extremely fruitful, I know. I made him his first real resume as he wants to start exploring other options. \n\nHow realistic is it that he could get a management or quality position within a luxury hotel and resort here in south florida? We obviously know he would take a pay cut but is there any hope? \n\nLike I said, he\u2019s 22 years old, married with already so much success and responsibility, mature, intelligent, one of the most ambitious and driven people I\u2019ve ever met. The man never stops working\u2026. \n\n\nWe are so scared but hopeful he can make this career change without it hurting us too much. We have an extremely large savings, 3k rent, 2k in car and insurance payments and eat all home cooked meals. \n\nI\u2019m 6 months pregnant (28f) and I wish there was a bigger way for me to help right now but I know it\u2019s quite bad timing. \n\nWhat are our options? How hopeful/hopeless should we be? Any advice at all is appreciated. \n ",

I have a remote job where I make decent money (can easily save 50%) and I\u2019ve saved up six figures up until now. I have no debt or anything to my name, except for some liquid investments.

Since I graduated college in 2022, I have applied to more than 4,000 jobs and have been stuck in service work and temp admin positions. \n\nI applied for, went 5 rounds and an IQ test for a $20 entry level operations position, in a city across the country i want to live in, with a tech company that actually really aligned with my interests. The entire process took 7 weeks. I got the offer. I was ecstatic. Of the 4,000 applications I've done, I can think of 5-10 companies I would actually love to have on my resume. This was one of them. \n\nI signed the offer on February 28th. Did not get the background check to sign until March 3rd or so. The background check was supposed to be done 7 days before my start date. It was not. I inquired daily, adamant that I would not move across the country without the background check clearing, given I have had multiple offers rescinded before at this stage and the company itself was in the news for laying off 20% of its workforce 2023-2024 and rescinded a hundred jobs. \n\nIt took over 2 weeks for the background check to clear, and on the Wednesday before my Monday start date, Sterling asked for W2s. Given the company's recent news and the background check taking this long, I had to read between the tea leaves and my logic was telling me I didn't get the job. I've been burned before. I was panicking that this was headed in the wrong direction. At this point I still haven't bought the flight, but I'd been searching for over a week to no avail on the Facebook on groups for roommates and temporary housing. \n\nOn Thursday night, they FINALLY told me I was cleared to start Monday. On Friday, they told me my laptop would be arriving that night or Sat morning. I was not in the state. My PO box wasn't open on Sundays when I was supposed to be there, so I had to negotiate getting it early on Monday but late (I'd be missing the first hour of onboarding). So they were about to find out that I didn\u2019t have a permanent address still. At this point I'd already been panicking for days, sick to my stomach and having hot flashes from the stress and situation I was in. \n\nIn the end, I packed and bought my flight, and I didn't get on the plane. I sent a withdrawing email because I assumed they were going to rescind anyways (I had already red flagged them telling them I wasn't going to be able to pick up the laptop in time). \n\nThe regret and shame I feel right now is enormous. I felt like I was dealt a nearly impossible hand, after a year unemployed I get hired by a company in a city I want to be in who uses a background check that takes more than two weeks (of the offers I've had before, no other background check has taken this long). It feels cruel. I used logic with what's happened to me before and this time my logic was wrong. I did everything right except get on the plane and live in a hotel for a week. Why didn't I do it? What the fuck is wrong with me? i have a degree i have not used in 3 years - I majorly fucked up. I could've been living a completely different life today. I'm desperate to leave my state. \n\n3 years, 4,000 applications, and finally and out-of-state offer for $20. I WANTED THE JOB!!! \n\nHow do I get over this regret? Interviews are so few and far in between, the scarcity of entry level roles has left me in a complete panic. Even my dad was crying with me last night over how devastating this is. I'll always have to live with the what-ifs. I feel like I ruined my life and this is a major life regret I can't live with. I don't know what possessed me on Sunday. ",

Couple years ago I woke up and realized how much more I should be getting paid for my experience and skills, plus I treat all our customers like my own.\n\n\nI'm sorta copier tech and IT, other equipment. We do all the school districts and medical facilities, law agencies, anyways, I like to have a good rep in the community. \n\nLong story shorter, I rarely mess up, pry 5 barely customer complaints in 20 years and each one of them quit or got fired for being shitty ppl.\n\nI broke my back last july, when to LA for training a week after in horrible pain, showing my dedication, came back, kicked butt still, our branch is a mess, we are not set up as properly as corporate branch, so I for instance have to also watch the managers back and help out way more than my own duties, I'm always keeping the boss updated on things and he comes to me all the time when he knows I'm the one that will make things happen.\n\nSide note, he's one of the most competitive guys in the world, absolutely everything in life has to be his way, outside of work too, I love him, and get to see his human side but...... not the main topic so....\n\n\nAnyways, my stepdad suddenly died while mom was pulling them at home, well, heart attack, she got him to the fire department around corner, they were pumping his chest on the sidewalk while she was yelling crying in agony for him to live, I showed up to that, holding her, then next 7 days in ICU praying he would wake up but he also had cancer and tho it was improving, we had to let him pass three days before xmass, no brain activity.\n\nNow my sister out of town, me and Mom are crushed, Moms alone now after being married 35 years to him, our lives have been turned upside down, I've been trying to help her through it all, they were my best freinds, I'm single 50Years old, she's 75.\n\n her brother, my uncle is dying soon from his cancer, we're devistated, one of my oldest best freinds died sunday.\n\nThe main rep came down to meet with me on some machines, weve needed lots of parts on back order and it's making us look bad, the boss knows I've gone crazy daily working on getting them to get their shit together, and it worked, I basicaly maybe saved us from losing an entire school district.\n\nSo this week, I'm still kicking ass, then I get some lip because corporate lady is mad i'm not always clicking my time clock for lunch, well the fkn app glitches, I put in the correction requests, I text my manager screen shots of the glitches or bad signal since i'm in print shops and it's either shit signal, glitches, or i just am so absorbed and under a machine or dealing with the customer i just say fk it sometimes. I proved to the boss by showing him all the screen shots, and i told him look i'm sorry too though because after dad dying i've been dealing with so much my goal is to just keep the customer happy. I used most my PTO while dad was dying.\n\nSo monday I realized I forgot to order the parts for a customer the week before. I was so mad at myself, i told the manager, we've known eachother pry 30 years, so i'm looking to see if maybe we already have the parts, then I get a call i'm meeting the rep, so i scramble. This was the bosses number one priority, as he was going to meet with the district after us. The customer was making threats. So I spent hours and hours and got shit fixed.\n\nHe was super happy, the past three weeks they have had me on the hardest shit, biggest machines, most important customers, I've been saving their asses, and sticking up for him, working late.\n\nToday, he goes to meet with another district, they pop by a school, holy shit I forgot to order the parts for them, the machine isn't down, but it's ugly copies, but damn, I got an earful. I just kept apologizing, reassuring how important it is,saying man i'm so sorry i kept turning to do it then the bigger stuff kept side busting me, and I told him i understand it's very important and i know all i'm dealing with has got me ruffled in life right now that i've been trying my best to stay on top of everything, anyways, we hashed it out a bit, i feel bad because he's right, as a team, the manager should catch things we miss and give us a heads up, normally he does, but it's been absolutely crazy lately, and like I said, we are not set up as good as the other branch, they use us techs for set ups and parts and all kinds of shit when we should have guys for that stuff like corporate, so we can focus on our customers.\n\nAnyways, he's the only one who hasn't said more than a couple things about my loss and what's going on in my life, everyone else has been amazing, his competitive mind and what's in it for him right now always shines most.\n\nSeveral ppl who have left, tell me all the time that I need to stop thinking he cares about us and be true to ourselves because he doesn't give a shit unless he finds out you might bail.\ni'm their best guy, all the customers treat me like family, last year i said if we don't get my pay closer to what's right then i'm going to have to start looking. I got 4 more bucks an hour, still 3 or 4 bucks short but it was nice.\n\nNow my review is due, I have a feeling that as much ass I've been kicking, they are going to try and use these things against me, even though i'm human and made a few mistakes, but i feel like he needs to understand he's lucky i've stuck around, havnt just quit and move in with mom, or hit up the other places but i don't think they are hiring right now, i know i messed up, but i wanna just quit on his ass for not treating me more human after all i've gone through since dad dying, it's taking all i got to go in and care each day right now, and i've still been kicking ass and he knows it. \n\nI feel like he knows it, but will use these mistakes against me getting the proper raise i deserve, like he grasps hold of every little bad thing, and holds it close for ammo, first,\n\nFirst, how to i stop letting this eat me alive and not wanna just tell him to suck it\n\n\nand how do i go about another good raise to get me to my proper pay for the industry",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m 31F and have been working in corporate roles since 2018. I\u2019m currently facing a difficult decision and would appreciate some outside perspectives.\n\nBackground\n\n-Graduated in 2015, worked in hospitality for a year, to save for traveling  then as a paralegal for another year in the country I travelled to. \n\n-Started in financial services consulting in 2018 (in a different country from my home). I was seconded to a large investment bank straight away so never felt like I was consulting. \n\n- Left that role in 2022 after feeling burned out, took five months off.\n\n- Joined a Big 4 firm in 2023 but accepted a role beneath my experience level, partly due to a lack of confidence.\n\n\nI wanted  to move back to my home country in 2024 but  didn\u2019t want to transfer internally as I would have had to stay at lower grade.\n\nI wanted to move  back into a financial services firm but ended up taking another consulting role when I moved home, as it was my only offer. The firm is small but part of a global network. My department is three partners, one director. They needed someone experienced who could be client-facing immediately. The partners seemed great, they were flexible with my relocation, and they even increased my initial salary request by 5k.   Work-life balance is good, and they are willing to support (and pay for) additional professional qualifications. They have just hired a senior Partner from a Big 4 to help growth, so there is a lot of long term potential opportunity in the Firm. \n\nMy Dilemma\n\nTwo weeks ago, another company I had previously interviewed with reached out. They now have budget for a role they think suits me and have offered it without requiring a further interview. I am waiting for confirmation of the salary . I am pushing them to match my current salary, but their max offer could be \u00a35k less. \n\nThe overall benefits package is stronger:\n\n- 10% pension contribution (compared to 5% in my current role)\n- Free onsite gym\n- Private healthcare (I do not currently receive this, though I am covered under my partner\u2019s plan)\n- Location is much more convenient for where I want to be located long-term\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Role (Consulting) Positives \n\n- Great boss, very supportive firm\n- The partner I work for is highly knowledgeable, so I have significant opportunities to learn\n- hybrid working (three days in the office, but quite relaxed if I need to do less on a given week)\n- Good work-life balance\n- Private Equity investment just announced, so could be a lot of long term growth and it could be a good time to be here\n\nChallenges:\n\n- The office location is inconvenient for where I want to settle long term\n- Very little client work since I joined, and business development efforts seem unstructured. We did not hit target last year and are already off track for this year. This will also impact bonus\n- I don\u2019t feel like I am adding much value\u2014often just shadowing a partner\n- The office environment is outdated (lots of cables and wires everywhere, freezing cold in winter, all feels a bit uninspiring)\n- The wider firm feels somewhat outdated in its operations and leadership\n\n\nPotential New Role (In-House, Financial Services Firm) postives \n\n- More structured, stable work environment (no business development or concerns about pipeline)\n- Better long-term benefits\n- More convenient location and a modern office\n- team seems very keen to hire me \n\nConcerns:\n\n- The role is listed as requiring three to five years of experience, but I have seven\u2014am I stepping back again?\n- Unclear if there is much room for progression\n- Less flexibility\u2014four days in the office and longer working hours\n- If I leave, it adds to a pattern of frequent job changes, which may be a red flag on my CV\n- I feel incredibly guilty about leaving my current firm so soon, as they have been very good to me and their budget is built around me being chargable all year. If I leave they won\u2019t hit target. \n\n\nOther Considerations\n\nI am also thinking about the long term, particularly maternity leave. I would like to be settled in a firm before having children, as switching jobs while juggling childcare would be more difficult. My current job\u2019s location would also be a bigger issue if I had children, due to potential daycare drop-offs and commutes.\n\n\nWhat I\u2019m Struggling With\n\nDo I stay in my current role, accepting the bits i don\u2019t like (no job is perfect)  and gain experience that could help me move into a better role in future? Or do I take this new opportunity, which is better in some respects but I can\u2019t be certain will have good growth. \n\nI don\u2019t trust myself to make the right decision because I feel like every career move I have made so far has put me behind my peers.

Since then the manager that gave me this review has left the company and while I\u2019ve been away the company has restructured some of its job titles and I see that my job title went from a \u201csenior manager\u201d to just \u201cmanager\u201d title although I expect I will still be earning the same salary. \nJust wondering how I should address the negative review with new management and if I should bring up the job title change as it feels like a demotion.",

Somewhat frugal saving about 30-45% of take home.  Salary is slightly lower but okay if single. But not okay if have a family. \n\nTo preface my company is in heavy industry so boom and bust is real. \n3rd year into my career in supply chain.( very junior position ( should be stable)\n\nMy thoughts. Telling my boss ( who is caring enough)  that I just bought a house a couple months ago.\n\n Pro: if layoffs happen they may care about those youngish and save those who are hard working/ willing  to learn. \n\nCons: I feel  that corporations/HR could kneecap my potential earnings since I am now dependant on my employer to afford the house.  Ie for promotions may offer under market rate vs higher salary. \n\nOption  1)  don't tell boss and keep grinding getting new skills and apply for future positions in the next 1-2 years. Reason why Is i have a lot on my plate between work, renovations and family life.  Prioritize work and relationship. With working funding my savings, investment  and future retirement. \n\n\nOption 2)  tell my boss  who is a middle manager, and about my current situation. Protect myself from future layoff (if itnhappens)  I have an okay reputation within my department and  as someone who wants to learn. And expect HR to not be my friend and won't care about me.

        "content": "| (19F) am a junior in college, and I'm struggling with choosing between management information systems and accounting. I already changed my major from computer science to management information systems because I wanted something that had less math and less coding. Now, after my first MIS course, I found it to be a bit boring. I'm thinking of changing it to accounting because people rave about the job security. Additionally, I am someone who enjoys working alone. I'm an introvert with social anxiety. My personality type is ISTJ. I'm not that expressive; I tend to overthink, and l ask a lot of questions when completing any sort of task due to perfectionism. But when I think about the pros that MIS has over accounting, I'm afraid I'd be making a mistake. MIS seems to pay better, the education process seems easier, and there are many different job routes so you don't feel inclined to stick with 1.\n\nUsually, when someone is trying to choose their major, they are questioned about what their passion is or what their interests are. I'm a very artistic person with many hobbies (drawing, making jewelry, crocheting), but unfortunately that doesn't make you money, so I just want to choose something that makes me good money, gets me a job quick after graduation, and provides work-life balance. I'm decent at math, but I'm not an expert by any means. I failed Calculus 1, which is one of the reasons why I stopped pursuing computer science. To be fair, the professor wasn't all that great, and many people didn't do well. But I remember getting into advanced math classes in middle school, and my PSAT and SAT scores showed higher proficiency in math compared to other subjects. I enjoy it when I understand what I'm doing and when I'm excelling at it. If I were to major in accounting, I would most likely pursue the CPA.\n\nI've read many Reddit stories, watched many YouTube videos, and TikTok videos about the best majors and people comparing management information systems and accounting. A lot of the time I see people saying to double major since they're both very good, but I don't have much money for that (I assume that it would cost more than simply majoring in one). FAFSA didn't give me anything, and I'm accepting all loans. I also don't think that I would have the drive for that. I would greatly appreciate anyone who has recommendations on either which major is better or a good way to decide which is better for me. I have an appointment with a counselor in a few days.",

        "content": "Alright, I really need some honest advice because I\u2019m at a major crossroads in life and my brain just won\u2019t stop overthinking this.\n\nI\u2019m 27M from India, currently earning a decent salary working as a content marketing strategist for a startup. I did my bachelor\u2019s in computer applications from a decent-ish college, but the experience was... meh. The course was outdated and most of us had to learn the actual skills on our own. Just as I graduated, the pandemic hit, and companies weren\u2019t exactly eager to hire freshers. Desperate to start working, I took up a role in content marketing for a startup in 2020.\n\nCut to 2025 - I now have 5 years of experience working in content marketing for two companies. During this time, I also tried starting my own business, but that didn\u2019t quite work out and we had to shut it down within a year. Also, sad fact: I haven\u2019t stepped foot in an office even once in these 5 years. It\u2019s been all remote, all the time. And honestly? I\u2019m starting to hate how monotonous my life has become.\n\nThat said, the silver lining is that over these years, I\u2019ve developed a solid understanding of how content works in general. I\u2019m well-versed with most of the creative tools needed to produce high-quality, engaging visual content - video editing, photography, design, you name it. And here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m also a passionate hobbyist photographer and filmmaker. My absolute dream is to travel the world with my camera, capture stories, meet new people, and share those experiences through visuals and storytelling on platforms like YouTube and Instagram.\n\nNow, this brings me to my dilemma. I feel like I\u2019m at a stage where I need to make a big move to break out of this rut. I see two possible paths:\n\n1. Spend 25-40 lakh INR to get a business/management degree from the UK or Ireland. I wouldn\u2019t be taking a loan - this would be from my own savings. I understand that a university degree itself won\u2019t automatically fetch me a job - I\u2019m fully prepared to put in the effort to build a strong network and gain practical experience. But given how the global job market is pretty bad right now in 2025, I\u2019m not even sure how promising the job prospects would be after spending that kind of money.\n2. Take around 10 lakh INR as kickstart money and travel the world with my camera. I\u2019d work with clients as a photographer and filmmaker, earn money while I travel, and simultaneously build my social brand on YouTube and Instagram. The idea of telling stories through my lens, experiencing different cultures, and building a life around my passion honestly feels like the dream. But I also know this comes with its own risks and uncertainties.\n\nSo here\u2019s my question: What would you do if you were in my shoes? Is spending a huge chunk of savings on a degree worth it given the current job market, or would it make more sense to take the leap and chase this creative dream while working freelance? If you\u2019ve made a similar choice or faced a similar dilemma, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. Any advice or perspective would be seriously appreciated.",

Between the low income, several health scares this year, and the highly stressful nature of the business and administrative end of the work, I am ready to call it quits and find a 9-5. I'm so tired of being on the edge of financial collapse at all times.

I can handle some, but Jesus Christ this is too much\n- preferably work that involves teaching. Any age group, I love kids just as much as teens or adults. I really just love helping people\n- a dope woman with a dope baby\n\nMy Resume and skills:\n- 6 years at a local restaurant. 4 years of that time as training manager and shift manager\n- 3 years instructing between two different Martial art schools \n- 6 years at the school I now own. One year teaching as an employee, the other five as the one running the show. The school grosses $200k-$210k a year, and the classes are always full! But that doesn't matter because overhead and taxes are so damn high\n- I'm a high-level teacher. And I am very good at the social and emotional piece as well. In one way or another I have been teaching/tutoring for my entire life, it's just something I do naturally. I'm self taught and highly motivated in this arena\n\nIf you take the time to comment with advice, thanks a bunch!

Pay is weekly.\n\nI have been offered a supervisor position on the production line for $2-4 dollars more (they aren't sure exactly on the offer yet, they're still discussing) and it would be five 12 hour shifts 7PM-7AM Monday-Friday. I am currently working 9.5 hr shifts (with lots of flexibility on arrival time and leaving time) and am off every other Saturday and Sunday. \n\nI would get a lot more days off every year, but I would also be working much longer hours and responsible for a crew of 8-15 guys. I would be much more visible to management and prospects for promotion are higher, but I am apprehensive because my current role is very relaxed and very flexible. \n\nI am so unsure of what the best course of action would be. I absolutely think this is the right career move in terms of promotion, but I am worried the stress and pressure of being in a supervisory role and the extended hours could take a toll on my mental health. I have never been a supervisor and I am in my mid 20s. \n\nSorry for length of post.",

        "content": "I'm becoming increasingly frustrated in my attempts to embark on a new career direction. It\u2019s going on two years that a big career change has been at the forefront of my mind. I\u2019ve spent a considerable amount of time thinking about this problem, consulting with friends and professional colleagues about it etc. But I have still not really come close to any sense of clarity. At this point, I believe there is some serious analysis paralysis going on.\n\nI'm 37 years old with a Master's in Science Communication and a BA (Hons) in Political Science. I've had a varied career in filmmaking. I have been making my own work my whole career - documentaries, music videos, video art, with some success, but nothing to achieve total security as a freelancer (very hard). Environment and climate have always been my focus. The work I've done for money is varied too. First as a documentary/wildlife cameraman. Then I moved into more commercial work. I spent a few years making promos for hotels/resorts around the world. During COVID, that dried up, and since then I've been doing freelance work but only just enough to get by - no savings, no feeling of progress. For most of my career, things have fallen in my lap. That doesn't seem to be the case anymore.\u00a0\n\nFor the last couple of years, I've been exploring options. Environment, climate, and ecology are my focus. All my work is on these themes, as are my reading and interests.\n\nI am open to many things - sideways shifts within film, doubling down on my skillset, completely shifting to a new field. I'm considering doing another Master's to get there or trying to get an entry-level position.\n\nThere are so many factors at play, I find it very overwhelming tackling this problem. My partner and I might want to have kids in the next three years, but I want to be on this new track before we do that. We live in Berlin but don't think we want to be here forever, though we aren't sure exactly where to go next. I'm from New Zealand, she's from the United Kingdom. I'm quite pessimistic about the future - climate breakdown, the rise of the far right, etc. Often I look at jobs in various fields - corporate climate and environmental organizations and NGOs, and feel like those jobs are rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.\n\nAs you can see, there are lots of conflicting ideas and issues. My attempts to methodically resolve these have been quite fruitless so far. I have a huge document which I regularly consult and update, with all my thoughts on the matter. I feel overwhelmed. I have considered a career coach for this. There's a sense of desperation that comes and goes. Sometimes I just feel fine about it - life is unpredictable, ride the wave, etc. Then sometimes I feel this intense fear that I'm beginning to approach an age where a career shift is difficult/impossible.\n\nI\u2019m seeking counsel from anyone who might have been somewhere similar. How do I break the deadlock and paralysis?\n\n",

I am a graduate (2018) from a 9-1-1 communications college course and I loved my program and my career goals then and I also did very well in school achieveing deans list and honours and graduating second in my program. Unfortunately, it is a very competitive market where I live and I haven't found my footing in this field. I've gotten quite discouraged and completely gave up for a few years. I had a phenomenal offer right after graduating but it involved moving provinces and it wasn't a fit for my family at the time (I was in a very abusive relationship and he had a child we couldn't move with us or leave behind). I started trying to get a job in this field for the past year and am having no success. \n\nSo now I'm not sure if I should continue trying to get my foot into the 911 field or going in a different, safer direction. I don't want to bounce from job to job and live paycheck to paycheck anymore. I want a career, stability, and to be something my daughters can be proud of. \n\nI worked as a bartender throughout school and for a couple of years afterwards. It was great money and offered me the time to apply and interview and test for 911 positions. But then with covid, the industry collapsed and it wasn't viable anymore as I was now a single mom of two. I went into manufacturing and supply chain as it was a guaranteed job and I had the in. It was actually great. I learned alot and thrived there and within 6 months, I had moved up the ladder and had been poached by another company. Unfortunately I was on midnights and it didn't work well with my health and family and I left the position for something I thought would be similar but better hours. I often regret that choice because I hated the new job and the added hours to my day (driving 1 hour + each way vs 5 minutes). \n\nSo now I'm considering going to school for my ba in supply chain and logistics. I'm in my thirties and have my family to consider and still have osap loans to pay back so is this even a viable route? Also, the income of the roles I could get after having this education would be significantly higher than a 911 dispatcher. \n\nShould I stick with trying to get into a dream career for me? Or am I better trying the safe route? Am I at a point where I'm too old to start over again? Would adding more debt to my osap loans be detrimental? I just don't want the job to job anymore, I want to settle down in all aspects of my life now. ",

I managed to complete another Bachelors, this time with honours all the time caring for my mother and doing side hustles as a tutor, volunteer work at the local food charity etc. I've been applying for jobs etc but thus far i've had no success. I've been applying for graduate programs now too but even that's having problems as I can't get over the final hurdle. I don't really have much skills and i've been trying to apply for any job around (supermarkets etc) but nothing sticks. I can't even get an interview. I feel really done with all this honestly, I'm super depressed and even reaching out to my community has been worthless. My family (extended and close) pass comments about how much of a failure I am, \n\nCan someone give me some advice so I don't end up offing myself or something. Every day I wake up depressed and have to force myself to do anything. I feel burned out and honestly no matter what I try nothing helps. I've lost all my friends as almost all of them have left the country (UK) and none of them talk to me anymore. I know that once my mother passes, I won't have anyone in my life who cares for me even a little. I have a sibling and our relationship is good but I need to walk on eggshells around them because any small things sends them off and I end up getting the silent treatment and being ignored for days on end. I don't have any savings left as I used all them on repairs and bills for our house (my father has a steady income from his pension but refuses to help). I have a degree in Biological Science and I have a ton of experience in volunteer work, I've done work in India helping the poor there, organising food drives etc all by myself. ",

I studied biotechnology and then took my first job in CR to be near my fianc\u00e9e. I didn't know what the job was and I had no plans on making it my career. \n\nThe first few weeks of any job are always a learning phase but once I started doing the job I realized that I didn't enjoy it. There's no one area of the job that especially hate. I just don't care about it. \n\nI worked in different parts of the industry, for sponsors, big pharma companies, contract organizations etc. In both animal and human health. \n\nAnd from the start I really didn't enjoy it, bordering on hating it from the start. But as a lot of you know once you start down a career path, kids are born, houses are bought etc and it's needed to continue on this path.\n\nThis all came to a head in Sept 2023 we moved onto a new house which had a lot of problems.  I was teavelling a lot for a job that I don't care about. And then I was off for 6 months with burnout. I went back to my last employer and basically was out if my position \"on the bench\" to say it one way and was still payed until September 24. Then I was unemployed until this week.\n\nI started a new job in the same industry but from the other side of the fence. So working in a hospital on the clinical trials. So far I'm bored senseless I working 40 hours a week I have a 45 minute or so journey to the job one way. \n\nBut I have realized that I really don't care about this job and what it entales. And I know I was off for so long that I could have found something else to do but I still have no idea what I would like to do.\n\nSo 4 days into this job I feel completely overwhelmed, our kids need to now also get up earlier and stay longer in after school care and kindergarten. And I don't know what to do or what to say to my wife.\n\nOn my wife she is incredible she supports me so much and feel like such a failure. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \n\n",

I just accepted my first full-time role (working in marketing) about three weeks ago, and I absolutely dread going to work every day. The work I\u2019m doing is fine, but it\u2019s not where I want to be and I feel like the location of my work is prohibiting me in other areas of my life that I really value (social life, physical activity, being independent). I feel like my mental health has really tanked since beginning the job, and I just feel like as long as I\u2019m going to have to work for the rest of my life, I might as well be somewhere I actually want to be and go home to a place that I actually want to go home to. I really took this job because I needed experience and it\u2019s nice to have an income. It\u2019s a far commute and I really want to move out of my parents house closer to the metropolitan area near me, but this job does not allow me to do that as it is 30 minutes in the opposite direction, kind of in the middle of nowhere (it\u2019s a resort). If I were to move to the city and keep this job, my commute would be about 1 hour 10 mins, and I would get maybe a total of 3 hours at home every day before I\u2019d have to go to bed. I also currently work in the hospitality business, and after the past few weeks I\u2019m not sure this field is for me. Anyway, my question is, would it be bad to quit this job after 1-2 months? I wouldn\u2019t quit until I have another job secured closer to where I want to move to. I know it doesn\u2019t look good on a resume to only stay at a job for a few months, but I seriously do not think I can stay here for longer than that.

        "content": "Hi, Reddit :) I'm 23F, graduated in May 2024 with two Bachelor's, one in Marketing and one in Studio Art. Right now, I am living with my (amazing, supportive) parents as a substitute teacher while I figure things out (and because I have an internship in Japan over the summer). I initially had no idea what I wanted to do, and now have almost narrowed it down between going into marketing or being an art teacher... and I cannot decide.\n\n**Marketing:** \n\n**Pros**: Potential for a much higher income. Could work for a company in something im interested in (video games, art, animation). Possible work from home. Could work for an impactful non profit. Marketing experience can be tailored to apply to a variety of business admin oriented jobs outside of pure marketing. My graphic design skills make me a desirable candidate.\n\n**Cons:** I don\u2019t find business/marketing itself all that interesting; I found myself growing to resent it while in business school. I hate \u2018hustling,\u2019 and would not want to run marketing for a firm by myself. I don\u2019t really like social media/SEO marketing. I do not have a lot of experience/expectations for how I could be successful as a marketer. The job market right now is TERRIBLE and requires several years experience. I also hate networking. Lack of job security, some benefits may not be guaranteed or even good.\n\n**Art Teacher:**\n\n**Pros:** My state/county has good benefits/security. The pay is also better than other counties/states. The job \u2018makes sense,\u2019 (I understand what it means to be a good teacher and what to expect - generally - on a day to day basis). It is very hard to get fired once established. I like art and would (hopefully) feel purpose in helping students develop their skills. Summers off, could do some work over the summer (bartending?) to get my money up. Art teachers in particular apparently have more freedom in lesson planning and are less likely to get attacked by parents. I have experience as a sub for all grades and a variety of student bodies so I would not be going in blind.\n\n**Cons:** Thankless job, the pay is not great and is not expected to get better. I have to go back to school (though there are ways to get the degree for much teacher through county programs). Students behavior. Students\u2019 lack of motivation/depression rubbing off on me; me getting disillusioned. Admin/other politics making the job much harder than it needs to be. Bad supply budget means me buying a lot of material myself. If I hate it and want to change industries, being an art teacher is not exactly desirable former experience for many industries.\n\nThanks for reading, and sorry for bad formatting. I may be coming off as naive or ill-informed, so any real-world advice is appreciated!!",

        "content": "Hey everyone thanks for taking the time to read this post. I can\u2019t help but feel really lost these days. I\u2019m not lazy by any means I work my ass of while at work and when I\u2019m at home helping take care of my 2 year old daughter and helping my wife around our home anyway I can. I can\u2019t help but feel just so behind for my age, since i graduated high school in 2020. I look back and it\u2019s been five years since i graduated and i wasted so much time already, I could\u2019ve been doing anything but instead I just been working job to job with no advancement I feel like a fuckin idiot. I haven\u2019t gone to college nor the military ya know the usual stuff that people do after high school. All I\u2019ve done is just work different jobs. I feel so lost in what I want in life but of course I want to be successful and have the drive / motivation to get there if I just knew what I wanted to do with my life. I feel so behind though because I don\u2019t have any skills or advancement for a career opportunity. I don\u2019t want to do security, I work for the state so the benefits are great and my quality of life is too, my wife is a SAHM but it\u2019s been hard on me. I only make 35,000 take home and surviving on that is extremely hard. I feel like I let my daughter down and my wife. I feel she almost doesn\u2019t respect me because I haven\u2019t don\u2019t anything to further my direction. I don\u2019t know what the hell is wrong with me, why can\u2019t I just take the leap of faith TO DO SOMETHING. I feel really disappointed in myself and discouraged. Everyone always tells me \u201cI\u2019m doing good for my age\u201d while that\u2019s great to hear I don\u2019t feel that way at all. I feel I should be giving or sacrificing more for my family. I don\u2019t know if anyone has been in my shoes before or is currently dealing with the same situation. But just any advice or even just your thoughts would help. ",

        "title": "Loss of meaning and running out of time with multiple interests. What do I do?",
        "content": "Before I (25F) get started, I'll just give a quick overview of some of the things I've done and I'm interested in:\n\u2022 Art - I love painting / sketching\n\u2022 Sports - I absolutely love working out (it's a non-negotiable)\n\u2022 Teaching - I'm really good with kids/people in general\n\u2022 3D - I love Blender and making stuff in 3D\n\u2022 BME - I'm a biomedical engineer who has worked in designing implants.\n\u2022 Material science - I have a diploma in material science and metallurgy\n\u2022 Coding - I've spent 3 years of my life learning OpenGL and real-time rendering just because I enjoyed it. (But I don't want to make a career out of coding.)\n\nStory: I've painted since I was 5 years old. I was also extremely in love with science growing up, my room used to be filled with sketches, art, microscopes, motors, soil, trash, you name it - everything. Stuff used to fascinate me to the moon and back. However around the age of 15-16, I really started paying attention to art and painting and it turned my life over. I used to feel calm, as if I'm engaging into deep meditation for hours. I was getting appreciation for it too.\n\nI've always been extremely confused about what career to pick. After I finished 10th grade, my dad suggested me to take up a diploma in material science, which I did but I absolutely hated it. During those 3 years, I got so deeply lost in art that I found myself painting humans a lot. Studying humans in general was meditative, and I loved it so much that I wanted to pursue medicine at that point, majorly forensic pathology. What I remember from that time was - despite of being in the worst phase of my life due to family issues and whatnot, I was still able to find joy and hope due to my art and my perspective. \n\nHowever, my family was totally against this. I put unnecessary pressure on myself to become a full-time artist and prove them wrong, and started posting on Instagram - only to realise that you need to a have a continuous supply of art to please the algorithm, and painting every single day but not putting my soul in them, and painting just to paint made me burn out. Besides, putting such raw pieces out there made me feel vulnerable as heck and I deleted my entire account. \n\nIn 2023, I took up a 3D implants job where I designed implants using CAD, and I loved it. But I was suffering from a chronic pain issue which amplified to a point where I had to quit my job and engage in physiotherapy for a year. During that time, I was studying OpenGL through a class which had insane deadlines and culture (no sleep, sacrificing your family and big events, coding even if someone in your family dies - all of this was normalised). By the time I finished my final project (Jan 2025), I was extremely burnt out. I had given beyond 100% and I was done with it. I don't want to code anymore. \n\nNow between 2023-2025, I was unemployed, attending this rigorous class that burnt me out, no money to travel either, living with my parents, never had a proper love life. I've been hella depressed for the last few months, unable to get back to the gym like before (I was in my peak physical form in 2023). I feel stuck, with too many options before me and no zeal for life. I feel like at 25, life's already done. I've also been through extreme trauma and abuse at the hands of my dad while growing up, which has wiped away 70% of memory of my childhood and teen years.\n\nHere are some of the things that used to enliven me before:\n\u2022 Teaching and guiding kids, ie helping them find something unique within themselves.\n\u2022 3D modelling - blender work.\n\u2022 Painting - losing myself in art for hours, trying to build something beautiful from scratch. \n\u2022 Painting leading to study of anatomy and the world - studying mathematics, spirituality, etc. \n\nMy biggest concern is, I feel like doing too many things and running out of time - having a 3D business, or having my own painting brand someday and working towards it / or making a therapy game for people / building toys for disabled kids / working at a healthcare job to help people, etc. \n\nBut when I start doing that, I feel like I'm forcing it like I've forced it all my life - to learn learn learn, but never fully absorb it by taking the time to. And it all comes down to studying things by painting. Painting just to study things. For the heck of it with no ulterior motive to get results. Because that's what sparks curiosity in me - it's by studying things inside out on a paper. Once I study things and link them to each other, I start seeing the spark in life and studying electronics, math, everything becomes easy. \nHowever I feel like what's the point of it all? \n\nPlus, this takes time. I feel so exhausted and done that nothing gives me a reason to pursue anything anymore. I feel like what's the point? Who is going to see the stuff I make, and even if it reaches a wide audience, what's the point? What's the point of any of it? I'm just so done. Everything feels like too much work, even the smallest things. Even a small bit of progression is a reminder of how far behind I'm falling, and makes me want to not progress at all because it'll take me idk how long to make something out of it. \nI already feel so dead, if I take up a job right away I fear that I'll burn out so much I'll get roasted. In order for me to get a job, I want to feel some kind of pull towards it which can come from seeing beauty in things, which I've completely lost.\n\nPlus, I feel like I'm running out of time. \n\nIf you've read so far, thank you so much. I appreciate it a lot. Any advice would help.\n\n\n",

        "content": "Not entirely sure what to include here so I'll just provide my basic info. \n\n**Education**\n\n* I received a Bachelor of Arts in Game Design, with a minor in Ecology, in 2013. \n\n* I don't generally like to tell people about that because they generally assume it's like a computer degree, but it wasn't, it was more about designing stories and game art. It was not my first choice of majors, tbh it wasn't even in my top ten, my folks chose both my college and my major and I didn't get much of a say in either. \n\n* I'm totally open to going back to school for anything. Either a second Bachelors or Masters or anything, I have a 529 so it would be covered. \n\n---\n\n**Jobs I've Had, In Order**\n\n* 5 years at a Service desk at a library (I worked here in high school)\n\n* 3 years as a Dishwasher at the college I went to\n\n* 3 summers at various entry level positions at three different grocery stores\n\n* 2 years as a Google Analytics Specialist at a startup - (this was for one hour every two weeks and I was paid in college credit, it was in no way a 'real job')\n\n* 3 years as a computer repair person at Best Buy\n\n* 1 year in a position that didn't tehcnically have a name, but it was by far my favorite job. It involved working with massive Excel spreadsheets and driving around to find people who knew the data from the missing cells. It was like a yearlong scavenger hunt where I drove thousands of miles and got paid by the mile. \n\n* (at this point there was a global pandemic and I was out of work for a bit)\n\n* 1.5 years at a call center - (my most recent position, I was fired from here two days ago, first time being fired from anywhere)\n\n---\n\n**Skills* \n\nMicrosoft Excel (including advanced functions), very light Python scripting (mostly for use with Excel and command line applications), graphic design (I have a Redbubble store), and I've been told I'm excellent at tutoring high school level math, but I've never done that for pay, only for friends. I like math in general. \n\nI'm not sure if I have anything else that could be considered a skill. I can get from one place to another with nothing but a map and a compass, and I'm a very safe driver. When I was in college I worked on a large scale forestry restoration project. I also know more about religion and the nuances of religious law than anyone I've ever met. \n\n---\n\nThe only things I can say with any certainty that I'm not interested in are customer service and IT (which is really just customer service but with computers). I also can't do anything too physical, like the military, most trades, or law enforcement, because my legs don't work right (long story). Lightly physical is okay. \n\nI feel a bit like my window of \"you have all the time in the world to explore what you might like\" is closing or possibly already closed so whatever I do next is likely going to have to be the job I end up doing for a long time. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions for decent long term careers for someone in my position I'm all ears.",

        "content": "Trying this again as I made this post 3 weeks ago and got no responses. \n\n**Some background**\n\nI, (M24), am just finishing up my 2nd yr of my MSc in Dietetics, to become a dietitian. I am averaging a 1st class (American equivalent of a 4.0 gpa) at a Russell Group university (Ivy League Equivalent) in my masters. I also have a BSc in Nutritional Sciences at another Russell Group Univerisity (Got a 1st class, i.e. 4.0 gpa equiv).\n\nI am from the UK and typically out of graduation, I am looking at a \u00a337,250 ($48,000) a year grad job in London working for the National Health Service. I can expect this to grow to about \u00a355,000-\u00a360,000 ($70,000 - $80,000) in 3-4 years of work experience from now (dependent on pay rises given to NHS workers). This is not bad pay by any stretch of the imagination, however its not amazing either considering I have invested 5 years of my life in order to be qualified to do this job in the first place. The earning potential after 3-4 years btw is pretty much capped, I mean, you can go higher but it becomes a lot more difficult, and earning 6 figures without having your own business is pretty much a not a possibility as a dietitian working a full time job in the UK.\n\nI find myself being someone who enjoys wfh a lot, as well as working with outpatients, and working in wards in hospital, whilst rewarding, is a very draining type of work. I am currently undergoing clinical placement, and I find myself not enjoying the job as much as I would've imagined. I can thug it out maybe for a year or two, but I cannot see myself doing this for the rest of my life.\n\n**The question**\n\nWhat would be a good job for somebody with a masters to get into? I am completely open to whatever kind of industry, so long as it pays well and it requires a masters/bsc but is open essentially to any discipline, I am very much open to trying it out.\n\nThank you all, I really need advice so any contributions is greatly appreciated.",

Before graduation, my Father died and that left us with a financial dilemma. Whereas, I was not able to complete my on the job training. Being the eldest daughter, I feel it is necessary to just set aside my OJT and find a job immediately. I feel that it is a duty to quickly remove myself from Mom's financial worries. During my working girl era, I make sure to send money to my Mom to help with the finances. I was also able to complete my OJT at the nearest airport but didn't learn much and the pull towards the aviation industry was kind of weak since I was not able to have my OJT right after graduation. I have to go to either Manila or Cebu to get the proper training but cannot with the financial dilemmas and to think that I am the eldest and I need to set aside these things.

I went back to school again because I believe that it is really important for me to earn a degree and also I don't want to regret later on in life.

I WOULD like to explore more of this field. I would like to get a WFH IT related job. \nBPO - when I was a customer service rep, I also garnered awards in our account. This is an okay job for me but I think this is not for a life time career.(For me)\nWFH (Cold Caller/Appointment Setter) - I honestly hate this job. But this puts food on my table and helps with my bills. \nESL - Not really passionate with this one.\n\nSorry my story was a bit mixed up and not really organized but would like your opinion or suggestions/thoughts. I'm already 28 and just want to settle in one career and grow in it and thrive. \n\nThanks. Sorry please don't bash/hate on me. \n",

        "content": "Hi, I'm currently working full time as a software developer/engineer at a company where I've been since 2023. I am happy because I have no stress at all and time for other things in life such as completing my masters in Computer Science (will be finished this june). And the income is alright (2.2k after taxes per month). I've been in a project which started exactly last year and i only needed to code few things and took care of the whole documentation with few other colleagues. I have 50% HomeOffice so on days I am at work I either help someone, sit around doing nothing or do some private stuff. At home I just waste time mostly. Is that what life is all about? I want to do so much more than to just sit around and step out of my comfort zone ...\n\nThe only issue I have is that Software Engineering is not THAT interesting anymore. My whole academic life I've been studying Computer Science so I'm also scared to completely change my career path. I still like to solve few things now and then but I feel like I forgot everything from university and college. And Software Engineering isn't also something I wanted to do with all my heart, it was never a passion, more a safety choice because I'm the eldest (24y) of immigrant parents who is responsible to just make it somehow, but I'm still happy to have done that.\n\nThere are so many years left in this life and I see people turn around their boring lives by changing 1 or 2 things, yet I don't know what to do or what to pursue. I am currently finishing my masters thesis, so I'm happy to have that time, but what should I do after that? I would like to stay in Tech, with not too much programming. (Was thinking about Data Analysis)\n\nI also don't mind staying in my current role as long as I can do something else besides that like starting a business or something. Besides my current job, I play on an amateur level football (soccer) earning little money so that's what i really love. I'm not married or talk to someone so I still have much time.\n\nI would really appreciate any ideas or recommendations and thank you guys in advance for that!\n\n",

I've always wanted to work in the Bio/Pharma industry, but in my country (in the Middle East), it's almost impossible to get a job in these fields without a post-graduate degree or something similar.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m working as a Production Engineer in a paints and coatings manufacturing company, and to sum it up: it sucks. From the hours to the work environment, the only good part of the job is the somewhat higher pay. I\u2019ve been here less than a year, and I already want to leave.\n\nI\u2019ve applied to multiple other companies but haven\u2019t received any offers, so I decided to apply to universities around the world. I got accepted to the University of Pennsylvania for an MS in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, which is huge for me. However, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that quitting my job and going might be a mistake.\n\nMy government offers full-ride scholarships to those accepted into top 20 schools, so I won\u2019t have to pay anything, but I\u2019m still worried. I fear that once I finish my degree and return, I might not find a job in the industry. People often say that master's degrees aren\u2019t worth it, but I just want to get out of my current situation.

I have been working as an apprentice for a little over a year now and recently I have been feeling like I cant continue.\n\nWhile I enjoy some aspects about this job, such as:\n\n1. The feeling of being proud of your work. For example, when you run a lot of pipe and you take a step back and look at your work. Its like \"damn I just did that.\". I feel satisfied and I like that feeling.\n2. I like to be on my feet (to an extent) and moving. I feel I get antsy when I'm sitting down for too long\n3. There is some sense of comradery in the trade. A brotherhood as they call it.\n4. I suspect I have ADHD so this type of hands-on work helps minimize those symptoms\n\nBut there are also plenty of cons that I personally feel:\n\n1. There is a lot of pressure to be \"good enough\" at your job and that constant pressure is personally very stressful\n2. Its hard on the body. While it, by far, is not the hardest job you can do physically. It is still pretty physical work. You're lifting, pulling, climbing, bending over, kneeling, and even at times crawling all day. I've only been doing it for a year now and I've started feeling the effects. I cant imagine how it will be in 10, 20 years.\n3. Its a very fast, high stakes environment. I find that my brain just shuts down in these situations and I cant think straight. Leading to a number of fuck ups\n4. It can be very unstable. Majority of the time you will be moving from jobsite to jobsite, having to adjust to new environments and people quickly\n5. Maybe this last reason is stupid but I feel my personality just doesn't fit. I am an introvert and I prefer not to interact with people for extended periods. In this job, you have to.\n\nI would really like a job/career where:\n\n1. Where I feel there is some value to my work. I think I am a very empathetic person and I want to see my work benefit people in some way, even if its small.\n2. Low pressure and or slow paced environment. When I say low pressure/slow paced I don't mean I don't want to work hard. I understand at work you need to be productive and I want to work hard but I find it easier to be productive when there's not a million things going on\n3. I'm not just sitting all day. I would love to be in a dynamic workplace where I can sit and move around\n4. Decent enough pay to live on my own.\n\nI would love to hear any suggestions or opinions, Thank you for reading!",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI(UK based F24) have just graduated from University with a 2.1 in Law (like that matters these days, lol). I do not have much direct experience with the corporate sector. While studying, I only worked in hospitality, including being a supervisor. I did not engage in any internships or placements (something I have come to regret, considering how competitive the job market is). I knew I did not want to take the typical route to becoming a lawyer while studying, hence my avoidance of getting any experience in the sector in addition to my limited knowledge of any alternative career paths.\n\nSo, in essence, while I left university with a degree, I think my lack of experience is hindering me. I have applied to Civil Service Fast Streamer, Local Government Graduate Programme and a few other Graduate schemes starting in September 2025. I have been rejected for all of these. I feel like for the corporate world, my skills are likely drastically underdeveloped. Additionally, I have later come to discover how competitive the roles I applied to are. After all these rejections, I am feeling slightly deflated, but I also think perhaps I was too keen, expecting to get a graduate role with my limited experience. I suppose I naively assumed graduate roles were catered to new graduates.\n\nAnyway currently, I work as an Equality advisor (non-legal advice over the phone). Ideally, I would like to work in a role relating to Policy, specifically, Equality. Or some sort of equality advisor/officer/advocate/program manager for equality-focused projects.\n\nI am currently considering getting a master's in Policy, starting as an Administrative officer in the government and working my way up, or looking more into the private sector(but to be honest, I do not know where to start). I do not want to spend too much time applying for graduate roles if I need to bulk up my CV.\n\nI also do not intend to apply for more roles until September 2025, as I want to travel beforehand.\n\nApologies, I am quite the rambler (AuDHD).

        "content": "Hey,\n\nAbout me: \nI love to work with people one-one and I enjoy having conversations with people of all backgrounds. Having a flexible schedule and high pay are important to me. I\u2019ve been in college for a really long time, but I kept changing my mind about what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I would like to get out of school as fast as possible with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree. I volunteer with kids from underprivileged homes, and I used to be really good at customer service and retail (I went way over the top for every person that needed anything). I love to improve people\u2019s lives and create change in the community.\n\nI\u2019ve been interested in radiography for some time, and at first I wanted to be an IR tech. There were a lot of applicants to my school\u2019s radiography program, so I applied to a speech pathology program as backup. I used to be in school for speech pathology, and I really enjoyed my classes. \n\nI dropped out of the SLP program due to the environment and personal issues. I got a job in radiology at my local hospital and have been enjoying it, but I\u2019ve been torn about my future career choices. The newest career I came across was radiation therapy, which seems like the top contender right now.\n\nSpeech pathology feels like my first love, like the one who got away. Radiography feels cool and awesome. Upon doing even more research, I came across radiologic therapy. That career path seems like a solid one that combines the best of both worlds (therapy and radiology). \n\nMy biggest issue in making a decision is the time commitment. I\u2019ve been in college since I was 17 (21 now), and I have no degree to show for it. \n\nMy 3 education plans: \n\n1. I could get my associate\u2019s in radiography and then go somewhere to finish my bachelor\u2019s in radiologic science to become a radiation therapist. (2-3 more years of school)\n\n2. I could get my associate\u2019s in radiography and become an IR tech. (2 more years of school)\n\n3. I could leave the radiology world completely and go back to speech pathology, earning both a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree. (2-4 more years of school) \n\nI really would not like to struggle financially in the future, and the job that seems to pay the most is radiation therapy.

Wanted to talk about my career progression and how I am unhappy with the same. \n\nI did my BSc. in economics from Mumbai, got bad grades in 12th so couldn\u2019t get into Delhi University. \n\nMy first job was at KPMG in Investment Banking in 2021, annual CTC was 3L\n\nMoved to Bangalore after a year, CTC 8L. Things didn\u2019t work out in The startup in Bangalore, left after 8 months. \n\nJoined Investment Banking in Mumbai at a reputed Indian firm two years back. Year 1 CTC 17 lakhs, year 2 CTC 22 lakhs. And now I am being promoted with my CTC reaching 56 lakhs. \n\nBut I am really unhappy because I aspired to reach 1 crore by the time I hit 25. Any tips on how to move forward from here as this target seems difficult to reach. ",

        "content": "Heyo, been thinking about my future recently and I guess reddit is the best place to talk about stuff you\u2019re absolutely clueless about with people who probably know more than you. Btw this post might be long or rambly idk and idc, I gotta lotta stuff on my mind so if you stick around and read the whole thing then, thanks! If not, then thanks for even clicking, and feel free to skip!\n\nSo anyways, I\u2019m a 24 year old guy who\u2019s kinda feeling a little lost in what I wanna do. I\u2019ve been drawing as a passion basically my entire life and always thought I\u2019d wanna do something with art as a career, but I dont really know if an industry job like that is all that appealing to me. I\u2019m not an animator, the most I\u2019d wanna do in that field is stuff like character design or storyboards or something. \n\nBut I guess maybe the intimidation of a commitment for a skill I\u2019m not super confident in even through encouragement of others has kept me from going to school for it. Independent artwork always seemed more appealing, like idk webcomics? \n\nBut anyways the other week I went to the San Diego Zoo, and the whole time I was obsessing over the animals and telling my friends dumb facts about the animals from the knowledge I\u2019ve gained from just being into wildlife my whole life. I didn\u2019t even really realize just how much stuff I\u2019ve learned through either nature documentaries, educational YT stuff, or just reading articles/research papers online. He told me I should be some sorta biologist, or nature conservationist, or something related to animals/nature, and I feel like it kinda awoke something in me. \n\nMy whole life I\u2019ve thought if I wasn\u2019t an artist I\u2019d wanna work with marine life, or just nature in some way, but for some reason I always go \u201cOh yeah it\u2019d be cool, but I AM an artist, so that\u2019s probably what I\u2019ll do\u201d. But I don\u2019t know, working with wildlife/nature while keeping art as a personal hobby genuinely seems really appealing. \n\nObviously I don\u2019t wanna just throw myself into a serious field of work like this with rose tinted glasses just to latch onto a sense of stability and purpose. I really am passionate about wildlife and if I do go into this field I\u2019d like to do it right, so I started looking into various jobs related to wildlife and people\u2019s personal experiences in these fields, and really trying to see what career/lifestyle would be best for me. \n\nSo far, wildlife biology, environmental conservation, that kinda work has seemed the most appealing to me. Like I said earlier, I know these kinds of career paths aren\u2019t just something you can \u201cdabble in\u201d just because you like animals and nature. I know there are pros and cons to this work, and the dedication that is required can be a lot. I\u2019ve looked into many people\u2019s personal experiences with these jobs, so I know I\u2019d have to deal with low pay, hard work, and that everything isn\u2019t just hanging out with bears and deer, I really do.\n\nBut I dunno, I think I\u2019d be okay with all that. I mean if people aren\u2019t willing to do what it takes to do what they love, then what good having a passion? Even before I realized these thoughts, I\u2019ve always thought I don\u2019t really care about having the highest paying job, as long it\u2019s something I\u2019m truly passionate about. Obv everyone wants to have money to live comfortably, but if I settled for a job I don\u2019t care about, then it\u2019s not a life worth living imo. I already struggle financially, so it\u2019s not like the idea of it is alien to me, if I worked a job I truly cared about like this, then I think I\u2019d be okay with that.\n\nI didn\u2019t really come here to just spout all this stuff and ask for you to leave a reply with an answer to all my thinking, I just came here to learn and listen. I\u2019d really like to have a genuine discussion, with the honest truth of what this kind of lifestyle can bring. I\u2019d like to just talk about you guys\u2019 experiences in the field of biology, or opinions on career paths, or anything really. \n \nI\u2019m really open to discussion on anything you guys might have to say about any of this. I\u2019m still freshly looking into this field obviously, so really any kind of feedback is helpful. I\u2019ve looked into Wildlife Biology, Conservation Corps, jobs in Department of Fish and Wildlife, whatever man, say whatever you think is a good idea!\n\nThink this is just romanticizing and I dont know what I\u2019m getting into? Think that not an industry art job, nor a job working in nature directly is the move, but it\u2019s in fact a secret third thing? Think I should stick to artwork and keep nature as a hobby instead?

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am 28 years old and work as a warehouse manager in a small company in switzerland. Since my apprenticeship, I have been working in logistics\u2014somewhat unwillingly, as I couldn\u2019t find another apprenticeship at the time. Alongside my job, I am studying business administration and have also earned two additional qualifications in process management. I have made the best of my situation and try every day to be better than I was yesterday.\n\nAt my company, I have taken on additional responsibilities, including creating CAD drawings, developing new products, handling customer projects, sales, complaint management, and price calculations.\n\nI learn very quickly, can adapt well to complex problems, and easily develop an interest in new topics. I also get excited about new things quickly and am always open to trying something different. I try to teach myself something new every day. I also really enjoy learning new things and acquiring new skills in general.\n\nDespite this, I feel like I have wasted years of my life. I don\u2019t enjoy my job at all, and I only go because I feel forced to, as I haven\u2019t been able to find another position. My company is good, and I do receive appreciation, but it doesn\u2019t fulfill me.\n\nI strongly suspect that my name (which is Arabic and very long) or my appearance plays a role in this. My teacher even told me back then that this might unfortunately be the case. (He also helped me secure an apprenticeship as a logistician so that I wouldn\u2019t be left empty-handed. I am very grateful to him for that.)\n\nLast year alone, I sent out over 200 applications and received only one invitation to an interview\u2014despite having my CV adjusted by two career advisors. I should also mention that I don\u2019t enjoy working in large corporations; I prefer small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nMy goal is to become self-employed someday. However, before that, I want to try out different jobs to discover what I enjoy and where potential lies. I feel like I haven\u2019t found my calling yet.\n\nAm I doing something wrong?\n\nHow did you find your calling? What helped you?",

I hate working every single day, it's depressing to think about. Staring at the monitor all day in an office seem so unfulfilling. Also I have IT degree but I'm not working in my field entirely. I just feel like I don't fit in here and the thought of possibly being laid off makes me nervous. The pay is decent but I'm thinking about switching over to nursing. The pay will be better and they have more days off, I also like helping people. I need to take the pre reqs for nursing but I don't wanna quit my job because the job market is also really bad. However, nursing kinda scares me because of the crazy patients and the mean nurses/ being overworked physically. was thinking to do a masters in health info to combine the two but I don't really like coding. I just wanna make over six figures, not work everyday while also doing something fulfilling. Any suggestions to ease this feeling or any plan for me?",

I will do my best to not make this lengthy.\n\nCurrently, 25M (going on 26 in 3 months) with a B.S. in Biomedical Marketing, and 4+1 MBA concentrated in Healthcare Management. For the year and a half, I have been working in Patient Access / Revenue Cycle Management department in the ED of a multi-disciplinary trauma hospital in Florida and love all I have been exposed to whether it be coworkers, patient interactions, exposure to the things you can come across working in an emergency dept, etc. So far in my professional career, my degrees are not living up to their expectation in permitting that desired boost in growth. Despite this, it does excite me to have the degrees back me up and now I have to get my hands on experience in this lucrative (both financially and emotionally in my perspective). Due to personally perceived lack of growth (despite everyone else telling me otherwise), I feel I need to add more flavor to my academic resume with a clinical background job. I am considering going back to school through my employer who partners with a local college that has degree options fully paid for. I am considering such clinical degrees as follows:\n\nNursing A.S.  \nRadiography A.S.  \nSurgical Services A.S\n\nUltimately, I wish to delve into C-suite ranking management in a hospital setting, or the medical device industry as I am very fond of medical equipment at the end of the day. One thing about these 3 clinical backgrounds listed, I look at nursing SCHOOL specifically almost with distaste because of how rigorous I hear it is down to how you breathe while in clinical (joke lol). It does hit my pride a little considering going back to school, but I feel it would benefit me, and I need to put my pride to the side.

        "content": "Sorry if this is long: \n\nI\u2019m 41, single mom (kids age 18, 5) and have always struggled with finding the right career path. I have an associate\u2019s degree in IT (math isn\u2019t my strong suit &amp; I hated every minute of it but ultimately finished).\n\n I spent 14 years working in retail in various roles, including HR, before moving to a corporate role in HR recruiting. I didn\u2019t do much recruiting in that role and spent most of my time learning the ATS and the build in report system. They were not using any features or the reporting and ultimately the work I did with that, saved the department when the company was downsizing. I did that for 2 years before my former boss said I would be a good fit for a training role. For the past 8 years, I\u2019ve been a training specialist, handling eLearning development troubleshooting various training issues, working with training vendors for most of our state compliance training, in house training compliance (tracking food safety laws, certificates, alcohol &amp; tobacco, licenses, etc) and LMS administration for 20,000 users, dabbling in basic web development, training document creation. I wear many hats in this role. While I enjoy most aspects of my job, I\u2019m bored and yearning for more. I\u2019m experiencing burnout. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve recently realized is that my real strengths\u2014and what excites me\u2014are problem-solving, research, and critical thinking. In both my job and personal life, I\u2019ve always been drawn to researching, and helping people out (Examples: in current role I have to keep up with training compliance requirements for about 30 different states. In my personal life, researching real estate laws to help an Ex with a tenant issue, digging into education laws for my son\u2019s IEP, catching hidden charges in my car contract, etc.) Every performance review I\u2019ve had highlights these skills, I am more introverted but enjoy talking with people, I\u2019m well respected in ny company , work closely with various departments and have received multiple raises.\n\nThis led me to consider a career in the legal field. I know it\u2019s not an easy path, especially at my age. I also still need to finish my bachelor\u2019s degree. But given my experience, I feel like law might be a natural fit. My goal would be to leverage my current work experience and company. Ultimately my first goal is to finish my bachelors which will take about 2 years (company offers tuition reimbursement)  and figure it out from there. I do plan on talking to some people who currently work in the legal field both within my company and outside of my company to gain a few different perspectives and see if this is the right path. \n\nHas anyone made a midlife career change into law? Would my experience translate well? What other types of jobs would suit my  skillset? \n\nI am also a very determined individual who came from a crappy background, wasted my younger years,  and want to show my kids that anything is possible (within reason, ha!)

        "content": "I (30,F) been working in my field for almost ten years. In the last six months I made a slight career change. Turned down the corporate job, and opportunity to lead a team etc for a job that would hopefully give me more satisfaction and help me have a better life balance. \n\nAnyway, in this role I am assisting researchers (both older male) complete research projects. It involves a lot of away work generally me and whichever researcher whose project we are working on. \n\nI am feeling a bit uneasy about one of the researchers. Below are some of the reasons. \n\nStory one: \nIn the first month of this job I was away with said researcher. I was setting up new equipment and needed to buy something that would be used in its maintenance. Researcher wouldn\u2019t really engage with the issue all week and then right at the end of the week I read verbatim from the user manual (in a last ditch effort to get approval to purchase the item) and he then just goes \u201coh well of course you need xyz. Thats obvious blah blah\u201d. And just makes out like that was his opinion the whole time. I was a bit annoyed but didn\u2019t let it show (apart from going a bit quiet and saying okay no worries) when he kept going I said \u201cokay, can we just move on for now\u201d. \nHe then started teasing me and kept going in a gross child-like voice \u201cyou\u2019re angry!, you\u2019re annnnnngryyy\u201d. Multiple times. I ignored it and just said I wasn\u2019t angry and that I\u2019d buy the item the next time I was in the office. \n\nI know you guys don\u2019t know me, but generally I\u2019m pretty quiet and happy at work. I don\u2019t let people know when I\u2019m having a bad day so I don\u2019t bring them down too. I wasn\u2019t angry nor was I rude. \n\nStory 2: \nRelated to the above but on every trip since the one described above he will bring it up again and say in the same tone how angry I was and how funny he thought it was. It happened at least six times and after that I said I wasn\u2019t angry and that it isn\u2019t funny to joke about a woman being angry/ emotional at the best of times but especially at work it isn\u2019t a joke and I didn\u2019t like it. He said it had nothing to do with my gender. He has continued to bring it up. In a teasing sort of way. I\u2019ve never reacted emotionally to these comments I either ignore it or I calmly say that I wasn\u2019t angry. \n\n\nStory three: \nA few of our trips we have known that we would finished with enough time to go back home that day. However the researcher has delayed things (I.e. taking an hour for lunch, wanting to finish at 2pm with 90% of the work done cause he is tired) and I hate to think this but I have a thought in my head that he is purposefully dragging it out to extend the field trip. \n\nStory four: \n\n\nThis man has a reputation as being super non communicative. Will disappear for a while and turn up again. Rather quiet, keeps to himself (I.e doesn\u2019t sit with colleagues for lunch etc). I was warned that I might not hear from him for a while at a time but not to take it personally. \n\nI have worked with people like this before and I find it fine. I have developed good ways to communicate and to escalate things if needed. I have been managing projects for a long time and am pretty happy to work independently and just send fyi update emails. I\u2019m calm at work, I think being stressy is a waste of energy. I prefer to think about any road blocks put together a list of potential ways to solve the issue and bring it to my supervisor if I need approval/ their input. \n\nThis hasn\u2019t really been the case for me. He constantly walks into my office and asks if there is anything I need him to do for me. He will hang around in my office and I don\u2019t really know what to say. Last week he was leaving for a conference and he came and said goodbye four or five times in the space of 20-30 minutes. \n\nHe is currently at the conference and there is a two hour time difference. He calls me at my 730pm (his 930pm). I know I shouldn\u2019t have answered but anyway). He said he was just calling to see if everything was going okay. He had received several fyi emails from me that day just about confirming hire cars or plane tickets. Nothing that would suggest anything was wrong at all. He then proceeds to tell me about the dramas of the conference and then asks me about really low priority things that were send out in a group email by our manager this morning. \n\nThere have been other things too, like some gross racist and homophobic comments. Which is me just painting more of a picture of the man I guess. \n\nI will add that he has been nice to me. He values my opinion and doesn\u2019t seem to get caught up in the hierarchical structure that is a bit prevalent in my team. He kees saying I am not paid enough and I need to ask for more money and that if he was allowed to sign off on it he would. Which was nice to hear at first but now I have started to feel a bit icky about it too. \n\nIf you\u2019re still reading thanks for putting up with me. My question is what\u2019s your take on this situation? My gut is saying somethings not right and it might be escalating. But also I know I might be a bit sensitive to it as I am gay and I acknowledge that I can have a bit of a short fuse when it comes to male attention. \n\nI have nearly three months of fieldwork in remote areas where a lot of the time it will just be me and him. And maybe I am a bit stressed about that and am starting to over think things? \n\nAm I over analysing the situation? ",

Now I feel like I\u2019m not where I want to be in life at 27.\n\nI started in August, everything seemed great, but it wasn\u2019t. My manager didn\u2019t like me for some reason. I think I intimidated her, here\u2019s why:\n\nShe asked for help with her PC, I tried to help her, she shooed me away with her hand when I couldn\u2019t figure out the problem.\n\nThe co leader made a comment about my frizzy hair in the 2nd week of the job. I thought it was a joke so I let it slide. My colleague came back from outside with an umbrella in her hand, so I asked if it was raining, she said, no it\u2019s drizzling, but I don\u2019t want to get my hair frizzy. I said, neither do I. He said, but your hair is already frizzy. I said his name in a jokey way to show I couldn\u2019t believe he said that. He said, but it\u2019s true, it\u2019s frizzy. \n\nI arranged lunch with him as one of my goals was to get to know my colleagues and he was one of the few people in the office. He came over to speak to me and said\u201d I can\u2019t understand a word you say, it\u2019s hard to understand you because you don\u2019t even open your mouth when you speak\u201d. I couldn\u2019t believe he said this! I was in shock and said I\u2019ll try and speak better then he said you mustn\u2019t change a thing. Really didn\u2019t want to go to lunch but didn\u2019t want to cancel on the co head of the department.\n\nCame back from a meeting, the director asked how I found it, I said great and asked if I could ask some questions, he said sure! My manager rolled her eyes at him. \n\nSeveral things happened which made me think I wasn\u2019t liked or fitted in. I\u2019m the only woc there along with an Asian man. This isn\u2019t an issue as I have been the only woc in my old job. Colleagues inviting everyone for coffee, so I went to, they seemed annoyed that I came and one guy actively avoided speaking to me. But in the office, he would speak to me.\n\nManager was sat next to me and asked my colleague if he had heard from me, he said not really, she said what on earth is wrong with her! I went to my car and cried.  She constantly vaped in the office and spoke to me in harsh tones but I let it slide because I was new and she was nice most of the time. \n\nMy colleague who is my buddy had been ignoring my emails when I asked for a catch-up. The next day I left. I have a freelance job which earns more than that role but the job is not stable. I had a ftc in a finance job which ended in Feb. Now, I feel like I should have gone to hr to complain, stayed and played the game. A part of me thinks I made an impulsive choice to leave the next day. \n\nI told myself to never work in that area again, as I had a job there before where I left the next day due to my racist colleague whose mum ran the senior department. The first day he shouted at me down the phone for not being able to find him in the car park, I froze. He also said\u201d my manager has no power really, his mum is more senior\u201d. \n\nHowever, I really needed a new job as my old one was laying everyone off. Something told me not to go into defence because I had moral issues. \n\nHow do I make better decisions in the future? I did speak to another woc grad there who confirmed the racism and that she planned to leave aswell. Am I just making bad choices in life? Why can\u2019t I find a good job to fit me. I went to therapy for years to tackle child hood issues and my eating issue. We also touched on this issue, but I thought I solved it. I\u2019m trying to keep myself busy by doing more courses to improve my job prospects.\n\nI even made a fool of myself. I emailed the other director to let him know I had left( he was travelling overseas), he was very fond of me and sent me a nice message. The next day I asked him if he could reconsider the job. My partner said I should ask. I also spoke to hr as she gave me her number if anything changes. The recruiter who got me the job told me to call hr as the company needs to sort their practices out. I spoke to her and explained the issue she said we could have resolved it and the business may not want someone who makes impulsive decisions like that. Which is true, I just need to work on this. The reason I didn\u2019t mention the racism to her when leaving is because hr works for the company and I couldn\u2019t accuse the co head of being racist as a newbie, it was clear I wasn\u2019t wanted there by my manager or colleague( it\u2019s a small team of 4). After quitting, my period came and it was the worst. I don\u2019t know if this has something to do with my emotions. ",

        "content": "**Hello everyone,**\n\nI\u2019m 28 years old and live in Northern Italy. I find myself at a point in my work life where I feel a bit lost and frustrated, and I\u2019m looking for advice on how to handle the situation. Here\u2019s some background:\n\n**Current job:**\u00a0I work as a marketing commercial technician in a company focused on furniture and design, primarily working on commercial development. I\u2019ve been with the company since 2020, and although they continue to reward me and trust me, I often feel dissatisfied with my role and my skills.\n\n**Dissatisfaction:**\u00a0Despite the company recognizing and rewarding my efforts, I can\u2019t seem to feel fulfilled in my role. It feels like I\u2019m not reaching my full potential, and on some days, I feel useless and incompetent. I want to change my life, but I struggle to find the energy for new projects, especially because I\u2019m so exhausted after work.\n\n**Passions and interests:**\u00a0I\u2019m very interested in exploring new professional activities, like selling collectible items (which I already do on the side, earning about \u20ac100 per month), and I\u2019m also curious about how to start an independent business (maybe with a VAT number). However, I lack self-confidence and clarity on how to take the first step.\n\n**Salary:**\u00a0My current salary is around \u20ac33k with a company car for personal use, and I\u2019ll be getting a bump starting in 2025 due to a flat increase for overtime hours, bringing the figure up to around \u20ac35k. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s worth continuing on this path or if it\u2019s time for a significant change.\n\n**Difficulty finding new opportunities:**\u00a0Another concern I have is that, given my studies (I have a language high school diploma and a degree in languages and literature), I\u2019m struggling to find a job that offers me a similar salary or other benefits like the company car. Even though I\u2019ve worked in this field for years, I feel that my CV isn\u2019t strong enough to apply for positions that could offer more significant growth, especially roles requiring more specialized skills or a different academic background. The most important thing to mention is the 17 business trips I\u2019ve taken around the world to strengthen relationships and find new clients.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* How can I overcome this sense of dissatisfaction and find more energy and motivation to grow in my current role or explore new possibilities?\n* Do you have any advice on how to manage a career transition, perhaps even considering starting an independent business from scratch?\n* How can I balance my passions and my work life in a way that makes both satisfying?\n* How can I overcome the difficulty of finding a new job that offers me a similar salary (\u20ac35k) and benefits, considering that my CV and academic background seem to limit my opportunities?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or support! Any thoughts or personal experiences are very much appreciated.",

        "title": "Career plans, decisions and why I feel like i failed it now. Can you help me please?",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\u00a0\n\nI (w, 27) have just started my first regular job and feel like I don\u2019t live up to my potential every single day.\n\nHere is why.  \n\n\nI graduated with a Bachelor (2019, pre-covid) and two Masters (International Relations/International Finance - Double Degree) from Switzerland, but I live in Austria. My GPA is not bad (CH highest grade is 6, I have 5.22 and it is considered not perfect but above average). However, I never found a job in any field I tried.\n\nAfter my graduation in December 2022, I was traveling and then started working remotely and freelance (correction services for Bachelor, Master and Doctoral theses). I also occasionally worked freelance in a private language center as a German trainer since it is my mother tongue and at that time, there were more Ukrainian refugees. However, the center does not need me any more since it has qualified teachers and the correction services faded with the emergence of ChatGPT etc. So the last year (2024) I have mainly been traveling and when I was at home, surviving on bartender/waitress/private tutoring work. I tried hard from October-December 2024, but could not find a job. Of course, my CV is completely fu\\*\\*ed up now and this does not help at all.  \n\n\nIn autumn 2024, I had three plans:\u00a0\n\na)find a job in my field\u00a0\n\nb) do work as an English teacher with TEFL in a foreign country (which did not work out very well because English is not my mother tongue and most countries would not give me a visa).\u00a0\n\nC) do some random stuff (stewardess, mainly because my friend was working at the airline and said it is a cool job, something for me as I love traveling, other options were doing a yoga certificate, workaway, eternal world travel). I know I should not do this any more because my CV is bad enough. I was just having that as a back up option and to give it a shot. I did not get in as a stewardess anyway\u2026lol.\u00a0\n\nD) become a teacher. My mother is a teacher and said it is easy to get in. I also have +10 years experience in private tutoring but am aware it is way different from teaching in a classroom).\n\n  \n\n\nSo now I started working as a teacher at a public middle school. It was possible because my country has a severe teacher shortage so people with a Master can also work as a teacher, they just earn 5-10% less.\u00a0\n\nI am doing this job since January 7, 2025, and every day I am asking myself now: Was that it? My career, aspirations and everything\u2026can I really just stay at the school, teaching totally unmotivated children (80% of the time I am in a class which is just horrible, other teachers say that too. Students have severe learning impairments and concentration issues and I am better at explaining than motivating this group I guess\u2026if nobody listens it is just so difficult. Even thought the topics, e.g. In geography would be so interesting, most of the time we cannot do a lot). So contrary to my original plan, I just cannot stop thinking about my future :/\n\n\n\nMy normal career ideas before all that mess were the following:\n\nMy focus was on sustainable development, so first I wanted to work in sustainability management in a private company or in an international organisation dealing with issues that I can contribute. My fields of experience are centered around sustainable food supply chains, food waste and sustainable consumption/production/zero waste. I have written my Bachelor and Master thesis about these topics too. I was also ready to work in the area of climate for example. Unfortunately, the only \u201eprofessional\u201c experience I have is a pre-covid internship in a local company in Singapore as well as some non-profit activities (project head at a university association, sustainable food blog; my own blog about zero waste, food waste and conscious consumption).\n\nAs it should be a very versatile and interesting field, I also thought about consulting. I was doing an internship in a small company in Germany, focused on sustainability. I found the work to be ok but way too much MS Excel. Then, I had interviews in 2022 and 2023 at Two T1 companies (McK, Bain) which I fucked up and so I cancelled the third one (BCG). Since then, I did not try it any more.\n\nLast autumn however, I was just applying to anything somewhat related to my field, incl. Banking, assistant of the CEO at a liquor company, tourism manager for my province (I would have loved that one so much).\n\n  \n\n\nMy goals were:\n\n* Work mode - I would prefer to have a job where I am in contact with people, maybe only 50% of the time on the computer. I hate sitting in front of it all day, my eyes and body hurt and I feel really bad. This is something good about the teaching - I can move a lot.\n* Work mode: If I can avoid it, I would not like to work +50h per week but if the job is really worth it I guess it would not matter. I just value health over burnout and the companys wellbeing so I have boundaries.\n* Salary - I do not have the expectations of the other students at my former uni (acc to a survey, most of them said they wanted to earn 100 K CHF as an entry level salary - Swiss context. I am in Austria now and earn 45 K EUR but before tax/social security\u2026 So my salary is not very great if I also want to save money). I would clearly prefer 60 K +. It would not make a huge difference in my country of course as they rip you off with taxes anyway.\n* Saving and real estate: My aim is to save min. EUR 1500 every month, better more. I invest in stocks, ETFs etc. and try to have a good, balanced portfolio, my goal is also to buy a flat in 1.5 years. Maybe not in my region (germany-austria-switzerland) though, prices are outright hilarious compared to 15 years ago).\n* Topics: Actually, I wanted to work for sustainability and have a positive impact on one/more of the SDGs with my work. Over time, I forgot about this mission and just tried to get something to earn money. But I feel that it would be the right thing to do because I am just more convinced that I like the job if it is related to a sustainability field I am passionate about and actually good at. I guess I am still trying to find my calling\u2026 ( I love writing but really about novels and travel and I cannot make money with it for now, so this is not realistic at the moment. I have so many interests so sometimes it is hard to decide. But sustainability is what I am good and experienced at even though I cannot prove that very well due to my lack of experience).\n* Location: I was open to different countries but found it is hard to find a job that is further away. I would love to work e.g. in Singapore, the US or the UK. I have the issue that in my own country Austria, I only like my province and am aware that there are not many jobs. I would be open to Switzerland especially if it is possible to commute but in Switzerland they prefer Swiss people. A Swiss recruiter tried to arrange an interview for me but I did not get anything in half a year. I also applied to jobs in Germany - no offers.\n\n  \n\n\nNow I am still thinking how I should continue:\n\n1. Teaching: Just proceed with the teaching. I am aware that after a few months, probably you cannot say too much and maybe it will get more interesting and/or easier with the second school year. The holidays are a big plus of course. I like the other teachers but cannot say too much about them yet, I think the true nature of people is only visible after a longer timespan. They are just a lot different from me, mostly have families already and live a very traditional life.\u00a0 Maybe I won\u2018t make new friends or be inspired but it could be worse. However, the salary is bad in comparison to what I should (and could theoretically earn) with my degree e.g. In banking. My hope is also that if I can collect 1.5-2 years of teaching experience, I can teach in another country like China, a plan that I had and that did not work out with the TEFL due to the mentioned visa problems. I would love to go back to Asia since I was working / studying in Thailand, Singapore and South Korea already.\n2. Start a PhD: Actually, I wanted to work in my field (in sustainability) first and then do a PhD at some point. This was always the plan though. I have three super interesting research fields (probably a topic for another reddit though, I might add the link here later) and want to apply for scholarships from next year to start in september 2026. I would not start now because then I could not include US universities since I have not done the GRE or GMAT yet. Also, I am quite overwhelmed with the teaching mostly. I want to do a PhD to stay in university and become a prof later. I am aware it is hard but it could be the right thing for me. I love reading, researching, am familiar with the methods and have also self-published three books (spy fiction \u201eDer Cornea-Deal\u201c and \u201eDie Virenfusion\u201c (German) and, a travel story collection with factual info about South Korea \u201eSinchon Style\u201c, English). Also, i have some insight into teaching now.\n3. Try my field again: Get a banking or other traineeship roughly related to my field with a realistic chance: Maybe the times where I wanted to work at UN and \u201eimprove the world\u201c are over. I have seen the reality and know it is super hard to get in. There is the possibility of applying to a traineeship at a bank nearby and I might go for that.\u00a0 I live nearby and a friend recommended me to do it. I just need to start autumn 2026 already I guess, and if my aim is to do a PhD later I will also waste time\u2026I am just not familiar with the everyday tasks at the bank and during the internship and to be honest with myself, I am more motivated by the money and the possibility to cooperate with the Asian branches and to travel there than the other tasks etc.\u00a0\n\nNow I do not know what I should do.\u00a0\n\nWhich of the options (A, B,C) based on my background would you choose and why?\u00a0\n\nOr do you have a different idea for me?\n\nI am so happy to hear from you, maybe you have gone through a different phase in life. \n\nThanks to everyone who read til the end. I know it is a huge mess which is why it is so hard for me to think and do something about it.\u00a0",

That particular company had rubbed me the wrong way in terms of the way they viewed their entry level team members.

I am 34 years old (M), I'm originally from the USA, but I've been living in East Germany since 2018. I did my BA in international relations and did Peace Corps in Africa, and always considered doing something like diplomacy or state department work, but once I saw a bit of the life of embassy workers etc it seemed far less glamorous and cool than I thought. I came to Germany  to get an MA in area studies (focus on Africa) and have been doing a (PhD Imperial history/British Empire) since 2021, which I should defend this year after some editing. I was working on a research project as an admin basically while doing it, and it wasn't well paid but enough for East Germany.

I have to get up at 5:30 to commute an hour on the bus to a small town school which is hard, but usually, by 1:30 im done with class, but there's still plenty of preparation etc. I dont have much savings and investments, and I feel like I really need to buckle down and save some money etc but I wonder if I made a good choice at times.\n\nI got some comments from friends and family saying, \"Oh you got a PhD to teach middle school?\" or \" I imagined you doing something different\", and I wondered if I was living up to my potential.

I don't have formal education as a data analyst; I completed my undergraduate degree in Economics and Finance. When I graduated, there were very few opportunities in Lahore, Pakistan, where I worked.\n\nMy career started poorly with an extremely horrible experience in my first job, where I faced severe sexual harassment by the company's owner. At that time, no one took women seriously at work, so I couldn't do anything about it and had to leave. I couldn't even share my experience with anyone close to me because the culture I grew up in was inclined to limit women's mobility and financial independence, and I didn't want to be blamed and forced to stay at home without a job.\n\nAnyway, I moved on but felt really lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. What made it worse was that I was going in and out of extreme depressive phases and had a lot of anxiety since childhood.

I am a performance marketer, strategist, client manager and growth consultant all in one. My title is Head of Digital Transformation.\n\nI didn't choose my career; I ended up moving from one job to another until I became known as the \"fashion marketing girl.\" The main appeal of the job was that it allowed me to work with data, derive insights, and recommend or implement strategies. I don't have formal education as a data analyst; I completed my undergraduate degree in Economics and Finance. When I graduated, there were very few opportunities in Lahore, Pakistan, where I worked.\n\nMy career started poorly with an extremely horrible experience in my first job, where I faced severe sexual harassment by the company's owner. At that time, no one took women seriously at work, so I couldn't do anything about it and had to leave. I couldn't even share my experience with anyone close to me because the culture I grew up in was inclined to limit women's mobility and financial independence, and I didn't want to be blamed and forced to stay at home without a job.\n\nAnyway, I moved on but felt really lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. What made it worse was that I was going in and out of extreme depressive phases and had a lot of anxiety since childhood.

He has belittled me and told me that I have never worked for a real company so I don't know how things work. He is quick to point out how I lack experience because of my lack of privilege.

It has been tough and hard to understand the new software, and all. This is my 2nd day on the job, so we\u2019ll see where it takes me. It\u2019s so confusing, a bit overwhelming. \nBut anyway, prior to this I was in my 3rd year of radiography in Australia. I didn\u2019t love it. I hated it to be frank. Maybe I just don\u2019t like working a physical demanding job, and got extremely burnout. \nIn my 2nd year, I had the opportunity to work in a public hospital and tbh hated my placement time. I\u2019m really grateful for the opportunity tho. Just the toxic work environment and the moving/rapid in and out of patients + the patient behaviour and reduced mobility was very difficult + gossip. \nI then wanted to move to computer science , however was overwhelmed and moved back into radiography after a week of it in uni. It was just hard to learn as everything and everyone already knew some level of coding already + many layoffs were happening and I got a bit scared. My parents hated the idea of me being in computer science as my dad has a job in it and my mum tried it but didn\u2019t quite understand it so dropped out of it and not pursuing it. She\u2019s now an enrolled nurse at a public hospital. \nI was told by my parents to go back and finish my radiography degree. I managed to do my 3rd year of radiography after dropping out of computer science one week in.  I have completed all the academical side of things (theory/knowledge based course) but need to do the practical side of things (placement) which will be another two more years. In my 3rd year of placement last year, I failed due to many factors which related to how I handle criticism and referred to me as defensive and self-justifying. My supervisors also said I likely would pass, but I can\u2019t argue what they say after my feedback. I was completely wrecked by these comments, as I had a good time on placement and everyone seemed so nice. I asked for feedback after each of my examinations and wanted to get to know the staff better. I was confident in my abilities and was good at it. Fast and quick paced. I was pretty good at positioning patients and all. But I burned out, lost passion. I was waking up at 5:30am and the place was far away. I was putting in 110% effort for a total of 9weeks last year and that fail really hit hard. Made me reconsider what to do with my life. \nMy parents say you should go back into the degree, but I\u2019m not sure. I feel down and honestly lost passion for the career. I don\u2019t think I want to do it for the rest of my life. \n\nI don\u2019t have any goals or passion for anything. I\u2019m really lost with my direction of life. I frankly haven\u2019t found work that makes me passionate. I\u2019ve realised that all jobs are just the same. \n\nWhat do you think I should do? What career I should get into? Or should I go back to just finish radiography off next year, having to do another 2yrs of placements I dread? Should I risk it, what if I don\u2019t end up liking it and quitting again? It will cost be time and money. \nWhat should I do during my gap year?",

To give some background, I have a Bachelors degree in Public Health with a minor in Data Science and a Masters degree in Public Health with a concentration in Population Health Analytics. I was amongst the pandemic graduates of 2020 when finishing my bachelors degree so my career journey has not been a super traditional one. While in grad school, I worked as a Nonprofit Consultant for a local nonprofit profit then came across what I thought was the opportunity of a lifetime as a Business Analyst for a Health Policy IT team within a consulting company. I am the FIRST person  in my family to work in corporate or even to have a masters degree so this job at 65K, 10% yearly bonus, &amp; 401K match sounded like everything my grandparents said I should Have. I worked in this role tirelessly trying to learn how to navigate a full time remote job and grad school full time. In February of 2024, I came across my current opportunity which sounded like a dream. My Director (who I report directly to) was amazing and we clicked instantly. The only downfall was I asked For 80K base salary and was told by HR I would need 10 years of experience in addition to my Masters degree which tore me because I have over 100K in loans. After talking with my family, I relunctantly took a pay cut. (I had started to make 70K plus 10% bonus in consulting and ended up taking 63.5K w/ no bonus) my thought process was that I wanted To move into a more data heavy role that aligned with my masters degree which it did. I can admit my Director has taken me under his wing for the last year. I have become fluent in SQL, Power BI, &amp; financial modeling; However, I am really starting to feel my pay cut. I picked up a seasonal part time at Apple over the holidays which helped me tremendously but that role ended last month and has me examining my current situation. I love that my current job is remote, easygoing, I have the freedom to learn whatever I want but the pay isn't cutting it anymore. I'm willing to be uncomfortable to make more money. Do I attempt to job hop after only a year or do I hold Out and pray I can get 80K this year? ",

My sector is small - familiar faces pop up everywhere - and I\u2019ve been managing my own cases for years under an exceptional, globally recognised lawyer before they left the profession.\n\nI also have ADHD, a young child, and work from home almost full-time, aside from client meetings and my set office day.\n\nMy current role is fine. I do a lot of senior-level work beyond my official Grade C title, and I\u2019m known firm-wide as the go-to for technical and contentious issues. I\u2019m involved in hiring, training, and policy discussions, and my boss has said she sees me as a future partner. But despite positive conversations about a promotion in April, I\u2019ve been told that even with a step up to Grade B, there\u2019s no guarantee of a salary bump. There have also been internal discussions about financial performance - not that we\u2019ve missed target, but we haven\u2019t exceeded expectations as hoped, which makes me wonder whether promotions and pay rises will be conservative this year.\n\nNow, I have something in the pipeline. A competitor has approached me for a senior role, team lead, with a pathway to partnership. The pay bump could be \u00a320k+, but there are trade-offs: more office time, a frazzled partner who is admittedly overwhelmed, and an existing team with structural issues they want me to help fix. I enjoy problem-solving and team-building, but do I want that responsibility all the time? The client base is also slightly different, shifting from predominantly children to older clients.\n\nAnother factor is external training I planned to undertake, which my current firm supports and would mostly fund. The new firm wouldn\u2019t cover it, though I could afford to pay for it myself with the higher salary. That qualification would help with a long-term goal - possibly relocating abroad - so there\u2019s a bigger-picture consideration as well.\n\nI can\u2019t shake an odd feeling about this move, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s intuition or imposter syndrome. Am I just afraid of stepping out of my comfort zone? Or is my gut telling me something\u2019s not quite right?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who\u2019s been in a similar position - how did you really know when it was time to move on?",

I got the role through an apprenticeship (UK) which I passed with a distinction grade, but my employer wanted to keep me on before that because I worked very hard.\n\nWhen I began (with no prior IT education), juggling both work and learning was difficult, but I was motivated to apply myself fully - not out of love for IT though, but because I really wanted to give the career a chance and figure out if I'd be good at it/wanted to pursue it. I had no previous passions or goals, I've always struggled with executive dysfunction and other comorbidities along with no direction in life. Fast forward now, I've completed the apprenticeship but I've burnt out from the job badly. I know more about IT, but the thought of learning anything more technical than I already know overwhlems me. I had to take time off because the burnout was so bad.\n\nI think my lack of passion for IT is the reason I'm put off, it upsets me because I know I'm capable of working hard - the cost is just higher for me, with pushing through my executive dysfunction and masking all day. I also never pursued computer science, and I've heard many people with ASD love coding especially, but I fear that I'd just have the same issues I have now in that field (I'm stressed by the fast-paced, unpredictable workload and I dread the idea of complex tasks/issues).\n\nI don't want to stay at this help desk role forever because I know it won't sustain me mentally or financially, but I don't know if I should push through into another IT field or transfer my skills elsewhere. FYI, I can socialise and work with others fine, but I definetely prefer working alone.

        "title": "Do I stay in Malaysia with an APAC Lead role or take a Sydney-based Country Lead role?",
        "content": "Hi everyone. I am in my early 30s and have recently been offered the opportunity to move to Sydney, AU for a role. Never worked overseas before and am very unsure about what to do. Bosses are keen for me to pick up the role as they need to backfill the AU role, so I worry the advice they are giving me is to benefit them. \n\nHere are the facts I can share (without company or industry info):\n\nCurrent Job\n1. Based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n2. SME/SPOC role overseeing 18 markets in Asia Pacific.\n3. High visibility and can interact with many different markets (colleagues and clients). Currently involved with regional projects due to job nature. \n4. Paid MYR 253,500 per annum (USD 57k) excluding bonuses and other benefits.\n5. I have colleagues reporting into me based in various markets. Direct reports 5&gt;, with 50&gt; in the department.\n6. Occasionally get to travel for work (not really a benefit tbh). \n7. Considered management in my current role, but underpaid due to country and age.\n\nNew Job\n1. Based in Sydney, Australia.\n2. Country Lead managing Ops, P&amp;L, Finance, Client Management etc overall for Australia.\n3. Compared to other markets, AU is much smaller and hence, have much lower visibility. Minimal interactions regionally. \n4. Job offers AUD 150,000 per annum (USD 94.4k) excluding bonuses and other benefits. By job band, this would be slightly higher. According to the hiring manager, I might have room to push slightly higher, but unsure. \n5. I would have less than 10 team members spread across Australia. \n6. Allows me to diversify my skillset which is important for my industry.\n\nPersonal Facts:\n1. Married and have a dog. \n2. Travels internationally 2-3 times a year. \n3. Live in a good neighbourhood in Kuala Lumpur. \n4. Has a car but travels via public transport to work.\n5. Enjoys cooking with wife. But the weekend dinners and brunches out are a must to stay sane.\n6. Wife has a job. Would need to quit and find remote roles or possibly find something in Sydney. She is willing to move. \n7. We have properties in Malaysia rented out and currently living in our own place. \n\nWhile my current role is interesting and has high visibility, the SME-heavy nature of my role at an early age does worry me. Worries = am I specializing at too early an age? \n\nWe are also incredibly comfortable in Malaysia but I wonder if this Sydney opportunity could lead to greater things. My wife has also experienced burn out and hence, isn't against moving to Australia where the societal pressures (Chinese relatives) and rat race (at least our circle) isn't as intense. \n\nAre we crazy for even thinking about this? Is 150k AUD in Sydney even enough for a couple? According to ChatGPT, my tame home would be around AUD 9k and monthly expenses would be up to AUD6-7k for the 3 of us (incl my dog). Is this realistic or too low/high? \n\nWould appreciate any advice! Please roast me if needed. ",

        "content": "Looking for advice on how to start looking for a career\n\nHi,\n\nI\u2019m a 23M and I\u2019m interested in learning how to go about finding a career that I can pursue long term.\n\nA little bit of background, I have been to university twice but had to drop out both times. The first time I got to my final year studying Economics and finance and the second time I did around 6 months of a cybersecurity degree.\n\nUnfortunately I have struggled with addiction since I was 19 which is the reason I have had to drop out. I am currently in supported living for people in recovery and am in a 3 month program to help.\n\nThis time I feel very confident and ready to start taking my life to the next step.\n\nI really disliked economics but I somewhat enjoyed cybersecurity but I would be willing to try other things.\n\nI am an intelligent person and I know I have high potential, sadly I have had to suffer with addiction issues that made me think otherwise however the evidence I have suggests that I am a very intelligent person.\n\nI have no idea how I would go about researching what type of careers there are,  and which route to take to enter them.\n\nI\u2019m not willing to go back into full time education.\n\nAny advice or tips would be much appreciated !",

I have worked as researcher which I enjoyed a lot. Bit need here. I have been very passionate about social causes and uplifting others. But majorly it was coming from spot where I felt unseen and I didn't want same for others. Fast forward, I got burnt out. Now I don't feel writing at all and feel redundant in current economy. Also, after my diagnosis with ADHD and depression, I have realised why I could never fit in corporates. I am quite blunt and sensitive, not a good combo for corporate. \n\nI want a remote global career as I have to travel. A lot. I don't know what to do anymore. \n\nPlease guide.  ",

        "content": "I need some advice. I\u2019m 24, don\u2019t have a degree, and I\u2019m really confused about what I want to do. I come from a family who doesn\u2019t have much money, so I want to have a job where I\u2019ll feel financially stable.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought about becoming a vet tech. I love animals and have loved them since I was little. I have experience working with dogs, so I know it can get gross sometimes. The only issue is that vet techs don\u2019t really get paid enough for me to feel financially stable. I live in a city very close to Boston, so the cost of living is high. From what I can find, vet tech salaries range from $18-35 per hour.\n\nI was also thinking about possibly pursuing a degree in radiology, ultrasound technology, or biotechnology, but I feel like I\u2019m too \u201cstupid\u201d for those fields. I\u2019m an introvert with a bit of social anxiety, but I usually do well when talking one-on-one.\n\nCan you please give examples of jobs that offer security and financial stability? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

I love this job a lot as I love animals but it\u2019s doesn\u2019t pay well and it is taking a toll on me physically. I\u2019ve started to develop carpal tunnel from the vibrations of the blow dryer. I\u2019d like to go back to school and get a better job.\n\nMy main requirement is that whatever I do I don\u2019t want to be a slave to my job. I have no desire to work anything beyond a typical 9 to 5. I would like a nice paying job but I have no desire to be crazy rich, I live pretty simply and don\u2019t want a lot. So a work life balance is a lot more important to me than taking a job where good pay comes at the expense of that.\n\nI\u2019d also like something not incredibly boring. Doesn\u2019t need to be the most exciting thing in the world, just something that gives me a bit of variety and interest.\n\nI\u2019ve thought about Urban Planning and MRI/radiology technician but is there anything else I should look into that I\u2019m not thinking about?",

        "content": "Capitalism is kicking my disabled ass rn and im sick of living paycheck to paycheck. I want to support my family and my only goal is medium to low stress environments and something that at least makes me 60k - 70k or 6 figures if i can put in the work for a simple liscence or degree. College can be an option but its a struggle honestly. \n\nIm rather high functioning autistic, so i can handle some stress, but im so burnt out all the time at my current job (Starbucks Barista) and im just sick of dealing with such a high stress job for such little pay. And I do not want to climb the ladder because all the management is horrible and rude and negative at my location. \n\nI'm a very cheerful person and i tend to be brutally honest. I dont enjoy working somewhere where i have to lie to get my paycheck (like sales). I'm not great with kids unless its a passive role where im around them but not taking care of them solely. I dont have much experience in excel but im willing to learn, and im good with technology. I'm an artist but i dont really want a job related to art, but a somewhat creative job would be nice.\n\nI do not want to do nursing/medical, but i've thought about an anaesthesiologist or phlebotomist.\n\nAlso a job i dont have to work a full 40 hr work week and make enough to exist. I currently work about 34/36 hrs and its perfect for me.\n\nThings I have considered regardless if they have met the criteria or not: \n- IT Support (ideal but doesnt pay much)\n- Forklift driver (sounds sad and boring but if it means money ill do it)\n- phlebotomist (im not afraid of blood or needles but idk about the stress levels)\n- anesthesiologist (the ammount of schooling is intimidating)\n- real estate (it makes good money but i dont want to be a part of the housing problem in the US for my own pollitical reasons)\n- school librarian (probably not the best pay, or the best job security, but it sounds fulfilling )",
