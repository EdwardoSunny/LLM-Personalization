2025-02-27 22:19:05,1izs6o7,Partner is moving in and need insight on how to handle tax and legal implications,"Hey all! I own a house and am still making payments on it. My partner is planning to move in and we wanted to figure out what I would need to do to prepare myself to minimize taxes on their contributions and protect my assets. 

I used a legal template for a cohabitation agreement and I added the following 3 clauses:

1. Partner will contribute 800 monthly flat towards household expenses.
2. Partner will not receive any equity of the house of cohabitation.
3. In the event of separation initiated by either individual, partner will be given 30 days to live in the house before they must vacate themselves and their belongings from the premises.


We both agree with the terms but I was curious: 

1. Would I need to declare the $800 on my taxes? 
2. Would they receive equity even if we have this agreement in place? 
3. Does this reasonably protect me from a potential squatting scenario? Should I add any more?

Located in Maryland and we plan to both sign it and have 2 witnesses sign it

2025-02-27 21:46:39,1izrflb,Did I make the right choice?,"2024 was a tough year financially due to a divorce and I fell behind on a number of bills.  It was supposed to be just a couple months and would work to get back on track but a couple months became a few, then several and then an entire year.  Much of the debt was from the pandemic when my wife at the time stopped working and my income was also cut drastically so used up savings and ran up debt like a lot of people. 

I had  $12k stashed away  and was really trying to not touch it but I just couldn’t get myself out of this damn hole and keep running my credit into the ground.  I was over 740 at the beginning of 2024.  And the same time 2025 it fell below 600.  

So I’m caught up on a number of bills.  And that feels good . I hate being past due.  Still have too much debt than I’m comfortable with and it hurts to see that stash now at $0.

But now wondering if this was the best use of that stash. I wonder if I should have used it to just pay off a couple cards completely and then just try to catch up on the rest instead of using it to just get caught up on all the bills I fell behind on.  I had a lot. 

Probably should have asked before I did but here I am.  Looking for validation or a ‘wtf were you thinking?’

EDIT:  thanks for the feedback on what I should have done.  Noted and agreed.  But can’t change what I did so just seeing if you would have made the right decision with the cash- pay off 2 cards completely or spread across 6 accounts (cards and a couple utilities) to bring current. So still have balances to pay with the decision I went with.  Had I went the other way.  I’d have 2 less card balances but still be past due on the others.

My SO and I are looking to buy or build a house in the next few years, and we're not too sure how much we need to plan on having saved. We're currently in a HCOL area, and our cost of living will decrease, other than any large investments such as the down payment. Our plan so far:
- stop renting and move to a New England state within the next 2-5 years
- start working remotely for a pay cut
- live there for as long as we can

- should have about $250k in savings at time of purchase
- income likely to be around $120k combined before taxes after moving
- no current debts or loans, 700+ credit scores
- building a house would cost about $600k, not counting land, which seems crazy
- we want a good bit of land, anywhere from another $200k to $400k

2. iShares Advisory Fee: $190.87 (.3220% of iShares current price of $592.764)
3. iShares Third Party Fee: $43.82 (.084% of iShares current price of $592.764)

2025-02-27 20:34:53,1izprfz,"Impending layoff, not sure what to do.","I recently learned about an upcoming layoff in about six months. Due to circumstances I can't disclose, I need to stay until it happens, and I’m uncertain about finding another job in the same industry right away. There’s a possibility of a severance payout, but I can’t rely on it for planning. Plus who knows what the economy may do in the next 6 months at it's current trajectory.

Complicating things, I invested in a large wooded lot near my hometown, using savings and proceeds from selling a rental property, with plans to eventually build and rent cabins. Around the same time, I bought a new truck, expecting to pay it off quickly with a substantial bonus that never materialized. Since I needed a truck for the land and planned to keep it long-term, I opted for a higher-end model - something I wouldn’t have done had I known the bonus wasn’t coming. Now, with unplanned car payments and depleted savings, my financial situation is more uncomfortable than anticipated. That said, I always planned to keep the truck until it falls apart and won’t replace it unless taking a loss on negative equity makes financial sense.

Additionally, my mom moved in with us a year ago and relies on minimal Social Security. Downsizing would make sense since my kids are mostly out of the house, but her needs limit my flexibility. My focus is on preparing for the worst-case scenario, especially given the current economic climate.

Debts:

* Current home is \~$650k on the low end, owe about $390k @ 6% \~ $3.5k a month.
* Land is $420k, owe nothing other than $2k in taxes every year.
* Car is \~$1.7k a month, has $75k left @ 2%. If I sold I'd maybe get $55k? (-$20k 🤦‍♂️)
* $300k in retirement, I'm 45.
* $100k in savings.
* No credit card, no school loans.

I think my high-level options are:

* Sell the land with minimal prep, netting around $400K after fees (approximately $350K after a 1031 exchange to offset capital gains).
* Sell the house (net $230K after fees) and build a small home/cabin + ADU on the land (likely avoiding capital gains under the 121 exclusion). If the market improves or I can get another job, gradually add rental cabins for long term cash flow.
* Sell both and downsize to a smaller home (\~$350K) with a small ADU, investing $500K in index funds for long-term stability.

The land is owned jointly by me and a c-corp I am a sole owner of, and may do a statutory conversion into an LLC this year, especially if the tax climate becomes more favorable in the short term to hopefully avoid the double taxation if I sell the land and have to split the proceeds apart and double-tax the c-corp portion.

Any suggestions or other creative ideas are appreciated.","Given my current financial situation and impending layoff, what are my best options for managing my debts and investments effectively?","The individual is 45 years old and has a mixed financial and family background. They own a current home valued at approximately $650,000, with about $390,000 remaining on the mortgage at a 6% interest rate, which results in monthly payments of roughly $3,500. They invested in a large wooded lot near their hometown for $420,000, for which they owe no money except for yearly taxes of $2,000. 

The person also has a new truck, which costs about $1,700 a month with $75,000 left to pay off at a 2% interest rate. Selling the truck would result in a loss, as they could only expect to sell it for around $55,000, creating a negative equity situation of about $20,000.

Family-wise, the individual has had their mother move in with them about a year ago, and she relies on minimal Social Security support. With children mostly out of the house, it might make sense to downsize, but their mother's needs impose limitations on their flexibility.

Personal & Financial Situation

Age: 43

New Job (March 2025): $250K base, potential for performance-based incentives

401K: New employer offers a 3% match

Wife's Income: $100K base + ~$4K monthly commission (she just finished grad school)

Kids: 2.5 years & 5 months old

Debt: Wife has ~$50K in student loans (aggressively paying off, plan to finish this year)

Housing Situation: Currently renting in a high-cost-of-living (HCOL) area, but planning to buy a home (~$1.2M) in ~1.5 years with 20% down

Portfolio Breakdown ($735K in liquid assets)

Cash/High-Yield Savings: 14.5%
401K: 22% (only ~$164K in here, the rest is in taxable accounts)
VTSAX (Total US Stock Market): 31%
VTIAX (Total International Stock Market): 4.5%
VBTLX (Total Bond Market): 7%
VGSLX (REIT Index): 4%
VGENX (Energy Fund): 5.5%
VWELX (Wellington Fund - Balanced Stock/Bond): 10.5%

I currently save 20-25% of my salary each month but have kept a good portion in cash/high-yield savings since I want liquidity for a house purchase in the next 18 months.

What I Need Help With

1️⃣ Portfolio Diversification & Rebalancing

Should I reallocate my portfolio to reduce overlap and improve diversification?
I plan to use some of my HYSA + cash out investments for a house down payment—how should I allocate the rest?

My goal is to earn at least 7% annually while keeping enough liquid for the home purchase.

2️⃣ Better Use of Tax-Advantaged Accounts

I know I’m not taking full advantage of tax-advantaged accounts—should I be maxing out my 401K, starting a Roth IRA, and using 529s for the kids instead of VWELX?

Right now, I’ve been saving for my kids' college in VWELX because it’s more flexible, but I’m wondering if 529s or other options would be better long-term.

3️⃣ Balancing Tax-Advantaged Accounts vs. Liquidity Needs

Since I plan to buy a house, I want enough cash/liquid assets but also want to grow my wealth efficiently.

I recently became overemployed, and by May I should have around $40k in my checking account. Before this, I was living paycheck to paycheck mostly. My current combined salary (2 jobs) is around $110k, and this employment situation will last around year, because it's too physically exhausting to keep it going for longer. I will go back to one job earning $60k/year by the end of this year.

I have two debts: $10k in credit card debt and $130k left in my mortgage (I pay around $1600/month including property tax, at 4.5 APR).
Car is paid off. I'm single.

Common sense in me says pay off the credit card debt and put the remaining on the principal of my house. However, I things became REALLY bad and I lost both jobs, isn't it better to have the least amount of debt in the mortgage? In the worst case scenario I could declare bankruptcy for the credit card debt, if it came to that.

I also need a bit of savings of course, but I should be able to build a bit of that during the rest of the year.

I'm feeling very uncertain about the economy, so my #1 priority would be keeping my house if it came to that.

My current card provides 1 pt per dollar to be redeemed on travel, cash rebates, merchandise, and gift cards.

The new card has an interest rate that is 2% higher than my current one. It also provides 2% cash back, but no other rewards. I can set this up to automatically deposit the cash back into my account.

I’m not sure which one to go with. I like that I can use my reward points on so many things, but will admit that I forget to use it. It also takes a while to rack up enough points to shop with and I have only used it once or twice. However, the loan officer mentioned that the gift cards I can buy with my current card might actually be a better deal.

I know I’m overthinking this, but I need help deciding. This is my first and only credit card and I don’t have family members I can ask who I know will give good advice about this.

Edited to add: I pay off my card every month and have never carried more than 10% balance on my card in the 9 years I’ve had it.

First-time home buyer here. Married, no kids with $393K of pre-bonus HHI (not bringing bonus into this just given variability). In the DMV which is extremely pricey. Has anyone developed a helpful framework for looking at overall debt / housing burden? Loan advisors have underwritten us at $960K with a 20% down payment, saying that is at the top end of their conservative bucket. Comes out to around $8K of fixed monthly charges (principal, interest, taxes, insurance, utilities, HOA) or \~26% of income. We would cash flow around \~$3K a month after fixed charges, maintenance reserves, taxes, and our average other expenses. Adding that cash flow plus 401k max contributions, we end up with monthly savings of $7K or \~22% of HHI. That makes me feel pretty good but with the cost of potential childcare ($3K / per child in our area and we want to eventually have two) then this rough math all breaks down.

The reality is that we need to spend at least $1.2M to maintain our current lifestyle as renters in one of the better neighborhoods (metro, nice restaurants, coffee shops, etc.). An almost $1M mortgage is kinda freaking me out as I think about future kids, but I also realize this is probably a common issue in a VHCOL city.

I’ve considered doing a rollover to a traditional 401k, but I’m hesitant because while I’m not currently making enough to need the option of doing a backdoor roth, I was only a few thousand dollars away at my last job. I’ve taken a big pay cut to work in a less stressful role, but I’m not sure if I will go back to higher paying roles in the future. This makes me second guess making the backdoor contribution a hassle to do should it be necessary.


I have a 401k plan with a new employer to which I’m not currently contributing. My employer offers a small match (Would end up being 3-4k/yr) but I’m not vested for 3 years. I’m not sure that I see myself spending long enough to be vested, but you never know. Definitely not my forever job.

Old employer- 

Annual administrative fee:0.52%, Expense ratio: 0.12%, Distribution fee- $50

New employer-
Expense ratio VTSAX: 0.04%
Participant charges (not sure if covered by employer) - $15-30
Contract assess charges- 0.25% currently (but can change based on assessment on a monthly basis from 0.25% -2.43%)

Other fees to consider-
Terminated participant fee - $10/yr
Distribution fee- $50


Questions:
Does anyone have any experience rolling traditional 401k back to an employer 401k or recommend that path so that I can move old 401k to a traditional but still have the option to backdoor if needed?

Considering new provider may charge 2% fees or more, would you recommend contributing to the new 401k over a personal brokerage account if I don’t stay long enough to get the match? What if I stay long enough to get the match? 

Assuming I stay until vested, should I contribute just enough to get the match or should I max it out before I think about investing in my brokerage account considering fees could rise?

* **Investments (RH taxable account):** $20 (just started yesterday)
   * Portfolio: 50% VOO, 10% SCHD, 10% XMMO, 15% AVUV, 10% AVDE, 5% AVDV
* **Planned investments:** Around **$500/month** for now, which should leave me with **$1,500/month for expenses & savings**.

After graduation, I plan to become a firefighter, which will boost my income, but I’ll also have more bills. I have two **high-yield savings accounts**:

1. **5.03% APY (only applies to balances under $2,500)** – Planning to keep this around **$2,400**.
2. **3.8% APY (no balance limit)** – Will use this for additional savings.
3. **Checking Account:** Planning to keep around **$400**, replenishing from savings if needed.

Should we renovate and add on to make our house comfortable for at least the next ten years, or move to a bigger house?","We live in a medium-to-high cost of living city, and bought our house during peak prices in late 2021. My husband and I together make roughly 300k per year, and net about 14k a month after retirement contributions, taxes, etc. We definitely overpaid for the house in a very competitive market, but have an affordable (for us) monthly mortgage of $3300ish due to our 3.1% interest rate. We have about 670k left on our 30 yr mortgage. We would likely not be able to sell our house (3bd 2bth, 1700 finished sq ft) today for what we bought it for (880k), but probably close (maybe 850k). We are doing well financially - we have about 150k in savings and have access to 50k in gift money to use on a house. We also have a lot of monthly payments (our mortgage, daycare ($2000!), a car payment (550), miscellaneous housekeeping and gym stuff, food.. all in all, we probably save 2 to 3.5k a month, most of which we put into a high yield savings, but also put some into mutual funds.   

We moved in knowing that one day our house would likely feel too small and we would eventually either add on or need to move to a new place. We have a one year old and are thinking about a second kid (which will eventually be an additional 2k to daycare), have a lot of guests at our home because our parents live out of town, so we want to make one of two decisions soon: 

1. Renovate soon-ish. We got the architectural plans to add on to our house just to see what was possible. Would make our house a 5 bd 3 bath and add 700 sq ft, and cost around 350k (of course, likely more). We LOVE our neighborhood, our particular lot, and much about our house. It's pretty updated, has new boring stuff (like sewage, water lines), and doesn't \*need\* any big work. We would need a loan of *at least* 150k to fund this project, and I assume that loan will have at least 6 - 7% interest. This would also take probably 8 months or more, and be a general pain. But the idea of adding on would be so that we could stay for another (at least) ten years or more, comfortably and tailored to our needs. 

2. Stay for another 3 or so years and then sell and move into a bigger house, hopefully in our neighborhood. From staying on top of Redfin, there are few homes that we come across in our neighborhood that are both bigger and updated in the way we'd want. During the daycare years ($$), we can't really fathom almost doubling our mortgage due to a higher interest rate, so we would need to wait a few years to move. We could continue to live in our house, even with a second kid, just not very comfortably. Right now, 5bd 3bth homes in our neighborhood at the same ""updated"" level are roughly anywhere between 900K - 1.3M. Could probably put down 30%. 

Any thoughts are appreciated! I know this likely comes down to a pretty personal decision, but we don't want to make too giant of a financial mistake. Real estate agents tend to warn that renovating means you wouldn't make the money back on a sale for at least 15 years. Architects tend to sell the upsides of customization of our home. Thank you!

 I ended up buying a car from a dealer where they sucker me and my partner into what we now know as a bad event, but an “event” that slapped us with high car payment, but at the time, between both of our incomes we could afford it (the payment is $572) however, a few months later I found out I was pregnant and I was left with no choice but to leave my job because of the nature of my work it wasn’t safe for me to work in that position (that is a whole other battle I’m dealing with legally due to the PFWA and asking for a department switch that they denied). So, with his income alone we have fallen behind some months, leaving us underwater with the loan.
On top of this, my car insurance is astronomical, even having USAA, but because I have prior accidents I wasn’t at fault for (we live in a no fault state) it skyrocketed me. 
I was doing Lyft for a while, but because of other issues with my car insurance (feel free to see a post I made in their sub this morning) I was suspended from driving for them and uber (and all other contract driving jobs) because my license is suspended. 
I’ve been trying for months to find a job that I can safely do pregnant (because I also have a heart condition) while playing the long waiting game from SSI, but no one hired pregnant women, even work from home jobs. 

We also have CC Debt we’ve been paying off because I’ve essentially had to live off of that during this time. It’s nearing $7k and I’m just drowning. I tried selling stuff on marketplace with no success (people just not showing up or stop responding), I can’t sell my car because I’m underwater, I can’t even get stupid Ai writing jobs which is pathetic in itself. I feel like a failure especially with a baby coming very very soon. 

A look at our bills currently (if you made it this far):
My insurance: $265 (but I canceled it due to the issues with USAA and turned in my plates) 
Car payment: $572
Lot rent (we own a mobile home): $407
Cc payment (minimum) $110
Personal loan: $400
His insurance: $100 (but is on his parents policy so that is taken care of)
Student loan payments: anywhere between $35-$150 a month",How can I manage my financial situation while being pregnant and unable to work?,"The individual is 25 years old and had a stable job for 4 years before relocating across state for what they believed would be a better opportunity. Their financial stability has been affected by a divorce and issues with student loans, which they do not fully understand. They participated in the Say YES program for college, allowing them to attend for free.

After moving, they purchased a car with a high monthly payment of $572, which they initially could afford with both incomes. However, following a pregnancy, they had to leave their job due to safety concerns related to their work, leading to financial difficulties as they relied on their partner's income alone. The individual is also dealing with a heart condition, which impacts their job search. 

They have significant credit card debt nearing $7,000 and have been living off credit during this period. The individual has tried to generate income through Lyft but has faced difficulties due to a suspended driver's license from car insurance issues, leading to their inability to drive for rideshare services. 

They also mention owning a mobile home with associated lot rent expenses and have canceled their car insurance due to ongoing issues.

I've always struggled a bit with impulsive spending but managed okay until my dad was dying of lung cancer and I was out of work for a while and then not in the best mental health while caretaking and then grieving. The long and short of it is that I racked up quite a bit of credit card debt. 

Other than the debt I'm in a decent financial situation now. I have a job I love with benefits and comfortable pay for my area. I don't have a car note and my monthly housing payment is low. If nothing changes and I stick with my current payoff strategy I think I can be debt free in a little over 3 years. 

I'm also looking into some side hustles or odd jobs to supplement income and payoff even faster.

Mostly I just could use some kind words to stick with it and not get discouraged. I already paid off one card last year and I should be able to pay off another small one in March or April, but after that the next two are bigger ones and I know it'll be a long road before the next 'win.' 

I know at the end of this journey I'll look back at it and it'll feel like the blink of an eye. I'm old enough to know that 3 years is nothing in hindsight, but looking at the hard road ahead of tight budgets and careful spending... it feels like forever.

2025-02-27 16:07:36,1izjamu,How Can I Clear My Name After Being Wrongfully Flagged for Fraud?,"Hi, I’m hoping to get some advice on how to clear my name and resolve an ongoing issue with banks flagging my accounts due to fraudulent activity I was unaware of. I’ve been caught in a very difficult situation, and I need help figuring out the best steps forward.

My ex-boyfriend used my banking details without my consent, and this led to fraud being committed through my accounts. I had no knowledge of what he was doing, and after the activity was discovered, both FNB and ABSA blocked my accounts. I later had an incident with Nedbank where money was stolen from my account without me unlocking the app or authorizing any transactions.


FNB and ABSA flagged my accounts for fraud, and I’ve been unable to use their services. I’ve tried to reach out to the banks and their fraud departments multiple times, but I haven’t gotten any resolution.

Despite being a victim of fraud, I feel like I’m being treated as the perpetrator. Last time I called the fraud department, I was threatened with jail time if I didn’t cooperate, even though I don’t know what happened to my accounts and I’ve repeatedly explained my situation.

1. Has anyone here been through something similar? How were you able to clear your name?

2. What are the best steps to take when dealing with banks and fraud prevention, especially when you’re a victim but are being wrongly flagged?

3. Can anyone recommend legal solutions or steps I should take?

I decided to invest the entire sum right away into voo so it would start growing and making me money while I sleep. My plan is to withdraw 4 to 5 percent a year and retire and live comfortably until my 80s however I also could go down different routes. 

My dream since a kid was to be involved in Bollywood So I thought about moving to Mumbai India and living like a king there with my yearly withdrawals. I would be making almost 9 lakhs a month there which is like making 30k a month here in the States. 

The other factor is working. I could continue to work and let the money grow but I have no skills and I'm lazy. I worked part time Uber eats for the last 4 years and dropped out of college. Never could hold a job down. Lived at home, have no friends, and never been anywhere else. I spend most of my day playing video games. So this money would allow me to live at my own place for the first time and finally buy some nice clothes to go on a date. Nice car, travel, good food, personal trainer, girlfriend, etc

2025-02-27 19:12:40,1izntem,Been broke so long that having money feels odd,"So I have been in a paycheck to paycheck cycle for what seems like forever.  I am 26F with two work from home part time jobs.  I'm also a full-time stay at home mom.  I just started my second part time job a few weeks ago.

Before I had these jobs, my bank account was usually at $20 or less at any given time, especially because most of my husband's income went to bills and there was never much left.  We often had to pick and choose which bills would run late each month.  Without getting into too many details of our finances, I'll say that after I got my first part-time job, I was making just enough to get some groceries, diapers, and pay some of my personal debts (paying the absolute minimums).  My checking account would usually hit $0 or come very close before the next paycheck.  It was very stressful and frustrating because I just COULD NOT keep any money or save or build up my account balance at all.

  
Now that I have another part-time job, I am making double what I was with just one job.  After my bills are paid and all the essentials are bought, I still have a couple hundred left and it feels so weird to me?  It's like I'm scared it won't last or I'm going to end up right back at only $20 somehow.  Or that I feel like I should be doing something with my money because clearly a few hundred is too much to just have, right?  It's not normal to see that number in my account anytime after payday.

I'm realizing that this is what comfortable feels like.  The stress of barely scraping by is no longer there.  I can buy what I need *when I need it* instead of deciding what I'd have to go without until my next paycheck.  For so long I had the goal of never letting my bank account dip below $100 and now I'm there!!  And I am fully aware that two or three hundred dollars is not much at all but I know it will grow over time and I can start saving it and paying off my debts faster.

  
I guess my purpose for posting this is to see if anyone else starts to feel weird when their financial situation improves because they're so used to being in the trenches??",Is it common to feel anxious or weird when my financial situation improves after being in a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle for a long time?,"The individual is a 26-year-old female who has two part-time work-from-home jobs and is also a full-time stay-at-home mom.

This financial stress has persisted, with her checking account often nearing $0 before the next paycheck.

2025-02-27 17:11:19,1izkuqv,Buying a 3.5K Sqft House With No Kids & Facing Judgement,"Hello everyone, sorry, I just gotta get something off my chest and maybe if any of you have similar experiences that will be nice to hear im not alone...

To me (30 Male), a house was always been something to strive for. When I was a kid, my older brother and I would scrounge through the couch cushions in my parents 2 bedroom apartment looking for coins so we could walk across the street to the discount grocery store and buy day-old milk and eggs. Needless to say, growing up we had very little. When I was about five years old, we started renting and moved into a small 3-bedroom townhouse because my mom gave birth to my new little brother. Still, pinching pennies was as important as ever. It stayed that way for much of my life. Buying what we needed only most of the time and buying what we wanted almost never. That's just the way I grew up.

At age 13 my parents told me to get a job. I ended up getting a job at a fast food restaurant less than 3 months after my 13th birthday. I worked every day after school from that moment until the day I graduated. I was never allowed to do after school plays or sports, even if I really wanted to. I was always told working and making money was the most important thing. I missed out on a lot of opportunities because of that, not to mention a lot of time with friends. After I graduated I worked another 4 years, 50-60 hours a week. Still, just like I'd learned as a kid, I bought very little. Only what I needed, very very rarely anything I wanted.

6 Years ago I married my wonderful (now 31, female) wife... who came from a very different upbringing. Her family wasn't rich-per-se but they had money. They went on vacations every year, had a nice 5 bedroom house her whole life, and paid for her college. It was a lifestyle I didn't understand for a long time (and still struggle with it sometimes) but it was all she knew.

My wife now has a masters degree and makes very good money, money I couldn't have imagined when I was a kid. We live in a nice 4 bedroom house, about 2k sqft, but it is not in an area we want to be in. We have always wanted to live by the beach actually, so finally, a few months ago, we decided to just do it. So we started looking, and that's when the comments from my family began...

""Why are you getting such a big house?"" ""You don't need all that space"" ""You don't even have kids why are you getting that"" ""We are nowhere near able to afford that so I don't even understand""

Ive dealt with ""poor guilt"" for much of my adult life. I know what I married into, my wife makes probably 6 times what my dad made when I was growing up and it's just the two of us. I know I have a privilege with the kind of savings I have. Trust me, I know that.

Everything from presents for family to vacations has been difficult for me. My wife's family gives each other presents that are often hundreds of dollars. My family often gives presents that are gawked at if they rise over 20. It took me a long time to come to terms with these things, a long time to grow up and realize that both of these are just what my wife and I each knew. So, together, we have landed somewhere in the middle. We have plenty of money but we often don't act like it. Besides our home we don't really buy too much. We both have phones from 4 years ago, we only have one car, we have more broken TVs in the house than working ones. We have money but things were never something either of us really needed.

But now we want a house, we want a nice house, the kind of house where family can come over and spend the night and we don't have to worry about air mattresses or who gets to sleep on the couch. We want a house we are comfortable in because it is one of the only things we really care about. Anyone can have the thing they care about whether it is traveling or having an incredible car or going to a lot of concerts. For us, it's just a house.

I already feel guilty that I have money now and most of my family still doesn't. I've never flaunted it in their face and ive only ever talked about it when offering to help them when/if they were in a financial bind... But this is supposed to be a happy time. We are looking for our forever home. We are looking for something as close to our dream home as we can find. I just wish my family could be happy for me. I don't know if it's jealousy or just the way we grew up, but I just wish they could say ""that's awesome, congratulations."" instead of making me feel like my wife and I buying a house is somehow a slap in their faces.

Six years ago, he married a woman who comes from a financially stable background. She has a master's degree and earns significantly more than his parents did, which contrasts with his upbringing where extra financial resources were scarce. Together, they live in a nice four-bedroom house but are looking to upgrade to a larger home, ideally by the beach, a dream they’ve held for some time.

Despite their financial comfort and savings, he struggles with feelings of ""poor guilt,"" stemming from his past experiences and contrasting with his family's ongoing financial struggles.

2025-02-27 06:33:29,1iz9kdj,I am in a critical bind and would honestly just love to get any advice/suggestions on what I can possibly do!,"
Hello everyone, I hope your day is going well!
Before I explain my situation, I just wanted to say that if I get too detailed at any part, it’s just to kind of explain where I’m at. I promise I’m not just trying to garner any sympathy, and I assure you that engaging at all with this will not end in me asking for favors/$!

I feel incredibly stuck and don’t know what to do, but at the same time, I feel extremely motivated to figure this situation out, so honestly, anything would be extremely appreciated. 

So:
Mid-January, I was blindsided by  being falsely blamed for something that happened at work. I think it actually had to do with massive budget cuts that are currently happening where I was working, but ultimately, I was warned of all the doors/opportunities that would close if I was to be fired, or I could just resign and walk away clean. Even though the whole situation was not true, I was told that if I was fired, I would not be eligible for unemployment due to the nature of the firing. For the sake of needing a new job immediately, I felt like I had no choice but to resign.  

I have a great work history and have never not been offered a job after interviewing in the past, so I assumed that I would be able to find a new job weeks ago, but I have had no success, and not for lack of trying or being picky. It has been a daily grind that is still ongoing. 

My job was awesome, but due to a recent move and various unexpected bills, I will still be living from check to check but was well on my path to getting back on my feet.  With my final paycheck, selling my PS5, and major grinding on freecash.com, I was able to cover January’s rent last week and cover some bills. 

I have my tax refund and a retirement refund check due in the future, but that could still be another month for all I know.  It will be enough to cover expenses for a while which is amazing, I just need to make it until then! 

At this point, I am at risk of my internet and cellular getting cut off, and also the next batch of rent will be due on March 1st.  I need to figure out a way to generate $1000-$1200 in the next several days and am open to anything. I plan on starting plasma donations tomorrow, which will help a ton with bills coming up, but it’s not enough to help in the very near future. 

Sorry for the ramble, it’s been a hectic last several weeks. Thank you so much for your time :)

",How can I generate $1000-$1200 in the next several days?,"The individual has a strong work history, typically having been successful in job interviews and securing employment. They experienced a job loss in mid-January due to being falsely blamed for an incident at work, which they believe was connected to significant budget cuts affecting their workplace.

They have recently moved and are dealing with unexpected bills, which has led to a situation where they are living paycheck to paycheck. Despite their previous job being a positive experience, the financial strain has increased due to various circumstances surrounding their situation. They have managed to cover some expenses through their final paycheck, selling a PS5, and earning money through a site called freecash.com.

Additionally, they are awaiting a tax refund and a retirement check, which they anticipate will help alleviate some financial pressure but are concerned about meeting immediate expenses. They are also at risk of having their internet and cellular service cut off due to financial difficulties and are planning to start plasma donations to help with bills.

2025-02-27 06:19:06,1iz9cqf,Advice for Utility Bill Years Overdue,"Hi,

I always feel that getting advice from an outsider's perspective is the best thing you can do when faced with a crisis like I am currently in so I do apologize if this post is a bit long-winded. 

I moved into an apartment that is managed by a property management company, and have lived at my residence since early 2021. It was my responsibility upon move in to have the electricity and natural gas turned on in my name along with other non-essential utilities such as cable + landline phone service. Other utitlites such as trash, sewer, and water are paid for by the property management company. 

I set up all of my utilities upon move in and paid the necessary deposits for each provider before I took posession of the apartment, but the my situation with the gas has been an ongoing nightmare, and I've been disconnected due to non-payment after four years. 

The previous resident never had their gas services turned off before they moved out so there was two statements that were showing up in my mailbox - One for the previous resident, and one under my name. During my first two months of living here I caught that the street number (Not apartment number) on the billing statement was incorrect and was one number off which put the service address for the complex next door which is owned by the same property management company and also has another apartment unit with my number. I put in a change of address as the Postal Service and the only thing I can think of is the carrier that delivered mail at that time saw my name on other mail and put it in my box. I've had mail delivered to me and it's two streets over and USPS in my experience has always been a mess. Especially since I've lived here, I've had crap go over to the complex next door where residents have dropped things off at my door and I've done the same whenever things have shown up in my box.  I've put mail back in the box and written on the envelope ""Wrong address."" ""This person does not live here anymore."" so whoever delivered the mail would know that this person does not live at this address. I did this on a couple of the statements that came in my mail for the gas company.  I brought this to the attention of the gas company and I called them initially when I first noticed the error on the paper bills all those years ago.

The Customer Service Representative that I spoke with told me that it was an error on their part when they set up the service originally and they would send me a paper check for the initial deposit and payment on the first bill that I paid in the form of a refund check. I do recall asking them if they could refund it to my checking account and they told me no it had to be sent via mail. A week or two went by, and I didn't receive anything from them. I called them back I think a week or two after the initial  phone call and asked them where the refund check was and they told me they had no record of a check. The next couple months rolled around and there was no bill coming in my name anymore - Just the previous tenants name. Fast forward to multiple changes in owners/years of never recieving a bill or any communication from the gas company about my situation after numerous phone calls the natural gas problem is still not solved. I received multiple red disconnect notices on my door, and I communicated with every single notice that was left. I was asked to submit a copy of my lease last October to their new accounts e-mail/communication line and they told me all previous debt at the property will need to be paid before a new account can be opened at my address.

  
After getting nowhere with that, at this point the gas service is still on. 

Fast forward to early February and I get another red card notice on the door that says to ""Contact Office"" so I get on the phone and call them and explain what is going on for the eight thousandath time and the guy on the phone tells me the bill is several thousand dollars. At this point, I'm really not shocked for four years of usage. He tells me he's going to send out a copy of the last statement for the address and send it to me and that is the balance due to restore the service. I asked him on the phone if it would be easier to pay on the account number that's been running this whole time and he tells me yes I can do that and that they also offer payment installment plans to make it easier to catch the balance up. At this point, I think alright so maybe this is finally going to get figured out and I can put this shit behind me. 

I wait for the statement to show up in the mail because normally I throw them out and I do this because it is against the law to open someone elses mail. I've always been taught if a piece of mail isn't addressed to you then you have no right to open it. I received permission from the gas company to open the statement and I see the balance with the account number. I called the toll free number to make a payment and the first question it asks after inputting the account number is to enter the DOB or SS Number for the primary accountholder.

  
I have no relationship to this person so I have no idea how they expect me to do that.



Fast forward another few weeks and I wake up and the gas service is officially turned off and a red notice on the door that says it's been disconnected due to non-payment.  

  
I get on the phone and I am transferred to a supervisor that is of no help to me at all after explaining the mess that this is and she tells me there was never an account and there is no history of me ever having an account.  They are demanding that I pay the entire balance up front before services can be restored...UNDER THE CURRENT ACCOUNT HOLDERS NAME. I am not attempting to get out of this bill - I am fully aware that the usage is mine and have agreed to the back billing from 2021 because I am the person living here. The bill is $4200 and I told them I can have the balance settled in less than three months if they can do a 90 day arrangement. I had $1300 I could have paid them on the phone right then and there. This woman is a supervisor and after asking her if they are able to roll the balance into an account under my name and she tells me I can give you no further information on this account.

  
Now, I sit here without gas service.  I've already put requests at work in to start OT immediately. I went out and bought a hot plate to cook on and cold showers will work in the meantime, but what the hell grounds do I have against my gas company? The only thing I can think of doing is tracking down my old bank accounts and seeing if I can have old statements pulled. I threw the couple of bills out after I talked to whoever it was years ago thinking it was going to be resolved, and now I'm here kicking myself in the ass because if I would have had them there would have been a paper trail of some kind. The gas company is telling me they have no record of my name or anything in their system which is complete BULLSHIT because I paid one of the first bills with the mobile app!! 

What this sounds like to me is that this is a major administrative error on the gas companies part and now they're sticking it to me. I've taken accountability for the balance owed on the account because it's my usage, but I've communicated with them numerous times and let them know THE ACCOUNTHOLDER YOU GUYS HAVE ON FILE DOES NOT LIVE HERE. 

  
Can anyone give some insight as to if they've had anything like this happen and what can I do? I'm working on bringing the balance up in my account ASAP and I should have $2k in my account by the end of the week which is a little bit under 50% of the entire balance. 

  
Thank you,

T

  
","What can I do about my gas service being disconnected due to an account issue that seems to be the gas company's administrative error, and how can I resolve the balance owed under an account holder's name that is not mine?","The individual in the Reddit post has been living in their apartment since early 2021, where they are responsible for managing their own utility accounts, including electricity and natural gas. Over the past four years, they have encountered significant issues with their natural gas service, primarily due to mismanagement and administrative errors with the gas company, which has led to disconnections due to non-payment. 

The person has communicated multiple times with the gas company about the situation, explaining that the account in their name has no records or billing statements, and has faced difficulties resolving the problem. They have mentioned that the previous resident's account was still active, which contributed to the confusion. 

In terms of their financial situation, they are currently facing a large utility bill amounting to $4,200, which they acknowledge is due to their usage. They are actively working on remedies, such as seeking overtime work to help pay down the balance and have managed to save part of the amount owed. The individual appears to be taking accountability for the service usage while expressing frustration with the procedural issues stemming from the gas company's handling of their account.

2025-02-27 05:24:18,1iz8hhk,Question(s) about tribal loans...,"I've read a lot about these  and understand obviously that first and foremost they are an insanely risky and unwise financial undertaking. With that as the baseline understanding, I have a few questions:

For anybody who has *themselves* taken a loan from one of these services (and discontinued/failed to pay it back):

Did it have an effect on your credit score?

Did they attempt to garnish your wages? and were their attempts ever successful?

 Did you end up get sued by them? and if so did the case actually make it to court ?

  
I'm also curious if there's any instance of them selling the debt to anyone outside of their ""in house"" collection agencies.

oh and importantly: **What specific service did you use?**

  
I've done a lot of reading about them and from what I've gathered it seems they are - at worst tricking/scaring people who don't know any better into paying insane 800% APRs - and at best all bite and no bark. I see that many of these 'companies' are involved in ongoing class action suits, which, if everything i've read is true, does not surprise me.

at this point you make be making inferences about my intentions.....lol. i am *not* planning on taking out a loan with the deliberate plan not paying it back. Just trying to gather data from first hand accounts and get to the bottom of wether they have ever successfully legally lived up to their threatening claims.

thanks

2025-02-27 04:45:25,1iz7ts3,Motivated to get out of debt and change my life - Which method should I choose?,"Hi y'all, I'm looking for some insights or advice on a really specific revolving debt situation and a possible solution.

I'm a little over $10k in personal debt, most of which are high-interest/predatory loans (the top two are $650 at 99% and $2,500 at 250% interest) that are making me miserable. I've been taking out loans for about a year, always swearing up and down to myself that I will repay it immediately and I have never been able to hold myself to it and it's been getting worse. I started getting these loans to pay for my rent and bills and I should have known that was already a bad sign.

It's all catching up to me and I think I've finally, or almost finally, made peace with the severity of my financial situation.

* I get paid $1,200 once every other week
* I have been living in overdraft for about two years, usually around -$400 but I'm currently -$711
* My rent is $1,110 and I use an app (Flex) to split it up throughout the month (I pay $14.99 a month for the service/membership). No matter what, I always try to make sure this is paid so I can split my rent up the following month.

I recently connected to a certified financial counselor through National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) which has been IMMENSELY helpful if anyone is considering it, you should!

I'm coming to terms with the fact that because the predatory loans are paid automatically through my bank account and I am so severely overdraft that I might have to stop my direct deposit and ask for a paper paycheck to cash and pay my rent in cash. I would let my bank account go to collections and live on cash for the foreseeable future.

This is absolutely terrifying but also feels like the only reasonable option given the severity. I'm not letting myself take out another high interest loan...but what if I did something else...

So I don't have a regular savings account (hence the loans) BUT I do have a 401(k) account that was started when I took this job about 2 years ago. I have a vested balance of \~$8,000. Since I am only 26 I would certainly have to pay the ""crazy horrible"" 10% taxes/penalty on an early withdrawal deduction, or I could take up to $4,000 in the form of a loan with 8% interest....

The only advice I have heard about taking a deduction from a 401(k) is from retirement aged people who insist that it is the worst possible move for your finances. But I can't help but feel like taking money out of a retirement is the best possible solution for a severe debt problem when it could keep me from eviction, especially when the interest and penalty is 8% compared to the predatory loan offered in the mail at a whopping 325%, right? I'm sure it's bad to take from your retirement if it's just superfluous, but if it's for a true emergency that feels worth it to me, but am I crazy for thinking this?

I'm definitely hesitant to take a loan out of my 401(k) because of what has been impressed into me, and I admit I would feel embarrassed talking to our CFO/HR about it as I also work in fundraising at a non-profit. 

Overall, is it better to call it quits on my current bank account and let all my debt collect while I resort to cash and be really be truly forced to change my spending habits, OR could I do the final loan to end all loans through my 401(k) and really get my life together one last time without losing my bank account?

This has led to excellent financial and health wellbeing. I often help people with jobs and resumes for free.

My partner (25F) grew up and remains below the poverty line, constantly ill, constantly stressed, low confidence, generally Not Thriving. I pick up all the slack or let her grow her debt to me, which is currently a little over ~2000 (credit debt, schooling, personal loans). Otherwise, I cover all her rent and groceries outright.

This has mostly been an issue in the last 6 months. Last fall (then over and over since then), I said to start looking for spring internships, get a small student loan, let me buy her a YMCA membership outright, find a side gig since she’s not full time, and potentially explore other careers due to US politics.

She still has one part time job (20 hours or less due to various illnesses), without an internship (she thought she didn’t need to apply???), without her free YMCA membership, turned the cost of her schooling into unpaid credit card debt, still making only $300/week, and will soon be competing with every other student for summer gigs, then every laid off federal worker for jobs in her field once she graduates. She did pick up some once-off gigs in December to pay down a few smaller debts and is now finally applying for things, but she’ll only take my advice _after_ things get bad. Most recently, she suggested cancelling pet insurance to save money despite her pets being seniors and having paid into it for 4+ years. I said that is a bad idea and generally have to talk her off the ledge often. 

It is frustrating because these issues are all largely preventable with some effort on her part, or even asking me for help before they balloon.

That’s been barely enough to make my payments for my student loans which are about $540 and storage unit, which due to the fires in LA the price rose to $350. In addition to that, at the beginning of the month, my cafe has closed, and so I’ve been unemployed for the last 2 weeks.

I don’t have a credit card, so there’s no credit history for banks to see and qualify me for a personal loan. My credit union (nfcu) couldn’t give me a personal loan to move because I’m not currently employed, and it typically requires an income for two months at the current job.

The problem is i have to pay something every month to them or they will not see him. And he needs therapy so bad. The out of state place says he does not qualify for their financial assistance. And the payment plan they are saying the lowest they can go in 125 a month. I cannot pay that! I do not know what to do they are not helping.

2025-02-26 19:14:01,1iyvl5m,How to manage inconsistent money in a family of 5?,"I’m 14 from a household where we don’t make much, probably under $35k a year. My dad works Uber, his income is stable I guess..l but it ranges. My mom doesn’t work, relying mainly on my disabled brother’s disability checks for support. My parents recently got tax income (around $3k+, I think 3365), and in just two days, my mom has already spent almost $300 on groceries, personal things for herself, and food when she usually uses food stamps and never cash... She was like “oh yay we have money now, i’m going to spend some now” but I feel like this spending is going to leave us with nothing soon, especially since we don’t have a stable income. And that shes terrible at saving and that I want to learn how to and be more responsible.

I’m trying to save some of the tax money, it’s filed under me and my siblings, so my dad was like “oh, if you weren’t here right now, we wouldn’t have this money at all!” okay.. if I ask‘d my mom if i could have for $1,000 to save, my mom will probably say no and that it’s too much and probably even that i’m being selfish and what about my siblings.. even though she’s spending irresponsibly and doesn’t have a job to make money at all.. She doesn’t manage money well at all and often blows through it. then says “oh you have to wait next month which is weeks from now to get what your asking me so I can get your brothers disability check! it’s 900$ dollars not even that much money!” and um, just to clarify, I’m not stealing money to save it, I read the rules and don’t want my post to get taken down.. The tax money is in envelopes in my house, filed under my name and my siblings. I don’t know that much about taxes, I don’t even have a job yet.. but I’m upset because I feel like my mom would say no if I asked to save some of it. But I don’t want it to go to waste either and not do anything at all.. That’s why I was thinking of saving it without her knowing, but um yeah I don’t know..

and I guess the last thing, am I overreacting or Is $300 in two days too much, given how inconsistent our income is? and I don’t know.. I understand parents may be neglectful because don’t have support and money to even get the basic necessities, but my parents have the basic stuff, but my mom admits to not buying me pants and clothes for over 2 years.. so just, what is my situation? i didn’t say it all but it’s just so inconsistent..","Am I overreacting to think that my mom's spending nearly $300 in two days is too much, given our inconsistent income?","The individual is a 14-year-old living in a low-income household where their family's annual income is likely under $35,000.

I've been having a rough few months, and as a result I have a past due balance on my student loans and my health insurance. If I don't pay both off by March 2nd, my loans will go into default and I will lose my health insurance. 

I can't make a payment on the loans until March 1st, a Saturday, but the payment won't post or be processed for 1-2 business days, which would put me past the default period. They are unwilling to postpone the payment time frame by this 1-2 days, so those will go into default even if I make the payment. 

For the health insurance, I owe two months (February and March). I will lose coverage if I don't pay both premiums by March 2nd. I can pay both, but that will take everything I have. I will have nothing left for expenses for another two weeks. 

I don't know what to do. There's no way at all I can get the money ($250) I need for the student loans in the next 1-2 days so I can pay it and it will be processed. I'd need to pay it today to make sure it went through by Friday/I didn't go into default.

2025-02-26 15:52:14,1iyqn7o,Demotion at work - Seeking advice to stay afloat/budget,"My team and I just got out of a meeting recently where we were told our shift will be dissolved in May. Luckily, instead of being laid off completely, the company thought it would be best to integrate our team into another shift. This, however, will mean that we will be paid $2.50/hour less than the rate we have been originally receiving. 

To preface my thoughts on the situation. I have been working at this company a couple months shy of a year. I am still pretty new to the company, but my fellow coworkers have done wonders to my physical and mental health. It has been a constant struggle up until this point even being happy at times and somewhat financially stable. 

This news hit everyone like a train. Of course, there were many phrases thrown around at us like, ""due to our current economy"" and ""in order to keep our business running"", but nothing they said to us really helped soften the upcoming blow to our financial wellbeing. 

  
I want to stay with this company. I don't care all too much about the work that I do (it's basically general labor/warehouse) but the people in the company are smart, talented and passionate people. I have never dreaded coming into work at this company and would rather avoid changing jobs if I have to trade my mental health for financial stability. 

Here is where I would like to ask for advice:   
My first thoughts on making the best of my situation would be to follow a stricter budget. cut on unnecessary expenses like streaming and take out, but my current budget is already pretty strict, and I am barely staying afloat as is(I haven't ordered any takeout/doordash since I have started this job, and my grocery budget is less than 60 dollars/week for myself). I am already working 50-60 hours per week to save up for car repairs (I'm currently carpooling until I can fix or find myself a new vehicle) and they will allow us to continue working these hours until the demotion is finalized in May. 

With all this in mind, is there anything anyone could recommend I do to stay afloat? Am I crazy in wanting to stay at this company even after being told they will be paying me less for the same amount of work I've been doing the past year? 

Also, I feel like posting something like this is already a big enough risk in terms of jeopardizing my employment. I would rather not discuss anything that could identify the company I work for as being paid 2.50/hour less is better than not earning any money at all. Thank you","What can I do to stay afloat financially after my pay will be reduced, and am I crazy for wanting to stay with this company despite the pay cut?","The individual has been working at their company for nearly a year and has expressed that they are still relatively new to the organization. They work in a general labor/warehouse position, which they describe as not particularly enjoyable, but they value the relationships with their coworkers, who have had a positive impact on their physical and mental health.

They work 50-60 hours per week to save for car repairs, as they are currently carpooling until they can fix or replace their vehicle. Their budget is tight, with their grocery spending limited to less than $60 per week, and they have not ordered takeout or used food delivery services since starting the job. 

The context suggests that the individual is motivated to maintain their job despite the impending pay cut, as they value the workplace environment and the connections they've built. They are concerned about their financial stability in light of the reduction in pay and have been proactive in seeking advice on managing their finances.",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1iyqn7o/demotion_at_work_seeking_advice_to_stay/,povertyfinance

2025-02-25 14:15:54,1ixvz77,Health Insurance Premium Increasing - Can't Afford,"**I just got a letter from my health insurance company (Independent Health) notifying me that they are increasing my monthly premium by around $150 starting in May.** 

I moved out of where I was living with three roommates in the summer to a place by myself, which, at the time, felt like the right decision, given the issues I was facing with said roommates and where I was at personally and professionally. I knew at the time this would make my budget tighter, but mathed it out and figured it would work. *My lease will not be up until the end of July.* 

The prospect of losing an additional $150 per month is not a good one, especially as Cost of Living continues to increase, and takes my budget from ""a little tight, but still some wiggle room for saving and discretionary spending"" to ""very tight, almost no wiggle room.""

*I am currently on one of the best of the plans* offered to me since when I was making that decision when I turned 26, I was concerned that it would be more expensive to be on a lower plan as someone on several medications who sees specialists (Neurologist and very occasionally a Cardiologist) and has regular telehealth appointments for one of my medications that is a controlled substance. That said, I fully admit that my understanding of Health Insurance and how the intricacies of that industry work is minimal. I was hoping to avoid a plan with a deductible for these reasons, but now I am afraid I have no choice.  

So my debate now is the following:

Do I...?

* Stay on my current plan and just take the L as far as monthly income goes, adjusting my budget as necessary
* Lower my plan to something more affordable, but risk higher healthcare spending
* Stay on my current plan and try to either find new roommates or move back in with my parents once my lease is up after July (not the most appealing option as I am a 27-year-old adult and like living alone, but it may be necessary)
* Stay on my current plan and try to find either a second job or a side hustle (important to note here I do not drive)
* Some other option I'm not seeing??

I feel very far behind compared to my peers and like I should have this stuff figured out by now; it sucks feeling this lost.

2025-02-25 13:44:56,1ixvbpq,Nervous about spending my tax refund wisely,"I'm a 36 year old single mom of two teenagers who works in a factory and makes almost $20 an hour, which sounds like a lot but doesn't seem to go far. I bring home $2800 per month after taxes and my bills are an average of 2400. This includes $200 per month in credit card payments that I owe a total of $4k on. The electric bill is really my only fluctuating bill that can sink me. I can barely afford groceries, we live off granola bars, sandwiches, sloppy joes and hamburger helper.

My tax refund this year will be $5k. 
My oven and washer are going out and I was originally hoping to buy those two things for *hopefully* $500 each and then throw the remaining amount at my credit card debt which would free up $200/Mo for me. 

But I have also considered throwing the entire $5k at my mortgage to where I would only have to make half payments every month for a year, freeing up around $400/mo. And then I could save up for a washer, oven and have more per month to throw at my debt. 

Here's how it breaks down and please tell me if it makes sense. 
My mortgage payment is $920/MO which includes taxes and insurance. 
$5k would pay for 5 months plus almost half of a 6th month. It would work out best if it were a complete 6 months. During those months that I don't have to pay, I save back half of the $920 ($460). When the 6 months is up, I continue to pay $460 for mortgage while pulling out $460 from the months I've been saving in order to make the full payment and by the time I run out of savings it'll be almost exactly one year which will be time for my next tax refund. 

What do you guys think, will it work? Is it the better option? I'm nervous I'm missing something or going to screw it up somehow.

2025-02-25 13:20:06,1ixusvm,Anyone Here Full-Time Student and Full-Time Worker?,"I'm not faring as badly as some of the other people here but transitioning from teenager to adult has been rough. I'm sorry about the long vent. I'm a 22-year-old man at the time of this post.

During my freshman year of college, I picked up a part-time job as a server. My first job. I worked around 15-20 hours a week, three days a week, Fri-Sun. It is insane to think that I unknowingly gave up my weekend one day and never had it back since.

Luckily, the combination of first-generation status, poverty finances, and decent academics allowed me a full ride at my state college, but there was a catch. If there were two semesters where I failed a class, all financial aid would be revoked. I couldn't afford student loan debt. The program then absolutely fucked me. I took several computer science classes in high school that transferred to college credits, so my first computer science major course in college was already a sophomore/junior-level course. I took one look at the first assignment and knew I was in a world of hurt. I'd managed to pass the class with a C- or a C+, with the class average being a D. The next CS class I failed. It was on some architecture assembly language, and I just couldn't keep up. This was during lockdown, so the professor would stream their lecture on Twitch with the quietest, most monotone voice that I couldn't understand. The professors themselves weren't even PhD's, and the teacher's assistants were useless. I remember sitting in Discord chatrooms with these TAs, who took 20 minutes to respond to my questions DURING OFFICE HOURS, only to completely run out their clock and tell me their office hours were closed, leaving my questions unanswered and my program's bugs unresolved. It was apparent to me I was just another fish in a sea of people reaching for that golden ticket to financial stability: a computer science degree. 

I'm not that smart. I'm not a golden, million-dollar child who can crunch numbers in their head and become a coding genius. All this combined with the fear of failing another class and losing a chance at a Bachelor's made me switch my major to something easier, but also something I'm very passionate about.

Since then, my father had a very scary health complication. He had me late and is in his mid 60's now. I drove him to the emergency room, and he needed another stent on top of the more than a dozen stents he already had. He hasn't had a job for over 14 years. My mother is the sole breadwinner working as a waitress. I've decided to take on full-time hours and work in the kitchen instead of serving. Working as a cook is superior to servers in that you get higher hourly pay, and more hours, and often are the last to get their hours cut when business is slow.

I managed to fit my four classes into two days of the week, and the other four days I'm working a 13-hour shift in the kitchen. As I've gradually pulled in more money, my parents are charging more from me for the rent, utilities, car bills, etc. At first, I was happy to help, but the weight has been growing difficult. Last week my mom immediately borrowed my entire paycheck (which she did pay back a week later) and asked if I had an additional $1000 in the bank in case she needed to borrow more for rent, which is on top of what I already pay for my portion of rent. This induced a lot of stress.

The main point I want to talk about is quality of life. I try and think I am a happy person for the most part. I don't treat my job as just a job, I genuinely enjoy cooking and culinary, and I've made some very pretty dishes that I'm proud of. I'm still in college finishing out my liberal arts degree. It's a free Bachelors, so I'll take it regardless of its worthlessness in the job market. I'll be the second person to get a college education in my family. The first is my older sister, who stays home now and is trying at a Twitch streaming career. It seems bogus but she has a small viewer count in the 30's, and I want her to have her Hail Mary shot. I also want my sister to be happy and be spared from the work I go through. I have one off day, where I spend the entire day with my lovely girlfriend.

However, what people don't often mention is that sleep is the first to go. Getting home around midnight and having to get up at 8:30 to get to class on time is not as easy as it seems. I'm someone who needs 8-9 hours of sleep, but I also enjoy eating dinner. Getting off work, cooking, and taking my food to my desk, where I can just eat and watch YouTube videos or browse Reddit is the absolute highlight of my working days. Alone time. But you can't have this and also get a full 8-9 hours of sleep, not to mention I also use this time to catch up on homework assignments. 

People talk about burnout but I feel like I'm beyond it. I had two periods in my life during college where I developed very bad depression and anxiety. Depression has been better with my girlfriend, but the anxiety comes and goes. I just feel I'm doing what's necessary to survive and that gets me through the rough days. I suppose what I really want is for me to come home from work and my mom tell me I'm working hard instead of telling me what new bills she has coming up and how much she needs from me.

Going from teenager to adult is strange in small ways. I've recognized over the past couple of years certain items stopped showing up that I needed to start buying, such as toothpaste, paper towels, food, shampoo, soap, etc. I guess I took these things for granted when I was a kid, but I need to start buying these things as an adult for myself.

I've been able to put aside a decent chunk of change every month into a Robinhood account, nothing risky, mainly ETFs. I'm hoping this will be my way out in the future. 

As I mentioned, I'm a flawed person, Over the past couple of years I've wasted time and money on gambling, a bad smoking addiction, alcohol, and stupid shit like that to cope with the stress. I think addiction runs in the family, as I remember my mother blowing away nearly $100k, almost all the inheritance money from our grandmother passing away. Growing up in poverty has damaged my mental. I think all the vices are self-sabotage because I don't think I deserve good things in life. Everything leading up to now has been miserable, so I must be a bad person to deserve it. I'd come home from my 13-hour shift and sometimes I'd be immediately greeted with new bills and more weight as being the safety net for the entire family, and I'd just nod and go up to my room and drink by myself. Other times I'd come home and sit in my chair for a couple of minutes knowing I wasn't going to sleep until five in the morning because I had a final essay to write.

But I've learned to be easier with myself. It was a hard truth to swallow that sometimes you're just unlucky. Shitty things happen to people at random. Especially looking at my coworkers who are in the same boat, it's weird to see how life fucks over people differently. One lady in her mid-20s dropped out of college because her mother fell ill and was too disabled to work. She spends all day working, making doctor appointments and trips, and caring for her mother. This easily could've been me, or you, or anyone. No time for having fun for fun sakes, every action you do from now on must be with purpose.

Rent keeps going up, groceries eat through our paychecks, and every month feels like we’re barely keeping our heads above water.

We have two teenagers who look to me for security, and all I can think about is how I’ve failed them. My wife is half-Filipino, and after exhausting every option, we’ve come to a heartbreaking decision: we’re leaving the US and moving to the Philippines. It’s the only place where we might actually be able to breathe again. But this means uprooting our kids, leaving behind everything we’ve built, and starting from nothing in a country that doesn’t even feel like home to me.

I feel ashamed for my kids. Could I have worked harder, made better choices, given them a life where we didn’t have to run? It feels like I’m giving up, like I’m taking the easy way out.

Has anyone else been in this position? Does it ever stop feeling like you failed?

—

UPDATE: I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has reached out with support, advice, and shared experiences. Your words have been incredibly comforting during this challenging time.

To provide more context about our situation:
- My wife, being half-Filipino, owns a property in the Philippines. Her father, a retired Navy veteran, chose to spend his retirement there. Both of her parents have been encouraging us to consider relocating, offering their support to help us settle in.
- My wife is a self-employed designer, and I work in IT. Fortunately, both of our professions allow for remote work with U.S.-based clients, which we hope will provide some financial stability during this transition and we’ve been made aware of the tax implications.
- Our children, aged 13 and 15, have a basic understanding of the local language but aren’t fluent speakers. We’re concerned about how they’ll adjust to a new educational system and culture. We already discussed our situation and they’re kinda supportive of it but just scared of the idea of migrating.

This decision hasn’t been easy, and we’re still grappling with feelings of uncertainty and guilt. However, knowing that others have faced similar challenges and found their path gives us hope. Thank you all for your empathy and encouragement.",Does it ever stop feeling like you failed when you have to make such a difficult decision?,"The individual in crisis has two teenagers, aged 13 and 15, who depend on them for security.

2025-02-25 10:10:11,1ixroab,i hate living in the future,"I got laid off early january without notice from a job i was already living paycheck to paycheck. Debit card was locked due to the number being stolen a week after (relevant), no big deal i'll transfer funds to my credit card while i wait for the new one. Was 'lucky' to get a job two weeks later, collecting one week of unemployment just before i start. 

Work two weeks, doing well. New card comes in the mail, I'm able to pay for a few things with my debit card. Find out due to the payment schedule I'm only going to be paid for the first four days, grit my teeth and rebudget. Some payments will bounce but i'll have enough time before things start getting shut off. Then payday and there's no check. I email the owner of new job, talk to the other owner. Nothing for another week despite asking. Brushed off. Starting to sweat but alas theres the first check, I can pay for everything. Deposit it, waiting for it to go through since it was given to me on friday and won't post to my account till monday.

Then my internet gets cut off. And my phone service. Try to access account to pay bills on monday by going to the library - its presidents day. Which means bank holiday. Another day, no big deal. Then I get an alert that my debit card number was stolen again, card is locked. Have to do the dance of moving funds to my credit card and waiting before payments can clear. 
Finally, after a week my phone and internet should be back. Still have a second payment on my rent, but second paycheck should direct deposit to my account right? right? 

No I need two factor authentication to confirm my bank account, which I can't do since my service is still shut off. By the time i'm able to receive a text i've missed the cut off for direct deposit by a day and I'll have to get another check. One I won't get till saturday so I can't go to the bank and withdraw cash. let myself 'splurge' on buying bodywash and eggs on my credit card, since ive been going off of butter noodles for over a month. 

fast forward to monday, staying up till midnight to pay the last rent payment i'm already late on (i use flex). Only to find out after the check deposited that I can't pay through my bank account and i cant add funds through my credit card. I would pay the full balance but it's $606 and my credit card limit is $500. new debit card is still in the mail, should be delivered on the third. Payment is due on the 28th, If i dont make the payment by then i'll have to pay the remaining balance and the next months full rent all at once. 

worst of all, this whole time, anytime i've had to contact someone i've had to fight through endless ai-assistants, connecting calls that get dropped, or if i even get connected to someone i've been put on the wrong phone line so they aren't able to help me. flex has no phone support, no person i can explain or get help from. 
my last leg is going to my property managers office and asking for help though theyre rarely there. phone calls are again - all robo calls that go nowhere, emails are just a link to another ai. will i be evicted? not likely, but the tiny bit of relief i was looking forward to is gone. 

oh and I broke my glasses today.

Their financial situation was further complicated by their debit card being locked due to theft shortly after the layoff, limiting their access to funds. 

While working at the new job, they encountered issues with delayed payment schedules, which led to difficulties in meeting essential bills, including rent, internet, and phone services. They faced repeated challenges with their bank, including issues that required two-factor authentication for direct deposit, which they could not complete due to their phone being shut off temporarily. 

The person mentioned budgeting challenges, having been restricted to a limited diet of inexpensive food, and feeling overwhelmed by the continuous need to contact customer support, which was largely automated and unhelpful.

i woke up to feed my newborn and got the sudden urge to pee. as stated above, my muscles are weak so i truly cannot hold it and wait. there are 6 adults including myself living here yet 5 of us have to share one of the 2 bathrooms because my partners cannot add grandpa sleeps in the only room with an ensuit and refuses to let anyone use it during the night.

i went to pee and noticed the bathroom was occupied. i try to hold it then realized i truly couldn’t so i knock. no reply. i pace back and forth a bit then knock again, no reply but i hear a video being played on their cellphone. i say out loud “can i come in to pee really quick i have to go” no reply. at this point ive already peed myself a tiny bit so i grab a roll of toilet paper, run outside. and squat by the side of the house and go. then i start crying uncontrollably. 

i’m the only woman in this house. i shouldn’t have to pee outside like a dog. i am embarrassed and ashamed that i did. i know you’re thinking i could’ve just driven somewhere to pee but the reality is the closest place is 12 minutes away. 

if i wasnt poor we could afford a place with a bathroom i’d only have to share with my partner but i have no income thanks to unpaid maternity leave and won’t for a while thanks to daycare being too expensive and my job unable to be done remotely (even if i got one bc of the amount of adults living here the house it’s never quiet so idk how id navigate that considering most wfh jobs require you to have a quiet environment to work in). i am so fucking upset and ashamed that i had to pee outside and i needed to let it out but it didn’t seem fair to wake my partner up when he has work at 5 am so i came to reddit. sorry for the tmi.

I am tired physically pushing myself and doing the same monotonous and body breaking work. 

  
However; I cannot break my current lease. I would have to forfeit my security deposit ($1.8k and pay 2 months of rent in advance ($2600)). I live paycheck to paycheck.  
I am moving to an airbnb temporarily and leaving most of my furniture until I am ready to move fully and end my lease at the old place.  
So for the next 5 months, I will be paying $1300 for old apartment and $850 for a fully furnished airbnb.  
I also dont have a car and will rely on bus/uber for work. The bus does not run early enough to get me to work on time so I have to uber, but I can take the 1.5 hour bus ride home after.

Monthly pay after taxes: $2,800

Rent : $1300 + $850 = $2,150

Transportation: Calculated at $350 a month

That leaves me with $300 for food and other expenses.
