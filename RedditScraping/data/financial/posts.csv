1j4nceg,Want to Start an Emergency Fund But Don't Know Where,"Howdy everyone,

So I'm looking to start and emergency fund, but not sure where to start - everyone has the CORRECT idea, and every idea is different.

I have about a few-thousand to start with in a checking account I am looking to transfer. On my research, I was initially interested in a HYSA, it seems to be the most secure option, but don't know where to go - again, this time every bank is both the correct and wrong one. On further research I hear about MMAs, CDs, so many options I don't know where to go!

My caveats are that I just want the best APY I can get, with FDIC insurance on it, no monthly fees, and preferably a card to access these funds. The idea being I would lock that card in a fireproof safe for emergencies and ease of access.

1j4pk7z,Should I Open a Second Bank Account for Diversification?,"I currently live in Dubai and have my main bank account with a local bank, where my salary gets deposited. I also have a credit card and a foreign currency account with the same bank. While everything works fine, I’m considering opening a second bank account, ideally with a bank that has a stronger global presence, as a backup.

This way, I have a backup in case of technical issues, regulatory changes, or other disruptions. But I’m unsure if this is necessary or if I’m overcomplicating things.

A few key questions I’d love input on:

1. Do you keep accounts with multiple banks for diversification, and has it actually helped you? Have you ever faced issues where a second bank account was useful?

2. Would a second local currency account be enough, or should I also open a foreign currency account with the second bank? I already have a foreign currency account with my primary bank, but I’m not sure if splitting that across two banks is worth it.

To make matters worse, my parents stopped paying my insurance two months before the accident, so I don’t have coverage.

I’ve been continuing to make the car payments even though the car is no longer usable. It feels like my money is just going into a hole since the car is just sitting there.

They asked me to sign a document stating they'll cancel my affiliation without reimbursement and I essentially can't dispute any charges or do any kind of legal action against them. I decided not to sign and filed a dispute with my credit card company for the deposit. Unfortunately, I lost that dispute after almost 2 months of waiting.

1j4nnot,Retirement & Investing Advice Needed,"Hi, I know little about finance and am looking for multiple opinions after meeting with a financial advisor who is suggesting an AUM-based fund at a 1.25% advisory fee. 

Situation: total comp package is around $300k, stay at home wife (for a while at least), have maxed my 401k every year (6% match +3% free into 401a) pre-tax, have about $475k in retirement at 33. Emergency fund is decent. No debt outside of my mortgage. My goals are: pay for all of my 3 kids’ college tuition (4 years in state), and retire or partially retire by ~55. 

Part of my comp is RSUs which I’d like to start investing each year. I am currently putting about $900/month across 3 kids into 529s to save for college, but am thinking this is going to be too restrictive potentially if I fully fund these and one decides to do something else, for example. 

3 questions:
1.) Should I go with a financial advisor charging 1.25% advisory fee to open a managed account? If not, what exactly do I do? Keep in mind I have no idea what I’m doing and would need this spelled out in decent detail the exact steps I’d need to take. 
2.) Should I be contributing to my 401k pretax or Roth? I have been advised to switch it over to Roth to not pay taxes on the compounding gains
3.) Should I continue funding 529s, or switch this over to something else given the circumstances?

Thanks in advance for the advice. Happy to provide additional detail as needed.

1j4n4zg,realistically what can happen? (cosigned loan in collections),"in 2019, i cosigned a car loan for my mom. she had a great job at the time and i thought she wqs doing well. she chose a car within her means. she paid the bill herself every month as she was expected to.

until 2020, after i found out she was using heroin since 2016, after what i thought was years of sobriety from cocaine - she was using both. she attempted rehab and my partner and i footed ((all of)) her bills while she was there. 

fast forward to 2021, we had a falling out and she wasn’t working anymore. i have the spare key at my house and yes i could have taken the car, but i didn’t. i heard she was actually living in the car for a while, but i do not know what she has been up to nor do i want to. ((this has solidified to me that she has no conscience truthfully, and i do not intend to reconcile with her, for my mental health sake)) 

fast forward again, in late 2023, the bill went to collections. they called me repeatedly from 2021-2023 and i just never answered because i didn’t think (still don’t) that explaining what happened matters to them, that they just want their money ((which yes i cosigned the loan and i get that it is my problem)) but i do not want to pay on a loan for a car i don’t even have possession of. the car was never registered to my address, always hers. however my name was on the registration due to the cosigning of the loan.

its been this dark cloud just looming over me, i am not sure what will happen, i just really want to know realistically what can happen as a result of not paying it, if anyone else has been in a similar situation. ((a little less than $14k is what is owed))

Some background, my dad is 58 and just got word that he's in remission. He's begun talking about retirement but I'm concerned.

He's wanting to retire around 63-65 depending how bored he gets (or if they fire him after FMLA). He has very little saved, maybe $50k cash and $100k in a 401k. He's made good money his whole life, 6 figures for at least the last 15 years.

Don't ask me where the money went because I don't know. Until about 5 years ago they spent like crazy and racked up CC debt which is all gone now. 

The mortgage has like $70k left on it, house valued around $350k. That'll be paid by the time he retires. 

Anyways, he's essentially just lived his life as though Social Security will be enough when he's retired. His estimate is mid $3,000s a month, moms is like $700.

1j4mbtc,"Tax Help, 1099-NEC or W-2?","I have a two part question & need help before I make a wrong move (or make my move too late & the IRS is on my a$$).

I have filed with TurboTax every year since I have been employed (9 years). I have worked primarily as a W-2 employee, but even when I had small 1099 jobs, I still filed with TurboTax with no issue, & still got a refund because I made way more from my employers those years. In 2024 I worked as an employee (W-2) up until the end of October, I started at my current role in November. My biggest issue is that when I began to file on Inuit (which I have since learned is the devil, thanks to a few subreddits), it said I owed $900 as well as late payment penalties?? $900 is a lot for me, especially in today’s economy, & I’m not understanding how my two months of “self employment” income have me paying in that much even after working 10 months as a taxed employee. I’m also pissed that they want me to pay a late fee because I was completely unaware I even owed these taxes? I’m concerned that my previous employer (who I have not had an amicable relationship with as of lately,) messed up my W-2 or W4 somehow (I don’t even remember filling out a W4 for her), because she’s 1, a douche, & 2, a first time business owner & this is her first year with employees. I would also like to add that I have an appointment with a local tax office (and all of the staff are on the IRS directory), but they will only review my taxes if they are preparing them for me, which would cost an additional $250. If I have to pay in either way I’ll just file online for free, I understand we’re in busy season for tax workers & I have no problem paying them for their time, I just wish I could pay them for a “tax overview” rather than paying them to prepare/file for me.

My second part to this question is that when I first panicked about the number I owed, I discussed with my current supervisor if it would be possible to “sign on” as a taxes employee, rather than an independent contractor. They were more than happy to give me that option, but warned me that I would (obviously) receive a lot smaller of a deposit each payday, & may end up paying more in taxes. They basically said that while it may feel scarier to have to file at the end of the year & pay-in a lump sum, after the deductions I can claim I would probably end up saving money on taxes as a 1099 worker.

1j4jwx3,I think someone was trying to scam me but I don’t get the logic,"I was sitting in front of the shops today playing on my phone, when a stranger turned up and asked to borrow my phone as he quickly needed to check his bank account.

Immediately, I thought this was a very strange request- (using a stranger’s phone to check YOUR bank account??) and felt like this was a thief/scammer so I told him he was making me uncomfortable and he left without a fuss.

I looked it up later and apparently this could be a scam where someone asks for your phone, accesses the bank app on your phone and uses that to transfer money to themselves. 

But I’m confused because my bank apps are all protected by a password/pin so it would be impossible for someone to get into my bank account even if they DO have my phone. So it sounds like a scam that won’t work most of the time.

So what is the logic behind this scam? Can a stranger easily access your bank account if they just have an unlocked phone?

EDIT: I forgot to mention- right before the stranger approached me, a woman with a dog asked me to mind her dog as she needed to go into the shops. I did, and she picked up her dog and I did not think much of it. The stranger approached me immediately after.

Now I wonder if it wasn’t a coincidence? Like they were tag teaming or something. Still strange, minding a dog doesn’t mean I’m going to let go of my iPhone and I didn’t notice anything suspicious around me.",What is the logic behind the scam where someone asks to borrow your phone to check their bank account?

1j4jvjm,It gets better! Emotional and financial recovery after major loss,"Just wanted to share my story, as I know that I'm not the only one to have fallen for a scam and I won't be the last!

In 2019, I was in a vulnerable state - got out of an abusive relationship, grappling with low self-esteem, etc. Had about $80,000 (USD) saved up. I was 29.

Randomly walked by a real estate office and went in, and the salesman was promoting a particular place and made it sound really good.

Without much thought, I bought it almost immediately.

It wasn't a ""scam"" technically speaking, but there were so many complexities I didn't know about and I ended up losing all I put in. I cried myself to sleep for nearly a year and felt so much anger and rage.

Now, 6 years later, I can tell you the following:

1. I met my wife as a result. She is amazing and my biggest hero and supporter. I met her through a side job I took up to make up for the massive loss. This alone would have made the loss ""worth it.""
2. I took the pain and used it as fuel to upskill. I found opportunities that paid multiple times what I was earning before the loss, and those are opportunities I would not have sought out / received had I not lost all my life savings.
3. It numbed me psychologically to financial losses. When you are investing for the long haul, there will be ups, but there will be massive downs. I'm currently down about $100,000 from my peak (don't worry, unrealized losses), but I barely flinched. It helps that I have a fairly sizable cushion and a stable income, so even with the unrealized losses of $100,000, I am able to have the lifestyle and hobbies I always wanted to pursue.
4. It's like a vaccine. Just like you get a vaccine (a small amount of discomfort now; I had a mild fever the day after I got the Covid vaccine for example) to prevent getting the full disease in the future, this financial and emotional pain now from losing $80,000 will make it so that I don't naively lose $800,000 in the future. And, in retrospect, 29 was the ideal age to experience that loss. Any earlier, like in my teens, and I wouldn't have felt the pain because I was still being taken care of by my parents. Any later, especially in my 40s and 50s, such a loss may feel even worse and harder to recover from since I will have so many of my own responsibilities, such as my own kids to take care of. 29 was the age where you can still feel the pain and learn the lesson, but young enough to fully bounce back without too much long-term consequences.

As for any advice... *always* be chary when someone wants your money. Now, I'm not saying that business owners are always scoundrels, but when someone stands to gain money from you, be sure to think things over. If someone is trying to sell you an investment opportunity and makes it sound too good to be true, then ask yourself why they themselves aren't doing it?  
This is different from, say, a small business owner who is trying to sell you products or services that are genuinely useful. Even then, make sure that you understand what you're getting into and make sure that they earn your trust first. (I myself now have a small business and while I of course want money, I always make sure that my customers know what they're getting into and what I can and cannot do for them, and I have turned away clients that I felt I could not help.)

Long story short: Losing $80,000 (my entire life savings at the time) hurt, but it led me to my wife, a better career, a wiser mindset, and inoculation against future losses. Though I would never recommend this to anyone and wouldn't want to go through it again, I’d take that trade any day.",How can I recover emotionally and financially after losing a significant amount of money in a bad investment?,"The individual was 29 years old in 2019 and was in a vulnerable state after getting out of an abusive relationship, grappling with low self-esteem.

They used their pain from the loss to upskill, resulting in better job opportunities that increased their income significantly.

1j4i83o,Need advice on selling to pay debt and rent,"I’m currently in a tough financial situation and I’m starting to think selling my house to clear my debt and starting over is the only option. 

I understand at a surface level this is not a great move but there are a few factors involved. 

Based on comps around me I’m very certain that even after broker fees and other expenses, I will profit just enough off the house to be debt free. I have about 90k in total debt spread across credit cards, car, personal, and student loans. I won’t go into how I got the debt that high but I’m confident that it will not happen again. My wife and I have dramatically changed our spending habits and have gotten decent raises over the past couple years as we slowly paid down the debt. 

We are a family of 5 (husband, wife, 3 kids). Current mortgage payment is about $2500 per month. The house is a 3 bedroom and with a new baby, we know we’ll need that 4th bedroom sooner than later. We are in a unique situation where the two oldest kids are only here half the week as they are from my wife’s previous marriage and spend the other half at their dad’s. We live far enough away where driving them to and from school a couple days a week is becoming mentally taxing on both of us. It’s about 30-35 mins best case scenario no traffic. Closer to 45-1hr during rush hour driving them to school. We drive a minimum of 250 miles a week, in traffic, just getting them to and from school. Also, as they’ve gotten older the 4 years I’ve known them, they are becoming increasingly more social with friends and involved with activities like sports that require us to drive them to their dad’s town.  Their cousins and grandparents live in the town as well, so we are frequently driving there to be with them. Their dad is also very busy most of his time with them so we know if we were closer we’d be able to see them more when he has to work longer hours.  Plus we want them to be able to see their baby sister as often as possible, even when it’s not “our day”. 

The town they live in is expensive (Massachusetts) and we’d probably struggle to buy a 4 bedroom house even without all the debt. Rent in the area for what we need is around $3500 which really sucks, especially compared to the $2500 mortgage that is also building equity. 

That being said, based on my math if we sold the house and cleared the debt, even in the $3500 range for rent, we’d come out with around $1500 extra in our pockets every month with a decent emergency fund. I should mention my wife and I have stable jobs that give steady increases year over year and we’re not worried about job security. 

To me, the pros outweigh the cons. We’d have a positive cash flow that would allow us to save up for a down payment to eventually buy a house again one day. We’d be closer to where the kids lives are centralized and lose the mental headache of driving constantly. They’re be able to socialize with their friends without worrying about the logistics of it. It’s just really hard for me to give up our house and lose that investment (which has already grown so much the past few years without us adding any meaningful upgrades). 

I guess I’m just looking for any advice or alternatives before we pull the trigger. Sorry if this was long-winded, thanks in advance.

1j4hpjt,I Retired and Found I Can't Take Monthly Disbursements From My 401K So I Have To Move It,"As the title says, I retired (62) and when I went to ask for a monthly disbursement from my 401K I discovered that my company does not allow monthly withdrawals. The account has about $650,000 in it. I want to put the money in a lower risk account than what it is now and was thinking of something along the lines of about 30% stock and 70% bonds.

I have 4 choices:

Leave it there (Not an option. I need money.) or

Withdraw all of it (and what? Nah.) or 

~~Roll it to another 401K plan that does allow monthly withdrawals or~~ (since I retired, no new 401Ks for me)

Roll it to an IRA that also allows monthly withdrawals. 

I discussed a lot (investment objectives, risk tolerance, etc.,) with the company (Voya) financial advisor I spoke with. He recommended I roll the money into a regular IRA and use their advisory service who will manage and rebalance the account at least annually. The advisory service would also be available to me to answer questions and give advice. 

He recommended a Vanguard ETF. The management fee would be 1.022% and the fund fee 0.5% for a total of 1.065%, or about $6,900 annually. 

But that seems like a lot that's not going into my pocket. I was paying only $1400 a year for this 401K before I retired.

I really don't know how to manage money so the idea of someone watching it and adjusting investments for me is appealing but I'm pretty sure I could also just roll the existing 401K into some Vanguard, Fidelity or Schwab ~~401K or~~ IRA account that I could open and not pay that 1.022% management fee. 

I'm pretty sure those three companies would offer a 

~~401K that allows withdrawals or~~ 

an IRA that allows that as well as Voya and maybe for less money. 

I would think those companies would also have a ~~401K or~~ IRA that has a 30/70 investment mix that doesn't need more management than perhaps once or twice a year since I'm not terribly proficient at that.

The advisor said the the non-managed accounts the offer only allow mutual funds (which seems OK) but are actually more expensive than the advisory service accounts. He said the non -managed account would cost me about $8400 a year. I find that odd. 

Where are the flaws in my thinking? Am I missing anything? I think I just have sticker shock at that $6900 - $8400 a year costs.","Am I missing anything in my thinking about rolling my 401K into an IRA for monthly withdrawals, given the high management fees?","The individual who wrote the Reddit post is 62 years old and recently retired.

1j4h5sx,New IT job absolutely wrecking mental health and productivity outside of work. Looking to take a personal loan to focus on those two things,"Basically the title. I just recently started a new job as an IT call center technician and although it is a decent job with decent pay ($21 dollars an hour), I am completely remote from 8am to 5pm everyday. The only catch is that I have absolutely zero leeway to leave my workstation besides my one hour lunch.

My mental health has tanked because I feel completely brain dead doing this job, and I didn't take IT certifications just to get stuck in my room doing password resets all day. It's also been extremely hard for me to maintain a any semblance of a sleep/gym/life schedule because of the strict adherence policy and even when I'm off work, I feel so drained and empty from the day that I can barely get myself out.

I've been thinking of taking out a personal loan so that I can focus on my mental health (and my health in general tbh). My expenses monthly are pretty manageable, I have a good deal on rent at $600 a month and my other monthly bills only add up to $300 dollars, so a total of $900 dollars in bills and then maybe an additional 150-200 on surviving (food, toiletries) and I do have an on-call status on standby as a barista that I can take at any time to pick up shifts part-time (for $16 but much better mental and physical health)

What I'm wondering is, would this be a good idea? I am currently working on slowly paying off credit debt (less than 2,000 dollars) but it's not urgent at all. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of 3,000 to 5,000 dollars so that I won't have to worry about working my new job and I can comfortably focus on getting myself back to a better headspace.

Any tips?",Would taking out a personal loan to focus on my mental health while managing my expenses be a good idea?,"The individual has recently started a new job as an IT call center technician, earning $21 an hour, and works remotely from 8 am to 5 pm with a strict adherence policy that allows no breaks beyond a one-hour lunch.

They have previously pursued IT certifications, which makes their current job situation unsatisfactory for them.

1j4f1pp,Transferring Farm Title from My Dad to Myself,"Hello all - Illinois resident here. I apologize if this is all strung together randomly - I am trying to gather my thoughts on a big life change. My family recently lost my mom after a 19 month cancer battle. We are all beyond devasted. Before her death we discussed transferring the deed to their farm, where her and my dad resided, to me in order to protect it should my dad need care.  My dad agreed that this was a good idea wo keep the farm in the family. My dad has great health insurance and is on Medicare, but I know bad things still sometimes happen and should he need to get on our state Medicaid they would seize property.  Now that my mom has passed, my husband and I are considering selling our house to go stay on the farm. My dad would love the company and we could keep what's left of our little family close. We are hoping that after we pay off the mortgage on our home to clear almost $100k profit. There is a solid oak newer barn on the farm property we are thinking of remodeling into a house using the funds. I have been waiting to make big decisions until we have some more perspective and clearer rationale. I don't want to make any huge decisions while we are grieving, but I'm trying to work out logistics.  So - a few questions. 

  
1. Are there tax implications for selling the house and turning that kind of profit? We plan to take the proceeds and pay off any existing debt, then use the money to remodel the barn. (Side note: I am getting estimates for power service, water service, septic tank install etc. to get an idea of the outlay required for basic infrastructure costs. )

2. Do we 'buy' the land from my dad at that time to transfer the deed?  Is there a better way to do this to protect the land and home?

  
Thanks in advance for any advice. I will edit my post for clarity if I have missed some details. I apologize if I have forgotten something -I am still trying to gather my thoughts.

Edit: I used the term 'farm' because we call it that, it is not a professional farming operation, it is 40 acres where we gardened and raised animals.

Hey all,

I’ve put the max each paycheck into ‘Employee Before Tax’ and already hit my $23.5K Pre-Tax contributions this year. I'm about to get a bonus, and want to tax-optimize that money. 

Question 1: Is it correct that setting 'Employee Roth 401K' to 90% won’t help since it contributes to the same $23.5K max?

Question 2: If so, do I ratchet up 'Employee After Tax' and then go through the instructions under the 'Turn my future after-tax contributions into Roth money automatically?' button in Vanguard? 

Question 3: I want my Pre-Tax contributions to be Roth, so they get taxed now instead of later, so I think I should also select ‘Convert my current savings to Roth.’ Does that take my non-Roth contributions so far this year and move them to Roth?  Would that in any way mess up my contribution limits this year, or lead to any tax issues?

I’m in a pretty tough situation right now, and I’m hoping someone here might have some advice or ideas that could help.

i have a decent enough job but it’s commission based so i make $6000 usd some months and then $2000 usd others. it makes it so much harder to plan and budget. i’m going through a divorce so im a single mom and i was also left with the house but not the car. he also refuses to pay for and child support or child care unless directly court ordered but i can’t afford to take him to court let alone get a lawyer to represent me. i want to move as rent is 1.6k a month but i can’t afford to break my lease. to be able to work my son has to go to daycare so that’s an extra $300 every week. to get him there and for me to work i had to get a new car as there’s little public transportation where i live and nothing close to routes id need. 

i want to get out of this rut but im at a loss on how to start. i could and want to get a second job but to get a second job id need another form of childcare which would take most of the funds id get from working that job. i make too much in my area to qualify for any gov assistance, even health insurance and certainly not any food stamps or anything of that sort.  

how can i get out of this loop????",How can I get out of this financial and personal rut?,"The individual in the Reddit post is a single mother going through a divorce, which has significantly impacted her financial situation. She has a commission-based job that provides inconsistent income, ranging from $2,000 to $6,000 per month, complicating her budgeting and financial planning. After the divorce, she was left with the house but not a car, creating additional transportation challenges. Her ex-spouse does not pay child support or child care unless mandated by a court, but she cannot afford to pursue legal action due to financial constraints.

She faces high living expenses, including a monthly rent of $1,600 and weekly daycare costs of $300 for her son, which are necessary for her to work. The lack of public transportation options requires her to own a car, adding another layer of financial burden. Despite wanting to improve her situation by obtaining a second job, the need for additional childcare would consume most of her potential earnings from that job. Overall, her background includes a challenging family situation, financial instability due to her job structure, and a lack of access to government assistance despite her circumstances.","The person is going through a divorce, struggling financially, and seeking ways to improve their situation as a single parent.",30s,female,divorced,commission-based job,middle class,not healthy,not specified,overwhelmed,no,frustrated,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1j4dzgx/how_to_get_out_of_the_middle/,povertyfinance

1j4cd30,It hard to be kind to yourself,"There is so much shame associated with being financially insecure... I've been yelled at and mocked by partners and family. I've internalized so much of how I ""ruined my life"" 

I was young, fiscally uneducated, and mentally unwell. 

Now I'm older, caring for myself, but I feel like I'll never recover from the debt and bad decesions. 
This feeling of being a failure who ruined thier future of never being able to escape the debt, never being able to build savings... 

I thought it was going better before life came for it all. Settled credit cards, refinanced student loans, I did all the work. 
Then I met this new girl, let myself go out a bit and the  she started convincing me to go to doctor and take car eof myself. I hadnt seen a doctor or dentist in ten years. But I had payed down my credit! Why not use this money to be happy and take care of myself! 

This ""money"" I don't even have. What rediculous thinking. Put more and more on credit again because ""I'm paying it this time!"" ... Well we broke up after the holidays. Card is maxxed. ""how could a smart woman make such stupid choices"" ""but you have a job what do you mean you can't go out"" no one in my orbit really knows. My friends make comfortable lives with the same measily pay cause they did it right from the start. It's so hard to open up about after being put down about it when young. 

I've never had nothing like this. I'll be paying overdraft fees until next payday unless I can find something to sell. I know it won't happen quickly because I don't have much at all. 
Luckily have some canned beans and rice in the pantry, heating oil seems like it will last this week... I could only make sure rent was paid. 

I reached out to some family and was told they couldn't make it work, my mom confessed she's behind on her home equity loan - she's taking new credit cards out in her maiden name ""to get new accounts"". Can't imagine that won't catch up to her too. everything is fucked. 

I want to scream into the sky so violently my heart stops. The stress the shame the isolation, it is killing me. ",How can I cope with the overwhelming feelings of shame and isolation associated with my financial insecurity?,"The individual expressing their crisis has a background characterized by several key factors:

1. **Financial Education**: They identify as being fiscally uneducated during their youth, which has contributed to their current financial insecurity.

3. **Age and Personal Care**: They indicate that they are older now and have begun to care for themselves, including seeking medical and dental care for the first time in ten years.

4. **Debt Management**: They have previously worked on paying down credit cards and refinancing student loans, which shows an effort to improve their financial situation.

5. **Relationship Dynamics**: The individual experienced a recent relationship that encouraged them to prioritize personal well-being. However, following the breakup, they found themselves in a worse financial situation due to increased reliance on credit.

6. **Family Situation**: Their family context includes support issues, as they reached out to family members for help but were met with limitations. Their mother is also struggling financially, taking out new credit cards to manage her debts.

7. **Social Comparison**: They feel a sense of shame and isolation, especially when comparing their financial struggles to friends who have achieved financial stability, leading to feelings of failure.

Life has not been kind to me, so I write this with tears in my eyes because I feel I have hit rock bottom. 

I lost my father back in 2007 when I was just a child, and my mother died in 2010. I have been completely alone since then. There are no siblings, no extended family members to turn to, just me against the world. I have tried to fight so hard and build a life for myself, but every time I take one step forward, it's as if I'm pushed back ten steps. I am currently homeless. I was evicted from my apartment for not paying rent for the last three months. My landlord locked me out, and I have been sleeping on the streets and just relying on the occasional kind stranger to get a meal. I am hungry, exhausted, and to be honest, I'm losing hope.

 I have struggled with depression for many years, but these days it has gotten so much worse. I feel like I'm drowning, and the number of times I have thought about just ending it all weighs on my mind so much that I can hardly keep track of how many days a week I reach that point.

1j49few,I'm seeking advice regarding my single 63-year-old mother's frequent requests for financial assistance.,"I'm seeking advice regarding my single 63-year-old mother's frequent requests for financial assistance. Since relocating to the US, my mother has consistently asked me for money; however, I'm currently unemployed, and my husband's salary barely covers our living expenses. Notably, my mother has never been employed, and after my eldest brother passed away 15 years ago, a family friend supported our education for 15 years, unaware that we attended public school and the funds were used for other expenses. My father has also provided intermittent support.

Sadly, my brother's friend and father have ceased providing financial support to my mother and younger sister due to my brothers friend and my fathers 
 illness this year, which has left them unable to work. As a result, I have become the primary source of financial assistance, as they continually request help with her Medication maintenance and other expenses. When my grandmother passed away three years ago, my mother received a substantial inheritance, but she struggled to manage the funds effectively. I consistently advised her to invest wisely and spend her money judiciously, cautioning that once I relocate to the United States, I will be unable to provide financial support. I also suggested that my younger sister should attend public school. Unfortunately, my mother failed to heed my warnings, and now the situation I feared has come to pass. Her funds have been depleted, and with no alternative sources of financial support, she is now reliant on me, expressing that they have exhausted their resources.

I have a strong desire to support them, but unfortunately, I am unable to provide any meaningful assistance and do not wish to ask for financial help for my husband, as he is not responsible for my family. My mother frequently shares Facebook posts about her child, who she alleges has abandoned her, shares negative post on her fb byand she uses my name to request donations for other people, which is having a profoundly negative impact on my mental health. As a result, I am reluctant to share any positive news about my life on social media, I cant even share it to them, as I am concerned that she will use this as an opportunity to request even more assistance, and I am anxious about what others might say regarding my circumstances, living in the US while my family in the Philippines faces difficulties.

Our apartment lease ends in August. Last year, they sent out the paperwork in 5 months early in March to renew our lease.

We were scared it would increase more and we couldn't find another place so we signed. We are waiting to get our papers for this year which I assume will be any day now.

If the rent goes up again, we will not be able to afford it as we are barely getting by as is. The base rent on the website is currently much cheaper than what we are paying. I would like to find somewhere cheaper, but then we have to somehow fork out the money for deposits/fees/etc.

I gambled on someone taking it so I could save $1100 a month. SILLY ME!!!!!

You sign up, get a bonus, fill out surveys, and rack up cents per minute.  Not alot of money but not difficult work.

It would collect data from me about 75% of the survey, a range of political, interest, shopping habits, demographics, voting inclinations, medical.  And it would stop at 75% and say I'm disqualified.

1j2v8hd,What to do after college,"I 22M am a senior in college graduating this May. I will be graduating with a Bachelors in Public Health and a Minor in Child Development. The original plan was to go straight from Undergrad into a Doctorate of Physical Therapy program but I am rethinking this decision. 

I have gone through undergrad debt free and will likely go significantly into debt to get my Doctorate of Physical Therapy. I estimate anywhere from $50k - $100k in loans as it is next to impossible to work through PT school from what I have heard. 

This being said the average PT only makes about $80k a year (area dependent of course) which for the debt I would be taking on does not seem fiscally responsible. I currently am looking to work for at least one year after undergrad to give myself a break from school (genuinely just very burnt out and know it would not be wise to enter a doctorate program with my current mental state) but don’t know what to do after that. I have seven years to apply to PT school after I graduate so I am wondering if it’s not worth trying to get in the door of other fields and entering the workforce debt free and taking a few years to see if I still want to pursue PT. 

In addition to this I will be needing to buy a new car in the coming years as mine is getting by up there in age and miles and is starting to have some electrical issues. I only have about it $11k to my name (all in a high yield savings account) as I have been essentially paycheck to paycheck throughout college and I don’t know if getting a small auto loan may help lower my student loan rates or visa versa. Additionally I’ve only had one line of credit since 18 and have about a 770 score, I have never had an auto loan (basically drove a beater $2k car was rear ended declared not at fault at paid $7k after deductible so I was able to actually get something nice), and I currently receive a good student discount on car insurance. I will be moving home after graduation (parents agreed to one year rent free and evaluate after one year depending on economy, job market, etc.) so my expenses will be significantly reduced as I will no longer have rent and utilities to pay. The only expense likely to increase is my car insurance but it’s not expected to go up by more than ~$30 - $40 a month. 

Would it be wise to get a small auto loan (~$10k) while in between undergrad and PT school? Would to be wise to wait until something happens to the car? I feel like getting a small loan before PT school and hopefully having it paid off before PT school will not only help with student loans but is also a much better alternative than having to take out an auto loan while unemployed and in PT school. 

For context PT school is about 3.5 years so my current car will have to last me anywhere from another 4.5 years and above. I currently have a Volkswagen with 120k miles so another 4.5 years will put me somewhere around 160-170k miles which is a lot for these cars. 

Any advice is appreciated!!!
","Would it be wise to get a small auto loan (~$10k) while in between undergrad and PT school, or should I wait until something happens to my car?","The individual is a 22-year-old male, currently a senior in college, graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Public Health and a Minor in Child Development. He is planning to graduate in May and initially intended to go directly into a Doctorate of Physical Therapy (PT) program after completing his undergraduate studies. 

He has managed to go through college debt-free; however, he is reconsidering his decision to pursue the doctorate due to the potential debt he would incur, estimated to be between $50,000 to $100,000. He is concerned about the financial implications since the average salary for a physical therapist is around $80,000 a year, which may not be fiscally responsible given the debt he would take on.

Currently, he is feeling burnt out from his studies and is considering working for at least a year after graduation to take a break from school. He is contemplating gaining experience in other fields while remaining debt-free and delaying his entry into PT school, which he has seven years to apply for.

1j2uteg,"Urgent repair, financing options?","I purchased a family home a few years ago- it was the only way for me to have affordable housing at the time. It made the most sense for a variety of reasons. Long story. Unfortunately, I just had several estimates done for work on the house- specifically the crawlspace area and it needs to be done urgently, borderline emergency-type repair. 


I picked the company I wanted to work with and they sent me links for financing options to apply for that they work with. One denied me, the second asked for household income on the application but the contingency on approval is providing proof of individual income, it didn't ask for proof of household income, and mine alone is only about 35-40% of the household's income... They said I'd have to add the other household member as a cosigner to count household income but his credit is terrible and would likely disqualify me from the loan. They also had initially offered me 11% for 180 months but the approval was for 20.5% for 120 months making the payment WAY out of my budget. 


I tried to do a home equity loan with 3 different places but can only use my income. Initially, 2 of them said all of my income would count and prequalified me but I was later denied using about 1/2 of my personal income which made me no longer qualify. I would 100% do the repairs myself if it didn't need to be professionally done. 


Is there a good company to potentially get a personal loan through for urgent home repairs that'll allow me to use household income but only myself on the credit application?

1j2qn7c,Desperate for Income as a Student & Artist—Looking for Quick Earning Strategies,"will be posting it to several subreddits

Bit of context about myself: I’m in my final semester of university, with only three months left to complete my engineering degree. As you can imagine, it has been quite expensive. The program was originally meant to take four years, but due to financial struggles, I’ve had to take on multiple part-time jobs that didn’t pay well. This left me with little time to fully focus on my studies, leading to multiple failed subjects.

Currently, I am in debt—about $800 for living expenses and another $1,000 left to pay for tuition. To make ends meet, I’ve worked various odd jobs, most of which were outside my skills and engineering field. However, I’m also a visual artist and illustrator, and these skills have been my main source of income. Unfortunately, I’ve been burnt out and overwhelmed lately, which led to losing some clients. My Fiverr commissions have also slowed down, especially since there aren’t many upcoming events in the first half of the year (I mainly illustrate for films and theatre productions).

Right now, I urgently need money to stay in my current apartment. There have been days since January when I’ve barely had enough to eat, and I don’t have a part-time job at the moment. My parents aren’t a reliable source of financial support for personal reasons I’d rather not go into. Before, I was at least managing paycheck to paycheck, but now, things have become much more difficult.

I’m looking for new strategies to quickly earn money—both for my daily expenses and to secure my future as I approach graduation. Since I’m an artist, I know how long it takes to rebuild and market myself to get consistent clients. I also don’t want to resort to extreme lowball offers that take a lot of time for very little pay.

Does anyone have any advice on ways I can make money quickly? Are there potential clients here who might be interested in my work? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated—I just want to be able to sleep peacefully at night (been really sleep deprived) and afford basic necessities.

I know many others have gone through similar struggles, and I’d really appreciate any advice or insights.

1j2p3bz,My blood clot is ruining my life and finances.,"I'm only 22 and already having really bad health problems. And it's sad there's no real help out here. Life's been terrible and I'm usually used to it, but it's getting way worse. I tried to appreciate life since my diagnosis. Tried to burry myself in work and hobbies. I coughed up blood a few times and my work rate was going down by a lot and they had to let me go because of my performance last month. I've been trying to get surgery and have them remove it with the thrombectomy surgery they reffered. But the surgeons told me the procedure is too risky or the clots are ""too hard to reach"" and keep asking me to take blood thinners. I told them I can't afford them since I lost my job. I looked for a second opinion but the other hospital is looking for upfront payment for the deductible when the surgery could possibly save my life and help me get better. 

  I live by myself in a small shitty apartment that I'm probably about to get evicted from. I can't make last month payment and I'm already getting notice like crazy. I'm mostly trying to find a way to have this surgery done, so I won't need to depend on anyone in the long run. This month has made obvious that I'm alone in this. My only real family lives in London. And offered for me to live there, just can't get there. I've been really hungry, needing blood thinners, and feeling week day after day. 


   At this point I'm actually hoping it kills me. My power is off, and I can barely barely walk to a bus stop. I had to stop using my car because I almost crashed while coughing. And I tried to get on disability because they weren't helping me with the surgery. But it's almost been 3 weeks with no response. If all of this isn't enough, my taxes are weeks late and turbo tax is telling me the IRS may have deducted some of my taxes to go towards unpaid debts. And no one at the IRS is picking up the phone. I know this seems more like a rant, but I need some advice. I had a suicide attempt recently and had to call the hotline again last night. The same thoughts are coming back. My job still has me on payroll and I've been denied link. My township has no funds, I have no medicine, and all salvation army could offer is a few bus passes, and a couple hotel vouchers. I'm in a small city and I'm trying to hold out until I'm able to get surgery. I thought I could do this alone. I tried to see a therapist but even that's expensive. I need mental health but my physical health is deteriorating and I'm not even able to get a handle on that. ",How can I get help for my health issues and financial situation when I'm feeling so overwhelmed and alone?,"The individual is 22 years old and has been experiencing serious health problems which have worsened over time. They describe their life as generally terrible but assert that it has become even more challenging recently. Following a diagnosis that has led to deteriorating health, they attempted to cope by immersing themselves in work and hobbies. However, their health issues escalated to the point where they coughed up blood, leading to a decline in work performance and ultimately resulting in their termination from their job.

They have been seeking a thrombectomy surgery to address their health condition, but surgeons have deemed the procedure too risky and advised them to take blood thinners, which they cannot afford since losing their job. Their attempts to seek a second opinion at another hospital have been met with the requirement for upfront payment for the surgery.

The individual currently lives alone in a small apartment and is facing eviction due to an inability to pay rent. They describe being alone and lacking support, with their only family located in London, who has offered them a place to live but cannot assist with transportation costs. They express feelings of hunger, weakness, and desperation as they await surgery that they believe is critical for their survival.

Compounding these issues, they have experienced delays in receiving disability benefits and have had difficulty communicating with the IRS regarding their taxes, which are also behind. Additionally, they mention the strain of mental health challenges and previous suicide attempts, indicating a significant psychological burden alongside their physical health struggles. They have sought therapy but have found it financially prohibitive.","The person is facing serious health problems, is struggling to afford necessary medical treatment, has lost their job due to health issues, is at risk of eviction, feels extremely isolated and helpless, and has had a recent suicide attempt.",22,male,single,unemployed,poor,"The person is experiencing severe health problems, including coughing up blood and needing surgery for blood clots, and they have a deteriorating physical health condition.",some college,The person is experiencing suicidal thoughts and has had a recent suicide attempt.,yes,desperate,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1j2p3bz/my_blood_clot_is_ruining_my_life_and_finances/,povertyfinance

Everyone in our family has cut her off beacuse she Always borrows money and dosen't pay back(apperently its been like that since she was a teenager accordning to her siblings)

It should be easy for me to say no but she keeps guiltu tripping about everything nice she has done for me in my life. She also always cries and says she is going to kill herself beacuse she dosn't have a reason to live witout money. 

This is mentally really hard for me, i have aldready struggeld with depression and anxiety my whole life so i often break down over this and i just want my mom to be happy. It feels like i am responsible to help her or i will be the reason she ends up homeless or worse.

Her finding new love is t the problem. The problem is that ever since she's gotten with this guy, which hasn't even been 2 weeks, she's been smoking crack, heroin, fent, meth, pills, snorting coke, literally everything. 

I got fired recently and have been taking care of the baby since.

We agreed me staying home wasnt all that bad because she makes more in one day than I ever have in a week with her sugar daddies.

Everything was going alright until she stayed out for a week and kept ignoring me most of the time. I figured something went on. 

I'd say it was the weekend before just this last one that she was supposedly kidnapped, drugged and raped. 

I was ready to fight for her. Went and picked her up and all that. But when she started telling me the story I realized it was just tweaker shit. And then she's still hanging out with those people too. One of them is her new boyfriend Alex. 

This guy has no love and respect for our daughter, obviously, but she makes excuses for him. After she came back from that week long bender he kept calling and texting her trying to get her to come out and smoke more. I told her if he really loved her he wouldnt get in the way of her and her daughter. She just doesn't give a fuck. She acts like she does to make herself look good but at her core she's shameless.

She promised to help me pack this morning and she hasn't answered any of my calls and texts. 

The only way she came back for a second last night was because I threatened to run off with the money we have saved up. I've got $1k into it. She's blown her share on drugs, literally.

1j2ak4e,Repost Grants for medical expenses,"**Hey I'm so terribly just sorry I had to delete my last post I did not realize that all my information was in the right hand corner of one of the photos I had posted.**
  And thank you for the two people that messaged me to let me know that. I really appreciate it. For the people that have already commented on my post I have saved your links and I am definitely looking over them right now.

Hello, 
  I want to start off thanking everybody for taking the time out of their day read my post. I 35f in Ohio. I'm trying to see if there is any type of Grant out there for a Specialist appointment and Surgeries. I have a condition that's called aortic renal vein syndrome. A retroaortic left renal vein (RLRV) is located between the aorta and the vertebra and drains into the inferior vena cava. Urological symptoms can be caused by increased pressure in the renal vein. Instead of having it just on the left side I have it on the right side as well. My issue is the one on the left, it causes a severe abdominal pain and hypertension. From what I found on Google it only affects 3% of the population. And I haven't been properly diagnosed yet but I believe I have what's called 'Nutcracker' Syndrome because of this.
 ***Nutcracker syndrome is a rare condition that occurs when the left renal vein (LRV) is compressed between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. This compression can impair blood flow and cause a variety of symptoms. The most common symptoms are hematuria and pelvic or back pain. Other symptoms include: Fatigue Headaches Orthostatic proteinuria Pain during sex Pain when urinating NCS can be difficult to diagnose and is often delayed. 

     Unfortunately I've been to several doctors and none of them even really heard RLRV. And have literally watched Drs Google this when they see it in my chart. And I don't expect them to know about something so rare, but to actually sit there in front of me after googling it an then have the audacity to tell me the crippling pain 
I feel isn't real is what's really making me furious and so annoyed. 
  
This is where my dilemma comes in at. The only doctor in my area that actually treats this syndrome my insurance does not approve of. I have contacted my insurance about this rare anomaly and they still refuse to give any type of help or assistance. Each visit to see this doctor is about $350 and the surgery they said that I need is about $25,000. I was wondering if anybody knew of any type of grants that may cover this. Unfortunately I don't have the credit nor the funds to even get approved for a loan. I have even applied for assistance with the medical treatment through the hospital of covering a portion of the bill but since this is with an actual specialist there's not much they can actually do. I even tried to get them to give me an itemized bill of what the surgery would be and unfortunately they can't do that unless I get the surgery. But I have to make a down payment on it first. 
  I am so lost and confused about what to do right now I don't even have a clue where to start. I've been googling for the past 3 days and haven't found anything of help. I cannot continue to keep living in this kind of pain and dealing with this issue. Even basic daily functions have damn near become impossible to do. Standing, walking and sitting as even become a task because I can't do them for an extended period of time without causing pain. Not to mention I have degenerative disc disease in my back and neck, I have lung nodules, I have another kidney disease known as medullary sponge kidneys on top of the aortic renal vein issue. And right now I actively have seven smaller size cysts on each kidney. I suffer from reoccurring gallstones which I currently have six now and supposed to be scheduled for surgery soon to get my gallbladder out with a general surgeon. Also a few other medical conditions. I never imagined being 35 and my life is completely ruled by pain. Every doctor I went to either acts like my pain isn't that bad or I shouldn't have any pain at all because I am still considered ""young to them"". I'm starting to see why Canada approved MAID. It just seems ridiculous I cannot believe I can't find a doctor help me on any of the conditions that I'm having. And that's keep telling me to push through it or have a temporary treatment that's not really going to fix anything just a temporary patch.

   Please if anybody has any additional information do not hesitate to let me know. No matter how big or small you think it might be please share. Thank you all so much and hope you have a better day than I'm having.


   *And the image above the highlighted purple area is my retroortic renal vein. You can also see dark spots and my kidneys which are also my cyst. I have dark spots in my liver which you can see. You can also see in the third picture of my lung nodules and then the second picture you can also see that the generative disease and arthritis in my back and neck.


Edit: 
Right now I am currently unemployed and I do receive Medicaid. Unfortunately Medicaid only covers so much and having to see a specialist on a rare disease the caseworker of my insurance told me that it's most likely out of network which it is. So right now I am looking over the information that you beautiful people have sent me. And I want to thank you all so much for the love and support that truly means the world to me. I know we're all just strangers but it makes me feel less alone at this time knowing that there's amazing people out there that will go out of their way to help somebody they don't know. And I love to thank you all for that. Things are just so hard right now financially with bills and my medical issues and I'm just kind of isolated myself from everybody because of this. I know this may seem like a simple reply to most of you, but I'm extremely grateful for all of you who taken time to comment and help. ",Are there any grants available to help cover the costs of a specialist appointment and surgery for a rare medical condition?,"The individual is a 35-year-old woman living in Ohio. She is currently unemployed and receives Medicaid, which has limitations regarding her medical care, especially in accessing specialists for her rare medical conditions.

She experiences severe abdominal pain, hypertension, and several other health issues, including degenerative disc disease, lung nodules, medullary sponge kidneys, and recurring gallstones. These health problems significantly impact her daily life, making basic functions difficult.

The woman has faced challenges in receiving proper medical care, as many doctors have been unfamiliar with her conditions and have dismissed her pain.

Her current financial situation is compounded by ongoing bills and her medical issues, contributing to her feelings of isolation and distress.","The person is dealing with severe health issues related to a rare medical condition, is struggling to find a specialist who can provide treatment, and is facing financial difficulties in obtaining necessary medical care.",35,female,single,unemployed,unemployed,"The person has multiple health conditions, including aortic renal vein syndrome, degenerative disc disease, lung nodules, medullary sponge kidneys, and recurring gallstones.",Not clearly stated,The person is struggling with feelings of frustration and isolation due to their medical issues and the lack of support from doctors.,not specified,lost and confused,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1j2ak4e/repost_grants_for_medical_expenses/,povertyfinance
1j2adno,"Trying to leave family house, can't find a job, what do I do?","I am close to 30 and live with my parents. We have very strained relationships, so my living situation makes me immensely stressed. I have had trouble working since Covid for mostly mental health reasons. Only managed to have a job for a year before I broke down and quit.  
  
 I have regularly been applying to jobs since October. I only worked customer service jobs. and have no education beyond a GED. Nobody will hire me. I am at my wit's end and need to leave, but I recognize my situation doesn't appear very dire on paper. 

What I am asking for is help figuring out my options for assistance. I am in Las Vegas NV. Where do I start? Is there a way for me to leave ASAP? Do I file for unemployment and get job assistance from there? Can I go to the welfare office and talk to someone about it there or would I be wasting our time? 

Sorry if this is a silly post, hard to think. Just a nudge in the right direction would help.","What options do I have for assistance in Las Vegas, NV, to help me leave my current living situation quickly?","The individual is close to 30 years old and currently lives with their parents, with whom they have a strained relationship, causing significant stress.

1j29qp7,Advice On Finance Before Leaving The Nest,"Hey all, I'm not currently in poverty, i think, but rather very close. As a family of 3 we have about 45k(maybe a bit more? unsure of specifics) CAD$ net income a year. Our rent alone is 2400 a month, or 28,800 a year. Already that is over half of our income. Add this ontop of bills and groceries and phone plans and so much more, and suddenly we have pretty much nothing remaining. 

At the moment, I'm 19. I just received my first paycheck in the mail - and I want advice on what i should do with it. 

I've been told i should help with the house and bill payments, but i have nothing saved for my higher education, and i want to go to university and study. How much can I realistically save?

I've heard of high interest savings accounts, but my parents are not very finance smart and don't know much about them, (father is about 7k in credit card debt, and mother has gone bankrupt, twice) and i really really want to try and not fall into that path.

any advice? im likely not going to be leaving my parents house until im into my 20s a bit. like 23 or so. I want to save as much as possible. How much could I save, whilst also helping pay the occasional bill, and not having the guilt of not helping my parents with money.

What are the best high interest savings accounts? should i get a credit card and start building credit? whats the best way to build credit? What banks are best for chequing accounts? What can I do to avoid unnecessary purchases as much as possible?

The individual's parents have financial difficulties; the father has about 7,000 CAD in credit card debt, and the mother has declared bankruptcy twice.
