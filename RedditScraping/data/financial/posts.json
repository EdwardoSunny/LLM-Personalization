        "original": "Not sure if this is the place to ask this but i\u2019m hoping for any help.\n\nSo i was on medi-cal (california\u2019s version of medic-aid) and then switched to kaiser due to a job. I called medi-cal and asked if i could see the same doc i see every 3 months for my prescription refill. They said yes, no problem. Kaiser would be my primary insurance and medi-cal is secondary. Since my doc is a medi-cal facility, they wouldn\u2019t have an issue. Great. I went to my doctors appointment and Everything seemed fine but then i got a bill in the mail for $746 for literally a 5min visit to get my prescription refilled. The doctor didn\u2019t touch me or examine me. He just said \u201care your meds still working?\u201d I said \u201cyes\u201d,and he gives me 3 months worth. I follow up every 3 months for the same thing and have been for 8 years. The bill just says \u201cfocused exam\u201d-$746. That\u2019s it. My current insurance (kaiser) will not pay it since it was out of network. Anyone have any suggestions on what i can do? Im willing to pay something since it\u2019s on me for not being more vigilant about checking my coverage but not that much for literally a 5min visit. I\u2019ve never had private insurance so i\u2019m just understanding the whole thing. \n\nTo add, i called medi-cal and they had me submit a billing inquiry which will take 60 days and will probably result in nothing. I called the doc\u2019s office and they said to call them again in a few weeks to keep them updated on the billing inquiry. That way it looks like im not dodging the bill? The bill is due on January 23 and i dont want this to to hit my credit (i have a perfect score, id like to keep it like that). They said it wont but i  dont believe them. I also think it\u2019s obscene to pay $746 for literally 5min of time. Im in my last semester of nursing school and 750$ is a tuition payment for me. Kind of hard to eat that cost. Just want to settle this with them fast.... please help.\n\nUpdate 1: Went to financial services office and spoke to the rep. She right off the bat gave me 50% off but I still felt it was really high considering the services I got were amount to nothing. I also should add that I looked up what a level 2 follow up pay out was from medi-Cal... $10.50. So my visit would pay the hospital $10.50. That made a $325 bill much less palatable. I explained that to the rep. She then said she would bill my private insurance (kaiser). She knew kaiser would deny the claim but I guess in order to play the bureaucracy game, she needed the denial so the hospital knew I was the only one who would be paying for my services. That way, she would be able to offer a steeper discount after the denial. It's stupid but whatever.\n\nAs far as missing the payment date and it going to collections, she explained to me that the account would sit for 90 days before going to collections. Which means I would receive 3 paper bills in the mail before they kicked the bill to a collection agency. The rep also told me that it would be noted in my file that I was in contact with them so it doesn't look like I'm dodging the bill. She gave me the initial bill i received back to me, with a small note on it and stamp of when I came in. So while nothing has been done yet per se, at least I feel like the ball got rolling. Hopefully my next update will bring this thing to a conclusion.",

My wife is hired as a PRN at a local hospital, and therefore receives no benefits. \n\nI decided since I was behind in retirement, and she did not have any retirement, I opened a Roth IRA for us both in June 2019, putting $1,000 in mine and $1,500 in hers initially, with $500 going into each account every month. I began doing some reading on the differences between LSI and DCA, and found that lump sum was the better way to go, when one article talked about periodically investing from your paycheck when you receive it. We have the money automatically deposited and then automatically invested the next business day, so we do not invest using DCA. We do this because our emergency fund is right at 5-6 months of expenses, and we do not want to take money out of that to fund our Roth IRAs.\n\nMy question is: **should we stop monthly contributions to our Roth IRAs and put that money into our savings so we can invest it as a lump sum at the end of each year?** I am just worried about holding that money out of the accounts for an entire year only to deposit the whole $6,000 at the end of 2020, then 2021, etc. versus depositing the money monthly.",

        "original": "\nWell okay I\u2019m 22 years old. Been working as an accountant assistant to my mom at my parents company in which they own. Import export. Basically I send invoices, receive payments, file, etc. \n\nOn average I make $230 a week. Get paid weekly. That\u2019s me averaging 5-7 hours a day. Usually 6. \n\nWhat\u2019s amazing about this job is that I get to choose my own hours. If I want to work 2 hours that\u2019s fine. As long as I finish my shit. But of course I chose more hours for the money. This makes things easy when it comes to going to the gym, which I want to be a priority from now on. Or other hobbies. And even easier when you\u2019re majoring for accounting at college with 4 classes per semester. Got 2 semesters to go for bachelors. \n\nIn where it sucks is that I have no feeling independency.... because I don\u2019t have any. And the feeling that it was given to me.... because it was. My mom and dad are my bosses. My mother is the stereotypical narcissistic childish mother.... think Olivia Soprano. Maybe not as evil but somewhere along those lines. Every time my mom gets to work I immediately get anxious, scared that I will be yelled at. Everybody feels the same way. My dad seems to be too weak to stand up to her. Or when he does he explodes and then there\u2019s a huge embarrassing  argument in front of everyone.\n\nAdmittedly I\u2019ve fallen to this trap myself. And somehow my mom always makes herself a victim and I feel bad. Point is, my mother makes the place a toxic environment whenever she is there. Which is half the time I\u2019m there. \n\nSo I have two options:\n\n1. Stay at my parents company which has toxic environment but great advantage of hour flexibility in regards to doing my hobbies (especially the gym) or going to college and giving my time to do homework or write essays. And continue to be dependent on them. \n\n2. Find a new job where I can have a feeling of independency and having this feeling I\u2019ve earned this job and will have more own source of income. However because other jobs won\u2019t be as flexible with hours I may have to sacrifice something, like the gym. Or other hobbies. And will have a harder time doing college work. \n\nIf you all have any advice for me, or another option, please be free to share it. I would strongly appreciate any advice.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ll probably be asked if I\u2019m going to want to take over my parents company. The answer is, probably not. I don\u2019t want to be given this whole company just like that. I wouldn\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve earned it. Look right now I live in a small city in south Texas, in the valley. My goal is to be accountant for a good business in a big city like Houston or San Antonio living in a good apartment, living independently.",

        "original": "Hello everyone!\n\n\nI (26F) need some advice as to whether this idea is terrible or not. I have found myself in some credit card debt. I owe $7,500 on credit card A and $4,500 on credit card B. I\u2019ve been paying on them for some time. I have not added any transaction on credit card B for two years, and will occasionally put something on credit card A and try to pay that off ASAP. However I\u2019ve been struggling to pay credit card A off for a while. I try and pay $500 to credit card A a month, but I feel like it only decreases by $50 a month. Credit card B used to have $9,000 on it two years ago, so I think I\u2019ve done pretty well with that one. I\u2019ve been paying around $200-300 a month on that one. \n\n\nAdditionally, I have student loans (both federal and private) and typically pay about $700 a month on those. \n\n\nAnyway, I am back in grad school (online) so my student loan payments have stopped. I am lucky because my work pays all of my tuition, so I\u2019m theory I\u2019m not paying anything out of pocket. However, my work will only reimburse me for tuition costs after I have completed the courses for the semester and submitted my grades. This means I have to pay out of pocket first and wait a few months to get reimbursed. Because of this, I will have to take out additional student loans. \n\n\nHere is my idea: I take out a private student loan for $3,500 a semester (a total of 3 semesters). When my work reimburses me, I use that money to pay off my credit card debt. Then the private student loans get added to the loans I already have taken out. I will start paying on those after I complete my program.  \n\n\nIn my current financial situation, I can\u2019t afford to pay $700 a month in student loans and $700 a month in credit card debt along with my other living expenses. I figured almost completely clearing out my credit card debt will free up a lot of money to throw at my student loan debt later. \n\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit for more info: Credit Card A has an interest rate of 16.65% (variable) and I have been paying about $105 in interest a month. Credit Card B has an interest rate of 17.4% (variable) and I have been paying about $65 in interest a month. My student loans have about a 7-9% interest rate.",

        "original": "I\u2019ll try to keep it as brief as I can - I work in pro sports and it pays very little. I\u2019m three years in at 24 years old and have only made about $40K in seasonal positions (based in sport analytics, I\u2019m an Associate Analyst). I\u2019m a Sport Management graduate from a very highly regarded program, but I didn\u2019t know at age 18 that I wanted to do Analytics/Technology. I have no interest in sales or marketing, rendering my degree useless. \n\nMy current position is seasonal but it\u2019s in analytics with a reputable sports company. However, hours are insane. 80+ hours a week, 50/50 travel and it takes a huge impact on my depression when I\u2019m not eating well, when I\u2019m sleeping in awful hotels, and when I only have 10-12 off days in 8 months, that are solely used for sleeping. \n\nI\u2019m currently working on applying for graduate programs in Data Analytics to widen my skillset and I currently live in the South Carolina area - cheap enough rent and cost of living, but if I stay here I\u2019ll be working probably several retail jobs in lieu of my career path. I have three options to choose from for this coming year, all with tremendous compromise, but I need to make a decision this week. \n\nOption 1: I can return to my job for another season. I can make about $35k and have my rent paid for. The downside is I\u2019ve already done it once and there\u2019s not much point in repeating these positions. The point is to prove yourself one year and go full-time. I was the only one offered to return and I\u2019m regarded highly, but there were not FT roles available. It would come with tremendous sacrifice to my mental health and physical wellbeing, and hours would render me from really pursuing school. I\u2019ve tried to inquire about doing the same work on a more manageable schedule outside their HQ, but they\u2019ve previously told me jobs aren\u2019t available. I\u2019ve debated asking again and just being frank about how much I love the org but the toll last year took on me. But I wanted to prove to them I\u2019d do anything to stay and grow - all I ever got was good feedback and my biggest piece of criticism is I worked at an unsustainably high work rate. With rent covered, I\u2019d be able to make okay money despite all the sacrifice. \n\nOption 2: I was offered a job for $36k to remain in the sports realm on the business ops end. It\u2019s a very reputable company with a lot of growth potential. They\u2019re a good feeder for employees into my industry.  They\u2019re about as good as it gets when it comes to implementing data into pro sports and creating technologies. But, it\u2019s an extremely low salary in Seattle. It\u2019d be a cross country move and I have very little money. I\u2019d have no help relocating either. I have a dog who I need to be able to care for (which I\u2019m not compromising on, he\u2019s family and I won\u2019t discuss it), which means daycare M-F, which I\u2019m aware is expensive in that area. It\u2019d be 40 hours and I\u2019d likely work a side job on weekends at a gym or yoga studio so I could afford a membership. They have said every 6-9 months they do an evaluation with pay raises if they think you\u2019ve done well - with an example being someone who made $10k in their first year. I\u2019m not sure I can afford to do all this though. Seattle is grossly expensive. And I have to make sure I can handle my dog and gym membership, while being able to apply and handle school work. The job is nothing fancy, but there are branches to grow and develop in the field there.\n\nOption 3: I take a complete gap year. I work at a gym or something on a full time basis while remaining in South Carolina. I would be very upset to have no involvement in pro sports for a year and it\u2019d leave a gap in my resume. But, rent in SC is very affordable and I\u2019d have substantial time to apply for grad programs. The other lingering issue to me is I\u2019d feel like I\u2019m wasting a year. School won\u2019t begin now until at least September (note: only seeking online programs), so it\u2019d be essentially 9 months of really twiddling my thumbs outside of my field, which would be very disheartening. This position does allow me the best quality of life - I can afford my rent, pay for my dog, keep working out consistently and keeping depression at bay. But there\u2019s no real growth for me this year. After breaking my back for three years, it just sort of breaks my heart for it all to lead me to some retail job in SC to just pay my bills. My mental state would be much better, but I feel I\u2019d be wasting time. \n\nI guess that wasn\u2019t brief - but I\u2019m trying to gauge what the best course of action is because I do need to make this decision this week.

Not married/no kids, dating. \n\nSigned contract for base salary of $200k per year plus bonuses start in August 2020 in low cost of living area. \n\nDebts: Only Medical school federal student loans to the amount of $260k at avg 5.9% currently on PAYE plan. \n\nSavings: $8k emergency fund in online savings account with 1.6% interest. \n\nRetirement savings: $12K Roth IRA (index funds/bonds).\n\n**Curve ball:** Parents went through devastating  times over the past 15 yrs+ (for brevity sake will keep it at that) and will need to sell their home as their current living situation is not sustainable. They lost nearly their entire retirement and emergency savings. Only \u201cincome\u201d is from SS which is $1300 total per month.

Their remaining personal debt after is an auto loan for a total of $17850. This amounts to $335 per month for 54 months (includes interest of 5%). \n\n**Assessment/plan:** I need to take care of my parents as they will be dependent on me as their only child. They are mortified about this prospect as they have never had to be dependent on anybody and their pride is hurt. They sacrificed so much bringing me up and this is the least that I can do. They will have to live with me the first year at least to reduce expense and adjust moving to a new state.

        "original": "I've worked this job for 2 months and if all goes well should be inducted into the union at the end of January - my superiors and co-workers seem to all have positive opinions of my work so barring anything unexpected I should get in. (I haven't seen the full union contract yet since I'm still provisional - if you ask me specific questions about it I may not have answers but can ask the union steward at work tomorrow, so e.g. I'm not sure if they offer a retirement fund/401k matching but will find out). I'm making more money than I ever have when I was working at my parents' company in the past and now have more money than I know what to do with. I have a checking and savings account at my local credit union and have been dutifully adding a few hundred out of each paycheck to the savings since right now other than gas and car insurance/repairs I have basically no expenses (I have offered my parents to help with the household expenses but they declined to charge me rent on the condition that I make progress towards moving out eventually - which I have been by getting a job, but now that I have the job I should move out some time soon, hopefully within the next year). \n\nI'm probably going to get a big tax refund this spring since I was unemployed almost all of 2019 before getting this job in the fall (my job at my parents' company was essentially as a part time temp worker and I only worked when someone else was absent, which didn't actually happen much since it's a small company). My total income from 2019 was only maybe 5k or so, so I should get nearly all of what I paid in income taxes back since my company was withholding as if I had been working all year.\n\nWhat should I do, if anything, to prepare to move out? I will not be able to afford rent in this area without a roommate unless I break the 30%-of-your-income rule, as the cheapest rent I'm seeing around is more like 40+% of my income not including utilities, and electricity in this area isn't cheap either. How do I estimate my expenses to create a budget, since I haven't really had any expenses before? I almost wish my parents would let me help with their expenses because then I would at least have some numbers to work with for things like groceries and utilities. \n\nI am fairly disciplined when I need to save and have basically only spent my money on necessities and very, very occasional nice things like going out to eat with friends - and we're talking places like Taco Bell, not fine dining - other than buying people Christmas presents this year, which obviously only happens once a year, was dependent on how much money I had available to spend, and didn't hit my bank account too too bad anyway. \n\nBoth my checking and savings accounts are comfortably over $1000 right now, but I know my mental health would be better if I knew exactly what portion of my income is disposable and what portion I really need to be putting away and reserving for the future, because I struggle a lot with guilt when spending anything on myself (even for things like food) unless I am able to earmark a specific amount from each check as spending money. I had a brief, ill-fated college career (no debt left from that luckily because I left before incurring any) and, like most college students, was perpetually poor while I was there, and I remember becoming reclusive and skipping meals because spending what little money I had on seeing friends almost made me feel sick to do because I would feel so guilty when I had to ask my parents for money. I really need a budget even though I know I have enough money for the place I am right now and probably even have enough for a couple months expenses if I were to move out right now. I just really need to know that for sure to feel like I'm being responsible, and I need to know how to figure that out.",

Generally around this time, I get stressed about the bills, fire up Mint, download the transactions and lament all the spending that was happening without either of us really realizing it.  We say we'll get better, then we get overwhelmed and give up after a month.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife describes herself as \"not good with money\" and is terrified of budget apps and wants to leave it all up to me.  Obviously this doesn't work.  She is my partner and not a child to be given an allowance, however I need to find a simple solution so I don't overwhelm her.  Much of the problem is that our finances are complicated.  Several savings accounts, checking accounts and credit cards.  She has no idea how much she can spend when.  She says that because I have a good job, she assumes we just \"have money\" and the idea of checking the bank account balance on her phone is terrifying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI currently have my paycheck going into an account that is used for paying all our recurring expenses.  Then I move cash on a weekly basis to another account tied to a debit card.  This cash is for all variable expenses (amazon, target, groceries, clothing ,etc.)  The problem is that the first time the card gets declined, she just swipes the credit card instead.  While this method does protect my mortgage payment from bouncing, I'm paying thousands in unexpected credit card bills.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday we agreed to lock the credit card.  What I would like to do is create a smaller \"ecosystem\" for her to manage.  Brand new checking account where her income goes (she is a SAHM, so her income is a set weekly transfer from the account my paycheck goes into).  She will have a couple of bills she is responsible for, but after that, I want her to be able to determine how much she can afford to spend at the trip to Target today, and still have enough left for gas and groceries this week, and the trip to the salon she has scheduled for next week.  Knowing there is no fallback credit card in the purse to pull out will be the motivation to manage her account more proactively.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there a simple app she can use that can manage this in isolation?  Where she can schedule planned expenses to better understand that even though there is $500 today, she can only spend $100 and still hit her other goals?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the wall of text and probably much more information than necessary to answer a simple question.

        "original": "Tl;dr at bottom\n\n I feel like I have been struggling with making / saving money for my entire life and I am great at making up excuses but I no longer want to live this way. And sorry if this is also a bit of career help but I feel they are both intertwined. Here is a brief summary of my current situation:\n\nI have $1950 in my bank account\nI am $4426 in debt with credit cards\n\nI make about 1300/mo with good health insurance\n\nCar Insurance is paid off for 6mo (until july 2020)\nPhone 61/mo + gas 25/wk + food 35/wk + gym 10/mo = $311/mo\nI pay my 1/3 of the rent at $653/mo with roommates - I may have to move in Oct due to a roommate moving out of state\nOverall, my bills add up to about $850/mo\n\nLeaving me with about $450 leftover.\nI can probably clear the debt in about 7-8mo, 6mo if I aggressively want it gone. \n\nI only have an associates degree in fire science to become a firefighter but have been barred from civil service due to developing asthma. That was 6 years ago, I have also been struggling to find a career since. I've tried human services, programming, and currently working at a school (another financial problem in the summer). These have all been a passion at one point but every time I pursue a passion, it burns out my appreciation for it. So now I want to pursue something that I believe I'll be good at but not have much of a passion for that can make good money - engineering. I have passed AP Calc back in highschool with a B while taking another AP class. \n\nI most likely will have to pay for school out of pocket now since Ive been in school forever but if it is something that is manageable for now that will have amazing returns in the end, I am 100% down to suffer for 5yrs or so. I know this may be a lot but the feeling that I'm not making much change financially is really starting to bother me mentally. And I am not sure what my options would be once my roommate moves out in Oct., I may ask to move back in with my mom ONLY if I were pursuing engineering and working less. \n\nWould it be a fiscally sound idea to pursue engineering while making $15/hr with $2k in pocket and $4.4k in debt? Do you believe it would be too hard to juggle both right now so I should wait until the summer to find a different job? \n\nI know this is a lot but I would really appreciate any feedback. Thanks. I can give more info if needed also.",

        "original": "Backstory: Hi there. I'm 30 years old and suffer from bipolar depression which I have ignored for the past 3 years. I stopped seeing someone and taking medication and have been on a form of auto-pilot since. I continued taking classes for a CS degree, even though I had no interest in it. Switched to a general studies degree which require two more courses to complete but currently can't afford those out of pocket and wasted all of my community college aid on those cs classes. I'm taking a phlebotomy course in the spring in the hopes of making my way into a hospital setting. \n\nI continued working at my banking job just because it paid enough for my hobbies and reckless spending habits. Recently, after a management change, I was kicked out of auto-pilot. The atmosphere changed very negatively. I quit my job (paid $19/hr) and took on a lesser paying job as a Pharmacy Tech ($14/hr). A client of mine offered me the job and even though the pay is shit, the environment change impacted my mental health for the better. However I'm going to fall back down quickly as I realize my finances, which I have never had in order, start to catch up with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIncome:\n\nI make about $500 every two weeks now. (Not including my state health care which will kick in next month for $78 a month.)\n\nMy father chips in $500 a month to help out or more if I'm in a bind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSavings:\n\n$200 across all of my savings accounts\n\n$17,500\\~ in my 401k that i had with my previous job. I never understood how any of that worked, so I just contributed what my company would match. In less than three months I will be eligible for a retirement plan with my new employer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExpenses a month: \n\nCar: $308\n\nGas: $40\n\nCar Insurance: $313 (I pay for my mom and I)\n\nCell: $150 (Me and my mom. It's the lowest plan but It's so high because I'm on an installment plan.)\n\nInternet: $55 for a year. I got them to lower it because I've been with them for a long time.\n\nApple Music: $10\n\niCloud: $10 (I plan on getting rid of this soon.)\n\nGym: $10\n\nFood: \\~$250 I eat out too much. I really need to cut back on that.\n\nAnd the biggest killer. My debt.\n\nI have around $12,000 in debt spread out across 12 credit cards. If I pay the minimum of each card, it's about $440 a month. \n\nTotal expenses: $1590\\~/mth\n\nAs you can see without my dad helping and my mom not requiring me to pay rent, I'd be screwed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also have two loans from my 401k which have an estimated $3500 left for me to pay. (Took them out for school.) I'm thinking of just letting that hit as a withdrawal which I'll pay the penalty for in 2021 because I can't afford to continue those loan payments right now. Or is that a stupid idea?\n\nAlso I expect to get an estimated $1500 back from my refund in Feb. Which I don't know where to put. Should I pay off the phone? Pay down some credit cards?

So now I am going through the process of gathering all of the necessary documents for the loan officer. ( Wish I had done it sooner) The loan will be in my name alone, since my credit score is 760, compared to my husband's 680. Some of the documents requested were two years of tax returns, and two months of bank statements. Knowing what I know now, there is so much I would have done differently with our finances. For example, my husband keeps all the money we save in his bank account, and I had a separate checking account that I added my husband to when we were first married in March of 2019. I work as a full time nanny, and while I am a w2 employee, and have paystubs to provide, I get paid through venmo which I then transfer to my checking account, and from there I would transfer the majority to my husband's account so he could save it for me. We just added my name to my husband's saving account, and originally, that was going to be the bank we provided the statements from. However, I just realized that his last two bank statements still don't have my name on it, since it hasn't been that long since we added my name to it. Will I have to provide the bank statements from my checking account instead?  That bank account was mostly left with enough money for bills, and then extra spending money, as well as buying groceries and things for the child I nanny for. The family always reimburses me for those expenses, but I'm sure I would have to explain a lot of that to the loan officer. Also, I have only been working with this family for 6 months and earn significantly more than my previous jobs (about 10k extra a year), so my previous tax returns and w2s will only show the previous jobs. Will that be a problem? I am worried that even though I was preapproved for a lot more, I am actually not looking as impressive on paper than my current situation actually is. That is with my income alone. My husband makes more than I do a year, especially since he works a lot of overtime. If my income and information alone wasn't enough to get the loan financed like I was previously approved for, would it be worth it to add my husband on the loan? I am so new to all of this, so any information or advice is so greatly appreciated! I'm sorry for the novel, but thank you so much for taking the time to read this.

I'm 24, recently married, and half-way through my first year as a public school teacher. The weeks leading up to Winter Break, I kept getting these calls from an insurance company called AXA. They kept prompting me to \"set up a time\" with them so they could \"explain my benefits\". I mentioned this to my other teacher friends and they were like \"Oh yeah those guys, I remember doing that my first year\". I thought nothing of it because it seemed like these people were approved by the school district, like they were doing some routine thing that everyone needed to do, and that my other teacher friends knew what this stuff was.\n\n Now, I was raised by two parents who aren't the best with money and I just never learned how to properly handle finances. I need a Michael Scott-level explanation of how retirement, life insurance, health insurance and all that stuff works. Even after this situation, I felt like I've done a bunch of research online and through friends and family for what all this stuff means and I have very little solid information. Anyway, I finally set up a time and this very professional lady explains how retirement works, explains why I need to set up a 403b, and sets me up with an account that is a third-party that partners with the school called TCG Group Holdings. She shows me how to go through my account and contribute money to my retirement plan (again, a 403b). This website also lets you see all the other vendors that my school district partners with. Fidelity, TIAA, etc. Okay, so she gives me a number that she thinks I should start contributing to this plan that comes out of my paycheck. I agree to that number. I set it up through the 3rd party, she leaves. I immediately google this company and find out that AXA is super bad and not a good vendor. High fees, super aggressive in getting you to commit (obviously), and everyone says to stay away. I immediately call them and change my monthly contribution to this policy to 0.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, here's where I'm confused. I still have a policy with them, right? Do I need to cancel that if I want to switch to a better vendor? My in-laws who work in public education say that Fidelity is a fine vendor that they use. I'd like to switch to them but I don't know how to do that. Do I just call them? Is it going to be some outrageous fee to cancel my policy with AXA? I feel like I got duped and now I'm stuck. How do I minimize the damage here? Also, why does everyone say AXA has \"high fees\"? Where do those fees come in? Where do I see the difference between AXA and someone like Fidelity? Is it my monthly contribution? Is it my return on the investment when I finally take out that money from the account when I eventually retire? Does Fidelity invest my money better so that it grows more? Please give me the simplest answer as if you were explaining to a 5-year old how retirement works. Again, this is super embarrassing.

If so, is that true that creditors can just find my business bank account easily and by-pass the anonymity of Delaware LLCs?\n\n5) Pretty sure I need a lawyer to do all this, what type of lawyer should I hire? Do all business lawyer know how?\n\n6) Since a Delaware LLCs is in Delaware, how do I file tax separately? A normal personal tax from my state and a Delaware cooperate tax or some sort? Not familiar with Tax but I will pay all tax as needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just feel like I should isolate my investment funds as much as I can, for security.

        "original": "Hello personalfinance. I'm seeking some advice regarding an impending purchase/investment that my spouse and I need to make (I'll explain). Our situation is as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Early 30s, combined income \\~$250-285k (variable based on commission/bonus). Stable employment in corporate finance and software industry. No children, although planning to. \n\n\\-School loans paid off, \\~$200k mortgage ($1700/month) in midsize, low to mid COL area, \\~$12k remaining between 2 car loans. No credit card debt, only monthly revolving utilization for travel rewards. \n\n\\-Maxing 401k contributions, backdoor roth in 2019 and planned for 2020 for both of us.\n\n\\-Roughly $60k savings, 30k of which is an emergency fund we intend to keep in savings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWithin the next 6-18 months we will need to make a large cash purchase of likely $90-120k, for a home in the country where my spouse was born (naturalized US Citizen) for their mother to live in. This is not an optional or luxury purchase, this will be my mother-in-laws primary residence (in our name) until the time comes when we are able to move back and live/retire in the house. It's something we've planned for since being married and think of as a long-term material investment for ourselves as well as necessary familial support. It's a big financial burden though, and one that we hope to make as soon as possible to move on with our own personal early retirement goals. \n\nMortgage rates in this country are upwards of 15%, and although my spouse retains citizenship of the country, we don't want to deal with a home loan when we expect to be here in the US for the next 10-20 years - so a cash purchase is really our only option. My spouse has tossed around the idea of taking an unsecured personal loan of 50-70k at 5-7% interest to make the purchase ASAP, and I'm not really into that idea. \n\nWithout something unforeseen happening, we'd expect to be able to save the required amount by early-mid 2021. My question is, for this relatively short term, is it worth saving the earmarked home purchase money in a brokerage account in ETFs or other index funds, or should it just be left in savings? It stings to leave gains on the table, and even the best online savings accounts only offer 1.5%, but with such a firm goal and desired timeline I worry a lot about a potential downturn. Appetite for risk here is low by nature, and I'd say even less in this situation. Interested to hear if anyone has had to work through saving for any similar large purchase in the short to medium term. Thanks.",

I'd like to think I'm very good at managing my money. The only debt I have is a school loan of about $15k that I am currently paying back with an IDR plan at about $140/month. A little back story, my wife and I deal with our own finances to try to make the money situation less stressful. It's worked so far until now..... \n\nSo this last year my s/o and I are planning a wedding. I pretty much gave her the reigns, but had multiple issues with overpaying on certain aspects. I tried to keep the cost down but she persuaded me her parents were footing majority of the bill. Little did I know, she was personally paying for a lot and worse, racking up credit card debt. So closer to the wedding, after a long fight, she convinced me to go against my better judgment and use a credit card to finalize a few wedding things. $8k and a maxed credit card later I'm already regretting it. I did my research and did get a card with 18months no interest and no credit transfer fees. She swears she will pay half off with income tax. Recently, she's gotten behind on some bills so I decided to take some action and figure out the problem. After a hard discussion I have all our income and expenses charted out and can easily see our monthly breakdowns. She has 3 credit cards all past the no interest date almost maxxed out. $3k, $5k, $10k, a credit loan for miscellaneous repairs at $2.5k. I suddenly get this sinking feeling cause I don't understand how this happens or how to fix it.\n\nI know it's not a huge amount, but it kills me  knowing that there is money just being wasted in interest I can't do anything about. She does not make enough income to meet her expenses because of this debt. I have started to take some of her monthly bills on myself to break even, but I am still at a loss for solving the credit debt problem. Is debt consolidation worth it? What are my best options? \n\nTLDR; Got married. Found out my wife has over $20k in credit card debt accruing interest along with my $20k of debt. What do I do!",

During the majority of that time, I was still able to perform my duties in my job (I worked in hospitality for years, bartending, serving, etc.).  I did this out of naivety, lack of options, and necessity.  However, the constant masking of the pain over those years took an immense toll on my mental psyche.  I haven't worked full time in a restaurant in over 3 years, but I still deal with depression and anxiety because the pain constantly makes me feel restrained and restricted.  I have held jobs for almost the entire majority of these past 10 years, but it always felt like I was holding on by a thread, both physically and mentally.  My last job I had to quit just last month and I'm currently unemployed.\n\nBut the good news:  After being misdiagnosed multiple times, 2 surgeries, and years of gym and physical therapy, I see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I'm not completely pain free, but this past month has been the best I've felt physically in 10 years, and I'm looking to regain my ambition.\n\nThe problem is that I have been so wrapped up with my recovery that now I don't know what to do and I need a job.  I'm currently not on unemployment or disability because I don't believe I would qualify.\n\nI'm hesitant to re-enter the hospitality field because of the physical toll, but with my experiences and frankly fantastic resume it is the only place that is going to pay me a wage that I am accustomed to receiving.  I've worked in an office before as well, but at the time I left I felt taken advantage of.  I don't think I will be happy re-entering that setting either.\n\nI also have almost 8k in CC debt and rent I need to pay.\n\nLuckily I have parents who would help me if the situation ever got really bad, but I don't ever want it to come to that.  They're retired and they deserve everything they have and the last thing they need is to support a charity case such as myself.\n\nI realize I'll need to make more sacrifices in order to get to where I want to be, meaning I will need to take a job that I may not like and work there for while.

        "original": "In 2018 I started an expensive graduate program that usually ends up in the range of 120-140k debt after graduation (100k tuition/20-40k living). \n\nWithin the last few years leading up to my matriculation into the program, I began dealing with a lot of horrible things. Mother diagnosed and died of cancer, I had a cancerous tumor that was taken out and that was supposedly the end of it (for now) and I have had horrible gastrointestinal issues for a few years as well. I thought that I could just deal with it since I was going to doctors appointments every once in awhile and trying different medications and taking different tests to see what was wrong, so I started the program because I didn\u2019t want to keep my life on hold.\n\nFast forward to 6 months and 36k debt later into the program, grades were good and I was doing well in school, but my health was absolutely horrible. I could not continue the rigorous studying and work schedule while juggling nausea, bloating, weight loss (when I can\u2019t afford to lose anymore weight), and night sweats every minute of every day. It was unhealthy, I was worried, and I decided to drop out right at the start of the third quarter.\n\nAdmissions and program directors told me I could come back after a small break but after dozens of doctors appointments, blood draws, and scans, the only thing I lost was my gallbladder which was not working. I still have symptoms that are bad enough to make me unfit as an employee and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve started having to repay the loans which my dad is helping so far, but I feel as though he may quit soon. As a 24 year old I am still living with him and he makes way too much money for me to qualify for any sort of financial help, which leaves me at a complete standstill.\n\nI continue to go to doctors appointments trying different medications and therapies to no avail yet, I\u2019m tired, and I feel as though I don\u2019t have any options left. Are these graduate loans just going to follow me for the rest of my life? I hate to sound entitled as though I don\u2019t deserve this debt but I truly feel like this is wrong.

        "original": "I\u2019m new to this sub so forgive me if this is the wrong place to post this! \n\nLast March I took a job as a \u201cBookkeeper\u201d at a local, volume high veterinary hospital. It was supposed to be 20 hours a week, just basic bookkeeping, and pay was $20/hr. I have both a Bachelors in Accounting and a Masters in Management so I knew I was overqualified for the job when I took it, but had mental health struggles that made me just want to grab onto something not so stressful and that I could handle.\n\nFast forward to today - it\u2019s been 10 months and I absolutely adore my job. However it is A LOT more than I thought it would be - a lot of management, and a lot of accounting work (not just bookkeeping). Over the past 10 months I have updated a lot of our procedures to make the basic bookkeeping and a lot of payroll automated (cut payroll down from 7 hours to about 3), reduced redundancies in our front staffs work, implemented quarterly management reporting, giving advice to management regarding delinquent employee loans and other financial matters, and a lot of other management work unrelated to accounting. My role was changed to Staff Accountant when I brought up the fact that my work was much more reflective of that, and was also given a $1 (5% raise) 6 months in. I have some big projects - all self directed and things I took the initiative to do myself, rather than be asked - that will also finish in the next few months. This includes taking a lot of my work paperless which is a huge goal at our clinic. \n\nBecause of my education (apparently HR did not advise them I had a Masters degree when I was hired...) and the fact that this job is WAY more hours and work than I thought it would be, at my one year mark I want to ask for a raise. I\u2019m just stuck on how much to ask for. Originally I was thinking of $23/hour, but have also been teetering on $24 but feel this may be a bit too steep. Our HR manager (the only other person in management who isn\u2019t also one of the vets and owners) is currently making $24.11. She came on in HR a few months before I did but before that worked reception (making closer to $14 an hour). Right now she is on maternity leave and I\u2019m actually doing a lot of her job as they didn\u2019t have time to replace her. \n\nBased in this information, is $24 too steep? $24 would make me very happy but I also don\u2019t want to get laughed at. I should add that my bosses are extremely accommodating and appreciative of my work and are constantly telling me how glad they are to have me around. I get along extremely well with them. I went into the job with only 8 hours of training and then was on my own so it was a quick learning curve. I should also add that I will bring a detailed list of my accomplishments at my job to any salary negotiation. \n\nTl;dr: I currently making $21 an hour at my job ($20 when I started), but the job duties are vastly different and more complex than when I started 10 months ago. Is $24 an hour too steep to ask for as a raise? I am an accountant at a local vet hospital.",

        "original": "Hi good people of personalfinance,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologies in advance for typos or bad math. Please be gentle. I realize that this is our fault and I intend to make it right. I have been perusing this sub, along with /r/povertyfiance and /r/credit for the better part of a year trying to get out of this financial hole that I have dug myself in and I have some lingering questions and would like some assistance as to where to go from here. (Hopefully only up!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackstory:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2018, my husband and I worked for the same company making a combined 120k a year in a part of the country where that kind of money went pretty far. Our credit scores were around 760/780 respectively and we had about 20K in savings. We were also renting and only had two car payments. When I was 8 months pregnant, the company went belly up and with about 2 weeks notice, my husband and I were both without income.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThankfully, I was able to keep my insurance through COBRA, and kept it until I delivered a few weeks later. However, job hunting for myself and husband were going absolutely no where and postpartum depression hit our household HARD. We had to break our lease early to move back across the country to in our hometown for better job opportunities/to be near family when I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed. Breaking our lease and moving across the country with a newborn and being jobless depleted our savings completely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then, we have been living rent free at our in laws since the end of 2018. We were both out of work for about 5 and 6 months and had no way to pay our bills with a newborn. I know, I know. Thankfully our in laws floated us our car payment/car insurance money so that we could keep our means of transportation afloat. Everything else, though took a major; major hit  and we defaulted on just about everything and our credit is wrecked with our scores in the toilet and I am practically begging for help to fix this. We are both gainfully employed again. We make a combined 90k a year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am receiving an inheritance check for about 40k this week with another 20k to follow in March and would like to know how to best tackle all of this with a total lump sum of 60k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReasoning/Goals: I would like to eventually buy a house now that we are both gainfully employed again and tackling debts. How realistic is this goal in the next year if we are able to pay these debts off/settle the bigger amounts owed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMuch of our debt has already been charged off/sold and is sitting in collections in an open status. Our debt is as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Card Debt: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMajor Bank A--- 5,300 NOT charged off, but closed by lender. I have been making payments on this now for 8 months in a good standing status. Before this account closed for 5 months of nonpayment, it was in a good standing status for 9 years with no late marks.\n\nMajor Bank A- 1,500 NOT charged off, but closed by lender. I have been making payments on this now for 8 months in a good standing status. Before this account closed for 5 months of nonpayment, it was in a good standing status for 9 years with no late marks.\n\nMajor Bank B- 13,000 charged off by lender. Received a settlement offer for 6,000. I wish to settle this for the 6,000.\n\nMajor Bank B- 1,000; charged off by lender. Received a settlement offer for 200. I wish to settle for 200.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Card Debt in Open Collections:\n\nMajor card lender C-1,000 charged off by lender, sold to attorney. I will likely be sued for this if I cant settle before they send a letter out for litigation. Open collections.\n\nMajor card lender D-3900 charged off and sold by lender. I will likely be able to settle this for 1,600. Open collections.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMedical debt in Open Collections:\n\nCompany A-90$\n\nCompany A-90$\n\nCompany A-125$\n\nCompany A-125$\n\nCompany A-125$\n\nCompany A-125$\n\nCompany B-50$\n\nCompany B-50$\n\nCompany B-50$\n\nNegative Utilities in open collections:\n\nCable-44$\n\nEnergy-30$\n\nRent-161$\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, phew. Those are all of the accounts in a negative standing. I realize the gravity of this situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Good\" Standing debt:\n\nCar debt:\n\n 10k and 12k respectively. No late payments on these.\n\nVarious other medical debt: <1,000K.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that I will have enough cash flow from the inheritance to pay in full most of these and then to settle the debts that have offered me settlement terms already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom my calculations, I will end up paying about 24k to all  open collections, CC debts and various medical debt and pay off 10k to one of our cars for a total of 34k. I will put the remaining 6k into savings and not touch it for emergencies until the 20k inheritance check comes in march; which will  be used to pay off the remaining car with the rest going into savings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow does this sound? How would more financially savvy people of reddit tackle this debt in a correct order to repair extensive credit damage? I have read the wiki and have searched this sub extensively. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit score now stands at about 549. Yikes.

I only worked at that job from **Jan 1, 2019 to April 19th 2019** since the overseas job came and that was paying more than double. That job was cool about it and actually encouraged me to do it helping me maintain a positive working relationship with them.  I was also in the Alabama Army National Guard  and that pay is very negligible in comparison. If I had to guess, gross pay was roughly $1500. I left the National Guard April 16th 2019 to pursue my current overseas contracting job. \n\nI only plan on fulfilling my contact agreement of ONE year, meaning that I will return home **April 27th, 2020**. Obviously this means that I would have fulfilled the requirements of the Physical Presence Test of the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, staying out of country for the 330/365 days BUT that would be AFTER April 15. If I've done my research properly, I should be able to request an extension for my taxes to push that date back to file so that I can make my physical presence test . If I qualify before I file my taxes then I should have an exemption of $105,900.\n\nAgain, these rough estimates until I get my W-2's, for my current job (As of December 26th, 2019) my YTD is $77,797.15. My last job was about $20,000 before I quit, and my National Guard stuff was bout $1500. So all together giving me a total of about $99,297.15 for 2019.\n\nI have certainly gotten lucky with jobs in the last year, and I have never made any where close to this amount of money in my life which is why I have come here to seek advice about how and when I should file my taxes. \n\nIn 2019 I also got married in March and bought a house in July. I have **no** kids or other dependents. My wife's income is easily less than $20,000 since she's been struggling to find a good paying job since graduating with her degree in English. \n\nMy questions are: \n\n* Should I use the extension and wait until my Physical Presence Test has reached 330 days before file my taxes?\n* Will I be eligible for the $105,900 tax break Jan 1, 2019-December 31, 2019 tax year since I started this new job in April? And my gross pay is less that $105,900\n* How will this effect my 2020 year taxes since only 4 months will have been spent in a foreign country (Jan - April) ?\n* When I get around to filing taxes, this is something I should see somebody in person for, instead of using software, right?\n* How will this surge of income affect my wife's taxes? or will it?\n* Since I'm married, should I file \"married filing separate\"?  \n\nI'm the black sheep among my coworkers, since all of them are not married and have been here for 5+ years and are unsure how to give advice to me since I am staying for such a \"short\" amount of time. There are no tax professionals near the base I am at. \n\nAgain, I'm sorry if I did not provide enough information, taxes aren't really my strong suit. Please let me know if I need to provide more information. \n\nTLDR; I make good money contracting overseas, but since I didn't start at the beginning of the year, how will that effect my tax returns given the approximations above.",

After reading up on how I should handle things I\u2019m still overwhelmed because self employment taxes are handled differently(quarterly? And the next time it\u2019s due is Jan15 apparently?) and sales tax is thrown in too.\n\nSo I\u2019ve ran an online store through bigcartel selling enamel pins and keychains I\u2019ve designed for a few years now and recently earned $2000 in 2018 and $4000 in 2019 (not including expenses). Before that, I was only earning a few hundred every year cause I treat it as my hobby. From what I\u2019ve read so far, I\u2019m supposed to be declaring the profit and paying for sales tax for orders from my state(CA). Does that mean I have to go through all my past orders and note down which were from California? I don\u2019t charge sales tax and just take it as a loss since that\u2019s the norm with all other artists\u2019 online stores. Also would this have to be filed quarterly too? On top of that, I\u2019ve sold at conventions but paid sales tax online and recently did some freelance work that I gave my W9 to(which I probably need to file by jan15?)\n\nI\u2019m feeling a bit dumb for believing my parents this entire time.

I have looked over a lot of the information here and it seems like this is the best course of action, but wanted some advice.\n\nFor some backstory; my wife and I have both been broke the majority of our lives.  We have both been homeless before.  I'm currently going back to school because my previous profession doesn't pay for shit and her teacher's pay is not great.  We have no credit cards, no car payment, no health insurance, currently rent and she has 50k in student debt.  I will likely be incurring my own student debt before long.\n\nI handle our budget and have meticulously documented everything for the past 2 years that we have lived together.  We typically close out the year with surplus and have held the joint account at 4-5.5k for that time period.  She came into the relationship with 3k.\n\nI am going into a healthcare field and after tons of debate and study, we have determined that health insurance is an absolute waste of money for us.  The premium we could afford has a deductible so high that we would *never* pay it off.  Our state does not offer Medicaid/care gap coverage.  So we decided that saving for health emergencies, a replacement car or a house down payment is the most responsible thing to do.\n\nWe would be starting by putting aside about 1.5k and are hoping to put ~100 into it every month.  My wife has a Capital One savings account at 1.7%.  She has kept it open for years with a few hundred in it.  But we don't have a Capital One branch here and they don't have the best reputation.\n\nOur current bank offers abysmal interest rates, so I've been looking around online and found [Bank5 Connect](https://www.bank5connect.com), [Vio](https://www.viobank.com/online-savings-account), and [HSBC](https://www.hsbcdirect.com/savings/).\n\nAre these good options?

I am a 25 year old male that makes a stupid amount of money for my age (not bragging - if anything, I feel like my company overpays me). I don't want to miss an opportunity to use my money to become wealthy at a fairly young age. For the most part, I have a clean slate with no fuck-ups yet (no stupid purchases, no major debts, etc.) Below are a few bullets about my life. \n\n* I work full-time and make about $185,000 annually, and my wife makes about $40,000 annually. Our nut is incredibly small with about $2500 going out for everything each month between the two of us for rent, groceries, entertainment, vehicles, etc. \n* I personally don't have any student debt, but my wife has about $25,000 left. We have been quickly paying these down with about $1,000 per month allocated to loans. \n* We rent our townhouse, but plan to purchase a home for around $300,000 this summer (I plan to put at least 20% down to avoid PMI). \n* I have about $105,000 in liquid assets (long-term high interest savings, a CD that is about to mature, and general checking and savings). $60,000-$70,000 is allocated to the home purchase this summer. Each month, I net about 10k which immediately goes into our long term savings - we can basically live off my wife's income while mine is being saved. \n* I currently max out my 401k and my Roth IRA (I understand we may be over the income limit - this is something I need to address when we get our W2 in a couple months. We just got married and we've only had this household income for about 10 months - I got a new job last February). \n\nThe questions I have are this: What, in general, would you do with the extra money? I have been mostly just sacking it in a long-term high interest savings account which generates about 2.25%. I have thought about keeping my planned down payment in the account and throwing the rest (including future income) into an index fund, but I don't want to miss out on potential investing opportunities at my young age. I have interest in rental properties, apartment complexes, etc.\n\nI'm aware that this is a very broad post, and some may be shaking their heads at me, but in general, this post is simply asking this: What should a young husband and wife that have very little debt do with household income over $225,000 a year? Should we both maxout our 401k's and invest the rest in a brokerage account? I don't want to miss the wealth train when I\"m young. Thanks",

        "original": "Hello,\n\nLet me give you quick info about me that might be needed. I am a 29 M, making approximately $60k. I went to graduate school which severely delayed my earnings, but in my field (child psychology), there is the potential to make $100-200k within a few years, once you add in base salary and consultation work and other moonlighting. I have approximately $90k in loans, with $50k interest free. I have no other debts at the moment.\n\nI have a wealth manager through Northwestern Mutual who makes commission off of any services and policies I purchase through them. So far, his services have all been free. Today we were discussing life insurance and he was trying his hardest to convince me to take a whole life policy through them vs. a term life. However, the benefits did not add up to me. I'd appreciate a second opinion.\n\nHere is what he showed me. Based on my age, income, health status, etc., I could take a term policy that would start off at $700 annual premium and slowly increase. By the time I am 50, I would pay a total of about $16,000 in premiums. This would be for $1 million in coverage.\n\nFor the whole life policy, I would pay $12,000 annually, with some of that reinvested. By the time I am 50, some of that reinvestment would result in a tax-free dividend return of approximately $100k. However, by that time, I have also payed out $240k in premium. This equates to a net loss of about $120k compared to the term policy (140-16+).\n\nI understand that he makes more if I select the whole life, so I was skeptical during our meeting. It is not that I think he is swindling me, but more that I recognize his livelihood depends on this vs. term. Yet, I simply do not see the short-term or long-term benefit of it. He said there were other factors I am overlooking, such as term policies not paying out for most people, yet I am failing to see how this benefits me. Especially right now when I can take the near $11k difference in annual premium each year and make that work perhaps more efficiently in the short-term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts? I'd appreciate anyone else's input.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your input and advice. To clarify some things, I do not pay this man anything. We met through a friend of mine that does make considerable money (runs her own business) who thought it might help. Perhaps he has been helpful to her. For me, he has mostly confirmed things that I have already been reading, and some of what he says makes sense (e.g., pursuing long-term compounding interest returns, diversifying a portfolio). It has been nice to talk to someone that speaks this language. I am from a very poor background where no one in my family thinks about financial stability and independence so I am often figuring this out on my own. As long as his services continue to be free and I find some use in them, I will keep talking with him. \n\nThis was the first time where I paused during a meeting. If it continues, I will move on from him. I do think, during the meeting, he was frustrated with my questions (\"We're getting too deep in the woods right now\") but I had already been planning to post here. \n\nAs for why life insurance, well the only way I got most of my student loans for graduate school tax free was through a non-profit organization that required a co-signer (single-parent who, as mentioned, does not make much). Last thing I want to do, should anything happen, is pass on that loan to her were I to pass. \n\nDisability insurance seems to make some sense though, if a bit boring and seemingly unnecessary.",

I am not making enough at my current job and can\u2019t even dream of making a decent living while barely skirting the mental health field so I do office admin work that I hate. Right now, I make 47k am in NYC. \n\nAt first I wanted to attempt to work full time while I go to school part time. I work 40 hours a week and commute about 2.5-3 hours a day. For a MHC degree, there is no way around the internships (20-30 hours a week). This just is not doable and I worry about doing poorly in school because of this. Also last time I was in school part time (undergrad) FAFSA only let me take out loans for 2/3 of the total expense. The other 1/3 had to be paid up front out of pocket. My savings simply isn\u2019t there and I am pretty much paycheck to paycheck though I could admittedly be better with my money.\n\nSo here\u2019s my plan. Go to school full time and apply for assistance. Get a part time job. \n\nRight now my share of rent is $650/month and I pay about $125/month for utilities. Hopefully food stamps can help with food. I would put my current loans (about 26k) in forbearance. I would apply for free healthcare. I really hate to do it this way, but I don\u2019t see any other way. \n\nQuestions. Had anyone else been through this? Anything I should know? Will my fianc\u00e9\u2019s salary (55k) affect my eligibility? If so, how do I get around that?

        "original": "Hello all, \n\nIm a 23yo male with a decent job (61k with good benefits) and no debt (paid off student loans within one year of graduating from big state school). \n\nMy plan for this year was to save as much as I can and (especially if a recession occurs) dump a bunch of my savings (roughly $18-20k) into various investment vehicles.\n\nI have a solid emergency fund saved up, and my employer offers a Roth 457(a) with employer contributions matching up to $1k per year. I was also planning on opening up a Roth IRA through Vanguard with a basic three-fund portfolio scheme (Stock/bond/international markets). \n\nHowever, I\u2019m extremely bored with the work Im doing and have been wanting to return to school to pursue a mathematics degree. I really love math (not my degree). I studied it a bunch as an undergrad, and wish I could study it some more and pursue a profession more in line with it like quant finance, economics, or data science (I realize some of these roles would entail graduate school). \n\nNow here\u2019s the thing. My employer will pay for my tuition (between 50% and 75% depending on how many years employed), but I would have to maintain my employment. This idea seems attractive at first, but it also means I would have reduce my course load to 1-2 classes per quarter/semester. Obtaining a second undergrad degree at this pace would take four years. A graduate degree would be a little faster, but without a math undergrad, the chances of entering a grad program seem more remote. \n\nIf I left this job, I could get the undergrad degree done in roughly a year, but I would be unemployed and end up taking on more debt (roughly $30-40k) with no guarantee of employment (though Im confident I could network and find some). Couple this with the lack of potential income during this period. \n\nAnother option is taking a handful of upper level math classes while working and convincing a graduate program that Im capable of handling graduate level work. I know some programs are willing to help students catch up and with an MS in stats or something similar, I can\u2019t imagine employment would be too difficult, especially given the experience I already have (analyst type role).  \n\nIm trying to be as financially pragmatic as I can about returning to a school. But I also don\u2019t want to spend four years taking one math class at a time just for another Ba/Bs. \n\nI wanted to get some advice from older and more experienced professionals. Is there any point at which it\u2019s worth sacrificing financial stability for credentials? If for example an MS in stats nets you a six-figure salary right out the door, would no income for a few years and 40k+ in debt be worth it in the long run?\n\nAll thoughts and feedback are appreciated.",

        "original": "In 2019, I think I did great financially. From avoiding my bank account to checking it on the daily, making a budget, and sticking to it. Learned how to really start saving and to follow my budget properly in the last few months of 2019. I live in NYC which is notoriously expensive and I live with my husband. He isn't working right now because he is in the process of getting his visa, but I am grateful to be in a position where I can financially support the both of us. Our goal right now is to be able to pay off student loans, then save for a down payment on a house. \n\nMy background: I'm 31, have a student loan ($120,000), no car, and signed a lease for a 1 br apartment. I have $27,000 in savings, $11,000 in investments, $78,000 in 401K. I'm hoping to put a lot more in my investment account (instead of savings) this year. I also love to cook and bake, so the grocery budget is pretty high. I have been trying to be better about it. \n\n**Goals:** \n\n1. Student Loans: My plan for paying off the student loans is to use 100% of my annual bonuses, as well as $25,000 saved up in the year of 2020. This way, I would be able to pay it off with the bonus in 2021. \n2. Phone Payment: Chose to do the instalment plans on 2 new phones and an Apple Watch. Plan to pay the balances off by the end of this month using my miscellaneous \"bills\" money. This would reduce my phone bill from $297 to $216.\n3. 401K: Planning to use the misc. bills to put my contribution in the middle of the year (this isn't employer-matched unfortunately).\n\nBelow is my take-home pay which takes into account taxes and social security.\n\nMonthly Pay: $15,250\n\n* Investments: $3,050\n* Total Bills: $5,294\n   * Rent - 4,150\n   * Internet -68\n   * Phone - 297\n   * Citibike - 16.27 x 2\n   * Netflix - 14\n   * Taxes - 300\n   * Storage Unit - 180\n   * Classpass - 53\n   * Con Ed - varies, but I put aside around 200\n* Miscellaneous Bills (big things that I am saving up for, otherwise known as sinking funds): $3,583\n* Groceries: $820\n* Doctors: $70\n* Miscellaneous (necessities, unexpected expenses): $1,200\n* Shopping (non-necessities): $300\n\nWhat I have leftover is about $716 monthly. Once my lease ends at the end of April, I am moving to Jersey so that we can save more on rent (thank god) + living expenses + getting rid of the storage unit is hopefully going to make a difference. I have been trying to find ways that I could save more money, eliminating anything that may not be useful. It's hard living in a city where everything is so expensive and the people around you are used to it. I need some advice from a different lens. Does this budget seem reasonable?",

        "original": "Hi so just a forewarning this post is rather lengthy.\n\nI'm really looking for some advice and perspective outside of not only my own but my family and friends because I need someone to look at it from the numbers and not just what they think is best for me.\n\nI'm a 25 year old male who currently is on long-term SSD where I get 740ish bucks a month from the government because I have nerve damage in my leg and I also undergo chemotherapy every 28 days for 5 days in that week.\n\nI recently completed my bachelor's degree online and received a job offer from a company that is willing to work around my treatment schedule, it's $14 an hour base but the potential to bonus and earn commission is immense. If I do my job just to the average in my department I could make an extra $512 on certain weeks every month plus the hourly pay. I currently work some hours a week at another job that I had throughout college and before I was diagnosed that paid me $12 an hour but there's no real growth there and if I want to maintain my disability benefits long term I would probably have to work very little there or stop completely so that I don't disqualify myself. The problem is the week I have to go to treatment is essentially a wash at the new job, I may make 15-20 hours and it costs me about $200 extra a month to travel to the new job as opposed to my old one and that week I won't be able to bonus, the next week will be difficult to bonus as well so I'd really only have like a 2 week window to bonus.\n\nI want to work and contribute to society, I'm somewhat of an anomaly and my case is unique. My disease is essentially a chronic illness and I don't want to just sit and collect disability because it's very unfulfilling and plus it's really not plausible to grow or move on in life by just getting disability. I can get benefits through the new job at some point as well but maintaining my Medicare Benefits for now is also a big deal because it's literally life and death for me so that is another $140 a month I would pay because right now it's taken out of my benefits before I get them so now that cost would be passed over to my actual available income.\n\nMy girlfriend luckily makes a decent wage and together we can afford our living expenses but we routinely operate like we have no money because we don't want to overspend and drain our reserves because every dollar counts.\n\nFor some added perspective our rent is about $1140\nOur gas was like $70 this month\nOur electric was $120\nOur food bill is usually around $65-$80 at the grocery a week depending on the week.\nShe works about 7 minutes from home so her gas bill is very minimal but mine is going to be about $30 a week plus a $25 a week charge for tolls if i take the job. \n\nMy parents still pay for my car insurance which helps out because of how little I make but I'd like to come off of that because like I said, want to contribute and all.\n\nBased off of the current information, if I were to take this job am I putting myself in a worse spot?\n\nThanks in Advance guys,\n\nP.S.\n\nIf you need any more information to help me out I'll gladly provide, just didn't want to overstuff the post more than I already did.",

At this point I\u2019m flipping out and I don\u2019t know what to do, my mom looks at it through her account (I\u2019m 17 and my checking account is a student account with my mom having co-signed it) and sure enough it says \u201cAvailable balance -$288\u201d so she quickly takes 300 from my savings and moves it into my account just to put me in the green.

She said she would talk to the branch manager about what they can do and will call me Monday.\n\nEDIT3: At this point no one is probably reading this thread, but the main branch called my mom and said the reason it was on hold was because I had accidentally deposited the same check twice. Well the mom just sent me pictures of the checks I mobile deposited (it sent her a copy of the pictures) and what do you see but checks 453 and 454.

So far I have 4K set aside.\n\nFurthermore, I have earned about 10k by working. Now that I have quite a budget, I want to start looking at opportunities to create a passive stream of income. One of the options I have is that I can try to get a mortgage when I have a 20k deposit in half a year from now, and rent out all but one of the rooms (where I'd be living). In the area I live in, this would mean that the house pays for itself because the rent would cover the amount needed to pay-off the debt. However, I dont have a permanent job. I work on a freelance basis (and am a student), and therefore it is unlikely that the bank would give me a mortgage (150k mortage would be enough to purchase a house with 4 rooms that I could rent out).\n\nThats why I have come here. I need to find a way to generate a passive income. I figured a website would be cool, but I have no idea what itd be about and honestly it seems a bit far-fetched. Im sure that the whole e-commerce market is satured and im too late to join in on that, same as cryptos. What would be the best way to put my money to use?

Just wondering if its a viable idea, given that I'm also a full time student. I am not scared of taking a risk, as long as its a risk I can calculate and put into perspective. It seems that 15K-20K is too little an amount to use for interest? I have seen online peer-to-peer loans going up to 5% interest a year, but it seems risky and the pay-off seems too little.

        "original": "So I'm applying for disability retirement from a federal job and my wife and I are having trouble with this decision. It's a good problem, the benefits are amazing, but there are a lot of variables. The federal retirement includes post-death insurance benefits for the family BUT I'm also a disabled veteran with VA healthcare (myself, family below certain income) and Tricare (whole family after death). \n\nAs a rough estimate, the cost/benefit for the 10% deduction/50% survivors pension option would be about $300 a month for about $1800 a month in survivor benefits. Also, if we ever had trouble with Tricare getting the healthcare we want need, we could re-enroll in Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) and only pay the co-insurance as though I was still working as a federal employee. IF we did this, and I died, my wife could continue the FEHB *only* if we have a survivors benefit. So no survivor benefit, no FEHB but retain access to Tricare and possibly VA. \n\nThe 10%/50% option seems expensive but I think that part of it is the continuation of FEHB benefits. If the \"backup\" health insurance options are something we should factor, the 5%/25% (about $150/$900) option might make more sense for the pension AND to keep our toe in the door on another health insurance option for my wife if I passed away. \n\nAnother big factor, I'm pretty young (almost 35) and I have a multitude of health issues but nothing life threatening (fibromyalgia, inflammatory arthritis, anxiety, sleep apnea, and a bunch of other little things). So we could potentially be paying these premiums for a very long time. \n\nMy wife is sort of leaning on me for the research so I would appreciate any feedback and advice. Right now, I think I'm leaning toward the 5%/25% option because Tricare is an amazing benefit but I have heard some horror stories in the past with getting some specialty care when you are older. It's not an easy equation in my opinion but this sort of hedges our bets. \n\nAlso, the election of survivor benefits for Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) is permanent as far as I know.",

I had $38k in cash, $20k in brokerage acc made up of mutual funds, \\~$9-10k in 401k (Not fully vested), $0 in Roth IRA. I also had a car worth $27-28k and owed $22k borrowed at 3.24% for 60 months. I wanted to work more towards financial independence and possibly save for home. The advice was to grow 401K and IRA and put my cash in a high yield savings account.\n\nThe advice really helped me out. I was so overwhelmed with the concept of investing and the different vessels that are available. It gave me direction and goals for 2019.\n\n**What's changed?**\n\nI made $71200 in 2019, maxed out 401k, 401k is fully vested now, maxed out Roth IRA for 2018/2019, switched my brokerage account from managed mutual funds at wells fargo to VTSAX at vanguard. Owe $18k on a car that is worth $26-$28k. (The car is a older corvette, it's kind of at the bottom of it's depreciation curve)\n\nNow my net worth break down is:\n\n$35k ally high yield savings account.\n\n$3k in checking account.\n\n$22k+ in my vanguard brokerage account (100% VTSAX)\n\n$13k+ in my fidelity Roth IRA (100% FXAIX)\n\n$35k+ in my fidelity 401k (100% FXAIX) and fully vested!\n\nI don't like my job as much as I did when I first started. I work in the defense industry. Being locked in a box all day doing a job most people don't want to do is getting old. I believe my functional manager senses my frustration because I was told I was put in for a level 2 position. This would come at the end of Q1 2020 after my merit raise in Q1 2020 and should put me in the range of $79-$85k from what others have said. The possibility of a big raise helps but it doesn't change the fact I'm not passionate about my work.\n\nOwning a house isn't something I am wanting as much anymore. I think what I really wanted was a garage to put cars. Cars are a big part of my life and I felt like I couldn't collect cars if I don't have a place to put them.\n\n**What stayed the same?**\n\nI still help my parents financially and they'd like me to stay 2020. Obviously I benefit from the $400/month rent but, it does mean I'll probably have to stay at my job for another year. The defense industry easily offers the best benefits and pay for my area.\n\n**My question:**\n\nDo I just continue with last years advice? Max Roth IRA/401K and put the rest in my ally account? If not, what changes should I make? Currently I am at 30-40% cash and 60-70% U.S equities. Also, any advice related to what I've talked about in this post is also welcomed.\n\nThank you!",

We're also planning on trying to buy a house in the next year or so and both of us likely won't have two years at our then-current employers. How big a deal is it if the job changes are voluntary, upward, and have better pay? We're not going to put our careers on hold to get a slightly better mortgage rate, but is this is even a real factor anymore? \n\nMy wife and I both have graduate degrees, ~800 credit scores, and a combined income around $170,000. No kids and our only debt is a car loan at 1.9% with ~$13,000 left on it over a total 36 month term (a bit under $500/month). We'll probably have a ~15% down payment. Between our stats and the fact that we'll be looking at something at or below 3x our gross income, I would think we'd qualify for good-to-optimal rates. What are the chances that a lender doesn't like the frequent job hopping and penalizes us?",

        "original": "I will do my best to keep this as brief as possible, context is US based (lulz)...\n\nEarlier this year, I suffered a traumatic injury to one of my eyes. I am legally blind in it now (worse than 20/200). I\u2019ve had five surgeries since, and it\u2019s at least good for motion detection and color differentiation, with the possibility that sight will improve over the coming months. Of course, I now have a lot of medical debt ($120k+ after self pay discount- we have \u201cinsurance\u201d through my wife\u2019s employer, but it\u2019s covered almost nothing)- I\u2019ve applied for financial aid with the hospital as at no point during this time has my ophthalmologist lifted my work restrictions. I\u2019ve worked regardless because I\u2019ve had to, but only on things I am confident will not impede my eye healing.\n\nFor 13 years, my career has been in commercial HVAC. I have a high school diploma, but nothing beyond that. I have been in a foreman role for three years, directing crews consisting of 2-10 individuals. I would consider that time mostly successful, as with my first employer while being in that role I was given $6/hr worth of raises in a year and a half timespan+ a company vehicle, with an additional $2/hr increase once I went to a new employer (which I now consider a mistake), topping out at $26/hr, still with a company vehicle. I quit working for the last group on the grounds that I was asked to be complicit in sneaking in two employees who could not pass a drug screen/background check to complete work inside a building listed as being part of a foreign trade zone- I wasn\u2019t sure of the legal implications but I knew for a fact it was against the contractor\u2019s jobsite rules and damn sure against the building owner\u2019s rules, and coupled with the fact that two months previous I went from 48 hours a week to 6 hours a week with no notice... you get the picture. I had some savings during this time that I burned through once the work dried up. The increased income from these three years were mostly spent paying off debt incurred from a serious illness my wife went through several years previously. \n\nDuring the time with my last employer, a family member decided to open a business in the same trade. Once I left my last job, I started working for them, knowing that I would make less than market rate for my talent, if for no other reason than I THOUGHT I would have to put up with less drama, lies, and general bullshit. Prior to starting I explained that I would need 22.50 an hour to work with them plus gas allowance and I would drive my own vehicle, and I would be happy with that rate for the foreseeable future until enough revenue was being generated to justify higher pay scales. They told me that my number wasn\u2019t feasible at the moment but they would \u201cget me close\u201d. This is the second fuck up, because I assumed that \u201cclose\u201d wasn\u2019t $220 less a week than what I asked for- $17 an hour was barely enough to pay the bills and really wasn\u2019t worth it as I had taken on much more responsibility including educating myself on how to use desktop Quickbooks (ughhhhh) along with no fuel compensation, but I stuck it out and scrounged up enough side work to make it happen. About two months later, I got hurt, which made the whole thing moot. So here\u2019s the skinny:\n\nAfter taxes+a garnishment with slow pay applied, my wife brings home $1200/mo. We have cut everything off that isn\u2019t a necessity except for our internet, which is $70/mo. Rent is stable AND cheap at $550/mo- I have a good relationship with our landlord as we have paid the rent early since we moved in 4 1/2 years ago, and I maintain the property for him (which he pays me for)- but he is elderly, and I have no doubt once the man passes his children will sell it. My wife has a car payment at $260/mo. I own my truck free and clear. Groceries- $550/mo. Utilities are $300/mo. Auto insurance- $170. Cell phones- $100. We had to get new furniture+ washer/dryer combo on credit right after the bottom dropped out on my hours at my last employer(our couch broke and then our washer took a shit a week later...after I put $300 and a year into it to limp it along), that\u2019s $260/mo. Add in misc expenses like the various eye drops I\u2019ve needed (again, not covered under insurance), gas, oil changes, etc and our bills are right at $2600/mo. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do. I anticipate at my next post op visit my eye doc will clear me for return to full duty. My trade involves a lot of work that requires good depth perception- I\u2019m figuring out the little tricks to regain some semblance of it and it IS getting easier, but I\u2019m still learning. We still have debt left over from my wife\u2019s illness to contend with- I estimate our current debt at $210k if the hospital does not \u201cwrite off\u201d what I owe them, and $90k if they do (lifeflight, original admitting hospital, a postpaid phone bill I defaulted on 3 months ago plus all our old debt from the last medical fiasco).\n\nI\u2019m probably going to file bankruptcy, but I don\u2019t know how to continue afterward. SO many doors have been opened as have been shut to me this year. I\u2019ve done a lot of different kinds of work for folks when able- mostly home improvement type stuff, although I\u2019m also a capable auto mechanic- and I really enjoy the only concern of the job being the satisfaction of everyday folks, and not meeting arbitrary metrics or efficiency goals that some desk jockey came up with. Things are NOT going well for the family member with their business- last I heard, the contractor was considering kicking them off the job if they didn\u2019t get their shit together, so I don\u2019t know if I can rely on that as a revenue stream, even if my compensation is not what was agreed on.\n\nWe have no retirement, no savings, no bonds, and no wealthy family members willing to invest in our future. I have friends who believe in me and advertise for me every chance they get, I personally own the tools required to do the work, a truck to transport them in, and a guy who says he wants to go the distance with me.\n\nI know this is a lot to take in. Is bankruptcy the right (only) move? More importantly- is the right financial move to suck it up and go back to work for an employer full time in my trade while continuing to learn how to work with one eye, or since I\u2019m already back at square one (again) should I try to do my own thing? I think I can make the money happen, at least to pay the bills- but it costs money to make money, and I don\u2019t think it wise to open a business before my bankruptcy is complete.

        "title": "College student leaving family business",
        "original": "Hey all, I'm an out-of-state college student who needs to cut financial and business ties with my dad, who has previously paid for my college and living expenses. I need some advice about how to extract myself from the family real estate business and how to live until I can earn enough.  \n\n\nAbout 4 years ago, as a high schooler, I joined our real estate business. This entailed my father putting some properties and cash in my name. It was meant to be an investment strategy to help me pay for college, build credit, and eventually be my inheritance. However, I didn't have direct access to this money and was told it had \"strings attached.\" Basically, I could use it for approved expenses as long as I was in good favor with my parents. I'm not sure what my legal options are regarding this money, but I morally feel like it's not mine, since I only did minor things to help the business.  \n\n\nFor years, my dad has used this financial support as a leverage device for me to be an \"obedient son,\" even when that entailed issues outside the scope of the business, such as what classes I was taking and where I was planning to work. This has put an enormous emotional strain on me, so a few months ago, I emailed them that I wanted to end my involvement in the business. I told them that they could choose to either support me unconditionally or keep their money. They took this as disrespect. Over the holidays when I was visiting them, things came to a head when my dad blew up at me over something small and kicked me out of the house, telling me to leave my credit card behind. I have decided to interpret this as them choosing to not support my college expenses any longer.  \n\n\nThere are several relevant assets available to me. There are the \"strings-attached\" business assets under my name described above, which I will need to transfer to my dad. There is money given to my parents by my grandfather for my college tuition, which I hope they will give me but which I can't count on. Additionally, I have a personal account with about $12k I saved up. I also have an investment account with another $12k that my parents do not have access to, but it might be difficult to withdraw. So in total, I have $24k owned, maybe more if my family cooperates concerning my grandfather's money. Thankfully, this is enough for me to afford my tuition (which is $17k due this week) and should be enough to cover housing and living expenses for the rest of the semester, if I cut down on costs. Additionally, I have an internship lined up for the summer that includes housing, which is a load off my mind.  \n\n\nI have questions in three areas: housing, the family business, and FAFSA.  \n\n\n1. The $7k I will have after I pay for tuition is enough to cover my housing and living expenses if I am no longer living in my current expensive apartment. My girlfriend has offered to let me stay with her for the rest of the school year, but her housing situation is such that I could not be a legal resident there. I am considering just unofficially living there for the next few months, however, during this time I would be technically homeless. What are the implications of being legally homeless for a period of time? Would this affect things like credit, etc.?  \n\n\n2. My involvement in the family business is confusing, and I don't know everything that has been done in my name or what I own. Technically, I am a real estate agent, and there are some properties in my name. I anticipate that disentangling myself will be a difficult process, especially if my dad is unwilling to fully cooperate with me. Since my dad up until this point has been involving me in the business for our mutual benefit, I believe that he hasn't already abused the financial trust I've placed in him in the past and I doubt he would act out of anger. However, I don't want to be na\u00efve or ignorant of how my dad could potentially screw me or my credit over in some way now that we are on bad terms, and I don't want to miss something important as I am leaving. For what it's worth, I just want to get out as quickly and painlessly as possible, and I don't want to cause further ill will by trying to take any of the business assets that are in my name. Given all this information, do I need a lawyer, and if so, what kind? If I do need a lawyer, how much should I expect to pay? I am worried that a lawyer would threaten my budget for the rest of the year. Another issue for me is taxes: my dad has been doing my taxes through his accountant for several years due to how complicated my finances are. Now that I am trying to become independent, I have no clue where to begin reporting that.  \n\n\n3. Right now, it's FAFSA season for the 2020-2021 school year. I have never filled out FAFSA before due to my family being well-off and my financial assets being so complex. Now that I am going to be independent, I will need student loans for tuition and housing next year. However, I know FAFSA is normally based on the situation of the student from two years before. Does anyone have any advice or experience about how to fill out FAFSA with a complicated, recently changed situation like mine?",

But I don't foresee any emergencies coming to my life (I realized this is dumb as you can't really foresee emergencies...). \n\nThe truth is I am having major FOMO about not investing and just feel like I'm losing money by the second my money sits in my bank account.

I have no debt, own my truck, have very good savings, and am single with no kids (I have a pug). In a year or two, I'll have the option to purchase the farmhouse that I grew up in for a significant discount off market value. I'm currently living in a house provided for free by a relative for virtually as long as I want, however it is in pretty rough shape.\n\nI have a lease agreement with my relative ($0/mo, but mostly for legal protection between us), and I'm allowed to renovate as I see fit or not at all. Potentially could buy it later, but that seems unlikely due to zoning issues. Anyway, at approximately 850sqft, it needs roughly $40,000 in renovations to be in \"normal\" condition - foundation repairs, electrical work, insulating/finishing a couple rooms, HVAC system installation, and a new roof. It has a leaky tin roof, window A/C units, two unfinished rooms, a sag in the long support beam, a settled/shifted corner of the foundation, and a rigged up furnace-to-heat-pump sort of heating system that is....effective, yet - well, it gets the job done. It is livable as-is for a bachelor (it's an old 1930 farmhouse type), but at minimum I think to stay here I'd need to spend $3,000-6,000 to make it adequate for my needs - patch the roof, update electrical & finish the two rooms for the space.\n\nI'm thinking that based on local rent costs being approximately $600/mo or $7200/year, then it's still worth it to fix it up as long as I stay under that amount. If I were to spend $7k, then live in it comfortably for 2 years; that would be very cheap \"rent\". However, due to certain family matters, I may not be interested in buying the old family farmhouse in a year or two, therefore am also considering buying a small house in the area for $75-120,000. The difficulty with that being that despite savings, I'm unemployed which makes acquiring a home loan difficult because most lenders don't consider the GI Bill living stipend (roughly $1500/mo tax-free during classes) a source of income. I could work part-time probably to secure a loan, but I have zero desire or real need to work while going to school using the GI bill benefits - a small home loan monthly payment would be perfectly feasible though.\n\nI trust my relative regarding this living arrangement, but still do not like being under someone's thumb so to speak. The opportunity to purchase the old family farmhouse is good, but there are variables at play that may delay it becoming available to me. I don't necessarily have to remain in this area either. These are weighted issues that I'll have to ponder, but at least for the strictly financial aspects I suppose I'm looking for second opinions.

        "original": "So some quick background: I (32M) just started a new position with a bank, and they offer an ESPP, which I have never been offered before. This is also a new career path for me, which came with a voluntary significant pay cut, so I'm kind of in new territory all around. I am making ~$50k. I will be contributing at least 6% to 401k to get my full company match, but will likely bump to 10% ultimately. The ESPP matches contributions at 15%. This is a top 20 bank.\n\nMy initial thoughts are to do a little (2%-5%) in the ESPP, and sell at year end if it's at or above my average, to lock in 15% gains minus gains tax. If the stock is below my average, I can keep buying in and lowering average. Then, I can use the money to fund other accounts (i.e. IRA, savings). \n\nMy questions/concerns: If I'm not able to fully fund 401k, should I even consider the ESPP, or put all I can in to 401k?

I bought the place for $99,000 with little money down. The mortgage payment each month is $788.91 and to make matters worse that includes a HOA of $280.41 a month, I believe at the moment my loan is about $96,000\n\nAnd here\u2019s my big problem. I had to move back home (in New York) after a mental health emergency where I was in treatment for a good few months. My ex was nice enough to rent the condo from me this year but has since decided to hate me and tell me I\u2019m \u201con my own\u201d. Unfortunately we broke up due to him being controlling, and unfaithful but that means nothing when it comes to finances and what is legal. That condo is mine and I am stuck having no idea what to do. \n\nI now live in New York because going back to that state would most likely kill me. I\u2019ve taken moves to try to get it sold. It\u2019s currently on the market and I\u2019m working with a realtor. And unfortunately it only has been for about three weeks because previously my ex told me he would rent another year and then changed his mind just last month. I have a few showings a week but hope it will pick up now that the holidays are over. My biggest problem is I have no way to pay once February 1st comes along. I live in another state, I pay rent for an apartment here, and have picked up my life and started over with a great job and supportive family and friends. I can\u2019t go back to CT. \n\nIf I can\u2019t sell this house by the end of the month I\u2019m not sure what my options are and this is where I\u2019m looking for advice. I know the possibility of foreclosure and filing for bankruptcy are very high. I want to know just how bad that will effect my life. Are there any other options? (aside from moving back to CT which isn\u2019t possible) People have told me to rent it out but being a landlord from another state is almost impossible as well. It was different when I knew my ex and knew he wouldn\u2019t destroy the place. Can I even rent while it\u2019s on the market? \n\nI\u2019m afraid, terrified actually. A lot of days I feel like there is no other way out then just ending it all. My mental health has suffered drastically and I feel like I\u2019m right back to where I was this time last year. Its Sunday and I\u2019m still in bed and I have no plans of getting up because I can\u2019t even will myself to do it. I feel entirely lost and don\u2019t know how to deal with any of this\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this was a lot but I wanted to provide background. I really hope someone can shed some light or give me some much needed advice \n\nThank you",

        "original": "Hi everyone, looking for some insight/advice on buying a bigger house and keeping our current one to use as a rental.\n\nOur situation: My wife and I are both 30, just had a baby and plan to have another in a year or two, I am also a veteran and currently using a VA loan for our current house and plan to use it for the second. Below is current income/expenses.\n\nIncome: Just over 8k/month after taxes/deductions(wife works part time, will go up to 10k when she goes back to full time, not 100% sure when that is, but if money got tight she go back to full time, right now just more time with baby.\n\nCurrent Mortgage: 1600/month with insurance and taxes, currently paying 2k a month\nCar Payment: 410/month, paying 500 a month\n\nRoth IRA's - 1000/month, maxing out for each of us\n529 - 100/month\n401k - My wife puts in the max her employer matches, 5%\nPension - I have a pension through work which will likely be about $60k a year once I retire in 25-30 years.\n\nBills - $727/month, this includes, auto, umbrella policy, life insurance, utilities, and our streaming services.\nCC - 1500/month on our credit card - this includes groceries and gas, but also quality of life purchases which we can cut down if needed. Could likely push this down to about 1000/month if we had to. We pay our CC's in full every 2 weeks.\n\nEach month we normally throw about 2500 (give er take on our CC spending) into our savings that we plan on using as a down payment on our next house, currently have 50k saved up. 20k of that is our 6 month emergency fund.\n\nThe house we are in now is too small for a family and we are ready to get our dream/forever home. We are very interested in being landlords and renting out our current residence. We can easily get 1700/month, would likely ask for 1800-1900 at first depending on what else is on the market.\n\nTalking with my lender, he says buying a 650k house will give us an estimated payment of 3400 with insurance and taxes. If we are breaking even on our first house, we will barely be scraping by if we continue to max out our roths. Is it worth it if we are in our dream house with our perfect yard and perfect location? Both my wife and I have jobs that provide us with 2.5%-5% COLA raises each year and after we buy this house we don't foresee any future large debt obligations so it seems like it might be okay to be tight for a year or two until we are saving a couple grand each month after maxing out our roths. Or we could take a year or two off from contributing to our roths to alleviate some pressure?\n\nOther things worth noting, I work for the city utility company and my wife is a nurse, we are in the greater Seattle area which is why the prices are fairly high and since I work in Seattle this dream home cuts my commute in half, currently 3-4 hours of transit each day. We feel our jobs are fairly full proof since I can't imagine people not wanting healthcare or electricity and we both are doing well at our jobs. But we still plan to have our emergency fund capable of paying for both houses for at least 3 months(6 ideally) before we throw any money towards the new house.\n\nIf things did go miserably we could always sell our first house and pocket the 60k in equity we have. We are not very interested in using that money for a down payment on the second house since it only reduces the monthly payment by about 300$ and our month to month would still be tight, it sounds like it would be better as a cushion/emergency fund.\n\nWe know this isn't going to happen today but hopefully this summer, but might end up waiting longer if we have to. Any insight is much appreciated!",

I'm hoping you'll all be able to help me understand the costs and benefits of these choices.\n\n**Facts**\n\nMy fiancee and I currently rent an apartment in a major city, and are engaged to be married this June.  I was recently offered and accepted a position as a professor in a rural location.  The job will start in August, and we've started looking at houses in the new location.  \n\nIn my current job, I make decent money and I will be making substantially more as a professor.  I'm also lucky to have saved a decent amount of money  for a down payment, with no debt.  Meanwhile, my fiancee is in grad school to become a public school teacher.  She  works full time, has a small amount of savings, and about $60k in student loan debt.  She's in the process of applying for jobs in the rural location where we'll be moving in August.\n\nI spoke to a mortgage lender, who told me that it was up to us whether to include my fiancee on the loan application.  The lender didn't give me a ton of information about the pluses or minuses of that choice, saying it was a personal decision.  \n\n**Questions**\n\nThe disadvantages of including my fiancee seem clear: she doesn't have a lot of income and doesn't yet have a job lined up in the new location, but does have $60k debt, which can only hurt our application.  But what are the advantages?    I understand that I'll be solely on the hook for the loan if she's not included, but does that change once we get married?   I know we'll have to pay her student loans in addition to the mortgage, but what else should we be considering when we decide whether to include her on the application?\n\nI have similar questions about the deed.  Obviously, listing her on the deed would make her a co-owner.  But if we don't list her before we get married, will she automatically get a property right once we tie the knot?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice and help!",

At the moment, she and I make a combined ~100k a year on a nurse's wage and teacher's salary respectively. We have ~10k in savings, and she has about 8k between her 401k and her roth IRA. I have ~75k in student debt, and she has $150k. I've been trying to help us do some long-term financial planning for us both, and I was hoping to get some advice here.\n\nAt the moment, our monthly budget breakdown looks something like this:\n\n**Income**: ~5700, plus or minus depending on whether she works overtime or I cover extra classes during my planning periods. \n\n**Expenses**\n\nCredit Card Minimum Payments: 140 (on about $4500 of debt)\n\nCar Payments: ~570 (on about $11,000 and $~26,000 respectfully)\n\nStudent Loans: ~1650\n\nRent: 755\n\nInternet: 65\n\nElectric: 200\n\nPhone/Car Insurance/Renter's Insurance: 370\n\nGas: ~275\n\nFood: ~400\n\nSummer School Savings Fund (to continue paying bills in the event that I am unable to secure a position in a summer school this year): ~450\n\n**Total: ~5,000**\n\nWith the understanding that money towards a mortgage builds equity and money towards rent is, well, more or less wasted, I was wondering whether or not we could afford a home -- or if it would be wise to. In terms of immediate goals for money, I understand that the most efficient place to put funds would probably be:\n\n* Make contributions up to the matching limit for any 401k / 403bs at our current job (no matching at the moment)\n\n* Get married sometime in the next 1-2 years so we can start filing taxes jointly\n\n* Save 3-6 months of expenses for an emergency fund (~15-30k)\n\n* Pay off the credit cards\n\n* Pay off the student loans\n\n* Pay off the cars if they have a balance at this point\n\n* Put ~500/ea or as close to it a month per person into our Roth IRAs\n\n* Pay off the remainder of whatever mortgage we presumably have at this point\n\n* Put as much into 401ks/403bs as possible\n\nAs a teacher, I have a state pension that, by the time I eventually retire at my anticipated age of 63, should cover 75% of the average of my 5 highest years of employment, so the IRA that I plan to start contributing to is moreso to diversify my retirement income and, perhaps, to help if I decide to retire earlier at reduced benefits. My fiancee plans to soon try to get a job with the state as an RN, so she may soon be in a similar situation soon, hopefully. I was wondering if this timeline looks appropriate and responsible, where in this timeline we would be most responsible for putting \"take out a mortgage,\" and whether or not it would be completely irresponsible for us to look at mortgages right now. \n\nOur lease is up in May and we are eager to start building equity with a starter home for 5 or more years, although I know that for the first few years the payments will primarily cover interest instead of principle. We also don't have much for a downpayment, although I heard that with an FHA loan you can avoid needing the traditional 20%, although I'm still not quite sure out PMI works, or what sort of programs there are for first-time home-buyers. We are still pretty new to the process, so any advice would be appreciated! We are worried that our inexperience could leave us ill equipped to recognize that we are ready to buy a house and delay our progress, and that if we sign a second year for our current lease when it comes up in May, we will end up locked in for that whole year (or at least subject to the headaches that come with breaking a lease) when we could have moved more quickly on the process now.",

        "original": "I (22F) graduated college six months ago and had to move back home due to financial constraints. My father is an emotionally and verbally abusive alcoholic and we have an extremely volatile relationship (bordering physical abuse at times\\*).  After being away at University I really didn't want to return home and exhausted my network in search of another place to stay for the time being. I had no luck finding an alternative. \n\nOver the course of the past 8 months, I've landed a full-time job and managed to save roughly $7500 thanks to my mom helping me make student loan payments behind dad's back. I'm currently in therapy & took a job an hour away to make sure I'm out of the house most of the time. \n\nI'm located in the greater NYC area and make $17/hr.  I have roughly $86k in student loans and a degree in English & Media & Communications. The biggest reason I haven't left home yet are my loan payments - they're about $700/month. Mom is an angel and she's currently paying half. My family has money, but my dad was unwilling to let me go to university. I had $40k+ in scholarships - so please spare me the \"you shouldn't have gone to college\" speech. It got me a job in an industry I wouldn't have otherwise and showed me I can be safe and happy with people who love and validate me. \n\nBasically, my living situation is undoing all of the mental work I did when I was away from home and I'd like to leave in 3-4 months...I know I'll never be happy if I stay. \n\nDoes anyone else who has been in a similar position have any wisdom to share? How much money should I aim to save and what are my housing alternatives?  Looked at renting with friends, but it was and is not financially possible for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*He knowingly keeps his hands off us because we will get authorities involved. My other family members are unwilling to leave. It's no longer physical and my brother & I are no longer minors, so there isn't much legal intervention available to us anymore.\n\n I Wish I had the courage to say something sooner.

        "original": "Hey all, so my parents are in a tough spot right now and I have no clue how to help them. First, my adult older brother is 38 and for 14 years had a fantastic job which he loved. Unfortunately, he\u2019s ran into some major health problems lately - first, he\u2019s had type 1 diabetes for a while now, and recently a tick bite gave him both Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. He also has a number of other ailments that I\u2019m not sure about, but basically he has a number of bacterial infections and is in bad shape. His body is not reacting well and at one point he had a severe reaction that left him in the intensive care unit for several days where he was apparently close to dying. \n\nEver since then, he\u2019s never been exactly right. His main problem is he is extremely lethargic \u2014 to the point he can\u2019t even get up in the morning on some days. Some days he\u2019s okay, others not. He\u2019s not consistent enough with his energy levels to be able to work. He\u2019s regularly seeing doctors \u2014 none of them have been able to resolve this. He took disability leave through his company since he was so weak. He was able to support himself through this, but unfortunately, they ran out and he has zero savings. So right how, he has absolutely no income whatsoever. He is trying to get better, but so far barely any progress has been made so I'm afraid the end is nowhere in sight.\n\nHe went sobbing to my parents and they felt very sorry for him and agreed to help. But I don\u2019t think they realized what they were getting into. They are both retired, and they are handling ALL of his expenses and bills - and I mean everything \u2014 including his mortgage, car payment, medical, groceries, insurance, phone, etc. literally anything and everything he has to pay for, they are covering. He has absolutely ZERO income coming in and nothing saved. But my parents are using more of their income on him than they are comfortable doing. It\u2019s probably no more than three or four days before he is asking for more.\n\nHe has cut all expenses other than the necessities. He has no cable, internet, no other subscriptions of any kind. He explained the situation to his mortgage and they agreed to let him defer some payments for now. And he does have a health plan through the Marketplace but it doesn\u2019t cover everything he is on. He says he can\u2019t file for unemployment because he is not actively seeking a job as his body cannot handle working right now. He did apply for some kind of help through social security that he is waiting to hear back on. And I believe he does plan to sell his house and temporarily stay with my parents until he recovers, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to help the matter much. Sure, the house expenses will be removed, but he still has a ton of other things, plus it could take many months to sell.\n\nThis has been going on for 4 months now and my parents came to me saying they are stressed and have no idea how to handle this other than to keep supporting him. They feel like they have no choice as he will either starve or won\u2019t have the money to get his medicine and he will get worse. I told them none of this is their fault and my brother shouldn't have left his job without having any savings, but then again he had a major medical emergency that nearly killed him and he is still trying to recover from. So maybe I am being harsh. It just kills me to see my parents so stressed for something they had zero involvement with and that isn\u2019t their fault whatsoever. It\u2019s to the point that even seeing a text or a missed phone call from him gives them huge anxiety over what he will need next and how that will impact their situation. Im just hoping there is a better way to handle what is going on.",

The thing is I earn very low for the town I live in. Before taxes, 43,500 and I work in the non-profit sector, with a daughter, as a single mom. The thing is this year I opened my first retirement account. My employer offers 403b plans as a non-profit. I chose a Roth because I am in a low-tax bracket for now. I invest $250 monthly on that account. My employer does not match anything. But I have been reading about the benefits of a Roth IRA. I have different questions regarding this:\n\n1. Should I open a Roth IRA too and contribute to both accounts?\n2. Should I stop contributing to the Roth 403b and just contribute to a Roth IRA for now?\n3. How does converting my Roth 403b to a Roth IRA work after I leave my job work? Is it a seperate account? And if I have opened an Roth IRA and were contributing to both like the scenario in question 1, when I leave my job would I have two Roth IRA's after conversion or can I put the Roth 403b in the Roth IRA that I opened?\n\nThanks in advance! \n\nAbout my finances: I basically live paycheck to paychek, but I always have 10-15% designated to savings and investments, not counting my retirement account. So far, since I started investing late in the game I have $2500 in a robo-adviser, $1600 as an emergency fund in a HYSavings account and $50 in another HYSavings account for Vacations. I usally have a spare $1000 in my checking account just in case. I am studying to get my license and than apply for a higher paying job. Hopefully by the end of 2020 I will earn more to contribute more in my retirement/investing accounts. I am also working on a writing plan to generate passive income as an author.

I do have LTD insurance that I rolled over from a previous job. It is one of the best policies I've seen in terms of scope and cost, and pays out at something like $3k/month. Still, there are a bunch of caveats about qualifying.\n\nI'm 30, no kids, and imagine I'll always work part-time until we can't work anymore, though of course that could change. When I'm not able to work anymore, I plan to retire abroad where I have family and cost of living even with a home healthcare worker would be no more than $20k/year.\n\nAlso... is it time I just see a financial advisor?",

(again bless her heart)\n\nGet to the point!\n\nI have no savings! (literally 25$ in a jar under my bed) I have a small student loan payment, failed school. Oof, with some car mechanics loan on my previous car (R.I.P.) Under my fathers credit card, which I need to pay off soon or all the interest that they are not making me pay now, will be added on later. I am currently working 40 hours a week, picking up over time if I can. I make 12$ an hour ($9.12 after tax)\n\nExpenses:\n\n1. Food(for myself): \\~$300\n2. Rent+Util: $270\n3. (planned)Savings: \\~$250\n4. Gas: $200\n5. Fun: \\~$100 (I have tried living without this expense.. its almost impossible)\n6. Debts/Loans: $100\n7. Laundry(for both of us): $50\n8. Supplies (spices, toiletry..etc) $50\n9. Phone/Insurance (Dads exps.)$50\n\n**Total: $1,370**\n\nI need to save money for a new car before anything else because the one i am getting will not last me forever.\n\nBUT I am also worried that I don't have money encase of emergencies, so I am struggling with figuring out my priorities.\n\nIf anyone out there can evaluate and give some feedback it would be a great help.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.

I've been doing a lot of reading, have created a household budget, and I'm trying to make a plan for 2020.\nI'm interested to hear what your next steps would be if this were your financial situation:\n\n- Married couple, 33 and 35, after tax income for this year will be at least $67000 (44000) after tax and Kiwisaver. That's around $2600 (1700) every 2 weeks. We will have around $400 (260) extra every 2 weeks by the end of the year but I haven't budgeted that in yet because of Novopay's unreliability when it comes to pay increases.\n- We have 2 children, 1 and 4 years old. I stay at home and we don't have set plans for me to return to work.\n- We pay $50 (33) a week to my in laws for our car\n- We put any purchases we can on our credit card and always pay off the full amount\n- Our mortgage is currently $181,590 (120000) at 4.96% p.a. We pay $551 (360) fortnightly. We refix in November. Home is currently worth $450000-500000 (315000)\n- We have $60,000 (40000)overdraft available (revolving credit from mortgage that we paid off before kids. I'm leaning towards getting rid of it, it's been sitting there for 4 years and it incurs fees account fees)\n- I still have student loans, but seeing as I'm not working they're just sitting there. I don't even know how much... around $15000-$20000... (11000) [For the non New Zealanders - we don't pay interest on student loans.]\n- My husband is contributing to Kiwisaver, 3%, and he has no student loans. His balance is $35000 (23000) with ANZ and mine is $15000 (10000) with ASB. Both high risk. [For the non New Zealanders - this is our retirement scheme. There are government contributions and employee contributions.]\n- We have life insurance, income protection insurance, car, home and contents.\n- We have $2200 (1400) in savings which is basically earmarked for insurance and rates payments, $400 (250) in the bank, and our next credit card payment is $1900 (1200) - so we're basically living pay check to pay check in a low cost of living area.\n\nI've got a couple of specific questions:\n\n1. We have income protection insurance. Once we have 3 months income saved up should we get rid of that? For context our parents would be able to support us in emergencies.\n2. What % would you be contributing to Kiwisaver if you were my husband? Just the minimum to get the government match? 3%? More?\n3. What would you do with the overdraft?\n\nI feel a bit stuck and frustrated at this point. Having done the budget I actually can't see anywhere that we can trim the fat. We don't dine out much, we barely travel, we don't really drink. I do have a better idea of where our money goes, but I don't think it's going to make much of a difference to how much we are able to save.\n\nI'd appreciate any feedback, advice, encouragement!

        "original": "Hey everyone! I'm a longtime lurker on this subreddit but this is my first time posting. \n\nMy wife, father-in-law, and I are desperate for help but have no idea where to even start. I've always seen great advice given here so I figured I'd give it a shot. If anyone has any suggestions on other subs that might be better for this situation, I'd love your suggestions there as well!\n\nHere's the situation...\n\nWe live in California (Bay Area) and my in-laws hold dual citizenship in the USA and Taiwan.\n\nAs the title suggests, my mother-in-law is severely mentally ill. She's physically and emotionally abusive to my father-in-law, and we've finally convinced him that they need to separate for his own well being. He has worked hard his entire life and had quite a successful career, but his wife has mostly squandered away all of their money and he's left without much cash savings, but they do own 2 houses. The houses are in both of their names.\n\nHe is an extremely admirable dude and, despite his wife abusing him for so long, really his main concern is finding a way to support her that prevents her from blowing all of their retirement money once he retires fully in a few years. We want to find a way where she can get a monthly allowance from a fund that she technically owns, but can't spend more than her monthly allowance. She would NEVER agree to something like this. \n\nThe other issue is that they don't have enough cash to retire without selling at least 1 of the homes. But, we can't convince her to sell the homes because she seems to think it's some plot against her. She really can't comprehend that the money to keep living her lavish lifestyle just isn't there anymore.\n\nSo my 2 questions are:\n\n1) What financial products, if any, could we set up to get his this type of allowance...knowing that it will be against her will.\n\n2) Is there any way to force the sale of one of their homes against her will? They won't be able to continue paying both mortgages, but we absolutely don't want this to end in foreclosure.\n\nTL;DR - Mother in law is crazy and abusive, squandered all of their retirement savings, and we need a way to support her while protecting her against herself. In order to do so, need to sell a house against her will. Help!",

        "original": "Hi reddit! This is my first time on this sub! I\u2019m a 24 year old grad student and I have a lot of money anxiety. I attribute it to my parents very different attitudes about money. I am seeking therapy to deal with this, but I do want to be practical in my finances and I want to see where others think I\u2019m at. (Meaning I don\u2019t want to just say \u201cI have money anxiety\u201d as an excuse to not be realistic/financially responsible). \n\nMy (wealthy) dad thinks somewhat poorly of finances, and my (not wealthy) mom thinks I\u2019m amazing with money and I can\u2019t seem to find consistent advice between them that doesn\u2019t contribute toward a toxic attitude about money. \n\nHere is my breakdown. \n\nFirst, I have no debt, and am looking into taking a $2000 loan for my last semester of grad school. Once that loan is paid off, and about 2 years later (to develop professionally) I will take out another loan to start my own practice. I am unsure of how much to take out, but my limit will be about $5000. \n\nI only work part time at the university, and I make $780 a month. My partner is working full time and is in school finishing up his bachelors. He makes about $2000 a month post tax and post all his personal bills (car insurance, phone bill etc.) but pre living expenses. My grandparents also give us $800 a month to contribute to our living expenses. This brings our total income to $3580 post tax. \n\nMy partner and I budget about $1800 a month for ALL living expenses, groceries, and other bills we have together, and there is always leftover money at the end of the month so we put it in a savings account that belongs to my partner and me. This will go toward a downpayment on a home in the future. \n\nOf that $1800, I contribute another $250 along with the $800 for the rest of the living expenses. My partner usually offers to contribute more so I don\u2019t have to contribute as much. But it\u2019s really important to me that I contribute what I can, but it\u2019s good to know that if something happened to my measly $250, my partner could help me out with my share. \n\n$1,580 (my total post tax income)\n- $1,050 for living expenses \n\n= $530 left over\n\nI don\u2019t have to pay for health insurance yet, and I don\u2019t have to pay for car insurance. I have a big family, so my share of the phone bill is very low. My dad pays for all of this for me and my siblings. \n\nI pay for the gas for my car, and copays for all doctors visits or prescriptions. If I were in a car accident I would pay my deductible. \n\nBesides the holidays, that money usually gets spent on lunch, or late night dinner, gas, and the occasional coffee or happy hour drink. I am trying to transition my wardrobe to have quality clothes that will last, so I right now am spending an additional $80 a month on clothes, but I feel like I\u2019m almost done rebuilding my wardrobe. Sometimes my partner and I will go in on something for the apartment, but that\u2019s mostly been his domaine. \n\nIn my savings account I have $3,600. I put about $60 in a month, but I recently had to take from out to pay my share of the bills (because I\u2019m a part time employee and the university is closed for 2 weeks, so I went 2 weeks without pay), and given the fact that it was Christmas. It was a lot for me to handle without going into my savings. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t have money for my bills, or Christmas presents but that was a lot for me to pay out of just my checking account. \n\nWhen I set up my checking account as a 14 year old my dad made it a joint account. He is still on the account and sees all my money. I put literally everything on a credit card that only I can see because I don\u2019t want him to see how much I spent on happy hour or whatever (I have never had a problem paying my credit card off on time though. I tend to pay it every 2 or 3 days). In the past he as got on me for being irresponsible with my money because he saw I spent money at a clothing store/coffee shop/whatever. Now I\u2019m 24 and he\u2019s still on there. And it feels humiliating. The reason I\u2019m including this because I feel very anxious of my checking account balance drops below $200 because he can see that I\u2019m low on money. I try to treat my bank account like if I have $250 in checking, I only have $50 in checking. I have yet to ask him to remove himself from my account because of how much he helps me. He offers to pay for all of these things, and he gets mad when I try to contribute to my car insurance, but then he tells me I should be better with money, and that I spend too much. \n\nI feel incredibly ashamed typing this out. Anytime money is brought up I feel sick to my stomach. So much so I\u2019m terrified of opening the Wells Fargo app to look at my balances. \n\nI\u2019d like to see myself double my contributions to my personal savings account but I have a really hard time transferring that money to an account for some reason. I am not contributing as much to my savings, even though I know deep down that that money is still mine, it just feels like I might need that money, and if I put it in a savings account it\u2019s gone. \n\nI guess I\u2019m wondering how I\u2019m actually doing. My dad would obviously look at this and think I was irresponsible (and who knows, maybe he\u2019s right). My mom would see this and think that I was Dave Ramsey\u2019s protege lol. \n\nAnd I am also asking for tips from anyone else that deals with bad attitudes around money, especially if you got them from your parents.\n\nTl;dr: my parents had weird and conflicting attitudes about money. While I\u2019m working to overcome that, I want to make sure that I\u2019ve got an least some what level head when it comes to my finances.",

We\u2019re recently married and he sold his car before enlisting in the military, so we only have my car to rely on, but she\u2019s really up there in miles and the amount of money we\u2019ve poured into her almost matches what she\u2019s worth so we figure it\u2019s about time to move on.

I\u2019d be doing most of the driving but we\u2019re going to be in a small town so I don\u2019t expect a commute more than 15 minutes. We had an issue when we went to a car dealership in our hometown because they had a really great lease deal going on (turns out it\u2019s known to be shady, even beyond the red flags we saw) and they pulled our credit. I have the necessary credit for a decent lease, but despite my husband having credit cards and good credit history, his came up as \u201cghost\u201d or no credit, which was weird. Is that normal? Or can I just tack that on to the list of shady things this dealership did (we obviously left but not prior to them pulling our credit). Would it be better for us to keep the car in my name once we go to a more reputable dealership? \nWe had also considered the idea of financing a newer used car. Would it be more worthwhile to go this route despite the monthly payments seeming to be higher? We live a very frugal lifestyle as it is, but not out of necessity. We just don\u2019t require much to be happy and after growing up watching family members make poor financial choices, we both fear ending up in situations like we\u2019ve seen our families in and higher monthly payments on something like this gives us the heebiejeebies .

        "original": "I have a friend that's nearly, if not above, $100K in debt. This includes student loans, car loan, credit cards, etc. I don't have the exact figure but that's the ballpark he gave me. Spoke to him some weeks ago and he said that he's not worried about debt and that things like that just \"Go away on their own\" (What??????). He recently put in for his two weeks notice at his $55K/yr job because he does not like it and wants to be 'free'. He has NOT secured another job yet and recently (month ago) turned down a $65K/yr job because it wasn't paying enough (he wants at least $75K w/ less than 1yr experience).\n\nHe is working with a mentor of his along with an insurance company but I don't believe he is being compensated for these things (they're like internships). Still, he has an extremely positive outlook on these things with no supporting reason.\n\nHere's the big problem. His car note is $500/mo. Car insurance is about \\~$200/mo. Rent is $1300/mo. These three fees alone nearly cover his entire month's pay after tax from his current, soon-to-be-gone job and we haven't even included other bills like utilities, phone bill, food, etc. His monthly income is/was about $3K after taxes.\n\nI believe he closed on his credit cards, WITH a balance, so his credit is in bad shape too, but he wants a house. I'm talking $2,500+/mo house with some roommates but I don't think he has anyone yet. Not sure how he'll get approved for that one with no income and poor credit history.\n\nA little more background. The way he thinks is irrational. He wants this significant pay increase, which is possible, but will not, under any circumstances, settle for less. Any decision he makes is ALWAYS justified by him so he basically never makes a bad decision in his eyes. His car was worth $4800 when he bought it, for $6800 with a...wait for it...29% APR. The documents had the total somewhere around $10K. His previous car was turned in with a $10K balance. Not traded, returned after he already paid about $15K on the car. Car was worth probably nothing when he turned it in since they sent it straight to the junkyard. So he has about $4500 worth of car with \\~$20K of payments. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that he has a repo on his credit too. He rented one of the most expensive condos in his complex. There's a list of stupid decisions he makes and justifies and just keeps putting himself in a deeper hole. It looks like he may be entering at mid-life crisis in his mid-20's.\n\nMy question to you is, how do I help/get through to someone like this? Someone who has historically only followed his own advice even when it makes no sense? Someone who I clash with on pretty much everything? Someone who disagrees with me on most advice I give him?\n\nMy dad had a saying, \"If you don't want to hear, you're gonna feel.\" I've been trying to talk to my friend for years about his poor decisions but it seems like he has to feel the impact of them on his own which is why I kind of don't care at this point. I have a friend that thinks that I'm the only one that can talk some sense into him, with numbers, so I've turned to Reddit to see if you all know something that I can do that I haven't done yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Friend makes poor financial decisions. Quitting his job with no backup and nearly $2500 in recurring monthly expenses. Stubborn/Hard-headed. Does not take advice easily, especially from me. No clue why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses. I've decided that I'm not helping him. He didn't ask for it anyway.",

        "original": "My dad experienced some health issues and was forced to retire. He worked as corrections officer and has a pension each month in the amount of around $3500. He is currently covered by health insurance through my mom, he will be 64 this July. \n\nThe pension is enough to pay his bills and their house is paid off. It's a tiny 800sq ft house, and the property taxes are only like $1k a year. Utilities are minimal, as the house is small and pretty well insulated. He started getting $1500 a month in social security as soon as he was eligible. He does not \"need\" this money and it gets deposited into an account and he does not touch it. So far the account has around 40k in it.\n\n He does have a 403b with another 40k. And a few other accounts with like an additional 10k in them. But that is all my parents have to get them through retirement. \n\nThe one kicker is that my dad may need to buy a new truck soon, as his 2000 Chevy is starting to rust. He \"needs\" a truck, as hunting is his main hobby and a deer or a bear won't fit in a Civic. So he could be taking on a $500-$600 car payment, or perhaps no payment if he drains his savings account to pay cash. He lives a very simple life and rarely buys things unless he needs them, hunting, fishing, and a small camping trailer are his modest splurges. \n\nMy mom will be 62 soon and she is also looking to retire, if they can figure out health insurance. She has no money saved for retirement and as a church employee for over 40 years her salary is low, so her social security will be around $1200 a month. The one benefit, is that she thinks she can get health insurance for both her and my dad from her employer upon her retirement for around $500 a month until they are eligible for Medicare. \n\nSo my question here... should dad keep putting his $1500 a month into his savings account, or is there something else he should be doing with this money each month?",

I am excited about the idea and I can't think of too many downsides, so I wanted some other thoughts.\n\nWe are a young family with two toddlers. We bought our house when our second was born because our rental was too small and rents for anything bigger were more than a mortgage. We used a low down payment mortgage program because we didn't have the savings we wanted.\n\nMy wife works part time around the kids schedules and I have a good paying job, but our benefits are bad so we have some medical debt and small credit card debt along with our student loans. We have enough to make things work and save a little, but we can't seem to get ahead on our 5 year plan of our emergency fund + CC/medical debt + 20% down payment for a house that fits our family/location.\n\nSo, my wife's idea is to radically sell our house in the next 60 days. The market is in our favor and with our bit of equity we should be able to turn a 10-15k profit. Then we would move in with my parents for 6 months. During that 6 months we would eliminate most of our bills and be able to save significantly while paying down the smaller of our debts. Then, in the summer we find a new house, taking our time, not having to sell a house and with a proper down payment without debt and a fresh focus on our finances.\n\nSince the kids are not in school yet the only things affected by the sudden move would be commutes, which is minor. Tell me why I shouldn't suddenly move out and get my house ready to sell right now!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Edit to answer some questions\\*\\*\n\nYes, step one is to budget this all out. I appreciate everyone pointing out the real estate agent fees/commissions. We have a great relationship with the agent who helped us by the house who we would use to sell. I would definitely have a discussion about what that number should be (thanks for the suggestion). Anyone have a good template for calculating the net on a home sale?\n\nWe currently can pay off our debt, slowly. This would be a radical change in effort to speed up the process while we see an opportunity. The other piece of this that I didn't explain well is that we have been looking at the possibility of moving anyway. We know we need to make changes to the budget as is, but this would be the jump start to the process in an effort to get us to the position of making that move more quickly.\n\nAnd of course this is all contingent on my parents.  In order for us to move forward they would need to be excited, not just ok with it. Of course we would not be asking to live for free, I would fully expect a rent, etc. \n\nThanks all for the input, keep it coming!",

That\u2019s the only debt I have, except for $1300 on a credit card which I paid off last month. My credit score isn\u2019t great but  not so awful- I\u2019ve been really building over the past few years, it\u2019s probably about 600-620. As it\u2019s been getting better I\u2019ve been getting a lot of offers for auto financing from Capital One- which is not my bank but my credit card company. I\u2019ve seen reviews for auto financing from my bank (TD) are mostly not great. I\u2019ve been warned against cc auto financing but it looks like the average rate is about 6%. Definitely not awesome but with my credit score I wasn\u2019t expecting better. Or should I?\n\nI really need a new car, my 20 year old Jeep is not cutting it anymore. My main question is- once I get this loan paid off- which should happen by the 31st, can I expect to see my credit score go up? And therefore should I wait for that to happen before shopping for a car? \n\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling generous, Reddit- I\u2019ve (30f) never bought a car from a dealer before and would take any advice you\u2019ve got. I\u2019ll probably have to shop alone- I\u2019ve been told not to do that as a woman and that I could get taken advantage of price-wise (which is shitty to hear) but it\u2019s my only option. I\u2019ve done some research but if you\u2019ve got any tips for me I\u2019d appreciate it. Looking for prob another Jeep- something like a 15-17 Patriot with less than 30k mi. I\u2019d like to pay less than $300/mo which from what I\u2019ve seen, should be doable. \nIf I get financed through capital one they just show me all the cars that are available near me with the rate I would get already agreed upon by the dealer (supposedly). So unless I get advice that that\u2019s a horrible way to go- I think it\u2019s a good strategy for me to be able to really shop around with out getting manipulated by dealers- which I so would, I\u2019m so naive and such an easy target.

Combined we earned about $240k gross in 2019.  I know that puts me on the top of the higher end of the income spectrum.  I've been climbing the income ladder for a few years without making many strategic moves to set us up for the future - that changed in 2019.\n\nBefore I get to the long winded stuff about what we did in 2019 here are some charts and tables!\n\n[2019 Sankey Chart - Income/Expenses](https://imgur.com/a/aZqt7rn)\n\n[2018 Sankey Chart - Income/Expenses (one that made me realize I need to get smarter)](https://imgur.com/r934oOH)\n\n[Table Comparing 2019 vs 2018 Income/Expenses](https://imgur.com/a/fPGuq40)\n\n[Net Worth - 2019 vs 2018](https://imgur.com/a/bYsE1AF)\n\n**Changes Made In 2019**\n\n1. Started using 401ks to the max allowable (changed later in the year so it isn't 100% of the max)\n   1. As a result we saved $32k which shielded $19k more from income tax than it did in 2018.  \n   2. Income rose $20k in 2019 but payroll taxes stayed flat!\n2. Paid off car loans without buying new cars.\n   1. We've had a goal for a few years to save for a vacation house.  Pulled about $10k out of there to pay off our car loans.  Know that this didn't really save us much in interest expense as our notes were both around 1.5% but it frees up a bunch of cash monthly and the psychological burden is lifted!\n3. Child 1 went to Kindergarten and left daycare.\n   1. That's huge as it saves us about $12k/year!\n4. Really stepped back and looked at our spending habits - part of this was realizing we're in a position where we don't need to worry about \"making it\" anymore.  We need to start thinking smart instead of hard.  To that end we actually started spending more on things that either bought us time, aided in our health, or protected our assets.\n   1. Didn't even consider canning the cleaning lady - she saves us so much time.\n   2. We've had a landscaper do some projects in the past - now he does everything around our home.  I get to spend the whole weekend with my wife/kids.  \n   3. Use services such as HelloFresh or Blue Apron.\n      1. I get it that those are expensive but it buys us time, allows us to try new foods, and is healthier than eating junk when the kids are in bed.\n   4. Reviewed our home and auto policies - we were way under insured in almost all areas.\n   5. Bought life insurance policies for both of us.\n      1. If either of us kick the bucket in the next 30 years the other will be able to still reach our shared goals of putting the kids through college and remaining in our home.  $1.5m for me since I'm the primary earner and $500k for her.\n\n**Changes to Net Worth**\n\n1. Biggest change was that our net worth increased 27% largely due to two factors\n   1. Tax deferred retirement assets increase $120k/45%\n      1. About $32k of that was contributions and the other $88k was due to a friendly stock market.\n   2. Eliminated all non-mortgage debt by paying off our car loans\n      1. Mortgage is a 3.5% so I see no incentive to pay that off any time soon.\n\nSo to wrap this up I'd like pointers from anyone in this community - what can I do better in 2020?  Is there anything people would like to learn about the strategies we took to get from A to B?\n\n**tl;dr:** we looked at our financial life at the end of 2018 and realized we needed to grow up - here's the results of spending 2019 growing up.

        "original": "The past four years me and my wife agreed to get on the same page to be debt free by 35 and retired by 46. four years ago she graduated college and got a job making minimum wage, two years ago she got her career and that is when we really started cranking out the debt from about 175k to about 113k. We are 31 right now and frankly it is exhausting and I do not know if we even have the budget to meet our goals. It feels like two steps forward and one step back. For example I spent the last four days figuring out a new cellphone plan as we shared a data package from Verizon for 115 a month. We switched to a prepaid ATT plan which costs us now 50 a month with double the data so we saved 65 bucks which is awesome. Then I get a statement that the internet bill has gone up 10 bucks as well as the auto insurance which went up 15 bucks. It is emotionally exhausting that you put in the work to save dollars and then get fucked in another aspect. \n\nI picked up 4k in overtime in the last six months of the year because we just had another child and we didn't budget in the yearly expenses for daycare so instead of paying less to the debt I picked up overtime to pay for daycare. During this time frame the dog got sick requiring a 300+ vet bill, the cat got a UTI which was another 100, struts went on our vehicle which blew out a tire 550, family vacation that we were dragged into which cost 1400 and that all but depleted out emergency fund. We seem to be living paycheck to paycheck which is our own fault because any extra money goes towards any debt. We both own our cars so we don't have any payments\n\nOur debt situation looks like this. The credit card debt is because we took out a loan from Axos at 8% to put an addition onto the house for a babies room this spring. I thought it was foolish to be paying 8% interest for the next 3 years so I took out a couple credit cards at 0% for 18 months with a 2% original fee. We have currently paid off 8k of them so far in the past few months and throw everything we have at them so we don't have to roll over onto another 0% credit card.\n\nOn top of that we take a huge hit with what we put towards our retirement. We put 10% each into a deferred comp program for the state on top of our original retirement plans. Everything has us feeling so thin that it is frankly exhausting, especially seeing our peers in the same income bracket take vacations around the world, buy RV's and toys and frankly go out to a sports event or show every weekend. The last time we went to a show was over a year ago to see transiberian orchestra.  \n\nAnyhow here is the debt situation and her is what I have budgeted. Should we be debt free by 35 and for those that are is it worth it? \n\nMortgage- $46750 @3.85%\n\nWifes Student Loans- $9,000 @3.4%\n\nMy Student Loans- $42,000 @6.4%\n\nCredit Card Debt - $16,000 @0% until April of next year\n\n---\n\nWife's take home bi-weekly paycheck=$1,300 and I budget it out monthly like this ($2,600)\n\n-$600 for groceries for two weeks\n\n-$300 for tuition for oldest daughters school\n\n-$1,250 towards credit card debt\n\n-$125 to student loans\n\n-$40 to personal savings\n\n-$40 to oldest daughters savings acct (youngest we start contributing at 4 like we did with our oldest so they have a comparable amount in there when they are old enough to buy a house)\n\n-$50 to emergency fund\n\n-About 195 is leftover for gas, life insurance payment ($35), streaming services (21), anything for daughters extra curriculars (gymnastics, field trips) and a slush fund if we run out of groceries\n\n------\n\nMy bi weekly paycheck is $1625 but I do my budget monthly as most of my account is handling the bills that come in so my monthly amount is $3250\n\nMortgage- $700 of which about 250 goes towards the principle and the rest interest and escrow\n\nStudent Loans-$550\n\nCar Insurance- $115\n\nSavings-$80\n\nLife Insurance- $325\n\nCell Bills- $50\n\nGas Bill-$75\n\nInternet- $55\n\nElectric Bill-$100\n\nOldest daughters savings -$40\n\nEmergency Fun- $50\n\nMy Personal Savings -$80\n\nWater/sewer and city garbage- $80\n\nYoungest daughters daycare- $625\n\nMonthly total=$2,925 leaving me with $325 dollars for gas, diapers and formula when needed\n\nLike I said we could just start paying the minimum and start enjoying our money but we want to be debt free, retire early and use the snowball method to pay off the riskiest debt followed by the high interest. At 1250 a month I figure the CC debt will be paid off by January of next year. Our tax returns are usually around 7.5k and we plan on putting that next year towards the mortgage dropping it down to about 35k. Once the 1250 a year is no longer going towards the cc debt we plan to put half and half towards the student loans and mortgage essentially paying them off by around 34/25. I am in the process of refinancing my student loans but the best rate I seem to find is 4.35%. Again not sure if this comes off as a vent but is it worth it in the end and frankly am I doing it right? I know this sub won't like the 325 towards life insurance but I have been paying into it since I was 21 and have some decent assets built up with the dividends.

We are in the position where we have up to $35k in cash for purchasing the van (perhaps a bit more if needed), so financing is not an issue or a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have read through the guides about how to buy a new and a used car, but how to decide between the two is something I haven't found much guidance on.  A couple factors that might be useful to know or not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* We take a lot of 4 hour road trips on highways to see family.\n* We put about 95k miles on the CR-V between the two of us (one car family) within the 4 years, 2 months that we've owned it.  I used to have an hour and a half commute, but now I work from home for the last year, so that number may be lessening, although compensated to a certain extent by more frequent road trips to see family.\n* We plan on driving whatever car we buy into the ground.\n* We have a mechanic we trust and live in a safe area.  (I used to live in an area where I was afraid of what a breakdown might mean-- not anymore).\n* We have a decent emergency fund as well, so any emergency repairs can usually be dealt with.\n* Neither of us are comfortable with haggling at all, so I appreciate the guides provided.\n* We are not really bells and whistles people so don't really want a lot of extras in the vehicle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question is which should we start looking for?

I'll do my best to update if it keeps flowing.\n\nThings I've learned: \n3% interest is cheap money. I never thought of it functionally with inflation and current savings interest rate.\nSofi has refinance rates down to 3.75%. That would be ideal. I'd feel comfortable paying together and not dipping into savings, if that is legit. She said she tried to refinance with no success. We shall try again.\nAbsolutely never spend your emergency fund. Unless it's actually an emergency. Thankfully I've never had anything that truly qualifies. Hopefully I never will.\n\nI've done my best to answer unique questions case by case, but the general answers are:\nYes, she is my wife and I am a guy. I tried to keep it gender neutral. Sounds like I slipped up or my mansplaining rang through or Reddit is sexist. I give up. It's hard being gender neutral. We are all zed now.\nZed's debt is not what I would call irresponsible debt. Zed has a masters degree in forensic paleontology. Zed had to buy a new vehicle as zed's was totaled in a not at fault accident. We got an solid deal on a reasonable vehicle. We both agree that expensive cars are not worth it.\nFuture debt concern is unwarranted. I advised zed was far better with money than I am. If my math is correct, zed is using 30% of her income after taxes to pay down current debt. Also, zed does contribute 10% in her 401k. I totally spaced on that. The only reason I am ahead is due to an 8 year advantage. I was not much better at 27. \nI should have added zed is intelligent and just as frugal as I am.\nConcern of 'together forever' is fair. I get it. My sister and father echo your wisdom.\nTogether, we have discussed zed's debt at length. Zed is of the opinion this is zed's responsibility. I saw what some would consider a smart opportunity to help our future. This is an exercise to explore what I may not have considered. I believe it was a success.\nThank you again.\n\n*Bonus Bonus Question*\nI also have an HSA for medical emergencies (Zed will have one on the next enrollment). Do people include this balance in their emergency fund? I consider it money that I've already spent on medical bills. Interest rates are appalling and I can't spend it anywhere else. Why even think about it?\n\n\nYoungish newlyweds - 35 & 27. Spouse is $76,959.65 in debt. I always see great advise from r/personalfinance and now it's my turn to ask.\n\nCurrently on a $1000 a month payment plan. \n\nStudent Loan 1- \n$37,118.88\n7.210% Interest\n$390 payment per month\n\nStudent Loan 2-\n$7,156.85\n3.862% Interest\n$50 payment per month\n\nStudent Loan 3-\n$19,994.25\n6.210% Interest\n$160 payment per month\n\nCar Loan-\n$12,689.67\n3.09% Interest\n$400 a month payments\n\nCurrent pay plan only includes spouses income. Our combined income is about $100k after taxes. \n\nI have $60k in savings working towards buying a house. $10k emergency fund. I max out my Roth IRA and contribute 10%(3% match) into my 401k. I am debt free with a newish vehicle. Spouse has not started down the retirement path. We currently live rent free (long story) and probably will for a few more years. Especially if I dump my savings. Other expenses are budgeted and I believe negligible for this exercise. \n\nUnbury.me is a fabulous tool that shows the straight dollars of spouse's current pay plan. Numbers indicate it would be paid off by 2028, but with over $20k in interest paid. The balance exceeds my funds, but we can scratch off the two higher interest student loans. Increasing our pay plan to $1500 a month, we would be debt free in a year with only $390 interest paid.\n\nI feel like I have given this plenty of thought, but I am looking for outside insight that I may have not considered.\n\n*Bonus Question* - Our living situation is rather unique, but can change at any time. It has not changed in 5 years and we do not expect it to, but it surely could. I was told with home loan interest rates being what they are; it is better to borrow than to put down a large down payment. I'd always have the $10k emergency fund for a down payment. Opinions? \n\nLastly, let's pretend trust isn't an issue. This isn't relationship advise. In my heart of hearts I can't imagine spouse saying \"kthanksbye\". This is not their idea. Spouse doesn't even know I am contemplating this. Spouse budgets, is paying debt aggressively and is far more responsible with money than I am.",

I have been browsing posts on this subreddit for couple months and this is my first post. I primarily want to seek advices on structuring my savings better.

My long term goal is to max out 401k, Roth IRA, and EE bond but I feel that I don't make enough to do it comfortably at the moment. After I graduate I expect to return to full time status making about 90k (possibly with a small raise as well)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe issue with my current asset structure is that: I want to have fund for future car / vacation / house purchase. Currently they are all part of the e-fund saving account and I don't like it. But I don't know if opening additional 1 or 2 saving accounts are necessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys suggest?

Once I returned I was advised by friends, family, doctors, etc. to seek medical attention immediately because rabies is no joke. Although I was very against getting the rabies shots (for fear of the medical debt it would place me in) I went through with it. I had to visit the hospital four times for a series of shots. The first being the most expensive costing $15674.25 , the second- $1086.05, the third- $1246.05, and the fourth- $1246.05... for a total bill of $19,252.40. I immediately applied for financial aid to help me with the bill. At the time I was working as a nanny being paid under the table. I mailed my financial aid form in and waited and heard nothing back. Filled with anxiety over my debt I went into the hospital and waited until I was able to sit down with someone from the financial aid department. This person eased my anxiety and I was able to submit my application. I stopped getting any bills of any kind and I thought my medical debt had been resolved.  I just received a bill from the medical revenue service for $12,479.05.  I called and spoke to the representative and she told me if I am able to pay the money up front she can reduce the bill to $9000- she suggested taking out one or two credit cards to pay it off so my credit would not be effected. Or I can pay a minimum of 300 a month for three years- and the bill would not be reduced and my credit would be effected. I currently work as the assistant director for a preschool and am paid $950.98 every two weeks after taxes. I really don't know the best way to tackle this and would appreciate any advice on what to do.",

Starting in my late-teens, I had a solid decade of bad decisions, ignoring my mental health, and being a dipshit. I was either using heroin, drinking, or going through withdrawals. My performance at work suffered greatly and, since my income is largely performance-based, I was headed toward a cliff that would probably end in my family leaving me and becoming homeless. There were several times that I thought that the depression was going to get the best of me (I later discovered that I'm also bipolar). Eventually, everything broke down and I ended up in rehab. Also, I'm married and we have two little kids.\n\nI slowly started to rebuild/recover - then quickly. My first year with my shit together got me out of debt and I started living less paycheck-to-paycheck. Then, in 2019, shit got real. My income from work increased by about 50%, I got a few side jobs which brought in another 20% of my previous income. Because I've learned to manage my time better, I've even had more time to spend with family (and play video games).\n\nJust in 2019, I went from having $0 savings, $0 retirement to:\n\n* Savings = $12k\n\n* IRA = $6k\n\n* 401k = $3k\n\n* Expected 2019 tax refund = $10k? (I over-withhold *on purpose*. Don't lecture me about it)\n\nHonestly, I don't even know what to do with all this money?! I've grown so accustomed to a minimal lifestyle that I actually enjoy living cheap. Other than spending a buttload of money on PS4, my expenses haven't really gone up at all.\n\nI suppose I should ask for some financial advice here... What should I do with my savings? My wife and I like the idea of continuing to rent cheap near where I work and also buy a house in an area that we really enjoy that we can live/vacation in part-time and rent out when we're not using it. In the area where we are looking at, the housing is $300k-$400k. My income has probably stabilized at $100k. My wife is going to start working in a couple years, probably at $30k - $40k for a couple years, and then doubling+ once she's done with her education. Also, my job is inversely tied to the economy, so **if** there's some kind of financial/housing collapse or recession, my income will most likely go up by 50% or so.\n\nAlso: using throwaway due to drug references and personal info.",

He literally lives on a blow up mattress in the storage room and showers with some outdoor camping shower behind the building. The business makes just enough to pay rent and utilities.   \n   \nObviously, he doesn\u2019t have health insurance or any probable income. I\u2019m sure you can guess his credit is bad because of a foreclosure when his mom passed away and he didn\u2019t have to keep paying her mortgage (she was sick for a long time).  \n   \nAnyways. I\u2019m an RN and i know the risks of untreated dental infection. The longer he waits, not only does he suffer in pain, he loses nutrition from what he can\u2019t eat and he risks infection which can lead to pericarditis and other serious medical emergencies.   \n   \nI make around $60k a year with overtime. I have some empty credit cards but they are all ridiculous interest rates so if I put 6k on them he would be paying interest forever. I have a 750+ credit score.

Maybe if I do this with like 4 of my long standing cards he will have enough of a boost to qualify for some sort of care credit or loan or something.

        "original": "I am recently divorced after a 10-year relationship that spanned age 18-29.\n\nI am a PhD student. For my undergrad and master's degree, I have about $80k in student debt (some government, some private - I'm in Canada for what it's worth). I am a fully-funded PhD student now, in my second year, and not paying any tuition/fees.\n\nBecause of stupidity and irresponsibility, I foolishly left all money matters to my ex. This landed me personally $15k in consumer debt after divorce (no property, auto). I filed a consumer proposal last week as the first credit card $9k served me.\n\nAfter tackling the debt, which was causing me tremendous anxiety and felt like an albatross to my past life, I now am taking on the task of budgeting my income. Now on single income, I have no sense of what aspects of my lifestyle are/aren't affordable, and still struggle with budgeting for one person (rather than two).\n\n**Budget looks like this:**\n\n***Income TOTAL: $69k (48k+21k)***\n\n**Income Source 1 - Fellowship/Scholarships (after tuition is paid - amt returned to me): $48k / year net (paid 3 times annually - 16k in September, January, May)**\n\n**Income Source 2 - Part-Time Work: $21000 net / year** \n\n\\--------\n\n***Bills: $3040***\n\nRent - $1300/mo (includes all utilities and internet except for my built in air conditioning)\n\nAir Conditioning Utility Bill $120/mo for summer months only - so like $60/mo year maximum)\n\nConsumer Proposal - $300 / mo ($18k total)\n\nStudent Line of Credit Payment (I have to pay this to my parents, who cosigned my loan when I was 18) - $180/mo\n\nNo car payment - car owned outright.\n\nAuto Insurance $180/mo (horribly expensive after moving to my current province despite no accidents, no tickets. Have shopped around extensively).\n\nGas: $130/mo (sometimes much less)\n\nPets: $60/mo - Food, treats, essentials\n\nCell Phone: $55/mo (need a new cell phone but intend to purchase outright when my scholarship comes in - currently using a 5 year old Samsung S7)\n\nStorage Unit: $95/mo\n\nBooks: $100/mo\n\nGroceries: $200/mo\n\nNicotine: $120/mo (Goddamn Juul...)e\n\nAlcohol: $200/mo (considering switching to winemaking to save money. Also probably drank more during last stressful year)\n\nI have no sense of what I spend on incidentals, except probably $40/mo on pharmacy/toiletries. I haven't bought new clothes or shoes in about 10 months, but I need new clothes desperately. I've been living pay cheque to pay cheque, and suspect I fritter a lot of money away on foolish things like takeout, housewares, and other relics from a time when I had dual income from my spouse / AKA when we were racking up debt. I also feel I could save money on groceries etc.\n\n**Savings and goals:**\n\nI only have a basic chequing and savings account (free). I use a bank the rest feature that rounds up my purchases but only started this last month so there's about $100 there.\n\nThe last year (moving twice, including once cross country) depleted the small amount of savings I had. I have 0 savings. My car is safe and should last at least another 8 years with only minor repairs as-needed. I just got the scholarship that increased my wage by $35k year starting in September, but I have nothing to show for it right now with a small amount of money in the bank waiting for the $16k to land.\n\nLast year I spent an exorbitant amount of money on travel home to see friends/family because my life was falling apart and I was completely unaware of how much in the hole I was. This has stopped.\n\nImportant: Need to save $9000 in 3 years to cover upcoming tuition bill. My scholarship/fellowship income is going to end before I finish my degree (I'm a year behind because of personal circumstances / getting divorced). After that point I anticipate 3 semesters @ $3000k semester worth of tuition I will need to pay out of pocket and should probably be saving for. I have 3 years before I will have to pay this. I don't anticipate being able to take out a loan at this point because of the proposal, and frankly, seems like I should be able to save this rather than add it to my student debt.\n\n**Upcoming expenses and still cleaning up messes:**\n\nI get my scholarship $16k this week. I have a few purchases that need to happen that I've been waiting for. The $16k must last until my next installment mid-April. I have the additional monthly income noted above from my part-time work.\n\nI had to borrow $3600 from my parents to pay for divorce costs. I am going to pay this back to them in lump some from my scholarship.\n\nI have a broken phone (crashes, doesn't hold charge). Because of the proposal I'm not likely to get approved for a cell phone payment plan. Planning to spend $700-800 on a new phone, keeping my current pre-paid plan at $55/mo. I've been using a broken Samsung S7 and need something reliable for my work calls.\n\nI need clothes. I suspect somewhere in the range of $500-600 to have shoes and clothes for work that don't have holes, etc.\n\nI need glasses. My insurance (covered by my school) will cover $75.00 but I suspect I'll spend around $150 out of pocket. I tried buying previously online but have been getting headaches since.\n\nI need to be able to afford to pay to travel to conferences for school and get reimbursed a few weeks later. This is about $2500 x 2 yearly. Next conference is end of April.\n\n**Taxes:** I have no clue if I am going to have a tax bill this year. First year divorced, much of my income is from fellowship/scholarships.\n\n**Insurance settlement:** At some point in the next year I expect $10k or so as an insurance settlement. My plan was to use this to pay off the consumer proposal ($18k total)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HELP NEEDED:** I don't even know where to start. I've tried Tangerine and YNAB, but the last year has been so erratic and bizarre that setting up a budget with past values seems overwhelming and I don't follow through with tracking. I feel like I'm living beyond my means but not sure if this is a lingering feeling from the past decade of my ignorance and last year of utter chaos.\n\nAre there any glaring suggestions?\n\nHonestly, I feel like I am financially illiterate and need to pay someone to help me manage my money / put me on an allowance system. Despite this, I am also really motivated to become literate and take control of my situation now that I am out of a toxic relationship.\n\nWelcoming of any thoughts, advice, insight, words of encouragement, heckling, etc.r\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Updated to include alcohol on the budget.\n\nEdit: Also, the $48k in scholarship income expires before I anticipate finishing my degree, which will leave me with a tuition bill AND significantly reduced income. I intend to work more to compensate for this, which is realistic at that stage in my degree (lots of demand for sessional instructors etc.). Also open to start working more now in anticipation and to build adequate savings.\n\nEdit: Updated to clearly indicate the amount of income at 69k / annually.",

        "original": "Hi everyone, I'd like some advice on saving for a down payment on a house. Here's my basic info for reference:  \n\n* 35, male, live in Orange County, CA. Not married, no kids. \n* Government job at a local utility making around $72k a year with a CalPERS pension, been there just over a year so I'm not fully vested yet. Also have a 457 that I contribute to. Get a COLA once a year, plus a merit raise. \n* Also teach at a community college, was doing one class a semester, now I'm doing two. Last monthly check was about $950, should be about double this semester. \n* Receive a monthly check of $465 from a promissory note I hold on a property, will be getting that until 2030.\n* Current retirement assets of approximately $130k. \n* Have $21,000 in liquid savings right now, contribute $300 a month to it. \n* Have a Roth, was maxing it out, but decided to focus on the 457 this year because I'm in a higher tax bracket. \n* No student loans or car payments. Carry a max of $3K in credit card debt, almost always try to pay it all off within three months. \n* Current rent $700, utilities $175, and a storage unit of $311 because I didn't want to take up all the space in my shared residence.\n\nSo here's my original plan: Sell some stock in a monthly dividend REIT to max out my Roth this year, then put the $500 a month towards my 457. I have already sold the stock and upped my 457 contribution from $200 per check to $450 per check, or $900 a month. But now I'm rethinking it, because I really want to move out into my own house this year. I have already been preapproved for up to $500k on a single family home with a $15k down payment and a CalHFA assistance loan, but I think that's stretching it a bit, plus the area I'm looking at is a little higher. So now I'm thinking of dropping back down to $200 per check for the 457, and using the extra $500 from not contributing to the Roth and the $950 from the extra class to help fund a down payment. I'd like to have at least $30k with a $5k-$10k buffer. After building the down payment I'd ramp up the 457 contributions again.\n\nIs this a good idea? While typing this up I even thought maybe use $3k of the stock sale for savings and put $3k in the Roth, then contribute in Q3 or at a lower rate through the year.",

        "original": "Long time lurker and first time poster. I'm looking for some feedback with regards to my budget and how my family finances are currently structured. Any perspectives are appreciated,\n\nBackground on us:  My wife and I are in our early-ish 30's and both work white-collar jobs in NYC for Fortune 500's. She has been with her company for 6 years and has been consistently promoted on the management track. I've been with my company for 2 years as an individual producer (sales). We are responsible and work hard, but only from 9-5. We have a happy and healthy 1 year old child.\n\n**Income:**\n\n2019 Gross W2 $285,000. There is some variability here approximately -25k/+40k based on sales performance moving forward.\n\n**Assets:**\n\nBrokerage Account - $20,000 - low cost ETF's\n\nBrokerage Account - $6,000 - low cost ETF's and some individual equities (this account is earmarked for our child). Not a 529 Account\n\nWife's ESPP Stock Account: $17,000 - Currently contributes the max of 10% income with 15% discount and no hold period. We typically hold the purchases and sell once they are considered long term gains. The company has performed well and we are bullish on continued long term performance.\n\nCash: $9,000\n\nLife Insurance: I hold a 30 year term life policy for $1.5MM\n\n401(k) Accounts: Combined $100,000 with 12% contributions\n\n**Liabilities:**\n\nStudent loan: $7,500 remaining at 3.75% - monthly payment $400. We've paid this down from a combined $35,000 in the past 24 months\n\nCredit Card: $0 (since 2016 we have paid down a combined $35,000)\n\nCar: 2019 Honda - Total note $24,000 @ 2.9% 5 year term monthly payment \\~$470 month\n\n**Expenses (Annualized)**\n\nRent: $56,400\n\nNanny Share: $32,500\n\nGroceries: $8,000\n\nCar: $5,500\n\nCar Insurance: $1,200\n\nLife Insurance: $1,400\n\nRenters insurance: $500\n\nCommuter Pass: $1400 pre tax\n\nMedical: $9,000 pre tax (combination of premiums and HSA contributions that are used)\n\nHousehold supplies: $2,400 - this is an estimate.\n\nTrips (Weddings, Vacations, Long Weekends): $5,000\n\nCleaners: $1,700\n\nLeisure (Eating Out, Spending, Self Care): This is where it's very hard to for me to track. We make a lot of purchases on Amazon/Target etc and it's hard to reconcile the charges. I would estimate this at around $20,000 but quite possible it could be higher\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\nI'm comfortable with our liabilities as they are fairly minimal relative to our income. Our expenses are high but at the same time we are not planning to purchase a house for another 4-5 years, if ever. We live a very high quality of life that we value, in a new building with short subway commutes to work. Our daughter receives loving care every day which we also cannot put a price on in her early years. Perhaps I will always carry the scars of the financial crisis in 2008/2009 (when I graduated) and prefer to not carry high amounts of liabilities (if any).  I would rather have nearly all of our money invested in the market. However I would like to be able to save more money and I recognize that the first step would be to accurately diagnose where the disposable income is going. I do feel that paying down my wife's $30,000 in credit card debit and our student loans in the past 3 years was necessary pain and that we are starting to lay the groundwork for a solid financial future.\n\nAny feedback or perspective is appreciated.\n\n-----------\n\nCurrently reviewing our main credit card year end summary by spend.

There's some extra money you get but it's used for vacation, sick, holidays or even tools. You just take it out of your check whenever you've accrued enough and want to. I also can't start contributing to a 401k until June I think. \n\nSo I looked around and found that a big university in town in hiring. I applied and had an interview but they've been on break until today so I haven't heard anything back yet.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's my issue.

This is for an entry level journeyman position so I guess there's room to move up and raises but that's a lot of money to give up. I think it's that low because the interviewer wants me to apply for another job posting in case I don't get selected and when I told the receptionist about it she pulled up a word document that showed the position I was interviewing for had 3 previous that declined due to low salary. I went home and applied. I called the lady who set up the interview and she brought it up to me that she overheard they wanted to get a hold of me to make sure I apply for the other job posting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I'd get 12 vacation days, 12 sick days, paid holidays, TRS(retirement), I'd work 7-4 M-F, and have \"good\" insurance.

Unfortunately, some chronic mental health problems kicked in, and I've yet to graduate. I've also, over this time, racked up some very worrying debt - \u00a31.7k in overdraft, and \u00a33.3 on credit cards, through uni costs (books, accomodation, transport etc.) and through being too ill to work alongside my studies sometimes. I currently pay about \u00a355 a month in credit card minium payments ( and more when I can, obviously, but this is seldom at the moment) and about \u00a350 in overdraft fees, although this is going up soon and will be more like \u00a380 a month, which has been really worried. I used to have an interest-free student overdraft but this is now terminated and I'm having trouble getting my bank to reinstate it.\n\nWhen well I've been working up to 30 hours a week in termtime, but currently my job (which pays \u00a310 a hour) has been cutting my hours to about 15-20 a week as I'm no longer as flexible as those who aren't studying. I am trying to get a proper full-time job, but getting something above minimum wage is difficult right now. I still live in London (I know, I know, but I need to be here for uni and I've got a rental contract for another 6 months. Moving home is not an option, as my abuser lives there). I earn anywhere from \u00a3800-1,000 pcm. My rental contribution is about \u00a3400 pounds a month, and I spend about another \u00a3250 a month on everyday life. My lifestyle is quite frugal. I am lucky enough to live with a great boyfriend who can help me out a little with food, etc, but I cannot ask him for a loan. I don't get student finance anymore, but if I go for graduate study in the autumn then I'll get an additional \u00a37k (I'd keep working the whole period of the master's).\n\nObviously the plan is to earn more money and make dents into what I owe, rather than paying off the minimum, and I'm commited to this. I also want to explore my options for reducing interest and perhaps consolidating debt right now, though. If I can convince my bank to take the interest charges off my overdraft, great, and I'll put that money back into paying off the debt, but my bank right now longer accepts that I'm a student.\n\nI wanted to ask advice about maybe taking out a loan to consolidate the debt. My bank will offer me a 5 year loan of \u00a34k (19.9% interest), which I would spend in entirely paying off my overdraft, keeping a cushion of \u00a3500 in my current account, and spending the rest (\u00a31.8k) to pay off some of my credit card debt. I would then apply for an interest-free balance transfer to another card in order to focus on paying off the loan.\n\nMy credit score isn't great - 880.\n\nIs this a really stupid idea? Is there another, better avenue I can take?\n\nThank you so much for any advice you can give.",

There is about 250K in equity in the house.

Typically I'd pay the CC off, but if I need a down payment on a house it would be nice to have that money in hand.  I was going to pay off CC and bank the $600 (Way more than minimums) in payments I make each month and build that nest egg back up in a couple of years, but I just found out they are selling the house I am renting.  I have no idea if I will have to move or not when my lease ends.  Apartments are expensive here and this house was hard to find.  \n\nAt my age I'd rather rent than buy and then have to sell again in 8 years when I move out of state.  \n\nShould I save the money for my Down payment, or pay off CC and why?\n\nIf I have much lower debt, no house and no CC debt.  How can I expect this to effect my credit score?  Which is already in the high 700s?\n\nETA: I am not in hardship, I am living comfortably.  I'm using less than 20% of my available credit.  I never carry much debt, but setting up a whole new household in 30 days so my kids have a place to stay made me dip into my credit.

I didn't pay my student loans, I maxed out 2 credit cards at 1900 and 2500 and let those and a $900 hydro bill go to collections.\n\n\nI started off September 2017 with nothing in my bank account because student loans took my rent and bill money directly out of my bank account on the 1st of the month. \nI was in a hole and it was all of my own making.\nStudent loans $28,000\nMC 2500\nVisa 2300\nHydro 987\n\nI was lucky enough to settle the MC, the Visa, and the hydro bill for $3400 total. And I paid that off with a loan from my grandmother (thank goodness for that woman. I love and respect her and have paid her back)\nI started a new job 10 days later\n In the last 24 months I have brought down my student loan to 18,500. I pay 400 on it every month.\n\nAbout a year or so ago I applied for capital one MASTERCARD to help rebuild my credit. I got it, a limit of 300, and it was easy. I then stupidly increased it to 2300 and have gone to hell with it. I pay 450 on it but I still use it so my balance just constantly stays the same. I have managed to throw an additional 500 on it so it's down to 1700 now but now I'm looking into credit card with a lower interest rate as the 19.99% interest is murder. \nI am looking into a MC that has 8.99% and 90 day 0 interest balance transfer. And after that 8.99% interest on the transfer itself. Is this a good route to go? Balance transfer to the higher card and try and continue to pay the 450/month on the lower interest card... I know this seems like an inane question but I'm trying not to screw this up.\n\nAny advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!!",

Before that could happen, my wages get garnished and now I can't even pay rent, car payment.\u00a0\n\n\nBackground: went through a separation couple years ago, he wasn't earning much but every little bit helps. So, I have $38,000 in debt(medical bills, student loans and my car) Credit score is below 500. I stupidly took out high interest loan to take care of fixing my RV (I live in RV, please don't think it's a mansion on wheels,paid less than $5 grand and it needs work, no hot water, no propane for stove or heat) and moving when my work transferred me (moving expenses were not covered).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n$300\u00a0goes to that loan a week. The money left out of my check was each week going to either rent, car payment, insurance, phone, etc. Sometimes, depending on which week, food was a luxury.\u00a0 Then of course must have gas money, laundry, etc.\u00a0\n\n\nThe final check of the year comes and it's $100+\u00a0less than usual (I'm salary). I review stub and see a garnishment. Contact payroll and they let me know it's for student loans.\u00a0 I contact them and they say there was a hearing in October. I hadn't updated my address when I relocated, so everything was sent to old address.\u00a0\n\n\nI can request a hearing to contest the garnishment, which of course I'm going to do. But what do I do in the meantime?\u00a0 Rent is due next Tuesday and I'm overdrawn by as much as my rent is.\u00a0 I have\u00a0$30\u00a0which should cover gas for work this week. I can eat at work. But I can't live this way. I will probably, barring any more unexpected sh**, be able to pay rent a week late, if he's willing to wait (pay for space in RV lot).\u00a0 \u00a0But if he's not willing to wait, will need to move my RV some where. I don't know anyone here. The nearest a friend lives is an hour away and cannot accommodate me and/or the RV.\u00a0 Not to mention, that puts me almost 2 hours away from me work\n\n\nI've applied to doordash as a driver. Waiting for my package so I can start with the hours I work at my job(10-12 hour shifts) it's difficult to find a job to work around those hours.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIt's so frustrating that I was planning on using my refund (which is now being offset to pay student loans) to pay off stupid loan so I could set up reasonable payments (not more than half my check each week) and now I can't even buy food or afford a place to live.\u00a0\n\n\nIs there anything I can do?

        "original": "Hey there r/personalfinance! Long-time lurker here. My fiancee and I have our date set and have started having conversations about how we should handle our money on and after the big day. I've looked at the wiki, and although our general plan of attack is clear, I was hoping for some specific insights from those who have been through the process before.\n\nSome background information: We are both in our 20s. I am finishing my final year of college. I already work in my chosen field, but getting a full time position will make a huge difference to my income. Fiancee is employed in a decent-paying role, hopefully with salary growth opportunities. Our only debt is my car payment (leasing a new car to be able to get to school and work). We have our wedding budget stashed away in liquid assets.\n\nI am much more risk averse than he is. He enjoys investing in his favorite company for fun, whereas I am more of a budget-spreadsheet-keeping type. In keeping with my \"Type-A\" style, I was hoping to hear what advice others would give to a pair of newlyweds, to ensure we are covering all of our bases.\n\nA few questions I have:\n1. What issues should we be aware of when creating or transferring financial accounts to merge our finances? Are there any hidden fees to watch out for?\n2. What strategies have you found are helpful for talking about stressful money matters with your spouse? \n3. What details did you forget when planning your own marriage (financially)? Was there any decision you made that you regretted afterwards?\n4. What's the biggest thing you wish you had known before you got married?",

My family has never been stellar when it comes to financial management and the only advice I was told growing up is to always save. Fast forward to 2020, I still don't have a credit card, I am applying to summer internships, and will likely apply for a government job. I intend on going to graduate school (for biostatistics or epidemiology) but will take time off beforehand to save money and gain relevant experiences to leverage myself into grad school. I currently have both a savings and checking account with a total sum of about 8k under my name and will probably be able to escape undergrad debt free! My tuition has been fully covered since I transferred from community college and only pay for housing.\n\nIdeally I would like to live out of my parents' house after graduating but at the moment there doesn't seem to be any prospect of me being able to independently support myself. My family has never been well off and it seems that their financial issues are growing, but I hope to end this cycle in my family's history and build a better future. What moves should I make as a 22 y/o in 2020 to improve my personal finance aside from building credit?

I am currently working in an AmeriCorps position which is full time and provides a living stipend of about $960 a month. I took the position in the hopes of using the education grant (\\~$6000 after 12mos of service) to go back to school but I've realized that it hasn't really been worth the trade-off. The past year and a half have been very unlucky financially and now with the stipend I just don't currently make enough money with costs of living, private loan payments, medical debt, etc. On the plus side though, being forced into a really hard financial position has given me perspective on how I could have avoided this with more responsible choices in the past and a safety net. I'm about $1300 behind on my loan payments and I also have $400 past due on a credit card.\n\nI have been looking for other jobs for about 2 months and I have committed to becoming more financially responsible this year. The weight of student loans, my small credit card debt, medical debt in collections, and the constant anxiety of being unsure if I can even pay my bills, let alone make debt payments or save money, has not been fun and I'm eager to work towards greater stability. Even a minimum wage job would be an improvement from my current situation. However, I have just had a really good opportunity present itself. I've been interviewed for a full-time, salaried position (36-40k range), with full benefits (medical, dental, vision all at no premium, up to 6 weeks paid leave per year) and they're hiring multiple positions so I'm feeling really optimistic about the outcome. The difficulty is that the job would require either a really significant commute (60 miles) or relocation. I don't have a car and the total travel time would be about 3 hours one way on public transit. My credit score is sitting at about 480 (compared to 730 two years ago) so I'm not optimistic about getting anywhere near a reasonable loan with only an offer letter before my position starts. I've looked into ridesharing but the position is a nightshift and I couldn't find anything. Similarly, I couldn't move beforehand either because I have absolutely no money saved, not to mention I have 7 mos left on a lease with my roommates/friends. Do you see any options? I'm in my early 20s and I haven't finished my bachelor's so I don't foresee another opportunity like this coming along.

        "original": "Hi all, \n\nSo with the start of the new year, my gf and I (both 23) have begun making efforts to avoid coasting on the paycheck to paycheck life. We have been dating for 5 years, living together for 3, and plan on getting married within this next 3-5 years so we decided to make a joint checking account to pool our resources and achieve our goals faster. We set up an account with YNAB, and would appreciate any advice on how we should be allocating our money. Here is a brief overview of our current budget. \n\nType | Amount\n---|---\nCombined incomes (monthly after taxes) | **~$5,700** (I get paid every two weeks so some months I get an additional $1460 on top of that)\nRent | **$2,713** (Includes rent, parking, and dog fee)\nAverage Expenses | **$1,000**: $500 for groceries, $180 for utilities + internet, $90 for train pass, $50 for subscriptions, $180 for unexpected expenses \nIncome Remaining to Save | $1,987, although we will try to set aside money for future purchases (vet bills, birthday/christmas presents, etc.) So maybe round down to **$1800** after adjusting for those.\nCash Savings | **$0**, we would like to beef this up to around 2-3 months expenses\nRetirement | **$7,600** in my Roth IRA, girlfriend doesn't have an account yet\nBrokerage | **$16,640**, all in one company that was gifted as a college graduation present\n\nWe have some long term goals that we want to achieve, but we are unsure about what we should prioritize. Is it best to contribute to all, or to focus on one at a time? I'm hoping to get a new job soon that will boost my monthly income by maybe an extra $1,500 a month.\n\n\n\nGoal (in no particular priority order) | Amount\n---|---\nEmergency Fund | $1,000\nOpen 2nd Roth IRA | $2,000 (for girlfriend with Vanguard)\nChecking Account Buffer | $7,000 (roughly 2 months of expenses)\nSaving for engagement ring | $6-8,000 range\nWedding Fund | $20-25,000 range (potentially lower if we have a smaller wedding and get help from parents)\nHouse Down-payment | $60-80,000 to get best rates and no pmi (both credit scores above 760 right now)\n\nWe are definitely doing better that a lot of our friends from college since we are lucky enough to not have student debt, but we have started the bad habit of spending pretty much everything that comes in. We would like to take advantage of our situation so that we can be more comfortable later in life. We appreciate any guidance! Thanks",

I worked there for 3.5 years and went to esthetics school for a year in the evenings. I became a licensed esthetician in May 2018. In addition to that, I have a Bachelor of Arts in Communications (graduated in 2010). \n\nBefore I quit, I asked my partner if it was OK to leave, confident that I would quickly find another job- he gave his blessing (side note: he is an electrician with his own company and employes 6 guys).\nUnfortunately I was unemployed for 3 months (unable to collect unemployment because I quit) and went on a dozen interviews with no bites. I was desperate an started working as a Marketing Manager/Esthetician for a dermatology practice in January 2019 three days a week making $30/hr OR 40% comission on facial treatments performed. I picked up a freelance PR job on the other two days I wasn't at the practice. I was still struggling financially with the two jobs, bringing in less than $1,000/week. \n\nIn April, I was offered marketing manager/esthetician position at another doctor's office 4 days a week and left the dermatologist practice and the freelance PR gig. The new practice would pay me $30/hour PLUS 15% comission on laser treatments and 50% comission on facial treatments. They also give me $200/month to use towards health insurance (which I get through my husband's business). \nFor an esthetician, this is a dream and great money. For someone who has a college degree, 9 years of experience, and over $60K of student debt, this isn't that great. One day a week I also work for my husband's business pulling permits and other admin work for $150/week. \n\nRight now, with both jobs + comission I am bringing in about $45,000 a year. Half of what I was making a little over a year ago. My husband has been putting pressure on me to contribute more to the mortgage/bills, especially now because we are newly weds and childless. He knows that if I go back to corporate I won't be able to work for him.Once we have children in a few years, the plan is to work PT for him and PT somewhere else (ideally, at the practice I am currently employed). \n\nI do love my job at the practice but I know they can't pay me what I deserve. We have discussed increased flexibility once I have children. They've been really good to me (I even invited the owners to my wedding and one of the doctors is my PCP) but I'm afraid to ask for more money because they're always stressing that we need to spend less, PLUS they just hired the owner's daughter and I'm sure she's making the same hourly rate. They also don't have a ton of marketing work for me to do, so I don't feel like I'm really utilizing my college degree.\n\nMy goal is to pay off my student loans before we have kids and I have contributed about 40% of my current income towards them. I also contribute $200/month towards a personal 401k. \n\nI'm in a pickle- should I leave this job for a corporate job that would pay me \n$90K+, plus benefits (matching 401k, Health insurance) now that I'm at my max earning potential, or should I stay at my job which I know has flexibility down the road but I make significantly less? I am nervous that if I leave here, I won't be able to come back once I have kids. I have a phone screen tomorrow with a large company for a solid job that may actually pay $100k+.",

Next is the main question, which would be our moving in together, but this time for real. We have always lived with roommates in college or small apartments for cheap, but we would like to actually explore around for either a starter home or some kind of cheaper rental to get going. \n\n\\*\\*The Cold Hard (Sad) Facts\\*\\*\n\nI don't presume that we will have any financial assistance moving forward other than from her parents for a wedding, so the name of the game for us right now is save, save, save. Like I mentioned previously, we are both living at home with our parents, who do not require us to pay any sort of rent and (for the most part) provide us with meals which is great. I have $20,000 saved up, she has about $2,000 (just started her career a month ago) and have been saving RAPIDLY since moving back in with the parents (about $5k by myself in 3 months).\n\n\\*\\*The Help\\*\\*\n\nSo, financial gurus, if there is any lick of advice for anything that could help me out on this ridiculous challenge we are about to take on for ourselves, please let me know. The housing in my area is a bit more pricey as it is all near the beach, and we were thinking that with 8-10% down payment on a house we could top out a housing budget at around $400k. There is so much going through my head so any type of planning, budgeting, saving advice would really go a long way for us.

Up to now I've been able to pay tuition and stuff without debt for several reasons:\n\n* I worked and saved pretty much all my earnings from 17 on. Nothing fancy, just food service and a summer camp.\n* I've lived either with my parents or on site at said summer camp as I did maintenance and stuff.\n* I've done my best to do college as cheaply as possible. Community college online for two years, transferring to another state school to finish my degree online.\n\nMy dilemma now is that I'm almost out of savings, and this new school, while still cheap in comparison to many schools I looked at, is more expensive than the one I have been at. Also, I no longer have the option of living rent-free (until mid-May, when summer camp starts again). I've found some super nice people that are willing to rent me a space for $300/mo for a few months, and I plan to move forward with that.\n\nAs a breakdown, my current income is usually around $800/mo. (Working part time for my camp). My current savings is $4.4k. Tuition is $4.1k (will be slightly less in future semesters). Rent is $300/mo. I don't have an emergency fund beyond those savings, so I've always tried to not touch them as much as possible.\n\nSo, I've got a few options. My college has a payment plan that splits the amount into thirds for a $25 fee. The only Federal aid I qualify for (my parents are successful enough that I don't qualify for much, but I don't receive aid from them) is a $2,750 Direct Unsubsidised Loan. I have applied to several scholarships (need to do more) but have not received any. \n\nI've got the savings right now to pay for this month, but going forward I'll need to potentially take a semester off of school in order to build up savings. I'd love to do college without loans at all, but I'm not sure how feasible that is right now. I'm registered for the Spring semester, and tuition is due very soon so I need to stop hemming and hawing and make a decision.\n\nThanks for your time and (hopefully) advice. :)\n\nEdit: If there is a better flair for this, let me know.",

        "original": "My father (76)  is disabled (2 strokes) and is in pretty poor health overall. He worked for the US Gov't and took a lump sum pension payout. I do not know how much it was, but I don't believe it could have been very much as he had some lapses in his work history. I should also add that he lives across the country from me and I basically have no communication with him; he doesn't answer his phone or respond to emails anymore. He's also an alcoholic.\n\nOver the Holidays, his brother called me to discuss my father's situation. He told me he took out a lump sum payout on his pension, and that I needed to find a way for him to reverse this payout and reinstate a monthly payout instead. He mentioned that taking the lump sum payout diminishes his Gov't medical benefits in some way, and that staying on monthly would allow him better medical coverage through his Gov't issued medical plan.\n\nI told him that I didn't think this was possible, and so far I have not been able to find anything that mentions this as a possibility. Nor have I found anything regarding diminished medical benefits for taking the lump sum payout.\n\nTo be honest, when I last saw my father last Fall, he was in such poor health that I didn't think he would make it to Christmas. But my Uncle says he talks to my father's wife (who doesn't speak any English), and she says he eats 3 meals a day and somehow got a clean bill of health at his last checkup. So perhaps he could live for much longer than I expect, which I guess is why my Uncle thinks a monthly payout is better, especially if there are some added medical coverage benefits as well.\n\nHas anyone here heard of reverting a lump-sum payout?

        "original": "Well, as the title indicates, I am seriously contemplating cashing out my retirement to pay off medical and credit card debt. What I want to cash out is an IRA (I also have a 401k that I opened up when I was promoted last year but it doesn\u2019t have much in it so I would just leave it). This is ALL I have though. I have no other savings, no emergency fund, and I own nothing. I\u2019m in my mid forties and single so I realize I am limited in the time I have to recoup the retirement and that scares me. \n\nFor the record, I am not a financially irresponsible person but I\u2019m not fiscally savvy either. I have faced challenges, after divorce and a foreclosure I was finally getting back on track (debt free) when life threw me side ways leading to the current credit card and medical debt. It\u2019s more than I can handle and the stress of it is overwhelming me. \n\nI\u2019ve looked into some credit relief programs but didn\u2019t qualify for debt consolidation loans and other options make me nervous (like one person I spoke with needed me to default on everything so they could negotiate). Will still consider it if I can find something that works. \n\nOk, some other facts. I have one child going to college this year and one with three years left in HS. I rent (15 months left on lease) as I do not plan to stay in the area we live when my younger son graduates. Without the debt payments I can live within my means, cover all my kids expenses, and continue to contribute to my newly opened 401k. I\u2019ve reduced my \u201cregular\u201d bills and spending all I can. I do not use the credit cards anymore.\n\nWith the IRA I could pay off all my debt, set aside the tax burden, and have a little left over to help my son with his move to college. BUT if heaven forbid life throws me side ways again, I\u2019d have no way to get out of it financially speaking. \n\nThoughts and advice are appreciated!",

Thank You, I'll keep it in mind and work harder towards it.\n\n@Edit3 Trades, IT, Side-jobs (I actually never thought about it but I know some old ladies from neighbourhood that really hate walking their dogs, cha-ching?!) As i mentioned below, I'll definitely give IT a go once my GED is there. I'm also hoping i get promo at McDon's :D\n\n@Edit4\nTHIS REALLY BLEW UP WOW, thanks Reddit! Sooo much to read and I love it.\n\n@Edit5\n\nThe amount of advices and support here is overwhelming. Thank you all. I'm sorry i cannot respond to every single one but I promise I read as much as possible. You're all really amazing and there are so many awesome things i just learned by reading this thread it's mind blowing. I'll hopefully post update on my situation in some time if anyone is interested.\nA lot of people also reached out to me in private messages, offering mental support as well some other advices. This is also the first time i recieved Reddit Silver - thank you! :)\n\nIf anyone is struggling to manage their situation my personal advice would be as #1 priority to cut all unnecessary expenses. If you can save on something, then do it. If you can buy cheaper food (not worse, just cheaper) do it. Also, nowadays there are a lot loyalty programs. If there is this one place where you like to buy a lot, check if they have any Android or IOS apps where you can get discounts. Same goes for internet shopping - always search for cheapest stuff. Consider buying used things (Does not always apply for electronics, be careful with that). Cooking is great because you can control your diet and avoid getting some extra pounds ;) And just like momma said, wear warm clothes when it's cold. Taking days off because your nose is running down like Niagara Falls is never great option. Always keep some money in case of emergency. (You can never know when your Boss is going to have a bad day, untill you learn it first hand)\nGood luck to everyone and be safe!",

I currently work a part-time minimum wage job (15/hr in Los Angeles) for my university and also plan to take another minimum wage job since California law doesn't allow students to work more than 20 hours per week. I figured I could save up 20k by the Fall semester if I continue my ultra-lean budget of eating rice and beans and going to any student events that give out free food lol. \n\nI do side gigs as a Production Assistant when I can and also am occasional script reader that works remotely but I can't count on that as reliable income. On top of all this, I am almost always writing/outline scripts I intend to create/produce myself and even more mainstream script I can sell to a studio. My ultimate goal is to make a living off of making independent/low-budget feature films. \n\nI've tracked several directors who have broke into this industry and most of them got their start making ultra low budget (>50k) indie features or a ton of low budget shorts. I really don't like asking my friends and family for money and don't expect to be handed the reigns to direct (or be paid) anything significant since I'm a relatively unproven director.\n\nThis subreddit has given me great advice to keep me on track with being accountable with my budget, but how do I start investing in my kind of line of work?

Kind of goes like;\n\n\\-Yes, I made money.\n\n\\-No, I'm definitely not married.\n\n\\-Yes, my heart is still beating. \n\nBut I'm preparing for this year using their TaxCaster tax-estimator and there was a question that said \"Enter the total amount of tuition and fees you pay for the year.\". This has me a bit stumped. So the last two semesters I've taken $7,500 in gov't loans (unsubsidized and subsidized) and haven't paid anything on them yet (eek, still enrolled). The next question it asks me is \"Have you paid any interest\" nope. \n\nBut its the first question that has me stuck. So I've technically paid for the tuition and fees for my schooling, however... I really haven't, considering its on loans. Would I mark this box upon the actual tax form as $0, or $7,500? Because it changes my estimation from \\~$500 to \\~$3,000 and that makes me think that I should be putting in $0. However, I've never received a federal refund less than $1,600 so I'm a bit puzzled (yet fully aware this is a calculator and not accurate in ANY regards).

I made around 74k in 2018 and contributed $6,000 that year into a Roth IRA. My job is a commission based sales job, so I had no idea what I would make the next year. Fast forward to 2019..\n\nI ended up exceeding (wayyyy beyond my expectations btw) at this job, became the top sales rep, and made around 170k this year (2019) I was contributing to the same roth IRA, until about August or so, where I learned about the income limit for a roth IRA. I file single, and realized I'd be over the income limit. Remember I am very new to finances, I'm still in my 20s. I immediately panic, and learn about the re-characterization thing. Of course it's way passed the deadline to recharacterize 2018 contributions, but I \\*was\\* able to recharacterize all of 2019.\n\nSo now I have two IRAs. $4,314 in the Roth. This was basically the stuff that was in there from 2018 (stuff that was too late to recharacterize) The second is the regular traditional IRA with $5, 851 in it. This was the money that I contributed in 2019 that I had to recharacterize because of the income limit.\n\nMy question is, what happens next? I know next to nothing about taxes, or retirement accounts. Am I going to get penalized for what I have left over in my roth IRA, since I am over the income limit? Everything just seems so complicated now, and stretched out over different accounts. ARe you allowed to have both a traditional and roth IRA? Please advise what I should do. Thanks!!",

Well, I just got my first job offer as a Software Developer. This offer has made me think about my future and my goals a lot. \n\nSince my wife and I live with my parents our biggest priority is paying off all CC debt (roughly 8k) because I had lost my job that I had while taking classes and then she wasn\u2019t making much since she is only working part time. This is from things like food and other things, like we have two dogs and one recently needed to go to the vet for getting fixed and he also cut his leg open and had to get staples. We had also bought me stuff for school last semester like a laptop so that was a good chunk. I\u2019m not too worried about the CC debt because that\u2019s my first plan of attack before I make any moves on moving out. \n\nBesides the CC debt I have student loans starting in June roughly.  My student loans are estimated at $400/month and I have a car loan as well at $345/month. \n\nAfter all CC is paid of my monthly expenses will look as follows:\n\nAuto Loan: $345\nGeico: $175\nVerizon: $275\nGreat Lakes: $400\n\nTotal would be about $1195/month. My job offer was $62,000 annually, paid semi-monthly. This comes out to $2,583.33 per pay period gross, I estimate at like $2,080 net after taxes. Bringing my total net for the month after taxes $4,160/month. My wife makes about average of $1,000 net after taxes a month working part-time. \n\nTaking away the difference of debts we\u2019re looking at a total of $3,965/month gained. We\u2019ve been talking about renting a house, but in the areas we\u2019ve been looking all the houses are roughly $1,700 to $2,200 and that just seems steep to rent. We want a house because we want space - we have two dogs and we tried the apartment life in college and it just wasn\u2019t for us. \n\nThis leads to my question - do we stay with my parents as long as we can and just go straight into buying a house, say with an FHA loan?\n\nAnother thing I\u2019m struggling with is this \u2014 with me being the primary earner because my wife is finishing her Criminal Justice degree and has 2 to 3 semesters left, I\u2019m worried about moving because what if my job doesn\u2019t work out, we might not have anything to fall back on? \n\nCan anyone help me sort this all out and help me strategize? \n\nThank you!",

The commute for me will be a bit rough but I can take a shuttle to work from the East Bay so it shouldn't be as bad.\n\nTo give some background, we're in our early 30's and I grew up in Southern California (OC) but we just moved here 6 months ago after I graduated from grad school on the East Coast.\n\n* Wife is in finance making $100K. She's looking for a new job and we're hoping she gets a healthy increase to about $120K or so.\n* I'm also in finance making $210K ($30K of which is equity).\n* Our savings were essentially wiped out paying for my grad school (\\~$200K) and wedding.\n* We started saving again after I graduated, and have saved about $80K in the past 6 months. Based on this, we're conservatively estimating that we can save about $8K/month, looking to close around Summer or Fall of this year.\n* We both max our 401K's and contribute to our IRAs. Currently, our combined 401K and IRA accounts is close to $700K.\n* Our taxable brokerage account has about $90K currently.\n* We have a pretty frugal lifestyle and our monthly expenses outside of rent are about $1700 a month.\n* We're renting a 1BR in Milpitas for $3100 a month.\n* We both have cars but hers is currently at my parents' in SoCal since we need to pay for an extra parking spot here.\n* We have zero debt with 800+ credit scores for both.\n* My parents will be helping out with the downpayment. We haven't talked about it too much but I'm fairly confident they'll at least gift us $50-100K. We would borrow the rest of the down payment from my parents.\n\nWe'd highly prefer new construction so the places we've been looking at are about $1.1-1.5M.

However, we both admit that the other community that is $1.3-1.5M is a lot more attractive, also with great schools. One of the houses we have our eye on is about $1.45M.\n\nBased on our info, can we afford to buy these houses at this price point? I've done all the mortgage affordability calculators and it seems like we can with some room, but should we is another question I have. It's hard for me to gauge because Bay Area prices are just so expensive, so normal ground rules that others may mention don't apply as well, such as only spending 25% of take home pay on the house, which is close to impossible here.\n\nCurious to hear what you all think and it'd be great if there are people in the area that could share whether this is doable and how most people here make it work.\n\nThanks!",

        "original": "Hiiiiii. \n\nI am currently 22 living with my mom and sisters in a 2 bedroom apartment on a twin sized air mattress in the living room. I've been here for about a year. I am tired and I'm sure my family is tired of me as well. I am a US Navy veteran living in Houston. Joined straight out of high school, got out in Jan. 2018. Got a quick job at Walmart while I was in school for my EMT Cert., started working as an EMT for a private ambulance company, got a new car and a new apartment with a roommate who was also on the lease. \n\nEverything was pretty good until 3rd months rent came around. My roommate decided that they were not going to pay their half of the rent and I don't think he ever really intended to in retrospect. He also refused to leave the apartment because his name was on the lease and started to become violent and sketchy. Long story short, I asked management what my options were and I ended up leaving. Also got stuck with a $5500 debt. Moved in with my mom shortly after. \n\nI could have paid the rent, I should have just paid the rent and found a way to get him to leave but management made it seem like that just wasn't an option because his name was on the lease. I also paid the total move in fees and I paid up the first 2 months rent by myself, giving my roommate ample time to come up with his half of $600. \n\n  \nFast forward 2020. I am working at a hospital now where I net about $1200-$1300 every other week. My car got totaled on Christmas Day 2019, luckily I had geico and gap coverage. Got a new car on the 31st in my name, car note is $568. Insurance is $291. I also have a job offer from a private Ems company $15 an hour for part time/prn. Will also be back in school Jan 21 and will receive monthly housing allowance of $1100.\n\nI believe I am in a good spot now to move out on my own and give it another shot on my OWN. However I keep getting denied. I applied for an apt. today and was told that I did not have an eviction but rental debt. \n\n  \nPlease. I know it's a long read. I need help. I am asking strangers for help. What are my options here? Do I tough it out at home for what let's say another year? Or keep spending money applying to different complexes? \n\nWould also appreciate advice on tackling my debt. I recently pulled up a credit report and these were the major debts: \n\nRental Debt - $5,548\n\nSprint - $812 (got the phone in bootcamp, literally the day I got to my command was the day the ship was going underway. Zero time to prepare. Zero internet/phone to call and place a hold on account. We were deployed for 3 months, river city. \n\nSpeedy Cash - $1,154 \n\nATT - $303 (cable for previous apartment, did not want to pay for cable for my \"roommate\" to use for free) \n\nToll Road fine - $1,800 (\\*sigh\\*, don't ask, please)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI make $17.54/hr , 84hrs/pay period\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks again in advance..",

        "original": "Hi r/personalfinance,\n\nI am using a throwaway account because there are a handful of people that can identify me due to the unique nature of the situation that I am about to describe. \n\nIt's 3 am, and this nonsense is not letting me sleep. I'm not really sure the best angle to approach it, so I was hoping to recieve some advice from a neutral third party. I've never posted here, but I have seen some of the magic that many of you have worked over the years, and I hope I may be so lucky.\n\nI am 25, and recently began searching for a new apartment that would put me geographically closer to school. Upon learning that my first rental application was denied, I decided to inquire as to why. It turns out there were a number of late payments on my credit report that I was unaware of until a few days ago.\n\nFive years ago, I purchased a (replacement) laptop for college from a corporate electronics retail chain. I, having not established much credit to speak of, decided it would be a smart and savvy idea to  open a credit line through this retailer in order to kill two birds with one stone-- get the computer I needed for school while building a credit history starting at a relatively young age. \n\nThis did not work out as planned. \n\nA mere five months after this purchase took place, I ecountered a health crisis that left me institutionalized. Unable to continue making monthly payments, my amazing and supportive (not sarcasm) mother insisted I not worry about it. It would be taken care of, she said, don't worry. So worry I did not. \n\nWell, this health complication required treatment for quite some time. However, I was assured that I had nothing to worry about as far as my financial debts were concerned. She would make monthly payments and I would worry only about my health. The account was eventually paid off and closed, I paid back my mother, and the account balance remained at $0 until it eventually closed. I resumed my education with renewed vigor, and found myself a straight-A student. All was well, and I soon forgot all about the issue.\n\nWell, until this week, when I decided to obtain my own copy of my credit report to ascertain what in the kentucky fried fuck was this person referring to. Sure enough, there were no fewer than four (4) 30-day late payments listed under various months falling within the timespan of health complication.\n\nI know this makes me the irresponsible party for not taking control of my own finances. I know that many of you will probably say that I am solely to blame for this predicament, and that I am deserving of whatever consequences it may bring, and you would be correct. However, I hope that those reading this will also understand that although it was only five years ago, I was still not much more than an immature kid. I had some difficulties to face, and I was focused on facing them. My mother had never once led me astray, and I had no reason not to trust her while I was doing my best to make it through the issue and trying not to act scared.\n\nThat being said, it doesn't change the fact that I still have these shitty marks on my record. Not only that, but they are still on there for another few years, and I can't wait that long to find a place to live. Admittedly, I'm sort of at a loss for where to even begin handling this problem. I'm not sure who to call, or if there is even a solution to be found at all.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this long post. I would be extremely grateful if anyone could help point me in the right direction. It's been a stressful few days and I appreciate the opportunity to even put this into words.\n\n**TLDR:** Bought a latop on credit with a retailer right before an unexpected health crisis. Mom assured me it would be paid off, but it wasn't done so, and I am now carrying 4 late payments on my credit report while trying to find a place to live.",

We're still quantifying how much equity she has in her buildings, life insurance, retirement accounts, etc. she has, so we're not sure how the math would work on that.

Sorry about formatting - I\u2019m on my phone.\n\nA bit about me first - I am 26 years old, Irish, but currently living in Canada. I have an application in for residency and I\u2019m just biding my time til that comes through (fingers crossed). I have a BA from an Irish university that I never used. I\u2019ve tried many times over the years to apply for jobs, but never had any luck. My degree wasn\u2019t very useful, and to be honest, it was just what I did right after school. I was never overly interested in pursuing it as a career path. It\u2019s been handy recently has its greatly helped me immigrating to Canada. I moved here in April 2018 on a two year work permit, just for some adventure. Here I have a lovely job as a Floral Designer, and I have a second job as a server cos this city is expensive, and floral design isn\u2019t particularly well paid. \n\nOriginally I had planned on moving back to Ireland once my work permit expires (April 2020), but a small spanner has been thrown into my plan - I have fallen in love with living in this Canadian city and I have fallen in love with a Canadian. (Sorry, cheesy). \n\nI don\u2019t make enough money to support the lifestyle I want and I do not want to work two jobs my whole life. \nI have been looking at going back to school to study Interior Design and Architecture. Once (if) I get my residency I can apply as a domestic student and I will qualify for loans. I spoke to admissions today and I\u2019d be looking at $40,000 in loans which I could pay off over 10 years. School admissions advised me that 97% of their graduates get a job immediately after completion and starting pay is around $50,000 for entry lever designers. I know it\u2019s not a crazy amount of money but it\u2019s better then what I\u2019m on now as a senior floral designer, and realistically, I won\u2019t get much more money in this career. \n\n\nWhat I\u2019m asking is, is it worth it? It feels like a huge risk to put myself into so much debt. But I need to change my career path so I can build a better life for myself. Has any one else gone back to school at this age? Any guidance would be so great! I\u2019m feeling very lost right now.\n\nThank you!!",

        "original": "Hello!\n\nI recently got a pay raise that\u2019s resulted in an extra $400 or so a month. I am trying to figure out if we should be saving this money or put it towards debt. Here\u2019s the situation:\n\nRight now, myself and my fianc\u00e9 are both working full-time in social services and have no children. Our finances are already joined and together we make about $48,000 a year after taxes. I am currently working on my masters in social work part-time online. One of the requirements to graduate and get my provisional license is to complete two practicum semesters where I will be working in an agency and not getting paid for roughly one year between the two. These will start in the summer of 2021 and end in spring of 2022.  \n\nWe are also in quite a lot of debt. Between the both of us we owe roughly $50,000 in debt and rising (loans are currently paying for graduate school and are added on each semester). Our monthly minimum payments amount to about $1000 which is usually what my fianc\u00e9 makes on a single paycheck. \n\nMy concern is what happens for that year I am unable to work. My fianc\u00e9 will still retain his job if my placement is local, but will have to find a new job if my placement is not local. His company has a number of locations, however, so even if we are transplanted somewhere else, he will more than likely be able to transfer to a different office. This still leaves us with only one income, however, and working in social services is not the most wonderful income in the world. \n\nWith this extra income, I am not sure if I should be putting it towards debt and hope it lowers our monthly payments enough to be paid by a single income, or to save all of that extra money in an account to supplement our expenses when I am no longer able to work. What would be the better choice here? \n\nIf there is any additional information that\u2019s needed, please let me know.",

I live in an expensive city pay $1050 in rent and groceries/bills are also expensive.  I live a pretty frugal life, a) because I can\u2019t afford not to, and b) I know I have debt/other goals that I haven\u2019t reached yet. I don\u2019t pay for any subscriptions other than Amazon prime ($119 annually). No cable, just internet because it\u2019s important for work. I only eat out twice a week (very cheap places) and very rarely buy coffee or smoothies out unless it\u2019s some kind of special occasion. \n\nAll that being said, I am finding it really hard to figure out how to save money. I have listened to Dave Ramsey and I just don\u2019t think that it works exactly for me or my lifestyle. I find that every time that I am able to save money, there is something that happens where I am forced to lose my savings. So much so that last year, I even went into debt for it (hence the 1700 credit card debt). I feel like my biggest problem is that life stuff happens (mostly health related for me even though I pay for a very expensive health care plan). But sometimes, its just life shit. I also don\u2019t have anyone that I can financially lean on in case something happens unlike a lot of my friends. I find that a lot of my peers my age have parents that are helping them or giving them large or small amounts of money pretty regularly. I am feeling pretty down because it\u2019s like I keep getting the ladder kicked from under my feet (savings wise). \n\nSo I have come to the conclusion that I have to have an emergency fund of at least 6 months and a \u201cshit happens\u201d fund. I calculated that my 6 month fund would have to be at least 18k and I\u2019d like my \u201cshit happens fund\u201d to be at least 10k (would like this to increase to 20k eventually). I also need to save for a down payment for a house, and would like to have at least a little bit of fun. And down the line I\u2019d worry more about retirement but right now I am already contributing 4% to a roth and don\u2019t want to touch that because my employer matches. \n\nMy first goal is to find a higher paying job as I know that I am being significantly under paid at my current job. I haven\u2019t found that job yet, but in the meantime, how do I prioritize? How do people save or know how to save for? Do people really just not have any fun? How are other people making the money I make surviving?! How can people afford kids?? Can anyone tell me how much they spend on their disposable income per month? And how much goes into each savings?

Other than a used car that she isn't healthy enough to drive, this is the extent of her significant assets.\n\nLast year she was in and out of hospitals and is declining. I fear that soon she will need additional care and will no longer be able to live in her house by herself. I also fear the expense that comes with that.\n\nShould she consider investing any of her savings? I know it isn't a lot but maybe it could grow a little? I'm worried that when she needs more medical help she is going to run out of money fast. When she eventually sells her home, what should she do with that money?\n\nAgain thanks in advance for any thoughts.",

The plan is to obtain a degree in business, and use that along with my past experience in retail to leverage a loan so I can open up a convenience store.

Because my stipend comes from a taxable government grant and is not reported on a W-2 form, I wasn't allowed to contribute to an IRA before now. (I suppose I could have done so if I had a \"side hustle,\" but that wasn't possible for my circumstances.)\n\nHowever, as I understand it, the passage of the SECURE Act allows graduate students and postdocs with fellowships to put their money into IRAs starting in the 2020 tax year. ...and now I don't know what to do!\n\nBased on last year's numbers, I estimate that I will save around $7,200 this year. Although I am relatively young (25), I know that it is always good to get a head start on retirement. However, I also plan on trying to buy a house with my partner in the semi-near future (~5-7 years) after I've settled into a \"real job.\"\n\nMy previous plan was to stow away all my savings into a HYSA, some of which would go towards a house down payment or hypothetical expenses from my future children. With this new development, should I just max out my contributions ($6,000 a year)? Would it be bad if, down the line, I withdrew some for a house down payment? I know it's generally seen as blasphemous here to raid a retirement account, but would it be silly to put half my savings aside in a HYSA and half in a retirement account if there aren't any penalties to putting it all in the IRA and withdrawing some if/when the time comes? I guess I'm just struggling with knowing how to allocate my savings! I get a raise every year I'm in my PhD program, so I'd really like to figure this out sooner rather than later!\n\nI only just learned about Roth IRAs, so is there something I am missing? What percentage of my annual savings should I be putting into a Roth versus HYSA? Are there any disadvantages to maxing out the contributions and withdrawing later if need be? Are there any advantages to keeping a large amount in liquid savings and therefore not maxing out my Roth IRA?\n\nPotentially Relevant Information:\n\n* I have no student loans or credit card debt. I also have a sufficient emergency fund.\n\n* I have about 2.5 more years left in my PhD program and then probably at least 2 years in a fellowship that will make about 50k.\n\n* No idea what my ultimate earning potential will be. Based on my career preferences, probably somewhere in the $75-90k range.\n\n* My partner is in the same program as me and is in a similar financial situation.\n\nThanks!",

        "original": "Hi everyone. I'm a 43 year old man in Brooklyn. Married with a combined income of about $400K in 2019. My wife has a steady job (225K), but I'm in the creative field and I can have big ups and down. For example, in 2016 I had a very unexpected low income around $60-70K. Things got back to normal in 2017 + 2018 and I made more like $150K. Then 2019 was great and I probably made well over $200K. With such a good year, I have been able to put away a good chunk of money for an emergency fund just in case a 2016 happens again.\n\nI currently have about $120K sitting in Ally earning 1.6%. I want to be pretty conservative with this money as we don't have any other liquid savings. I think we need to have 50-60K minimum just in case stuff hits the fan - our monthly expenses are around 10-11K . I'm willing to take a bit of risk with the remaining 60K that doesn't comprise absolute emergency fund.\n\nShould I be doing anytime else with this money? Should I create a ladder with CDs (Ally is at 2% for 12mo CD). My financial planner wants me to put that money into a couple more aggressive things. For example, he mentioned a fund (MUAIX) that is ultra low commitment (literally, 1 day) so it could be taken out basically immediately if I should need it and it should earn about 1.8%. He also mentioned some other stuff that had my head spinning. Basically, should I have this money invested in something beyond high yield savings + CDs? I know fees can eat up profits with an advisor, but like I said, I'm a creative and not a finance/numbers person. I need some hand holding and a proactive partner in investing.\n\nHere are more particulars about our situation:\n\n\\- no debt\n\n\\- mortgage/charges are $7500\n\n\\- 7yr old child (public school)\n\n\\- we have life insurance\n\n\\- we have about 450K in IRA (I only recently started being able to contribute to a SEP IRA as I didn't make much money until a few years ago)\n\n\\- no plans for any big changes any time soon. wife's job is stable. no car or home purchases planned. \n\n\\- we both have family that could support us (financially + logistically) if stuff happened\n\n\\- we just opened a NY529 with $10K for our child\n\nI'm hesitant to fully trust any financial advisor, but I've had pretty good dealings with my guy. He currently only manages my SEP IRA and it's been pretty straightforward so far.\n\nThanks!",

I've got roughly 34k in student loans (parents also took out loans to help and I'm in the grace period so I'm not currently paying them back).\n\nI am doing my best to hang in there because I don't want to go from a bad situation to another bad situation, but my parents are pretty unbearable at this point-- the fighting, binge drinking, getting on my case, barging in my room whenever they feel like it (they removed the lock when I was younger). \n\nHowever, despite all their vices, they do care enough about me to let me stay rent-free, use their gas card, use their car insurance, pay my phone bill. Granted, every three days I'm threatened with having to pay for all of that myself, but it still hasn't happened, so... I am extremely fortunate, but at the same time so mentally/emotionally exhausted. My mom made me late to work last week by cornering me in the kitchen when I was about to leave because she felt like I didn't say good morning to her nicely enough. She also got upset (read: drunk) and made me keep my car outside so that I'd have to wake up early to scrape the ice off before work. I could go on and on.\n\nThe point is: I want out. But at the same time, I don't want to drain my savings just because I want out. I have two interviews tomorrow (1 phone, 1 in-person). Ofc they didn't tell me how much they pay, but I'm really looking forward to finally landing a salary job. \n\nTLDR: I guess my question is, once I do start learning a salary, how will I know when it's the right time to move out?

From what I\u2019ve learned, this is the best approach to investing if you want to automate your investing approach and not pay high fees. Is there a better option to pursue without getting a financial advisor involved?\n\nThird - we currently have $300k in investments. If I am assuming an average 8% return over the next 12 years coupled with $100k in savings each year, am I wrong in assuming we could have potentially $2.8M in our portfolio? I built my own calculation in excel and am just curious if I\u2019m on the right track. Also, is an assumption of 8% return too aggressive with the current state of the S&P 500?\n\nReally appreciate any and all help/suggestions. Thanks!",

Many teacher friends of mine have told me I have to substitute to increase my chances of getting recognized/hired over the piles of resumes schools get every year. \n\nI'm attempting to do this but the pay is shit ($9-$10 an hour depending on the position for the day). We are capped at 120 hours (16 full school days) a month. We are also not gauranted a job every day. I can usually get to the 120 hours without the garuantee of a job every day because of the limit. \n\nI've looked for part time jobs to help supplement the income like food work but they want me to be able to work all 7 dayas of the week, at any hours they need me for $7.25-8.00 an hour. Working these jobs I feel would actually hurt my income as I'll be making less money during the school days/hours they would need me to work at. I've tried talking about my avaibablity and no one is wanting to work with it so far. \n\nI'm hoping that subbing until the summer will help me land a position for next school year but there are no guarantees. \n\nI really don't know what to do. We can cover our bills but not our food. We try to stick to $100 a week which isn't much where we live so sometimes it doesn't happen that way. We realistically can only afford $75 a week or less but that's almost imposible unless our meals consist of only rice and ramen noodles. My husband works a physically demanding job so he has to have a good bit of protein and a healthy diet. \nHis income is tied up into everything as well and he doesn't have any to spare either. We have about 5,000 in credit card debt combined aside from our student loans (he owes 5,000). He also owes on his car but I'm not exactly sure the dollar amount at this moment. \n\nI'm about to have to find a full time job elsewhere to make enough money but I feel it will hurt me in the long run with reducing my chances to get a teaching job. Even though they say there is a teacher shortage I never got ONE interview for a school even though I meet the certification requirements and did very well in school (3.8 GPA at graduation). \n\nI'm not very artistic or crafty so I can't sell things like that on the side for extra income. I'm very depressed over all this financial trouble. I really do not know what would be best for my future. If this subbing helps lead me to a teaching position I'll get a very nice pay raise from where I'm at now and anywhere retail that I could work.\n\nMy car is starting to have issues and it's coming close to the end of it's life as well.

I have been doing electrical engineering this semester which I absolutely love but when I get out I will only have an associates degree. I'll have some certificates along with it but I know that an associates degree in electrical engineering doesn't look that impressive compared to a bachelors so I was wondering if I should sink another two year in university to get a bachelors degree.

I currently have $11,000 in debt because I have been sinking every penny into paying off my debt as I have been going through school. Would tacking on a minimum of $30,000+ really offset a pay difference in the work force for electrical engineering?

I think I do OK at the bare minimum, but I know there is a lot more I can be doing. I am 29, and married. The following are my facts:\n\nSalary: $125k + Annual Bonus (most likely between $10k - $30k, but I consider this irrelevant for planning purposes)\n\nMortgage balance: $225k (thinking about refinancing, house value is approx. $300k, and also possibly relocating nearby but don't want to overstretch myself.)\n\n401k: $9.5k balance, 5% current deferral (I know I need to increase, not sure how much, but previously I shifted a little more cash into the purchase and maintenance of the house because it was important to me to have a house. At 5% I get all the match available to me.)\n\nChecking Account: ~$23k. I initially left a high balance as I was doing a fair number of mandatory projects to the house (well pump died, large tree removal, etc...), but the balance has crept up higher than I need it to be and it is earning no interest. Suggestions would be great.\n\nI do not have any car payments, but I know I'll need to purchase my wife a car in 1-2 years most likely (likely something used and simple). I drive a 2012 Accord that should last me several more years with minimal yearly maintenance.\n\nI do not have any student loans, and I pay off my credit card monthly. I pay around $4k annually in insurance for my house, life, and 3 vehicles (two cars and one motorcycle). My wife and I eat out once per week which I am sure we could cut back on, and we don't take extravagant vacations although we'd love to travel more. My wife does not work outside a minimal part time job which she earns less than $3k annually (more like helping someone out), and she is planning to start a small etsy-style side business. I won't go into why she doesn't have a full time job, but needless to say it is related to health reasons.\n\nWe live in Massachusetts.\n\nAs I mentioned, I know I am positioned reasonably well, but I also know there is A LOT more I could be doing.

I do have a small state employee  defined contribution plan as an adjunct professor for one school where each party contributes 7.5%.

I see Vanguard has a bunch. Are there yearly limits here? Are there specific ones that we can set and forget? I see VTSAX bandied about a bunch of places.\n4. Some other option?

I know exactly what degree I'd love to get (Bachelor's or Master's in Ecology), but I'm a bit concerned about the viability of it, and the overall cost.

        "original": "Quick backstory: I made a lot of poor choices in the past decade that amounted to a large amount of credit card debt (~$20,000). This is nearly half of my gross yearly salary, and certainly a lot more than half of my take home pay.\n\nI live in a cheap city, in a 'bad' (i.e. cheap) neighborhood, and don't have lavish tastes or habits. However, nearly 100% of what I bring in goes right back out immediately to contend with high interest credit cards and, of course, necessary expenses (rent, utilities, medical expenses, food, etc.).\n\nI do manage to have a social life, but that's only because my boyfriend funds it. Anything that I get to enjoy outside of the basics is because of his generosity. In fact, I had him sit down and look at my bank account with me and asked, \"Am I delusional? Look at these charges - This is not the bank account of a frivolous and excessive person, right?\" He agreed it was not.\n\nThe one big expense I have currently is my car, which I bought new last year with a fair amount of help from my father. I know I know I know - Sell your car and get a junker. The thing with that is that I know it would damage my relationship with my dad severely and I'm not willing to do that.\n\nI've talked briefly with my family's financial advisor, who is new to us because our former advisor unfortunately passed away. He preached the Dave Ramsey school of thought to me, which does make sense... for someone who has anything more than a few bucks extra to set aside. Last month my boyfriend emergency Venmoed me $20 at the end of the month because my diabetic cat's automatic Rx shipment (no I am not getting rid of my cat; I've had him for 12+ years and he's family) overdrew my bank account.\n\nSo I have a somewhere around $30,000 set aside for retirement in various funds that have been growing since I was young (thank you, parents). I am highly considering removing this soul crushing albatross from my neck by paying the associated penalties and taking out a portion of that money to nearly eliminate my debt.\n\nI'm 36, boyfriend is 37. We are not having kids. No we're not changing our minds. I'm an only child, he has one sister. Both of our parents have their own financial lives in order and have shared with us (independently, it was just kind of coincidental) that when they're gone, we're going to be just fine. \n\nOn top of that, I do have a decent job. I'm looking for an even better one at the moment because I can't keep living like this, and a raise in my current role is out of the question (another story, but it's a no-go). If I were to eliminate the huge chunk of my paycheck that goes to credit cards that aren't even in use anymore, I would have the ability to actually save and start investing some of my own money. I could get out of my shitty apartment, stop taking handouts, and not have panic attacks about flat tires and cat insulin.\n\nI'd like to hear what people think about this option. I know it's not what most would advise. But I am stuck, I'm not that young, and I have no desire to struggle for another decade because of past mistakes when a way to transcend that is literally just sitting in some coffer somewhere.\n\nOne quick other note about why this idea appeals to me specifically: I was in a horrific car accident last year and I'm lucky I survived. I'm alive now, and I want to actually feel that way and enjoy it. Now(-ish), not years from now.\n\nGiven these circumstances, what are your thoughts on using \"future money\" in the present?",

While the job was a hell of a raise and has been a blessing, we're by no means rolling in the dough yet.\n\nFast forward to earlier this week. I get a random call on my work phone from a gal with Merril Lynch wanting to talk to me about financial planning stuff. She's going to be at my company at the end of the month and would like to set up a time with me. I figure it can't hurt to hear what they offer and have to say, so I say sure. We talk about goals my husband and I have for the future which includes paying down debts, buying a house, and some more vacations. We start talking about days and times. Before she finalized the appointment, she said they want to be respectful of *my* time, so do I fall into one of these categories? Over 55 and nearing retirement or if I will be bringing more than $250k in funds? Nope. Neither. \n\nShe couldn't hang up the phone fast enough.

Currently, no 401K for my husband as he just started his job.\n\nRoth IRA - I have an account but only like $15 in it\n\nSavings - about $20. Better than a year ago when we had nothing. I have a couple of regular savings accounts and a reverse tier savings through my credit union.\n\nDebts - I have about $100k in student loans, $18k on a car loan, about $3k in credit card debt between the two of us, and about $4500 in back child support for him.\n\nI do get a bonus. It depends on how I do with my goals, but it averages around 10% of my salary. \n\nWe're working on paying down the debts slowly but surely.

I'm not from the US, so 8 years of savings at a high-paying job in my country were barely enough to pay for the accommodation, tuition, and spending.\n\nBut I did fairly well and landed a good job in the Bay area. Now as I was inexperienced, and living here is expensive AF, I barely saved much. Right now I've got $30k USD to my name.\n\nHowever, instead of pursuing higher-paying jobs, I've landed gigs as an online course consultant, as well as doing some small jobs for several startups.\n\nIt is paying well! The courses pay in Royalty and upfront advances. Right now, after releasing 3 courses in the last 6 months, I'm making well over $10k USD a month. Add that to some other on-going jobs at startups I'm definitely raking in close to 15k a month (but haven't gotten paid for most of these, they're paid 25% upfront and 50% on completion with 25% at full handover). But a lot of this money is expected in Feb/Mar. \n\nAnyway, I want to spend the next few months doing this before returning to the workforce.\n\nI want to save up to 100k and create a fully passive royalty based income with a couple of books I'm authoring. My aim is 15-20k USD a month in royalties by July.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, because I've lived in a shithole most of my life, I want to finally enjoy life a bit.

They landed a good job in the Bay Area but due to inexperience and the high cost of living, they barely saved. They have $30k USD to their name. They are now working as an online course consultant and doing jobs for startups, making over $10k USD a month, with expectations of $15k soon. They plan to save up to $100k and create passive income with royalties from books they are authoring. They are aiming for $15-20k USD a month in royalties by July. They have lived in poor conditions most of their life and want to enjoy living in a $4k/month apartment in the Bay Area and buy a BMW Z4. Friends think they should continue living in a shared apartment for $1.2k/month and drive their old Kia. They have no loans other than minor credit card debt and expect to earn at least $100k/yr by Aug/Sept. They believe their friends may be jealous as they are struggling financially despite being in the same field.

The year is almost up and she has to decide: rent or buy?\n\nHer monthly from SS is $2,500. She has $10k remaining on the card, but is floating that to keep her liquid assets until she makes this decision. She has $80,000 in the bank. Her rent is too much ($2,000), but she wants to buy a home that\u2019s $300,000 (I can\u2019t convince her to look at houses for less) and use $60k down to lower the payment and avoid PMI.\n\nI like the idea of her buying simply because if she runs out of money she will have the equity rather than some landlord, but there\u2019s something to be said about not eliminating that lump sum of liquidity.

        "original": "Hello all,\n\nSo this week I found out I have an $8000+ and a $100+ bill in collections.  Man all I can say, is I wish I had known. Very startling to find out you owe $8000 out of the blue.  So these are from college, I apparently didn't have loans to cover my last year of college which I vaguely remember being an issue but I think that I thought I just wouldn't get them for the following semesters but that I was covered for that one. It's all a haze... not a good time in my life. But for two years I've been entirely unaware that I've owed anything. Anyway, I stupidly told her more facts about my life than I should have, in order for her to give me some repayment options. Now I don't know where she pulled these numbers from, because they're actually kind of hilarious considering I told her about my situation. I was laid off  a couple of months ago, so my savings are gone and I only recently started getting paid from my new job. I told her all I had in the bank was $100, and I pay around $800 in rent/bills every month and I have a credit card with a limit of $500 that I owe $90 on currently, my student loans are currently in forbearance because I was laid off, but I generally pay around $43/ month. Her options were for me to make an initial payment of $4000+ and monthly payment of $69,  or make an initial payment of $3000- and monthly payment of $116, or make an initial payment of $2000+ and monthly payment of $172. I basically told her I would have a hard time getting an initial payment in the thousands...she said to ask my family...lol I'm the one my family comes to for money. I later called her to further talk about my options telling her family wasn't an option, she then put me on hold to talk to her management team to discuss some other options, she then said I could make an initial payment of $800 and pay $200 monthly, I then told her I had been laid off and the money just wasn't coming in and she knew what I had in the bank so It would still take me at least a month or two to come up with $800 she then suggested I take out a loan... why would I take out money that I'd then owe someone else just to pay you?  So some info I probably shouldn't have given her was where I bank and where I work, but if she calls the bank even if they could tell her how much I have she'd still find out I was correct, and I would like to prevent her calling my work so from what I've gather I can tell her not to contact me via phone and request only written communication. \n\nSome things about me.  I'm 22, I pay all of my bills on time and I'm really big on living in my means, building my savings and having good credit so this whole things just seems a little overwhelming and devastating to me. I thought that i'd be able to build myself back up after the lay off, but this hit me like a ton of bricks. I currently make $15/ hour full time, rent is around $450, utilities (now that it's winter) are around $150, usually around $60, phone bill is around $119, student loans $43 although I want to start paying more than required, I usually keep my credit card bill less than $50, around $100-$200 or transportation, and aim to put $100 in savings each month. I don't own a car or have property.No frills or thrills, but I do typically have money that I just end up wasting which is why I want to start paying more on my loans and adding more to my savings, and living a higher quality of life (including getting a car )and it's terrifying that I may not be able to do that because this past life time has been a struggle and I've worked so hard for my peace of mind for it to all just be abruptly  altered. As I said I just started working again and I haven't even gotten a full paycheck yet, I make $15/hour but some time this year I'm expecting to get promoted and make an actual salary, although I'm not sure how much. So currently I can't pay any lump some but am willing to pay installments of between $100-$200, not sure what she'll say to that, but she said if I didn't contact her with info on the possible loan, she would move on with procedure, whatever that means. My thinking is that even if she sues me and she can garnish my wages she'll only get 25%, which isn't significant for her and still no high initial payment.  So my plan is to first ask for a verification of debt, then negotiate some more if she doesn't budge, i'm going to request written communication only, and send a written offer. Should I immediately offer to pay in small installments or wait until I've saved a few thousand and ask if we can settle? Also this doesn't seem to be pulling my credit down yet, but I assume that it will.\n\nCan anyone offer any insight on what I can do? Or how I should alter my finances to make this a better situation?",

I am here to ask for advice on improving my dysfunctional financial habits, for the longterm...\n\nGrowing up shielded from major money concerns, and receiving more on demand, I can\u2019t seem to allow myself to feel realistic value about money. I tend to overspend, and not appreciate the limited money I have. \n\nWe never talked about money growing up - my parents always said there is enough for me, and I shouldn\u2019t worry about it. At the same time, I see my parents overworking themselves to sustain our standard of living, and I feel like my studying in a higher-income country definitely feeds into that. \n\nI receive a liveable amount to support me during my study, my rent and tuition is paid for by my parents, in addition to a monthly spending allowance. On top of that, I began to receive a generous scholarship, that my parents insisted I keep to myself, rather than reducing their support. \n\nSo, for the past two years, I\u2019ve been living with a bigger income than ever, yet somehow failed to save up any money. This has made me very concerned about the future - if I cannot put aside any money in this living arrangement, how will I do so after graduation, when my expenses will be much bigger compared to my earnings?\n\nAt the same time, I can\u2019t bear the thought of being without money. And admittedly, I am growing increasingly anxious about my future financial independence in 1-2 years, when my scholarship expires and my parents cease to support me.\n\nI desperately wish to become independent, as my parents will soon retire, and give back to them in some way, at least by standing on my own two feet, finance-wise. I don\u2019t wish to burden them. \n\nI suppose this anxiety comes from the fact that I never had a job myself, working service jobs has also been looked down upon in my family.  I\u2019ve only completed some well-paid gigs, after being approached/offered by friends or relatives (graphic design). Whenever I would run out of my monthly allowance, I could ask my mom for some extra cash, thus never really having to think about the real value of money. She\u2019s always been the bread-winner, while my dad has an absolute aversion to money, and doesn\u2019t have much. \n\nIn addition, I would spend hundreds of dollars every month on credit card purchases of books, clothes, or random things from Amazon, that I don\u2019t desperately need. Instead of putting the money aside into a savings account. \n\nI have decided to start 2020 on a different note. I removed my credit card from all auto-save places, and replaced it with a separate MasterCard, on which I will only transfer enough money to pay for my monthly subscriptions (Spotify, Cloud storage.). \n\nI definitely have an unrealistic relationship with money, and what it means to spend it, or save it. I am very open, and grateful, for any tips on how to remedy my relationship with money, live more frugally, and learn the real value of it... With the ultimate goal of saving up for an emergency fund, increasing my financial independence, and splurging much less impulsively and regularly. It would probably reduce my future financial anxiety from 8/10 to 2/10, haha. \n\nHave you recovered from a dysfunctional relationship with money? What helped change your ways, and optics? How did you manage to stick to a budgeting routine consistently, rather than only when money was a direct worry?\n\nTL;DR: Over-spoiled by parent, never adopted a healthy, non-dependent relationship with earning / spending money.

Everyday I\u2019m commuting 36 miles each way all the way to East Dundee, IL which puts a lot of wear and tear on my car and takes a lot of time out of my already crazy busy day going to both work and school now nearly full time and I am beginning to despise the micromanagement, BS, and overall crap at my job on a day to day basis. Sales just really isn\u2019t for me for an introvert that has decided to go into Software Development, but I do realize it is a good skill to have for later in life. \n\nMy absolute passion in life and way of staying sane with my schedule is traveling the world. My work after nearly 5 years still only gives me 2 weeks, plus the standard holidays off each year which kills my travel plans. Last year they let me take 2 weeks off at once to go to Bangkok and Tokyo, but now they are giving me crap about taking 2 weeks over Memorial Day weekend to go to Asia again because it's going to be hard to have someone to be able to cover my accounts. (my bosses will literally need to be out in the field handling all of my accounts in addition to their busy days when I am gone)This is the situation that is absolutely pushing me towards the idea of saying screw this job because I feel like I am not being valued well as an employee and they\u2019re taking my hard work for granted. \n\nI currently make about $47,000 a year at my job and work about 46-49 hours a week Monday-Friday not a great wage by any means, but not bad at all for someone in my position. Even though I live with my dad, I still need to pay for all of my own food, bills, travel, etc., but he does not currently make me pay rent. I have about $18,000 saved and planned to keep saving a lot more at this job this year if I were to stay. I  need to pay $80 a month for car insurance, $350 on my car note for my 3 year lease that has 2 years left, and $120 a month for my phone bill, and all other misc. expenses. I really like my car, it\u2019s a 2013 Honda Accord that is very reliable. I owe about $8500 more on it. \n\nI intend to attend DePaul University totally full time in September in order to remain eligible for as much financial aid and scholarships as possible and to graduate college as debt free as possible, but they do offer night and online classes if I wanted to continue working during the day. \n\nIdeally, I want to try and be Software/Web developer internship ready by the end of this year hopefully, and I really hate the idea of living off of my hard earned savings and quitting this job with nothing else lined up even though I am on a good path to continue with my studies. \n\nI am really just trying to find the next best option/path for myself where I will not be financially ruined and where I can focus on my studies while maintaining good grades and being happy at the same time. \n\nCheers Everyone! I look forward to hearing your advice.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you have any other questions for me. \n\nBest Regards,",

He was in the hospital for a few days but is all healed up and fine now. All his medical bills were taken care of through Medicaid and Medicare.

Me and my wife do ok and are in a good spot so they brought the check to me to handle what goes on with it. How can I save this or invest it for him to make it last as long as possible?

First off thank you to everyone who took the time to comment with advice on this matter. The internet and Reddit can be such a positive tool for helping. The advice I received on here led me to do a ton of more research into the specific suggestions. I also reached out to talk to his county provided SSA which is basically an advocate supplied to him by the county. I also touched base with the insurance company to make sure that all Medicaid and Medicare liens had been satisfied. And I have an appointment set up with an estate lawyer that has experience with Special Needs Trusts. I feel this may be the best option for us, and I will discuss all of this with the lawyer including taking care of end of life expenses for him. I tried my best to respond to as many comments as possible, but it started to get a little overwhelming to try and keep up. Once everything is set up I will probably come back and either update this post again or, make a new post and link this one.",

We currently pull over $250k/year + bonuses in compensation.\n\nWe have a kid that will be starting school next year (+3 other kids starting in the next few years) and have known we will move due to the poor school performance around us.  We have been focusing on finding an area with good schools and low cost of living so that we can build our savings and retirement.   We think we have identified an area in the southeast that fits what we want.  \n\nI have been looking at real estate websites.  It clicked with me that we don't need a huge house.  Our mortgage is our most expensive bill.  Then I started thinking about manufactured homes.  Would it be crazy to purchase a manufactured home?  I know they depreciate.  However, we could buy it outright (no mortgage payment).  The only debt we would have is our car payments which should be paid in full on the next few years.  We keep cars long-term, so should not have car payments for years after it is paid.  \n\nIs there something I am missing from the financial angle here?  Perhaps we buy a few acres (no HOA fees) and place a manufactured home there for 10 years, and then build a house on the land.\n\nI didn't start my career until early 30's.

        "original": "My wife and I have been having a debate about this situation for a few months now, so I've come here for some unemotional 3rd party advice. \n\nWe live in central Florida and we purchased our home in 2012 as a short sale for $165,000. We currently owe $123,000, fixed 30 year rate of 3.7%. \n\nAs of today, going off of comps in our neighborhood based on homes exactly like ours, others are now selling between $300-$320k. Our home has also been updated and well maintained; we've replaced the roof and the AC in 2019, as well as added a filtration system. We've invested around $44k on all of the updates and interior renovations. \n\nHere's the debate, as we are thinking about moving into a larger home as we are expecting our 2nd baby early this year. \n\nScenario #1 - we keep the home and rent it. It's in a very desirable neighborhood surrounded by high rated schools and other homes in the neighborhood are renting to the tune of $1,900-$2,100/mo. Our mortgage is right at $1,000 month, so presumably we would be pocketing $1k/mo in passive income. Capital expenditures should be minimal as most expensive updates to the home have been done. \n\nScenario #2 - we take the money and run. If we were able to sell (let's split the difference) for $310,000, we would walk with roughly $187,000 after paying the bank. There would be a capital gains tax as well as brokerage fees paid so let's say we see about 70% of that money after the dust settles and walk with $130,000 in our pockets.\n\nBackground on us right now is we are not hurting for cash. Our combined W2's for 2019 were $309,000, and we've been averaging between $300-$325k annually for about the last 6 years. We do work in sales so our jobs can be volatile so we're conservative with how we spend. My wife has been in her position for 10 years and I have been in mine for 5 years, but my previous position was for 7 years. \n\nCurrently we have around $200k in local savings accessible and another $162k in a liquid mutual fund, as well as our own 401ks we've been contributing to for over a decade, what's in those is irrelevant to the situation. We have no debt outside of our mortgage. We love the idea of diversifying and having some of our money in real estate. We may even still invest in real estate property away from this home which is why we've been keeping so much money liquid as we decide what the next moves are. We have a lot of money tied up in the markets that we'll never touch until it's time to cash out. \n\nDo we collect our $1k/mo rental income and have a back up home and something we can even sell down the road, or do we pocket the $130k or so that would take roughly a decade to accumulate renting this place? Not to mention we could park that profit into the index fund that has been averaging 10%ish/year since we started it. I see the appeal on both sides, but we would appreciate some advice. \n\nThanks!",

I have included a breakdown below of my normal costs:\n\nRent - $300/month (split with SO)\n\nUtilities - $200/month\n\nStudent loan - $155/month\n\nGroceries - $500/month\n\nOther costs (gas money, eating out, etc.) - $100/month\n\n**Total monthly costs - $1,255**\n\nSo, with all of this out of the way I am left with $1,145 every month. From when I started working I have put some of this extra money into savings and have built up a nice chunk of savings, around $5,000, that will be used exclusively for emergencies. With all this being said, I still have some money set aside for fun spending every month. I have been saving this up as well for some of the items I have on my wishlist and, even though I have the money to buy things that I would like, I can never bring myself to do so. I always think, \"What would happen if there was a huge emergency and you didn't have enough money to pay for it?\" Along with this, my parents have always been big savers and have instilled a frugal mindset in me from a young age. I feel a large amount of guilt from wanting things that I don't NEED, but I really would enjoy having. For example, when getting some new earbuds for the gym, I went to the store on three separate occasions before finally convincing myself that I should make the purchase. I use this item every single day, but it hurt when I finally went up to the counter to purchase them. \n\nI realize this is a first-world problem, but it is something that has been bothering me for some time.

The company I work for has differential pay for 1st and 2nd shift, 1st gets $12/hr and 2nd gets $13. So I'm already making more than other people, even though I'm now on 1st shift.

Also: not trolling. This is a genuine source of stress for me because most of my career was focused on digging out of student loan debt, and then building a life. I always knew what to do next, but I kind of don't anymore.\n\nThings I don't need or want to do because I've already done them:\n\n\\- My spouse and I's 401K and 403b's are maxed, and have been for years. As a teacher, she also has a pension that plays no part in our retirement plans.\n\n\\- Contributing $20K/yr towards my daughter's 529. We'd front-load faster, but we think there's a recession coming, so buying over a longer time horizon is more prudent. We also know when we're going to stop funding it and let it ride.\n\n\\- Travel is funded as a budget line item: $900/mo. We explicitly value experiences over things, so we tend to travel a lot. (Or we did before we had a kid, but she's finally getting old enough to travel on more than short road trips to visit family.)\n\n\\- We donate multiple hundreds a month to causes we care about. Don't really want to give more. Sometimes we give one-offs to GFMs.\n\n\\- We have 20% equity in our house, and our mortgage is at 2.85%. We overpay by about 40%, which will shave about 15 years off the repayment schedule but is technically a bad use of money because market returns are really good right now. Nonetheless, we do want to be done with it early because age discrimination is a thing in my field.\n\n\\- Not really interested in playing the FIRE game. FI, sure. That's inevitable anyway based on current trajectory. I like working, and so does my wife.\n\n\\- We both believe that tomorrow isn't promised. There's a balance for planning for the future and living for today, and we're happy with what we're doing in the \"planning for the future\" department. Squirreling more money away that's locked up until some arbitrary age isn't all that appealing.\n\nSo that brings us to the present.\n\nWe \\*already\\* average $3-5K/mo left over after we've paid ourselves and our bills. Our current heuristic is that I get half of the leftovers to spend, and the rest goes towards whatever the current family priority is. (More on that in a sec.) My wife just doesn't spend money because there's nothing she wants, but she knows she's welcome to any time. Once in a while, she buys something. But for her, a splurge is new running shoes. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nThe current family priority is either putting an addition on the current house, or moving to a new house. We need to talk to some GCs before we have a better sense. Either of those outcomes is fine.\n\nI happen to know that I'm on track for yet another promotion which should give us another $5K/mo on average. That leaves us with... call it $8-10K/mo left over. I don't know what to do with that money. Having a $4K/mo allowance seems fucking crazy so I probably won't continue with the 50-50 split for very long. (I'm on the waiting list for an RS6, if you're curious. I like cars.)\n\nFor the family priority, we want something lower risk. Should we do that in a muni bond fund or something like that? (Sticking $75-200K in a savings account seems like a bad use of money because it's losing value to inflation even in \"high interest\" savings accounts.)\n\nOnce the build-v-buy thing is done, do we just starting putting money into normal, non-tax-advantaged index funds?\n\nWe saw a fee-only advisor this past summer. She told us she didn't have any advice for us, because we were already doing everything right. She was the one who suggested the 50-50 split that's currently in effect, which I thought was a nifty idea. I just think we've grown beyond that already.",

Plus, my commute would go up 60-90 min, and it would effectively isolate me from friends/family/partner.\n\n$6500 take home - $2000 essentials - $2600 for minimum monthly loan payments = $1900 leftover for fun money and paying down debts faster.\n\nNo other debts/obligations. $10K in checking. No savings. Retirement has $310k ($120k Roth IRA, $170k Traditional 401k, $20k Roth 401k). I'd estimate $60K of that is Roth contributions that are over 5 years old.\n\nExpected to get a bonus in March of $3k (after taxes), and $2k-3k in state/federal tax returns around the same time.\n\nCredit score is \\~650. It was 780 until recently - the loans went 90 days without being paid (that's when the banks reached out to me and let me know that I was months behind, and I had to use half of my emergency fund to catch up on the missing payments + late fees). One of my credit cards has a feature where it estimates your credit score, and it says I'm at 650 now.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nCan I refinance this much in auto loans to get a better interest rate? Will my updated credit score screw me? Should (can) I roll them into a personal loan? Should use retirement funds to pay principal down? Finally, should I take out just the estimated $60k that's penalty-free or should I take out more than that?\n\nThank you lovely redditors, I'm struggling to accept with the fallout of all of this (massive debt, failing to realize how dumb cosigning loans is, basically losing relationships with family members over this), and I am extremely grateful for your advice on how to start fixing things :)",

My brief research into them suggests they focus more on investing money or at least serving clients that are a little more robust, or is that not entirely correct? I think bankruptcy might be another option, but my dad expressed disinterest in that since he filed when he was much younger after a divorce.\n\nTheir situation is plaguing my mind with worry, and I would appreciate any advice on the correct resources they should be reaching out to. Happy to provide more details if necessary, and apologies if I didn't do enough research. I'm just not sure where to start.\n\nEdit: I should have also mentioned that they just drained the last of their savings in order to make a major repair on their car, which I think prompted the whole discussion.

Three kids 4 and under, wife has had two surgeries in the past year, and I have been self employed for the past 18 months in order to be able to help take care of everything. We have a fair bit of debt accumulated and want to work towards paying it off. \n\nDebt:\n~ 11k in credit card debt\n~ 5k in a debt consolidation loan\n~ 25k in debt between 2 vehicles (20k & 5k)\n\nI am starting a regular job this week in addition to my self-employment. Take home pay from the job is estimated to be $470/week (15.60/hr x40 hours and taking out 25% for taxes and other deductions) and I can still make at least $250/week from self employment. Realistically it should be closer to $500/week, but I\u2019m budgeting low on that just in case. So roughly $2,900 coming in a month. I\u2019ll also be receiving a .50/hr raise after both 3 and 6 months\n\nI have gone through and totaled up all my expenses (car payments, insurance, utilities, groceries, and minimum payments on all cards/loans) and come to total expenses of about $2,300.  \n\nThe plan is to have everything paid off with the exception of one vehicle by the end of the year. To get it started, we have about $1000 in savings we plan on leaving there and hitting the debt hard with everything else we have in an avalanche method. A big help will be a 6k+ tax refund in a couple months.\n\nOnce that is done, the plan is to save aggressively, refinance the remaining car loan to get a better rate (upper single digits at the moment), build up a 6 month emergency fund and save for a down payment on a house. That is set for around 2 1/2 years from now. \n\nAny tips or tricks that I may be missing?",

        "original": "At 33 years old, I have worked for the government for the past 10 years. My family and I are considering a move to a new city. Through my government work I have made many contacts at this new city, one of which has offered me a job. I am having trouble quantifying not only the cost of living difference but all the compensation my current job offers compared to what the new job offers. I was hoping that anyone from either side of this could provide their input/suggestions.\n\nI am still trying to get numbers for the new position, but so far the comparison looks like the following:\n\nBenefit | Govt | Cont\n:--:|:--:|:--:\nPay|$100,000^1|$160,000^2\nHealth Insurance | $191 / biweekly paycheck | unknown\nDental Insurance | $33.11/ biweekly paycheck | unknown\nRetirement matching | 5% | 3%\nPaid time off | 20 days / year | None\nPaid Federal Holidays off | 10 days / year | None\nSick Paid time off | 13 days / year| None\n\n^1 : Low Cost of Living area\n\n^2 : High Cost of Living area\n\nThe hardest thing I am having trouble comparing, and probably the most important is the pension that the government offers. The details of it can be found [here](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/computation/), but basically it boils down to the following equation:\n\nX * Y * Z\n\nX: The average of your three highest salaries. For example, if I worked for 4 years and got 70k, 80k, 90k, and 100k then this number would be 90k (average of 80k, 90k and 100k).\n\nY: .01 (1%) if under age 62 or age 62 with less than 20 years of service. .011 (1.1%) if age 62 with at least 20 years of service.\n\nZ: Years of service\n\nIf my high 3 average was ~90k, and I only served 10 years, then this number would look like $9000 / year. That is a rough value of what its currently worth for me. If I worked here for 30 years, high 3 average was $120k then this number would look like 30 * $120,000 * .011 = $39,600 / year. So how do I quantify the opportunity cost of that pension?\n\nThe other potential thing that I am having trouble quantifying is the fact that if I work at least 5 years before retirement with the government, they will continue to cover their cost of the health insurance after retirement.\n\nThanks",

        "original": "In-laws are in their mid-60s, 50k/yr income. MIL just quit working and FIL has at best five years left but works manual labor and at his age is one small slip away from being forced out of a job. They have about 250k in debt including the mortgage (220) and credit cards (30). They have zero savings for retirement and are planning on living off social security and Medicare. They live in a beach town in a three-story house with the bottom floor being a totally separate rent-able apartment. The whole property is worth about a million. The plan all along was to sell the house and use that for retirement but now they\u2019re balking at that.\n\n**What makes sense to me:**\n\nSell the house. They have had cash offers for over 900k. Pay off the debt, move a bit further inland and rent or buy something smaller and live off the interest on the remainder of the cash plus social security.\n\n**What they are proposing:**\n\nGet a variance and sell the apartment to the kids. This has already been looked at by a lawyer and it\u2019s definitely possible. This will cost about 15-20K with lawyers, government fees, etc. So their plan is to sell the apartment to four of the five kids for 300,000 (fair market value), and pay off all debt including the mortgage. (One of the kids is in no financial position to buy so they\u2019re not going to be part of it.) The parents will continue living upstairs free and clear as the owner of that part of the house. They would continue to live off FIL\u2019s income and save as much as they can. The apartment can bring in 1200-1500 a week for nine weeks in the summer and will net about 1000/mo as a winter rental (Oct-April) but that\u2019s pretty hit or miss so that\u2019s not a guarantee. Both sisters (my wife included) are fully on board with this because the parents get to stay and the kids still get their beach house in the summer. Emotions, nostalgia, etc are all really hard at play here.\n\nI think that\u2019s a not a great idea for a lot of reasons. First, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to essentially go into real estate with family. We all know the reasons why. Second, I think it\u2019s going to create a lot of animosity with sibling number five. Third, what happens when one of the siblings wants out? Now we have to sell or buy them out. Fourth, between all the kids, nobody is really in a position to throw in 15K tomorrow to get the full 20% down payment so we\u2019re looking at mortgage insurance on top of a fairly pricey mortgage payment due to high property taxes. Fifth, two of the nine weeks in the summer will likely be used by one or more of the siblings for a vacation losing rental income. Sixth, gotta upgrade the apartment to bring it up to rental standards (probably about 10K worth of work). And the big one, that only leaves them with 50K in the bank. So they\u2019re still relying on his income which is going to be gone at tops in five years. There\u2019s other small stuff too but that\u2019s the basic hurdles I see. \n\n\n**tl;dr In-law's retirement is in a house they no longer want to sell and I'm concerned about the long term viability of their new plan.** I'm basically getting called a jerk because \"I want to force them out of their home they have been in for 30 years.\" But nobody seems to be looking at the long term implications. The two most vocal siblings seem to be clouded by nostalgia. I just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing some huge investment opportunity here.

        "original": "So I'm 26/F, and my family taught me next to nothing about finances, and it never really crossed my mind that I'd have to learn much because all I figured was earn money and pay the bills. Just, I haven't really had to do that either, so I'm rather behind here. Explain things as simply as possible, please, but what do I absolutely need to know?\n\nSituation and goal: Earned a BFA the end of 2017. No debt; about 3k in savings (was more but used a good portion to help pay bills the last couple months). I live at home, have access to a car but I don't pay for it or rent. I do help out with bills if asked to, cause obviously I need the lights on too, and groceries. Currently teach math for an online school. It's my first year with them and so I didn't take on many classes. Paid $15 per class session, teaching 3 classes, 3 sessions a week each. That's 9 sessions a week, if there's no days off for holidays (follow a typical school calendar). I previously worked for a private school, right after graduating, gained a designated teaching certificate with their education system, during that time. Not state certified, and have quite a few classes to keep my current certification (and/or get state cert.), which expires next year.\n\nUltimately would like to have my own place, looking to close long distance relationship, fortunately in the same state, just a few hours away. But I know I got to get up to a sustainable income, and get used to taking care of myself financially. I like working for this online school, and will take on more classes if I can (if not I'll just have to find other work). And I also am looking into tutoring to make up the rest. Looking at rough estimates, I think I'd need to be making at least $1500 a month. But I'm not sure if I'm underestimating this! Is that doable to live independently? I live in Tx, currently in a pretty rural area, looking to move around the Killeen area. If that helps any.\n\nThings I took into consideration and estimates per month I could find:\n\n* Rent (including utilities): <$700\n* Car Insurance: $200\n* Renters Insurance: <$20\n* Health Insurance: $50\n* Food: $150 (based off what I found, my family usually does a lot of cooking, don't eat out much, so I'd probably continue doing so, if that lowers cost any)\n* Phone: $47 (what I pay now)\n* Misc.: $100 (this includes my current subscriptions for software/websites; bank fee (with BoA cause that's what my family has but that fee is annoying) and I just doubled this expense for my budget)\n* Savings: $200 (just an ideal)\n\nThat totals just under $1500. Obviously not earning this much right now, but working on that. Figured I can earn more than half if I can get up to at least 15 sessions a week (5 classes/ 3 days a week) and tutoring a few kids a week at $30-40 a session. I didn't take on much work when I started with this online school, in part cause I wasn't sure how I'd feel teaching online. I like teaching, but my last year at university especially, I experienced a sever lack of motivation, that may have been in part due to depression. And I have social anxiety. It's been hard getting myself out there to find work I felt I could handle mentally. I love teaching from home and will gladly take on more classes, if I can make a living from that, and tutoring. Just kind of worried that's not realistic...and not sure what else I should consider or know in budgeting and being independent. Even if I don't move out anytime soon, I'd like to be financially independent.",

We made this decision as we have a fair amount in the bank and we believe in the business. Although it will take a few years of doing this to see a good return. \n\nAs you can imagine our previous lifestyle inflation is eating up more than we are adding so we are at a deficit each month which stresses me out.

        "original": "\nI was in an accident where someone at a blinking red light (essentially stop sign) came out and was nearly unavoidable from my perspective. We hit fronts and my car has been deemed totaled. Not surprising based on the damage (air bag went off and front end in terrible shape).\n\nFYI - I'm from NY\n\nI'm okay but just very frustrated about what, to me, was not my fault at all and all the financial burden and inconvenience. I would love to get some help on all aspects here:\n\n1. **Car Value -** can this be negotiated? They actually first put my wife's (admitted similar car) through and it was way off and I argued it. The guy made it seem like I had no option but to take the value based on the comps this valuation company pulled. Then finally when asking if it was the right drive train he reads off the car and it's not mine. He comes back and it's actually worth another $2K. Okay, great... but still low. I'm pretty sure all the options and mileage and all of that is appropriate. The 100 mile radius is BS since it's only like 3 cars. I purchased mind 150 miles away and the ones for sale are mostly 100+ miles. But he said it's said that's the law in NY.\n2. **Rental Costs** \\- now that it's deemed totaled, I have 5 days (whereas with a repair I have until the repair is complete). This seems outrageous. I work full time and so I am expected to find another car in 5 days and thereafter my rental costs are covered by me out of pocket? They have no other options I'm told so it's not my fault for taking a lesser policy. There was already burden in trying to find a like-vehicle given that my car had some hard-to-find options but it's difficult to find a car in a week. Still, I'll try... but why should I have to even pay $100 if I have to rent through the weekend while finding a car? Let alone another few hundred if it takes another week or two. Is this something I can get from the party responsible (if they are deemed responsible).\n3. **Gap Insurance** \\- if it is as low as he claimed it could be, I'd have been a moron to not get it when I purchased the car a year ago. I don't know yet. The only thing that I might have thought was well... it's an older car and already depreciated a lot, I'm fine. But clearly not... will have to pay out $2.5K. I think I can also roll that into another loan possible?\n4. **New Loan -** speaking of new loan... how much more unfavorable will this look? I bought the car 9 months ago and so it sucks to need to take out another loan. Hopefully assuming all else equal I still get approved and it's okay here?\n\nAnything else I should be thinking about? Anything I should ensure I pursue against the other driver? It's ridiculous that I'm going to be worse off material ways due to something that was not my fault. I regret SO MUCH that I didn't ask the cop to breathalyze the guy. After we got out of our respective cars he was about to LEAVE and I was so scared I took a picture of his license plate and asked someone who had just stopped to call 911. Not that I think he was really drunk but maybe tipsy? I don't know... he seemed so clueless.\n\nI'm just upset. Sorry for ranting. Any and all help appreciated. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit\\* one last thing - if this accident isn't deemed my responsibility and my insurance company therefore pays nothing... will it not impact my policy?

Annual income of $300,000 - $400,000. (small business owner so it varies some but can assume this is base going forward with upward potential) wife is SAHM.\n\nNet worth of around 2.5M if include the value of the small business. (Makes up around $2,000,000 of the net worth - based on the last offer I had on the business)\n\n$150,000 in after-tax bank accounts. Retirement plan $100,000. Own a rental property with about $70,000 in equity. Have about $100,000 in equity in a personal residence.\n\nOnly debt is primary residence owe $400,000 @ 4% over 30 years (27 years left on mortgage). No car payments or credit card debt. Owe around $110,000 on the rental property but it cash flows around $700/month before repairs but after mortgage/insurance.\n\nThree kids (6, 4, almost 1).\n\nMonthly costs are:\n\n* Health and dental insurance $1,100\n* Mortgage/property taxes/insurance $2,600\n* Disability/Life Insurance $240\n* Utilities: $1,000 (including cellphones/lawncare, etc.)\n* Auto Insurance: $125\n* Childcare: $1,000 (averaged over 9 months out of the year)\n* Charity: $200\n* Kids College fund: $600 ($200 a piece)\n* Random other subscriptions (amazon prime, netflix, hulu, abcmouse for kids, audible, Disney+, etc.): $100\n\nMy estimate on cost of lake house on a 15 year note after 20% down payment is $1,350 mortgage, $200/month property taxes, $100/month insurance = $1,650/month in base costs. Assuming $500/month in utilities to include things like internet and security system. (Maybe high if we aren't using it often) So a total of $2,150/month.\n\nAssuming no updates needed and we do not buy a boat or something like that. Not sure if we'd rent it out through AirBNB or not so assume that's a no.\n\nMy thoughts are that assuming our costs of living is approximately $7,000/month before food/entertainment that we could swing this given our monthly income is \\~$25,000-$35,000/month. Assuming the low end of $25,000 and carving out $8,000/month for taxes we have $17,000/month.\n\nThat leaves $10,000/month before lake house or $7,850/month afterward for things like food, entertainment, gas expenses and investing. I believe we could limit entertainment and food to $1,500/month (including traveling to/from lake house an hour away from our home)\n\nI believe that the property value is a good deal. It's in an area that has stable sales and low inventory, comparable sales have been for $100,000 more than this house. (This house isn't updated pretty much at all, and the others were, but we are fine with it not being updated and wouldn't plan on doing much either way) Given our rental property and some other RE investing we've done in the past, we've been able to become fairly handy and could do minor updates that would just take time but not much capital.",

        "original": "**About Me....**\n\nHi there, so I'm a 40-year-old professional living in Los Angeles, making a good salary and looking to get into the housing market after renting for the last 20 years. I need some advice on what I'm expecting to put down on an offer.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\nThe housing market here is very hot, and my spouse and I are looking in areas with good school districts. What that means is that almost everything we're looking at goes for way above asking (between $20,000-$150,000 over), and if we want to have the winning bid we need to be fairly aggressive. \n\nThe reason I come to r/personalfinance is because I realize that a house is a financial investment, and should be considered almost like savings account / investment. At least I've been told by people who *aren't* professionals. \n\n**My Question:**\n\nTo what extent - or more importantly to what **price** ***-*** should I think of my home as savings/investment? \n\n**specifically**, if spending 850k on a house leaves me with 100k in savings (after down payment) and disposable income of $2300/mo, $28,000/yr (pre-bonus) and $48,000/yr post-bonus... is that a wise investment? \n\nThat's compared to disposable income of $3750/mo, $45k/yr (pre-bonus) and $65k/yr post-bonus renting. \n\nBelow you'll find a bit more optional information if you want additional details about my current finances....\n\nThanks in advance for you advice!\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Current Financial Picture**  \nTo give you a more complete financial picture...\n\n*Employment:* Employed full time at a large very successful entertainment company, in a creative management role.   \n*Income:* After bonuses (which are guaranteed), our household income is around $220,000. In the $180-$190,000 range pre bonus.   \n*Takehome:* After taxes, benefits, and 401k my takehome is about 57% of my salary.   \n*Family:* I have a spouse and 2 children, both under 4. My spouse does not work.   \n*Debt:* I have no recurring debt, and pay credit cards in full each month.   \n*Expenses:* Monthly expenses tend to average in the $2,000-$2,500 range.   \n*Savings:* I have more than enough to make a 20% down payment and still retain over $100k in savings. \n\n**Additional Ramblings:**\n\nI have to admit that beyond a healthy 401k, large savings, and some minimal stock investments, I haven't put a ton of effort into personal finance - so appreciate the feedback of those of you who are more experienced in this realm.\n\nRenting always made sense for me as the commute / work-life balance was always important and there's basically nothing appealing within a 30 minute commute under 1m these days. However, I've recently transferred to a new division of my company which is located in a part of town which much more realistic options in my preferred commute (in the $750,000-900,000 range).\n\nTo avoid too much of a change I had always been limiting my search to something in the $750,000k-$800,000k range, really only because that would keep me within $500 of my current rent ($3000/mo). However after running the numbers, **financially I could easily go up to $900,000 and still put as much as $45k a year** **into savings** after mortgage, property tax, and monthly expenses.",

Fast forward and several classes later only myself and one other person have not converted. We are in the process of being hired on, but the background check has taken 4 months and the last update from the background check was 2 months ago when I sent in paper work. I did have a minor drug charge, but it was for simple possession. They have either let go or many people have outright quit and they have not been able to hired anyone on. Add to this I am on the autism spectrum and this particular work that requires calling out is just making me more stressed, especially with as many people they let go due to not passing a test.   \n\n\nWhat adds insult to injury is I spent money to get one of the tests done with money out of my own pocket, yet here it is, a year later, and I have little to show for it. Today I had to leave early because I felt sick with stress and needed to relax as my mind literally locked up. Further people have made jokes about me being a temp forever and the stats we are supposed to be competing against are people that fail to call back people they were supposed to be helping, so of course they will not be efficient. I did try applying to something a little higher up else where, but as soon as they said they wanted an interview, I called back the recruiter and was told it was already filled.   \n\n\nI do have a Business Degree, but there are degrees in CS I could get for under 10k, and at this point I am wondering if I am cut out better for CS, as I like to program and I like challenges, whereas any ideas I suggest seem to get shot down some how. Further I also feel like there are favorite employees, but I can't prove it.   \n\n\nLong story short, I am wondering if despite spending years getting a degree, maybe business is too much bullshit for me, and something more constructive might be in the cards.

I was told that I could roll over a 401K into my TSP and that it would be a good idea to do so. I have $80,000 in savings.\n\nMy job's 401K is vested on day 1 and is 50% matched up to 3%. My plan was to invest 15% of my salary into my 401K and try to roll it over into my TSP when I could. Are there better options than doing that? Should I only invest up to 3% and then invest the rest of it into a Vanguard account? What should I do with my savings? I held onto throughout college just in case I needed it but now that I am gainfully employed I want to invest in somehow but I am afraid of making a stupid move and losing a bunch of it.\n\nI am also looking to buy a home. I was looking into the VA Home Loan from a bank like Navy Federal. I live in the Midwest so homes aren't that expensive and not only do I understand that it is an investment like any other but I have house life goals as well. How much of a down payment should I make on my home? Is it better to buy a larger home and then rent out the rooms with the assumption that my salary will increase over time? What kind of interest rates should I expect and what are the disadvantages of 15 versus 30 years?\n\nSomething somewhat related. Is it normal to find other ways outside of work to make money?

        "original": "Hey PF - Hoping for some guidance in a good news situation.\n\nVia throwaway account due to windfall nature.\n\nI am due to receive something like $40,000 in a windfall that I was not expecting. I am very fortunate not to \"need\" the money and am looking for advice on how best to use. \n\nA bit of background for context: I am low 30s living in an apartment (rent = $3500, wild I know) in San Francisco with a finance, wedding is this year. I have a good job grossing $165k + 20% bonus (which we do not plan for, but have received every year in past) and finance grosses ~$115k. We have emergency funds in place and save significantly (~20% via maxing 401ks, Roth IRAs via backdoor, HSAs, and  taxable).  In general, our life is very stable financially due to our lucky families, lots of education and both being in stable fields.\n\nDebt: I have approximately $25k in student loans remaining from my grad school program, which I pay ~1,000/month. The loans are through First Republic at a 1.95% (again, wild I know).  I receive an interest \"credit\" if I pay them off in less 4 years, expires Sept 2021 (worth 2% of original balance of 60k, so $1,200).  [As an aside, if you qualify for FRB Student Loan Refi - do it!]  This is our only unsecured debt. I am paying ~1,000/month to just beat the September deadline.\n\nWe have purchased some real estate in lower costs of living area, these cash flow positively (with professional mgmt) and have outstanding debt @~4.25%.\n\nNext steps - We are looking at buying a home (likely townhome or condo due to prices) in SF this year as we now feel we can afford it and are as committed as we think we will be to SF. A 2 bedroom that works for us is likely to be ~900k - 1.1M (it's crazy.), so down payment of 200k is a good assumption.\n\nTo the question: How should I use this 40k? I am due to receive my bonus in March of ~$20k which could be used in a similar manner.\n\nOptions:\na) Pay off student loans immediately (book 1.95% return guaranteed)\nb) Invest the 40k in the stock market via IRA / taxable vanguard index (who knows? Likely high volatility in election year)\nc) Save 40k for use in future down payment. Note - Our parents will likely provide some assistance if needed, so this would be reducing that.  This option would be achieved through a stable bond fund, money market account, or 4-8 month CD. (Maybe 0.5%? return, but very low volatility)\nd) \"Buy down\" debt in existing real estate holdings. (Reduces outstanding debt @4% and modestly improves annual CF)\ne) Some combination of the above\nf) Something else entirely\n\nThank you for your thoughts and opinions.

        "original": "I know most people on here are looking for early retirement or just retirement in general goals, but I love my job and can see myself doing it for the next 15-20 years(I'm almost 40).  I don't need retirement investments, as I'm a union member and my projected pension is more than my current monthly expenses and an annuity that should be 7 figures by then. \n\nInstead what I'm looking for is income for when my work gets slow. I usually only work a full 9 months out of the year with 2-3 months of sporadic work, like 0-24 hour work weeks. My income is helped by unemployment during the 0 hour work weeks but anything more than 1 day in a week ruins unemployment for that week. \n\nSo what I'm looking for is probably something that pays dividends monthly or quarterly that while I'm working I can have reinvested and when I'm off I can draw for living expenses. I know using savings makes sense for this but my wife sees savings as something that should never be touched under any circumstances and when we do it must be paid back immediately.  She would just have more peace of mind if we had that income to use. \n\nWhat I don't want is to start a business. I have no desire to do marketing or networking. I don't like being around people and the point is to be able to enjoy my free time not devote it to another job. Likewise direct real estate ownership isn't something I'm interested in, though investing in REITs is something I've considered. \n\nI also have no investment experience. My annuity I just have in one of the portfolios set for my retirement decade. \n\nWhat I do have is some money, a couple grand, and more to invest with gradually while I'm working steady. I also have some time.  Right now and for the next few years it seems like my work will be steady, maybe not a full 52 weeks/year of 40 hour weeks but much less time off than I've had in the past. My goal is about $1500/month in income.  I'm not sure quite how much money needs to be invested to get that through dividends but that's the goal, based off of it being enough to pay for my house while not working. \n\nSo I'm not sure where to start, I guess a fiduciary would be a good place, but I'd like to learn and understand things on my own. A good book or podcast would be helpful, something with some real investment education, I got the basics of personal finance down pretty good(pay yourself first, don't go into debt, live on less than you make).",

The townhomes are at the top of what I can afford and I don't think maxing out that range is a particularly good idea. But the condos I've been looking at have been between $65k and $80k. The neighborhood isn't great, but isn't terrible. I don't want to stay in Dallas forever and I think these units have great rent potential. Both of the units need some updating, but most updates I could do myself and I could afford the ones I couldn't do myself since the price is much lower. \n\nIf I'm doing my math correctly, I could put $10K down on one and reasonably have it paid off in 10-15 years. HOA is $290/month. I need to do some research on property taxes and insurance, and I'm aware that there will also be PMI. \n\nThere's a few townhomes in particular that I'm absolutely in love with. They're higher priced and I could only afford a 30-year term with them, but have lower HOA fees. I could live alone in either a townhouse or a condo, but I would be able to have a lot more breathing room with money in the condo. The townhome would be best if I had a roommate and I'm not sure that that's something I want to bank on.\n\nDespite how much I'd love a yard, I think the fact that I'm only responsible for the interior walls of a condo is a huge plus for me. That kind of thing has been the main driver for why I've continued renting. I know I can handle most inside repairs by myself.\n\nI don't know. I'm so overwhelmed by this process and my family isn't the best with money, so I'm not sure how good their advice actually is. A lot of people seem to think condo-buying sucks no matter what, and my real estate agent said a town house is probably the best way to go if possible, but if I'm understanding this correctly, by the numbers, it may actually be the best option for me?

        "original": "Hello all,\n\nAs the title suggest I currently have 300k in student loan debt as I just recently graduated from dental school in May of 2019. The way I see it I have two ways to pay off my student loans aggressively or through the pslf program. Currently I am working at a qualifying employer for pslf and am paying on the repaye program. I currently make about 130k/year, salaried, and expect my payments to be 1000-1400/month based on the calculator for my student loans. I am currently 26 years old so I would be 36 by the time I have my loans forgiven. My comparative payments to have the loans payed off in 10 years the conventional way would be ~3500/month. \n\nSo the issue comes down to am I going to stay in a qualifying place of employment such as public health or would it be more beneficial to go into private practice. Currently at my place of employment I am given health care, 401k, 3 weeks paid vacation, holiday time off, a week off for continuing education, among other things such as they will pay for licensing and malpractice. Along with this I will be getting a 3-5% raise every year I am with the organization. None of this is offered in most private offices, as you are the boss. \n\nHowever, I can\u2019t get private practice out of my mind. It\u2019s a large part of why I went to dental school, to be able to have my own office. But having your own office comes with many headaches such as staffing, overhead, and making sure patients actually come in the door. There is far greater risk but as with everything more risk means more reward. You have the potential to make more money than I am now, but money isn\u2019t necessarily everything. I feel like if I went private practice I would never truly leave the office, always thinking about it and currently I don\u2019t do that or have to think about work except while I am there. You can have time off in private practice but anytime you aren\u2019t at the office you are still paying overhead but not making money seeing patients. I would also have to secure a loan for the practice which could be anywhere from 250k-500k, depending on size and previous years production etc. \n\nThe last thing I want to do is stay in community health for a couple of years, let my interest balloon and then decide that private practice is what is best for me. Currently where I am living isn\u2019t exactly where I would like to be but it is fairly close to family. I\u2019ve thought that if I just do this for 10 years I can have all my student loans gone and be financially free to start a practice if that\u2019s still what I am wanting to do. The one thing about this is if I was to start the practice 10 years earlier, this could be far more beneficial than saving money on student loans. \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated",

The upside to that is that I am coming out with an MD and a PhD without any loans (NIH pays for these programs), and I will be getting a stipend all 8 years ($36,000-$40,000, depending on year). After this, I will go on to a residency (average salary is $60,000), then on to a career as a physician-scientist (average salary is \\~$170,000, but I imagine this can change based on clinical hours, grants, etc., etc.).\n\nI am also about to get married to a current PhD student in psychology, who has 3-4 years left in her program before going on to a post doc, which will pay $40,000-$60,000 for 3-4 years before she goes on to a professorship (starting around $100,000/year).\n\nMy main question is what steps can we take to better our chances of being financially alright later on in life, especially given that we will be in school so long? Specifically, I'm looking for steps beyond just putting away money into savings each month, since something as mundane as one major car service can obliterate a savings account and I can't really put away more than about $100 each month.

        "original": "**Kinda lengthy, I appreciate your advice in advance.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 23F living with parents, rent-free. No student loans or credit card debt. My total monthly expenses are \\~ $900 each month. \n* I currently make 50K a year (gross income) but my contract ends in until June 2020, so I plan on job searching starting April.\n* I have a Roth IRA, making max contributions each month ($500). Just opened a CD account to save up for a house, making $1,000 contributions each month. I have an emergency fund (for 6 months) already in my Ally savings account. \n\nI need help figuring out my next move for housing. I come from a working class background, so my family has always rented. While I was in school for undergrad and grad school, my parents downsized to a one-bedroom apt with a room in the attic for when I would visit. After living on my own for a couple of years, moving into that room is just not comfortable now. \n\nI vocalized to my parents that I want to buy a house and have them move in with me. They have been very supportive and are excited about the prospect of having a home of our own. My idea was that I would buy a two-family house, rent one unit, and live with them in the other (ideally, I would finish the basement and make that a mini apartment for myself). My father would continue making \"rent\" payments which would contribute to my mortgage, and we would also earn from the rented unit. \n\nThe problem now is that while I was initially very excited to be making these financial moves at such a young age and bring my family up with me, I am now I'm having second thoughts about buying a house and living WITH them. I get along with my parents relatively well, but I think being crammed into that small apartment has made me easily irritated with them. They are very supportive and open minded (e.g. they let my boyfriend sleep over without a problem). I just wonder if I will regret living with them and not being more independent. Any thoughts on the following scenarios?\n\n1. Move us out to a larger apartment while I continue saving up for a down payment (but the savings would be lower because then I would have to contribute to rent)\n   1. The problem with this is that if I get cold feet and decide to not buy a house with them, they are left with a place they can't afford.\n2. Suck it up and stay in this apartment for another year or so until I can make a big down payment and hope for a buyer's market in the meantime\n3. Start making moves for a house after I secure a permanent job later this year, with the understanding that it's only my first home and I won't get stuck with my parents forever - but will have secured their retirement.\n\nNOTE: It is important to note my parents are not pressuring me into these decisions at all, though I do feel responsible for bringing up my family with me now that I am upwardly mobile. What made me consider buying them a house in the first place was that my dad (63) voiced his concerns about retirement since we are immigrants and have only been in the country for 10 years -  my mom works seasonal jobs. \n\n**Thank you for your input!**",

        "original": "Hey everyone, I was recommended to make a post here asking for some advice on my current career path, salary, and a potential job opportunity. \n\n25 year old male with a Bachelors in Management Information Systems. I\u2019m pretty much a stay at home kinda person and I usually play video games when im home. I cook for myself and eat out about 2 times a week. I occasionally go out with coworkers to hang out but its very infrequent. \n\nCurrently, I live in Massachusetts and my annual salary is $60k with a $15k maximum bonus at my company. I put about 10% of my paycheck into my 401k and I\u2019m still on my fathers insurance\n\nHere are my monthly expenses. The only amount that\u2019s variable is the amount I spend on food. I don\u2019t have transportation costs associated\n\n* $1200 for rent, internet, and electricity combined (I live with 2 other people)\n* $350 for food (includes grocery shopping and eating out for lunch/dinner)\n* $800 payment towards loans (currently have $60k in loans. Federal unsubsidized, subsidized, Parent PLUS, and Perkins loan)\n* $150 transportation costs\n\nI am talking to a recruiter for a company out in California in San Mateo, about 30 minutes out from San Francisco. The position, according to the recruiter is between $110k to $145k OTE. 85% of those numbers will be my base salary and the additional 15% will be from bonus/commission. So im estimating it around $93.5k to $123k, depending on my experience and other stuff. \n\nMy plan was to assume the lowest pay ($110k OTE or $93.5k base salary). Here some estimates per month if I consider moving out assuming the lowest base salary:\n\n* $2800 for rent, internet, electricity (1BR 1 Bath)\n* $500 for food\n* $800 loans\n* $500 if I get a car + insurance\n\nThis would net me around $4600 per month expenses, or $55,200 yearly. Using [neuvoo.com](https://neuvoo.com/tax-calculator/California-93500), it looks like I\u2019d walk away with $67,000 after taxes. I brought that down to $63,000 to be more conservative. In total, that would bring my yearly savings of $7,800 per year.\n\nMy question for the sub is, given my estimates, am I thinking about these numbers logically? Even if I dont get this job, and I end up getting a similar salary offer out in California, is ~$90k in that part of California livable comparing to how I\u2019m living out in Massachusetts? \n\nI\u2019d love the help and for anyone to give me feedback or even criticism on the numbers I estimated.

This past year, I had to move out of a rent-free situation and rented my own 1-br apartment in the area close to where I work due to the difficulty of commute and other personal circumstances that prevented me from a roommate situation (which would have saved me a lot of money month-to-month.)  Despite my fortunate situation, I did not take full advantage and maximize savings.  The $5k that I had saved up by January 2019 disappeared when there was a medical emergency.

I am endlessly hopeless and anxious over money and resent my friends who make more money and/or walked into their mid-20s debt-free due to their families being able to provide for them.\n* Where the *heck* is the other $515 going monthly?  I live in NYC.  I try not to order out , but I do 3-4x each month.  I do not buy clothes; get my hair or nails done; etc.  How can I predict this better?\n* I need to build emergency savings but also pay off my Discover loans ASAP.  Which comes first?\n* It's plain and simple.  I cannot afford this rent and I cannot tolerate or afford this cost of living that NYC demands.\n* So, I plan to move out of the NYC area and find a new job with a lower cost of living in the summer, when my lease ends.

Then focus on emergency fund until about $2-3k then attack the Personal Loan.\n\n\u2014> Edit for Context:\n\n\\-Car lease began when I was commuting to NYC 60 miles everyday and needed reliable transport. I was also not paying rent at this time so I could afford it.  That is why the lease and car exist in NYC. I would not have a car here otherwise!\n\n\\-I rented alone because I own a reactive and fear aggressive dog.  She can\u2019t be trusted with most people alone who aren\u2019t familiar with dogs of this sort of behavior.  My family was unable to take her even for short term and I can\u2019t re-home a dog safely with these tendencies.  It\u2019s not ideal.  It\u2019s also not the financially logical choice. But a dog is a commitment. So, I\u2019m trying to work around it for now.\n\n# Update. 1/18/20\n\nHi folks, here is what I have done since Tuesday evening.  Currently sitting on $505 in savings after being paid this week. \n\n**Applied for Loan Forbearance.**  I was iffy about this especially with the interest accrual but I pushed off student loan payments until July 2020.  This way, I can aggressively pay off the Personal Loan and also start saving to relocate.\n\n**Downloaded YNAB.**  I set up YNAB on Tuesday and have been using it the past few days.  I haven't tried it since early college years, and this is a much better interface than Mint was, so thank you for suggesting it.  I am definitely going to stick with this.  It had a few tricks to learn but was easy to use and I like how it is *proactive* and not reactive.\n\n**Balance Transfer.**  I was approved for a CC with 0% APR for 15 months and 0$ fee for balance transfers.  I applied for the transfer and should see the approval within 10-12 business days.  \n\n**Budget Review.**  Realized my credit union has a free budget tool.  It graphs your spending in categories and I realized that I was over-spending on Groceries, small purchases like an occasional coffee or bubble tea, Pharmacy purchases, and household items on Amazon/Target (e.g. hair dryer).  I adjusted my budget to include $50 for pharmaceutical items (prescriptions, feminine products, replacement bathrooms stuff) but I do not intend to spend that much monthly; I do not want to under-budget though.  These small purchases ended up being $50-200 gone from my budget.\n\nI also realized I had forgotten about $100 copays to urgent care.  I hate the doctor's but I have recurrent bacterial infections, and then would take antibiotics, which would trigger other infections and it was a revolving cycle.  I have new insurance this year so I found a couple potential PCPs who will have only a $25 copay.\n\n**Rent.**  I was advised by a financially competent family member, who told me that most people my age now have to pay more than 1/3 in their rent income, so it was a reality I had to accept and work around.  This was a mistake.  I would love to relocate but I lack the funds right now, and I cannot give up my dog because it would be detrimental to my mental health.  That being said, I am definitely going to relocate near the end of my lease.  I will look for housing properties that have some sort of en-suite or basement/attic apartment that will provide separation and privacy for my dog but may also have shared space like the kitchen or something, which would be fine.  \n\n**Income.**  I am going to look into side gigs.  There is only so much once can cut out of their budget, I suppose, so the next step is to increase income.  I have a niche skill set and certifications so I can probably earn an extra 65-200/week in tutoring.\n\n**Lease.**  I have yet to decide what to do with the auto lease.  If I relocate in July, then I will definitely need the car again.  This will depend on my future salary and CoL.  Glad to know that there is a possible option for this, however.\n\n*Thank you everyone!  If I do anything amazing with my budget, I'll post in* /r/YNAB *to show my progress.*",

She is a CPA working for a public accounting firm, and I am an engineer. We are 22 and 24 years old with a combined income of $135,000, so we\u2019re doing quite well for our age. \n\nMy SO was just told that she will be traveling for one month straight for accounting busy season, and needs to book 1 month worth of hotel/rental car on her credit card and she will be reimbursed. This comes out to ~$5000, which is greater than her credit limit. She currently is using her college card, which has a very low limit, so it looks like she has \u201cextremely high usage\u201d even though she is more than capable of (and has been) paying it off in full multiple times a month. \n\nThe logical thing to do is try to raise the limit. Wells Fargo (who the card is through) raised it to $2000, which still isn\u2019t enough to cover the month of travel expenses. Wells Fargo also flat out denied her for the travel rewards card because of her \u201cextremely high usage\u201d, which is literally just a couple hundred dollars. Her credit score is in the mid 700s, her portion of the rent is only 14% of her income, and she and I both are making fine money.  Out of shear curiosity, I applied for a card and was given a $10,000 limit through Bank of America. The only difference between us is that I was \u201cpiggybacking\u201d off of my parents credit throughout high school and college, and she is out here doing everything on her own. \n\nDo you guys have any card recommendations for somebody who is getting screwed by the credit system? She needs a higher limit for work travel. \n\nTLDR: Can\u2019t get approved for a higher limit/new card through Wells Fargo due to \u201cextremely high\u201d work expenses.

I paid my way through my undergrad in cash out of pocket without taking any money from my parents. Once I got in to pharmacy school I took out loans from the government and I have a student line of credit with a bank to cover the rest since the government doesn't put it all up. The government also forgives some of my loans as grants so I maximize those before I go to the line of credit. I also got a really good job once I got in to pharmacy school that I work at year round. I work as much as I can without sacrificing my grades and I work as much as I can during summer and holidays. I make about 35k a year. I have about 25k on my line of credit and 10k on my government loans. I have two years left so I should acquire about 35,000 of more debt. My car started falling apart and I paid out $4000 in repairs in 6 months so I sold it and bought a new car. The chealest brand new mazda 3 with an automatic transmission. My payment is about $300/mo but I easily save that money in gas and parts every month. My last car was a total gas hog and any maintenance was expensive as hell. I have about 10k of savings. \n\nI feel like I'm in a very comfy spot right now financially and I have a great earning potential in the future. Even if I can't find a pharmacist job right away I can make $50k a year if I work at my non pharmacist job while i continue my job hunt.\n\nDespite these facts I get very bad anxiety and guilt and shame any time I indulge in an expensive hobby. 7 years ago now I built a gaming pc and I spent $3000 in total. The pc is 7 years old and I could probably get another 2 years out of it if I stretch it really far. I have my new car obviously. I have a gun collection worth a couple of $ dollars. I eat a lot of good food. I buy nice clothes and shoes.

I'm married, have 3 kids either in school or starting soon, and am living that happy dappy middle-class American life. :) My questions revolve around the next home we want to buy, which we've dubbed our \"forever home\"...yea, super original. Details below. \n\n* Income: $110k (single income)\n* Home Price: $330k-ish\n* Credit Score: 810-ish\n* Revolving Debt: None\n* Expenses: Standard (but very frugal living - outside of house)\n\nI'm also a disabled veteran so I qualify for the tax breaks on the property, as well as 0% down (which I always use on my properties). Because of this, there is no PMI, and I qualify for the best rates. And since it's a 30 year mortgage, I still keep my payments comfortable in the event I run into any crazy situations that are outside of my control. There's also the option of the IRRRL if I wanted/needed to do that down the line. Not sure it's that great of an option...if you take into consideration all the extra time and therefore interest you're adding to your loan. But I guess it's an option to not foreclose if that's the concern or immediate threat.\n\nWe max out our personal roth IRA and matching limit in the company 401k, have a good amount (and continue to put more after maxing roth) in a high-yield savings account, and a 3 month emergency standard savings account. I was making significantly more than the $110k mentioned before while living abroad. We took that time to really pad our accounts before settling back down stateside.\n\nNot really sure what all I'm leaving out here. Our house is everything to us. For the past 11 years, we put all of our \"free\" money into our house, and not much into anything else. We don't care about fancy cars (paid cash for every car we've owned), and don't live a lavish life (no vices or expensive hobbies). If we're not at our house entertaining or enjoying our property...we're at a friend's enjoying theirs. \n\nWe budget mainly for the kids and school related activities, outside of necessities. So I guess my point is....is this house a smart financial decision from a personal finance perspective, or should we look at something cheaper? Thanks in advance!",

I have made cuts to my monthly expenses and have become very aware of where I need to cut my spending and this has left me with a very small amount of savings (~\u00a3200).\n\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever had excess income, and it will increase once I start my new part-time job. However, I\u2019m unsure what to do with this money, all I know is that I want to use it to invest in my future and provide myself with a safety net to fall back on if needed. \n\nI\u2019m taking a side course in business and eventually will want a starting fund to create my own start up, or to go into stock market trading if I find myself with a large excess. I\u2019ve seen a lot of things thrown around in this sub, such as Roth IRAs and 401Ks, but I\u2019m honestly completely lost on where to even start looking.\n\nAny help would be GREATLY appreciated, thank you!",

        "original": "Hi All,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I am looking for some advice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground is I am a 35 year old man with a wife and 4 children. When I was 18 I got a minimum wage job in a factory. My wife gave birth and I needed to keep my partner and my daughter. A few months into the job,  I was asked by my parents to get a \u00a310k loan. They were never good with money and needed urgent help before they were evicted. I did it, and for a few months they were paying me back. I was made redundant a few months later, so I was convinced by my parents to use the protection I had taken out to cover the payments as my parents were struggling again. I did so (stupidly) but that ran out. I was working again but was not earning enough to cover my rent, pay the bills that having a house entailed and pay back the loan that I had taken out for them. They were unable to make any payments as they were disabled.  \n\n\nOnce again, my parents begged me to help, and asked me to use my chequebook to borrow some money from a high street lender. This entailed writing 4 or 5 cheques for \u00a3100 each. The lender then gave me \u00a3500, and each month asked for \u00a315 per cheque to be held back. If that \u00a315 wasn't paid, they went ahead and cashed the cheques. Because they used a guarantee card against the cheques if even if the money was not in the account, it would be paid for the bank and I would be in an unagreed overdraft. Obviously, the time came when my parents couldn't pay the \u00a315. I wasn't told and the cheques were cashed. I did get a call from the bank to meet with the manager. I went and after a Spanish Inquisition ( I was made to promise I wasn't a drug user, not an alcoholic and prove I had a young child), the manager promised to hold the cheques for 1 month for me to sort it. He didn't keep that promise and the cheques were cashed that week. As soon as I was paid, I was \u00a3500 down and my credit score started to really fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, in between then and now I had 3 more children, a payday loan here and there to cover job losses, etc and 1 CCJ (which was paid off immediately). My wife has great credit but is unable to work as we have a disabled daughter that she has to care for full time. I am in a decent paying job. My wife used some of her good credit to get a loan which we used to pay off other outstanding debt and consolidate payments. Sorry for the life story, I've had no one to get this off my chest too and it's been with me for years. My tip to you is NEVER lend money to people with bad money habits, even your closest family!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo....we are now looking to get a mortgage. I've been paying rent for 12 years. It has steadily increased from \u00a3350 to \u00a3420 a month, with no late payments or problems. Because I am the only one working, and my bad credit history, I cannot get any realistic mortgages. I am being asked for 25% deposit or being flat out refused. My wife has a great score but they won't give mortgages to a carer as the income is too low. It has taken us years to save \u00a310k for a 10% deposit, there is no way we could save another 15% in any reasonable amount of time. Another 15% would take about 10 years, where I will be 45 and too old to get a 30 year mortgage. Are there any options available to us or are we SOL?",

Graduated in 2014 and have made 4 years of qualifying payments under PSLF. Since 2015, my payments have been about $500/month and I'm a few payments away from all interest being paid off. I plan to stay in the nonprofit sector indefinitely so it's in my interest to stay on this plan until I complete the required 10 years. \n\nMy husband and I married in 2018 and filed jointly for the first time in 2019. In September of 2019, I filed my annual confirmation of my full time employment in the nonprofit sector as well as my salary confirmation with the student loan agency. Because we filed jointly, my monthly payments shot up to about $1100/month. This is not sustainable for my family. I spoke to the student loan organization (1 loan, federally managed) and they said that it might be wise to put the loan into forbearance for the rest of the year, file separately, and have the loan payment only reflect my income. I now make too much to file under the income-based program but they estimate my payments will be substantially reduced by filing separately. \n\nAs of now, I did put the loan into forbearance (november-april) and hope to do just that. As a side note, I'm also pregnant and that will also reduce my payment as they consider it a household size change. \n\nSo my question is, is there a real downside to filing separately if it's almost guaranteed to bring my payment back down to a reasonable level?

        "original": "A while back my fiancee inherited a sum of money after a family member passed - it was about $350k. She hasn\u2019t done anything with the money and has some regret and anxiety about that - so this decision has a lot of pressure behind it and I want to make sure we make the most informed and sensible choice.\n\nI've recently read Simple Path to Wealth and Mr. Money Mustache - so that is the philosophy that is driving my thought process.\n\nThe big question is how should we situate this money so that it does the most for us? \n\nWe\u2019d like to buy a house in the next 5 years (but not sure if it\u2019s feasible), but aren\u2019t sure what city/what part of the country. Ideally we\u2019d like to live in Los Angeles due to the type of work I do and the fact that our entire lives are based here, but Los Angeles is expensive. In the not rich kind of shitty hipster neighborhood that we currently live in you can\u2019t get a 2 bedroom shack for under 1mil, and anything in the 800k - 1mil range needs lots of repairs ($100k+ )- so we don\u2019t know if we can afford to purchase a home where we currently live.\n\nMy fiancee had the idea of potentially buying a investment/rental property to rent out or airbnb somewhere close but outside of Los Angeles (Joshua Tree/Big Bear/Ojai/etc) but these areas are also very expensive. The other idea is to buy something somewhere else in the country but we don\u2019t have family or friends that could help us manage it from afar, so this may not be for us either\u2026 \n\nSo all that is to say that we\u2019d like to set some of her savings aside as cash to purchase something big that could potentially make us more money or that we could live in but we don\u2019t know where that is, or how much we could get that for...\n\nAfter reading the Simple Path to Wealth and lots of Mr. Money mustache, I have a plan in my head and wanted to get your feedback to see if I was on the right track.\n\nBasic info:\n\nFiancee and I are both about 35 years old, and have a 1.5 year old child.  We would like to have another child, and sadly our main hesitation is financial instability situation (and the stress that comes with it). We live in the Los Angeles area, which is not a cheap place to be, but need to be here for the type of work I do, which gets me a potentially high earnings when the jobs are available.\n\nMy Fiancee\u2019s background:\nShe made about 100k per year before taxes on a w2 (take home of about $65k per year). \n\nShe had a job in a field that was not a good environment for her.  We had our son and we\u2019ve decided that she\u2019s going to stay at home to get out of the career that she didn\u2019t want to do anymore and more importantly spend quality time with our son. We agreed that I would work to support our family. Our cost of living is high because we are in Los Angeles but we are trying to make adjustments to become more frugal and consume less. \n\nMy background:\nI haven\u2019t been able to save due to poor financial education and lack of self control. I\u2019m not expecting anything from my parents/relatives in terms of inheritance/help. The good news is that I\u2019ve paid off over $30k of debt in the past few months and spending all my time learning YNAB and trying position ourselves to financial success. It\u2019s simple but not easy.\n\nThe one weird/cool thing is that I have a opportunities that I can make large sums of money ($15k-$60k) in the short span of approx 6 weeks time.  When I\u2019m on these jobs I\u2019m 100% in and have 0 time outside of the job and these jobs are just very inconsistent and due to increased competition and the economy shifting these jobs are getting fewer and far between and happening for less money (the last time I had one of these jobs was 10 months ago).  I\u2019m paid in a 1099 through my corp so end up saving a lot on taxes through this work.\n\nAnother weird/cool detail is that I\u2019ve recently got a day job at a tech company as a consultant.  They pay me hourly and I get lots of overtime. They pay me 125 per hour - On average I\u2019ve been getting about $8.5k per week ($4.5k after withholdings) and when I have to work weekends I have received as much as $12k in a week ($6.6k after withholdings). \n\nThe money is great and I\u2019m super grateful for the job even though it\u2019s a step down from what I normally do and kind of taking me in the opposite direction that I was heading in; but I plan to stay as long as I can to build savings and support my family.  \n\nI was told the job has the potential to last for 1 year (until this Nov).  I\u2019m am not an employee but a contracted worker - so I could be let go at any time for any reason.  There is potential to get hired on but I would need to be at the company full time and would see a sharp pay decrease (I\u2019m guessing they\u2019d offer me something like 150k per year or $82,500 after withholdings). \n\nLong story short - I have ways of earning a lot but they are extremely volatile, if I go for something more stable I won\u2019t be able to earn nearly as much.  \n\nOur monthly expenses at it stands currently are close to 12k per month, that\u2019s with a 2400 per month rent for an old run of the mill two bedroom apartment, 1200 per month health insurance (son has had major health issue that needed surgery that is hopefully behind him but we won\u2019t know until we know), 1600 per month for childcare\u2026 the list goes on. Believe it or not these prices are actually on the lower end for LA,  other than the health insurance.\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out way to cut down our monthly bills but it\u2019s been an extremely hard exercise to find where to cut from (maybe that is worth another post?)\n\nOur Current Savings:\n\nFiancee has an old 401k that has about $30K in it (we plan to roll this over into an IRA, not sure if we should go traditional or ROTH depending on tax implications etc)\n\nOther than that she has about $350k in a savings account.\n\nShe has no debt.\n\nMy current net worth is at about $0, as I\u2019ve just come back from paying off about $30k in debt.\n\nI have a pension through my guild that has about $5k in it.\n\nI have the beginnings of an emergency fund that has $1.5k in it\nbut other than that I have 0 savings/IRAs/investments\n\nThe plan (based on my understanding of THE SIMPLE PATH TO WEALTH):\nTake 150k for a house/rental prop downpayment to keep in a capital one 360 performance savings account.\n\nHave set aside 6k to start a Roth for 2019, and an additional 6k for her 2020 contribution.\n\nWe have the idea to start a 529c via vanguard for our son and max it out at 14k for the year, but are uncertain about this.\n\nThe rest we would put in a Vanguard taxable account.  Vested entriely in VTSAX.\n\nSo:\n$150k in cash in high yield savings account for house\n$12k in cash to be contributed in to her Roth IRA\n$14k to start a 529c for our son (maybe)\n$174k to put into a taxable vanguard IRA to leave in long term.  \n\nTLDR: What should we do?\nHow should we situate my fiancee's savings from her inheritance to put ourselves in the best financial situation for the future?",

        "original": "I'll give a bit of background on income, expenses, debts, etc to help level set.  I am a 32yr old cyber security architect and make a comfortable income (~170K) while my wife is a stay at home mother.  We have 1 kid now but my wife is currently pregnant and due in May.  The only debt to our name is a modest 3 bedroom starter home where the loan is around 191K (zillow estimate values home at 288K) with a mortgage payment of $1400/month.  We do have one newer SUV that I bought my wife last year.  The loan amount is around 28k and the cars value is right around there as well (2018 GMC Acadia with 5k Miles).  I did a 48 month loan at .75% interest just to get the car paid off as quick as possible and that payment is around $660/month.  I do have two other vehicles that are completely paid off, a daily driver car i use regularly and a weekend/fun car.  Our emergency fund is in high interest savings account through Ally and is in a comfortable spot but is probably a little larger than it needs to be (25K).  I also have another savings account with the same bank i do most of my daily transactions which is around 20k.  The second savings account is used to cover unforeseen expenses or a month where we as a family overspent and need to replenish the checking account, which tends to happen regularly.  I have a traditional IRA with NYLife and a 401K with my current employer through Fidelity.  I am putting 12% into the current 401k and my employer matches up to 6%.  I do have a high deductible health plan through my employer but i max out the HSA every year to cover any medical expenses that may come up.  With a new child coming in May, i know things will get expensive with healthcare so i wanted to make sure we are covered there.  As for expenses or extra spending, i tend to spend anywhere from $200-$300 on hobbies a month.  That could be gaming, outdoor activities, or adding to one of my collections of cards or die-cast cars.  I even budgeted an amazon and target spending for my wife which is $200/month.  We spend a lot on groceries ~$800/month and normal utilities come to about $300-$400/month.   The only other monthly expense is my daughters pre-school tuition at $235/month and ballet $55/month.  As i stated early, we don't do well with the budgets some months and overspend in the categories that don't have monthly fixed costs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI believe i am in a good spot so trying to figure out what to do with this flexcomp check from my previous employer.  The flexcomp program was offered to individuals in the company who weren't eligible for the standard 401k due to higher salaries.  What it is, is a way to still put money aside (pre-taxed), invest it, but gave more options on what to do with the money on a yearly basis.  The problem is, when you leave the company, that money is given back to you, taxed, and can't be rolled into a traditional IRA to avoid the taxes.  I spoke with my investment accountant about this and there really is no way around getting the money into the IRA tax free unless i pay the taxes up front within 60 days which is about 12K.  The total flex comp check in hand right now is just over 41k.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat I am trying to evaluate is, should i pay the 12k in taxes up front to roll it into my IRA knowing i will get that 12K back next year or do something else with the money like start a college fund for my kids, open a liquid investing account, or pay off the SUV?  I don't like the pay off SUV option for the fact i lose 28k cash on a depreciating asset and the payment isn't holding us back from normal life.  My wife and I have talked about needing a bigger home in a few years so i am starting to think about that.  I would like to not sell the current home and rent it out and have enough money for a down payment on a bigger home (~80-~100K) so i am thinking about that as well.  Lastly, i would love to take my wife on a well needed vacation in a few years once the kids are older because she deserves it.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR - 41k taxed check issued to me from my previous employer and don't know what to do with it based on current financial and family structure.**",

        "original": "In my current job, I have no way to cover my family's medical expenses. To add them would be more than my mortgage per month. And my wife is self employed, but not yet successful enough to cover individual insurance costs even.\n\nIn short, we had to get her migraines checked out, and several procedures to correct brain/spinal fluid levels. Her doctor didn't charge her for several appointments, and even skipped billing her for a spinal tap procedure. Despite this, there were a dozen scans, and a procedure at the hospital. We got about 20 something bills ranging from $36 to $4,000. About half has gone to collections. It's about $12,000 in total.\n\nWe have almost no money to throw at this monthly, and when I tried calling to negotiate one of the bills, they wanted $150 a month at least. That still left the other 19 bills to pay. And I can't go much higher than $150 a month. I understand they wouldn't want $40/month, that would take forever, but I'm banking on a decent tax return (the last 5 years has seen no less than $3k come back). So that could be something I dump on the bills.\n\nMy thinking was, do I just attempt to take out a personal loan at a place like LightStream and pay it all off with a low monthly payment? The downside is obviously the ~10% interest. Or, attempt to slowly pay one bill at a time despite collections, and let them all sit until I finish each one? That would at least be interest free.\n\nThe ones not in collections yet, I plan to call and ask for a lower bill, though I know nothing about doing so. Maybe they can find a way to lower some of the really large ones for someone uninsured.\n\nAlso, this is all under my wife's name and credit, but if I take a loan (since I have better credit), I assume no one will care that I spend the money on my wife's bills? They can't dictate that I only use the money on my own bills (of which I have none)?\n\nAlso, I'm interviewing for a significantly better job (best friend put in a good word), with a far better family medical coverage, so hopefully, by March, we'll have a lot of spare money for debts. I just need to figure out what's best until then. Or worst case, I lose my current job by May (they know I'm leaving and gave me a deadline).",

I took some advice from a good friend in 2018 about giving it a shot with an 80/20 stock/bond split with mostly US and some International holdings.  I didn't want HUGE returns, but more moderate, less risky growth.\n\nI picked a couple of ETFs and a fund to diversify our money a bit.  I had about $10k invested overall in VOO, VBK and VSMGX (our extra account) at the end of 2018.  Then it dropped in october, I panicked and then I took out all but $1000 in december 2018.  It has since grown to $1300...yup, kicking myself now a bit since that was 30% growth.    \n\nSince then, we have saved enough to pay off our mortgage in August of 2020, ($127k principal left on 3.5% loan).  This will save us $21k more than if we continue to just send more to the mortgage like we are doing.  We will still have 6 months of emergency funds and are now wondering if we just put our monthly savings into these accounts going forward or leave them in our high-yield savings (1.7%).  Are we already 'playing' with enough money in the market by having our maxed 401k's?\n\nAre there better options?   Does this seem like a decent setup?  Should we maybe consider a 60/40 split in our 'extra' account for less risk?  \n\nWe both work, have 2 kids, are fairly frugal people and save around $3-4k per month.  We have maxed out our 401k contributions, we don't qualify for Roth IRA due to AGI and don't really want much other than saving for college.  We might want to buy another house some day and rent our current one, but who knows how that will all play out.\n\nThanks, any and all, for your thoughts and opinions.",

        "original": "Hi all,\n\nI'm currently trying to figure out what would be an 'irresponsible' amount for me to spend on an engagement ring for my girlfriend. I'm somewhat expecting r/pf to be very conservative against debt but wanted to get a few more opinions. Here is the current situation:\n\nMe - 26M, Her - 26F\n\nPlanning to get engaged some time between April-June, married some time between October 2020 - April 2021\n\nMy salary: 84k\n\nHer salary: 55k\n\nMy loans: 15k@4.5%(student loans), 10k@0%(car)\n\nHer loans: 70k@4-8%(student loans)\n\nI am paying off semi-aggressively at ~1k per month. Girlfriend is only able to pay about $100 per month on top of minimums+interest.\n\nMy savings/investments: 6% 401k match, $600 per month in ESPP(10% of posttax with 15% discount, cannot sell for a year)\n\nI will have 2.5k in my savings account by April set aside for future engagement ring/wedding costs (might go all to ring)\n\nHer savings/investments: 6% 401k match\n\nI started working late (first year of working) so I have only about 5k in investments/retirement. Girlfriend has 25k.\n\nBoth are in pretty stable jobs with opportunity for advancement in salary (tech/education).\n\nWe are hoping to have a kid some time in 2022 or 2023.\n\nWe are living in a medium cost of living area. We pay around 600-700 for rent living in different housing.\n\n\nI am having trouble thinking about how much to spend on the ring (marriage too but that's another thing to think about). Luckily the girlfriend isn't demanding but I think we want to aim for 1.5k-2.5k. We prefer diamond though I'm not even sure I can get a decent diamond ring at that budget. Does this price sound reasonable?\n\nAfter all the costs up there with basic living costs, we only have a bit left over to throw into savings. I just started allocating funds for engagement/wedding so I'll be putting in $800 per month. Girlfriend will be putting $200 (I will be buying ring). I'll still be putting 1k per month towards student loans. Unfortunately I will probably hold off on contributing to Roth IRA until after we get married or at least all the wedding costs are saved for.\n\nWhile I like the rate that we are going at especially with our projected salary growth, I don't want to throw ourselves in too much of a hole to get out of. \n\nI believe I should be out of my student loans or near it by the time we get married and we can combine our incomes to erase her loans. We are both responsible credit users with high credit scores (780+) who like to budget so I'm optimistic. Thoughts?",

        "title": "Planning for the future, making sure my retired father (66) is taken care of",
        "original": "Hi,\n\nI want to get some advice on what I (28M) should be doing to help make sure my retired dad (66M) is set up to have a worry-free retirement. We both talk openly about finances fairly often, and he pretty regularly asks me for advice on anything having to do with money. Sometimes he doesn't take this advice, and sometimes he gets upset when I tell him something he doesn't want to hear, but he tells me he appreciates the input.\n\nMy main concern is making sure that he has enough assets to get him through if/when he ends up having any major health issues. And if not, I want to be sure I have enough saved up on my end to help him out if needed. He is relatively healthy now, but he has had a few health concerns pop up recently and he is starting to get up there in age.\n\nI am a little concerned that his spending is too high right now and that he might be pulling too much out of his 401k (balance of $118k). We've talked a lot about ways he can reduce his spending and I've offered many suggestions in this area. He's made some improvements, but he's still pretty much breaking even month-to-month while drawing $1,200 a month ($960 after taxes) out of his 401k. He does have a pension and is drawing social security, so this helps.\n\nHe bought his parent's old house a little over a year ago after they passed away, so a lot of his monthly expenses go towards the mortgage on that house. It is a 15 year mortgage, so he will be paying on it for a while. He lives by himself and it is a 1700 sq. ft. 3 bed 2 bath house, so it is bigger than he needs.\n\nAlso, he has two cars when I think he only really needs one. One of his cars is a tricked out jacked up Jeep that he refuses to sell. It has been a maintenance nightmare and has cost him thousands of dollars in repairs over the past few years. This is one example where he could cut some of his expenses, but he seems to think he's in a decent spot financially and doesn't need to. He does tell me he gets a lot of enjoyment out of riding it around. It does offer some things that his crossover SUV doesn't (towing), but I think worst case scenario is he could sell both cars and get a car that fills all of his needs. This would help on insurance costs as well.\n\nHe has Medicare and a supplemental heath insurance plan, though he's talked about cancelling or reducing the supplemental plan to save money month-to-month. I guess I'm not really sure what he should expect to be paying in health care costs over the next few years. One thing that concerns me is that he does not have long-term care insurance. I know not everyone ends up in long term care, but I've read that home care/assisted living/nursing homes can run in the range of $100k per year if it comes to that. So I'm worried that if he ends up in that situation, his assets could be wiped out almost immediately unless I were to step in and help. He tells me not to worry because he won't end up in long-term care, but obviously he doesn't have control over that and I want to make sure we're prepared in case that happens.\n\nSo I guess my main questions are:\n\n\\-Should we get a long-term care insurance plan? I know this will depend on cost. We haven't gotten a quote yet, but I've seen that rates can vary from $1,500 per year to $3,500 per year. He couldn't afford this right now unless he cut his expenses or started drawing more out of his 401k.\n\n\\-Is his situation dire enough that he needs to sell his house or go back to work? He doesn't want to do either of these things. When I look at the numbers I think it might be necessary (unless he cuts spending majorly), but his thought is he wants to enjoy his years in retirement. He is in a low cost of living area, so he could find a decent apartment or small rental house for $500/month.\n\n\\-If he doesn't sell his house, go back to work, or cut expenses, how much money should I set aside to make sure he is taken care of? From what I can gather, if I didn't do anything and he ended up in long-term care, his assets would be depleted pretty quickly and he'd end up in on Medicaid, which I've read is a bad situation to be in. I want to be able to help, but I'm not really sure of the order of magnitude I should be planning for.\n\nAny help is much appreciated! Here is a breakdown of his expenses, income, debts, and assets:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExpenses:\n\nMortgage - $765\n\nSupplemental Health Insurance - $180\n\nCar Insurance - $215\n\nGas - $250\n\nTV/Internet - $125\n\nPest Control - $45\n\nGroceries - $500\n\nRestaurants - $100\n\nLiquor Store - $100\n\nHouse/Car Maintenance - $200\n\nFun - $100\n\n**Total Expenses: $2,975**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIncome:\n\nSocial Security - $1,228\n\nPension - $747\n\n401k withdrawal - $960\n\n**Total Income: $2,935**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDebts:\n\nMortgage - $95,000\n\nPersonal Loan - $400 (not sure interest)\n\nCredit Card - $1,000 (8.5% interest)\n\n**Total Debts: $96,400**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssets:\n\nSavings - $2,000\n\n401k - $118,000\n\nHome - \\~$115,000\n\nSUV - \\~$10,000\n\nJeep - $3,000\n\n**Total Assets: $248,000**",

Our child is 12, and so far the disciplinary pieces have stayed attached to school and don't follow us home. Also doesn't require supervision throughout the day.

The frustrating part  is that boss lady has been doing this exact thing with small children for years, and shows no sign that she's actually working, ie: responding to emails within hours.

Technically illegal, I think.\nKeep saving | Financially 'safest' in the long-term | Mentally, professionally, and academically *destructive* in the short term. Seriously, I don't think I can keep this up otherwise.\n\n\nI'm looking for as much insight as I can find, this will be my biggest purchase to coincide with a very big time in my life. Advice, critiques, anything will help!\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR** need a car should I spend 3k on a beater or finance for something more reliable in the 5-10k range",

        "title": "How I got from welfare to upper middle class",
        "original": "Hey all, I'm not sure how helpful this anecdotal story will be, but I'm really excited about this community and wanted to contribute what I could.  I grew up with a lot of 'checkboxes'--welfare, single parent household, drug abusive mom, and many more.  I was a poor student, surrounded by poor influences and no one--including myself--had a lot of expectations.  I remember my mom teaching me how to steal gloves from the Salvation Army.  I remember digging through couch cushions for McDonald's money.  I remember the elation of 'renters rebates' so I could get school clothes.  I remember being poor.  I started working at 15 and landed a job at the local movie theatre making $5.15 an hour.  I was emancipated at 17 and basically couch surfed through high school.  I stayed dedicated to my job at the theatre throughout and by the time I graduated high school I was an assistant manager and had no plans for college.  One day the manager drove in with his brand new Dodge Stratus and I found out a theatre manager's salary was around 35k and that seemed more than adequate, so that became my plan.  \n\nI eventually was dragged by my old social workers (now \"adopted grandmas\") to at least attempt to go to college.  My grades were terrible so not only were there no scholarships available, but I was rejected by every university in my city.  I eventually saved enough to afford a single algebra class at the local community college.  I worked hard and got an A.  I used that to prove to the universities that I was trying to turn over a new leaf.  Once accepted I had to start the arduous process of paying for college. It took a ton of research and back and forth (I did not have anyone to go to with experience on this topic).  Thankfully Pell grants and subsidized student loans were enough to cover everything but books.  I took out a little extra in student loans when needed to pay rent and keep my head above water.  After a year and a half at the local state university campus I applied to go to the \"Main U\" in the state capital (my first time outside my hometown).  I was Pre-Law at first but switched to Computer Science about a year in when I heard about salary and job prospects.  At this point I was prideful and felt I had enough experience in CS to justify an internship.  I applied a lot and got rejected a lot.  After living off my girlfriends server wages for a few months I sucked it up realizing I was not ready and got another job at the theatre.  I spent a lot of time at this point learning about my field, reading books, doing side projects, whatever could make me seem more appealing.\n\nI finally got a break in my Junior year of college and got a job at a student consulting firm doing odd projects for Thomson Reuters. I worked 20 hours a week, made $13.50 an hour and was getting direct experience in my field.  I interviewed a lot before and had a lot of rejections.  I remember I was sweaty-palmed and walked around the block a few times before my interview and when I got the job I bought my girlfriend (now wife) a stupidly expensive (relatively) purse with my first check.  From here, I had my break. I worked there through college, interned directly with Thomson Reuters and was much better poised for interviews as I approached graduation.  I got lucky and landed my first job at Microsoft making 81k a year.  It was a mind-boggling amount of money.  I ate peanut butter sandwiches for lunch every day until my first check came in.  \n\nSince then I've worked miscellaneous places in tech and have increase my salary significantly.  I thrive at work and I attribute a lot of that to the fact that I had to learn to problem solve and not succumb to fear early on.  Some middle aged guy shouting at me about a deadline doesn't bother me, but for some 'silver spoons' who haven't faced real conflict before it absolutely ravages them and they shut down.  People who grew up poor often have a lot of perspective and skills that are valuable to major companies. I'm 29 right now and  I just bought my first house, have a solid retirement plan and am able to buy things, travel and help others without worrying about next month.  It's still so surreal.\n\nLike I said, this is just a big anecdotal story.  I am well-spoken and white (which I acknowledge has given me privileges despite my upbringing).  I chose a career (intentionally) that has a surplus of jobs and high salaries and thankfully had a natural aptitude for it.  I had support from social structures.  And I probably got lucky saying the right thing to the right interviewer a time or two...I don't know if I would have landed the jobs I did if I applied again.  The main goal of this story is just to share a path of how I made it from A to B.  Anyone else here, I wish you the absolute best in doing the same!\n\nEditing to share a link to a very valuable resource I wish I'd have known about:  You can dial 211 or visit 211.org to be linked to local resources in your area that can help with necessities like food, shelter, medical or simply starting your path toward higher education or the workforce.  A lot of folks on here have expressed a sense of \"Where do you begin?\" and hopefully for some this link will help!",

        "original": "So, basically as the title suggests, I do not currently have a job, nor have I worked for over 6 months. I'd like to take a moment to appreciate this sub opening up, what a useful place because the other personal finance sub is so far out of my league. \n\nTo start off, I'm young, I have yet to finish college, and due to a few, or many, personal reasons, I'm basically on a break from working and going to school at this time. I have few skills, none of which are things I'm expert at in the slightest. I also only have one parent at the moment who lives out of state who, if need be, I'm lucky enough to be able to contact if I need money to support myself. The money I have now is about 4000 USD, which is what is left after my other parent died and left a small insurance amount. It was a lot to me but to people who get 30 or 100 thousand, it was just a bit. Honestly I wouldn't be able to feed myself if it weren't for that money I received. Thanks is in order to the insurance company for being a pain in the butt to get it btw. \n\nBasically, I'm not sure how long I will remain with no income, and whatever job i get will pay only about 10 dollars max an hour, so I don't plan to be making \"bank\" in the near future. I pay 200 bucks a month in rent, 40 for a phone bill, and now 11 dollars a month on netflix since who I live with also uses it so i pay for multiple screens. Due to health reasons, I've recently been put on a diet that keeps me from eating any dairy, gluten, corn, sugar, and soy, so now my food costs just got a whole lot more expensive and I've yet to start paying for those changes. I pay for food for myself and another, with the occasional third so before this dietary change my monthly spending could range from 400 to 600 dollars easily depending on how many trips to the store I make, which I've tried to keep at 400 tops since I stopped working, but since I spent less time eating to save money, it has been less than 400 even, closer to around 250 or 300. I've watched my 10000 quickly drain over the last 2 years, but that isn't too bad considering my situation. Now that I have this new diet though, I'm a bit worried how long I'll last. I will also have to start paying a chiropractor and a therapist starting in 2 months from now, which I should be getting reimbursed for, but that is not guaranteed. Those appointments may be 200 a month, which at the very least I have to have money in my account to initially pay, so having my account go to 0 is not an option, and asking for money is something I will feel awful about so any tips would be nice so I can be as prepared as possible. Especially about food shopping. Now I'm forced to mainly buy organic for myself, a whole 'nother realm of spending I'm not sure about. Any tips about how to conserve for when I do get a monthly income would be MOST appreciated since even when I was working, the money I spent was more than I made. Considering I was lucky to have 200 every other week in my paycheck, minimum wage stinks. \n\nThank you for all who reply, and I'm sorry if this is not much for you guys to work with to give out tips. Any and ALL tips will help out though because I am independent and anything to keep me from being a burden monetarily would be great to have. Thank you so much in advance!",

I'm so sorry.\n\nOkay so I'm about to start a job that's going to be paying me significantly more than I'm making now and this seems like a good place to crunch some numbers and get some feedback for how to better spend my money so I'm not just winging it every week and scraping by while also wasting tons of money (also this would be great to look back on in ten years ha)\n\nBackground: 23, married, one kid on the way, due in July. Living in West Virginia.\n\nThe job pays $11.20 an hour plus $910 commission (assuming I make my goals every month). That comes to around $2200 per month before taxes (estimated $1700 after taxes maybe?). Downside is it's only 29 hours a week and I'll be commuting a fair bit, though I have an extremely fuel efficient car. There is potential to move to full time and management based on performance.\n\nWife makes $11 an hour working 40 hours a week, brings home about $1100 per month after taxes.\n\nThat's roughly 2800 per month after taxes until the baby comes. Then she's gonna cut down to 20 hours a week and work opposite schedules. We're moving into her mother's basement to save up for a down payment on a house. Bit depressing but you gotta do what you gotta do and we won't be paying $1000 a month in child care.\n\nAfter tax estimated monthly income after we have the baby: $2300\n\n>Car payment: $113.67 (we owe about 1700 still, 2% interest)\n\n>Car insurance: $175 (should go down after we move)\n\n>Phone bill: $177.04 (we were dumb with our money and signatures before we found out about the baby but the job is in a Cellular company so that's going down to about 80)\n\n>Student loans: $64.01\n\n>Spotify/Audible/Prime: $38\n\n>No internet bill, no rent (although we tried to offer it)\n\n>Total monthly bills: $470.73\n\n>Remaining: $1829 per month\n\nI'm wondering with this situation if it's reasonable to keep the \"extras\" or if we would need to sacrifice those to keep afloat. Cutting those is no problem should we need to.\n\nI need to know how to save on groceries. Just the two of us can spend $100 a week and idk how to cut that down, but us living with her mother should help a ton, not only in what we buy but how much. So my tentative estimates are:\n\n>Groceries: $150\n\n>Gas: $300\n\n>Clothes: $50\n\n>Diapers: $200???? Honestly have no idea\n\n>Entertainment: $50\n\n>Savings: $100 (currently we have $20 saved)\n\n>Remaining: $1029\n\nAt this point beyond that $100 a month in savings I'm thinking of just putting my commission checks into a separate account that would build up to a down payment for a house.

        "title": "Advice and Hindsight from the last 8 Years",
        "original": "Some advice from someone who\u2019s basically lived at or barely above the poverty line while raising a family.\n\n1.\t If you\u2019re going to get into a life situation where you could potentially be sharing expenses/finances with your SO, make sure you\u2019re on the same page.  If you both work and your money is your money and what they make is theirs, cool.  If one of you is going to stay at home to raise the kids and one is the breadwinner, cool.  Just be sure you know what you both want (or think you want, things can change when you have kids, you or your SO suddenly has a medical issue or other weird/stressful circumstances pop up) and try to have a rough outline of that. \n \n2.\tTry to have your financial situation figured out before you get into that situation.  Some of us just aren\u2019t that great with money- retail therapy, unnecessary spending, no budget, buying new when used will do- try to be as brutally honest with yourself as you can about your own financial health and practices.  Start thinking of practical, reasonable ways to reach your goals, whether that\u2019s to build your credit, start an emergency fund, pay down debt.  Be brutally honest with yourself about where your money is and is not going.  If your always on the verge of not making the rent payment but you\u2019re eating out X amount of times a week, that\u2019s probably something you should address.\n\n3.\tCook your own food and plan your grocery list around sale items.  Buy a Crockpot from Goodwill if you have to.  Watch for sales on Tupperware.  Pack your lunch.  Do a big meal prep on Sunday, divvy up the food so its ready to go.  See what meat is on sale and get it.  Freeze what you can.    \n\n4.\tOpen all of your mail.  You know that bill you couldn\u2019t pay 6 months ago that you didn\u2019t open that you still have copies of under the sofa or jammed in a junk drawer?  And the one\u2019s you\u2019re getting now from collection agencies?  Open them.  Deal with it.  Answer your phone when the creditors call, even if its to tell them you have to decide on groceries or the gas and electric bill so good luck getting that money.  I\u2019ve had bills lowered, I\u2019ve gotten on $10 a month repayment plans, I even had a hospital bill forgiven because I said \u201cI can\u2019t pay this\u201d.  Schedule a personal day from work if that\u2019s what it takes, line up all your unpaid bills and make those phone calls. \n \n5.\tBUDGET.  This is about as basic as it gets.  Calories in, calories out.  You know the bills you\u2019ll have to pay each month, each quarter, each year.  You know when Christmas is.  If you\u2019re really lucky you\u2019ll know about how much money you\u2019re making week to week.  Figure out what comes in and what goes out.  If money is going to things you can change (gas bills, electric bills), do what you can to lower them.  Be brutally honest.  Can you live without internet and cable?  Can you swallow your pride and go to the library?  Do you need an Iphone?  To quote Sean Connery The Untouchables, \u201cWhat are you prepared to do?\u201d\n\n6.\tDo everything you can to not use credit cards.  I have $10k in credit card debts, and you know what?  I justified opening each one with the logic that I would use it in an emergency, or if I \u201creally needed it\u201d.  Out of $10k you know how much of that was for emergencies?  Less than $1000.  What about \u201creally needed it\u201d?  Less than $1000.  So I have $8k I racked up on unnecessary spending.  Not worth it.  \n\n7.\tBuy the most reliable used car you can.  My first car was an old used Cadillac that I probably treated better than any human I\u2019ve ever known.  I loved that car and it served me well through high school and into college.  Now I drive a used 2004 Toyota Camry.  It is not a Cadillac.  I do not enjoy driving it.  But I have a long commute and it gets good MPG, and its been exceptionally reliable.  I\u2019ll drive it until its not justifiable to fix.  And then I\u2019ll probably buy another one.  We\u2019re shopping for our first newer used family vehicle right now, and while my wife would love an Escalade or Suburban, what we *need* as a family of 5 with 3 little kids is a mini-van.  Not glamorous, but hey, that\u2019s showbiz.  \n\n8.\tTry to find ways to enjoy life that don\u2019t revolve around spending money.  I love getting a good haircut followed by lunch at my favorite bar.  I could easily justify that expense as a well-deserved \u201cme\u201d day, but its money I could use for bills.  But playing with my kids is free.  Calling an old friend to catch up is free.  Going for a walk, checking out books at a library (or using other services), starting a bodyweight fitness program- free.  You don\u2019t have to hit the mall or the bar to have a good time, and don\u2019t ever let other people make you feel less for making that decision.  \n\n9.\tFind ways to improve yourself.  Learn some basic meditation, get more exercise, pick up a skill from a neighbor or friend.  See if a hobby or talent can be turned into cash.  If college is an option for you check into it.  Sticking to a budget, always feeling like you\u2019re pinching pennies can be emotionally draining and, at times, more stressful than before you started to take control of your finances.  Its easier to maintain if you\u2019re working at building yourself up or have a constructive outlet for your financially-triggered stresses.\n\n10.\tKeep one eye on the short-term and one on the long-term.  Set some short-term goals and long-term goals.  For years my short-term goal was \u201cpay all the bills I open this month\u201d.  My long-term goal was to buy a house for my family.  Try to break down your goals (If I pay X amount on this credit card, it will be paid off in X months).  That way you\u2019ve got a tentative date to shoot for and you\u2019ll have a light at the end of the tunnel when it really sucks to keep at it.  To help keep on eye on those goals\u2026\n\n11.\tCheck your bank account DAILY.  Once in the morning, once before you go to bed.  You may not sleep too well in the beginning but if you stick with it that\u2019ll change.  \n\n12.\tHustle and grind when you have to.  Part of being brutally honest about your finances might entail realizing you just don\u2019t make enough money even after you\u2019ve cut cable, dining out and turned the thermostat way down (I was/am in this boat, although I just got offered a new job so I\u2019m finally docking it).  I\u2019ve had to work multiple jobs, surviving on little sleep and not seeing my family to help dig us out of a few holes (we\u2019re still digging).  It sucked, I was miserable, but its what I had to do.  I had to grind for a while.  \n\n13.\tUtilize whatever assistance you can.  Whatever benefits or assistance you qualify for, use it.  When I went back to school my family used food stamps.  I\u2019ve had to use heating credits, my church\u2019s food pantry, whatever I could do when we just couldn\u2019t make ends meet.  Along those lines\u2026\n\n14.\tTry to have or build a support group.  This means doing 2 things- staying away from people who impact your life negatively and surrounding yourself with people who will help you and you aspire to be like.  The best advice I\u2019ve gotten has been the hardest to hear, and it never came from people who wanted to see me stay the same as I always was.  Find people who will support your goals and push you when you need it.\n\nTLDR; Be brutally honest with yourself about how you spend your money and time.  Create a budget with short and long-term goals in mind, find new ways to fight stress besides shopping/buying stuff.  Check your bank account every day and surround yourself with good people who will nudge you when you need it.  Have your crap together before trying to merge your crap with someone else\u2019s crap.  Avoid credit cards but not your mail.  Get help when you need to, grind when you need to.  Pack a lunch.\n",

        "title": "I didn't make rent this fortnight",
        "original": "But it's not the end of the world...\n\nLet me start by prefacing.  I will be 32 in June.  I have spinal osteo-arthritis and fibromyalgia and realistically shouldn't be working, however was not eligible for the disability pension here in Australia. Until recently it had been 3-4 years since I was able to hold down a job, and for a period there I was in my wheelchair full time.\n\n2 years ago I was required to move out of my family home due to Mum remarrying, which started a 2 year period of 5 moves, floating around, living off the generosity of friends, doing housework in exchange for rent ect.  Unfortunately September last year I ended up back with my Narcisstic ex, and after 2 years of being separated and growing myself a pair of balls, his abuse had worsened as I attempted to stand up for myself.  I soon was in living hell, and began applying for community housing, public housing, and looking into domestic violence shelters, all of which would have required me to rehome my dog, who I had bought as a pup with the intention of training him as a service dog and to one day help me pull my wheelchair.\n\nNow this isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I did what I had to do, and found myself back in the sex industry after a 20 day dabble the previous year, this was December 1 2017.  The parlour I started at was soon raided by the police 3 times in 2 weeks and before long, I had 7 shifts in a row without a single cent to my name, but kept persevering.  I'd put away enough money to make 1 months worth of rent, and started applying for private rentals.  Between Xmas and New Years, I ended up in Emergency as my back had seized whilst- of all things- trying to reach around to wash my butt in the shower.  X rays showed my upper spine is now fusing together.  I just asked when I could get back to work.  In January I moved to a better (and safer) parlour and started earning better money.  I am able to lay on the couch, sit, stand, walk around as my pain levels change, with the bonus of using the spa with about 50% of clients which helps.\n\nAlthough Mum wasn't able to help me financially, she did put her name on my applications to help me secure a place, and in mid February I bawled my eyes out when I got the phone call saying I had secured a beautiful home with a huge backyard.  I couldn't get in there quick enough, I have been here about 6 weeks now, and whilst certain sounds and the sight of certain cars make me feel sick to the stomach, I am much happier and recovering mentally.\n\nSo until recently I was relying off government benefits, I am now climbing my way to lower/middle class, which brings me to my points.  Sorry about the essay.\n\n**How I am trying to improve:**\n\n1. When I moved in, I paid 4 weeks of rent in advance, not the 2 they asked for.  My work is unpredictable, as illustrated by the 7 day dry spell, so I wanted that security in knowing if I did have a shitty week or so, I would still be ahead in rent, and could make it up later.  I will be paying 1 weeks worth tomorrow and just making it up next fortnight (hopefully).\n\n2.  I was able to start an emergency fund.  It's still quite small but is growing, my goal is $2000 to be able to afford any insurance excesses or rent if need be.  I have pet, car, house insurance.  Once I hit $2000, I'll increase the excesses on my insurance which will lower the premiums.  It's enough to buy a beat up car to get me to and from work if mine dies in the arse (and having done over half a million kms, it's certainly a possibility).\n\n3.  As I get paid mostly in cash, I have envelopes in my safe for rent, bills, emergency fund, work related expenses, ect.  I used to have free multiple online accounts for the same purpose, but I found it too easy to spend when it was that easily accessible.  Rent and bills (gas, water and electricity) get filled first, then I spread the rest out.  $100 notes go straight to the emergency fund.\n\n4.  For an entire year now, I have tracked every little cent going in and out of my life with probably a 97% accuracy.  Just an Excel spreadsheet, with profit and loss columns for personal + work.  It's helped me to be brutal when looking at my frivolous spending.  For example, in the space of 6 months I spent $1500- yes you read that right- on freaking micro transactions on a mobile game.  I wasn't making ends meet at the time but $2 here, $8 there seemed like nothing until I was able to add it up.  This comes back to easily accessible money, my weakness.  I now buy an iTunes gift card every fortnight, add it to my account, and once I figure out how I'll remove my credit card details.  This previous fortnight, I wanted to see why I didn't make rent- freaking Uber Eats.  As I am working 5 shifts a week, travelling probably 90-120 minutes return each shift, and am still training for my chosen sporting discipline as well as cooking, cleaning, exercising dog ect, I had become lazy/too sore and stopped preparing food.  I am now forcing myself to get back into the habit of preparing a few days worth of food at a time to take to work.  So yeah, while I am disappointed in myself, being able to see where I am being a twat has enabled me to make the necessary changes to drag myself out of poverty one day at a time.\n\n5.  Which brings me to food.  I am single so it's much easier, but I buy and make in bulk, and usually eat the same thing a few days in a row.  I no longer keep junk food in the house coz I have no self control, which has helped me lose 22kg over the course of a few years as well (doctors said it would help, they lied).  For example this week, I cooked 8 chicken patties in my air fryer, popped them in the fridge.  Made a huge salad, and every night I put the salad and a patty or two in a container ready to grab the next morning.  I buy pasta and sauce which serves 4, cook it all up then separate, 4 meals ready to go.  A frozen pizza (about $3) can be 2-4 meals depending whether or not I eat it with salad.  You can definitely eat much cheaper, but I have to juggle my pain levels with convenience, I don't have the ability to stand in the kitchen for long periods.  I buy soft drink at the supermarket, 24-30 can cartons for under $1 each instead of buying them at work for $2+.\n\n6.  I frequent subs like personalfinance and frugal.  Most of whats on PF doesn't apply to me but I still read and absorb, and there are always a few good tidbits of information.  Frugal has been fantastic for helping me to spread my $$ further.\n\n7.  Smoking.  I've been a smoker on and off for 10 years now.  Until I started back in the industry I'd been smoke-free for a few months but the temptation, stress and being surrounded by other smokers soon meant I caved in.  Sadly it increased my pain and fatigue levels, as well as costing me $20+ a day.  I then met a girl who vaped and swapped my pack a day habit for vaping.  It satisfies my need to 'de-stress' by sitting outside and blowing huge clouds, and I import nicotine from NZ to add to my juice. A large initial outlay for a decent vape ($150 give or take), and I do vape quite a lot especially now I can do it inside, but have probably halved the spending there.  I've enjoyed experimenting with flavours, and have recently settled on a fruity menthol combination. The added bonus is no added pain or fatigue to my already poorly functioning body, no stinky smell everywhere, no butts.  Yes, quitting altogether would be better still, but one day at a time.\n\n**Where I still f@ck up:**\n\nBecause my money comes in and looks so good in my hand, I still make stupid mistakes and try to live a life of luxury I can't afford (yet). Sporting items I don't necessarily need, I went a little crazy furnishing my house (all cheap / secondhand stuff but it added up).  I haven't put anything away for tax yet which will kill me in a few months unless I get it together. *cough* Uber eats.\n\nWe are all human and make mistakes, but being able to acknowledge them and make changes is what is helping me work towards a life of comfort.  By the end of the year I hope to have a flush emergency fund, be debt free (pay out phone contracts and credit card), have a 'luxury' savings fund going for holidays ect, and to continue to be ahead with all my bills and rent. This all depends on my ability to continue being able to work, so a flare up of my health can definitely throw a spanner in the works.  I doubt I'll ever be able to purchase my own home, and realistically as each day is as good as it gets due to my spine fusing together, I'll probably end up back on welfare, but that's a problem for future me.  \n\nI fully appreciate lots of my advice doesn't help those of you who are literally unable to make ends meet, but I'm sure there are others on the cusp of the poverty line like myself who may benefit from a few of the ideas I have tossed around.",

I had a dental emergency recently (root canal and crown) that set me back quite a bit. My dental insurance covered $60 of my $1,300 procedure. I'm pretty pissed about this and need to find better coverage as my teeth are enroute for more trouble soon.\n\nExpenses:\n\nRent: $275, all utilities and internet included (I'm extremely lucky.)\n\nCellphone: $35\n\nNetflix: $11\n\nAmazon Prime: $13\n\nDental Insurance: $16\n\nCar Insurance: $65 (Car is paid off.

I'm not actually sure what my exact income is because I recently got a $1 raise at work but I do know it's the most I've ever had to work with. Previously my paychecks were $407 a week when I was making $13.50 an hour working 40 hours a week, now I'm at $14.50 an hour alternating between 36 and 48 hours a week, so I'm estimating my 36 hour weeks will be right at $400 and my 48 hour weeks will be around $550.\n\nWhich is great because I'll actually have a bit of extra income to put towards paying off debt and maybe actually be able to start planning for the future \\*gasp\\*.\n\nStill though, being 31 years old living with my parents and a pile of debt isn't exactly a dream scenario, but I think I can overcome it. I'd like to go back to school and maybe get one of those fancy career things, but having about $10,000 in student loan debt from my previous failed college attempt is a bit of a deterrent.

Daily binge drinking, smoking, lots of fast food and $6 hot and ready pizzas from Little Caesars.

It was practically useless. I got a job as an assistant editor for a small publishing company making peanuts just trying to start a career in my field. Shortly after, the economy crashed and I found myself working in restaurant management and substitute teaching just to scrape by.\n\nAfter a major life event, I decided I wanted to go to tech school and try to make some real money. I went out and got $17,000 in loans for school, finished my two-year degree, and started working in my field for more than double what I was making. Easiest and highest-paying job I've ever had and I'm still working there.\n\nGoing to tech school was the best thing I have ever done with my life, aside from marrying my wife. People say money doesn't buy happiness, but that is total bullshit. When you're living comfortably and saving a ton of cash, your life has so much less stress than when you're living in poverty.\n\nIt's not for everyone. Not everyone can work with their hands (although there are plenty of technical degrees out there where you don't have to), but if you can, become an electrician. Become a plumber. Become a welder. \n\nMost tech schools have a lot of adult students, so you can go nights, weekends, whatever fits your schedule.\n\nBest investment for a poor person that ever existed. \n\nEdit: to add on a little more, once you DO start making decent money, don't drastically change your spending habits. My wife and I still live in the same apartment that we did when I first started school. We didn't go out and buy a new car, I'm still driving a 2006 Hyundai. The only difference is that we are putting literally thousands of dollars every month into a savings account that will one day be a massive down payment on a small house, and our mortgage will cost half as much each month that our (already cheap) rent does right now.

A little background, I'm a disabled veteran currently receiving 60% disability for PTSD, TBI, chronic back pain, and tinnitus.  I filed a claim for individual unemployability and a rerating of my PTSD to 100% with the VA.  I'm married with two kids and two dogs.  My wife is a SAHM and is homeschooling our kids.  I'm currently receiving $1,227 per month.  We had just purchased a home with 10 acres 4 months before I lost my job.  We filed for SNAP and were approved.  My mortgage payment is 929 a month which I have not been able to pay along with a 320 a month car payment.  Car is about to be repossessed pretty soon.  I was served with papers stating that I'm in the first stage of foreclosure from the sheriff and I contacted my VSO and immediately got a lawyer that's working pro Bono.  I talked to the mortgage company's loss mitigation dept and my lawyer sent the paperwork they requested asking them if they could drop my payments down to 500 a month until my claims have gone through and they denied it.  So basically my lawyer is just stalling them for as long as he can in hopes that my claims are processed before they take further action.  My wife has 20k in student loan debt and I have 10k in student loan debt.  (My post 9/11 GI Bill hadn't paid my tuition one semester and they suckered me in to filing for a loan by saying that all my classes would be dropped if I didnt... I believed them like an idiot)  our tax refund was taken this year to pay some of the student loan debt and here I am staring homelessness dead in the eyes and feel like a complete failure.  I contacted the student loan company and asked if they could take a look at what im making and see if we qualified for them to be forgiven and they just said thats not an option for you.  Then i asked if i could be put on a low payment plan and that i could afford $25 a month.  Im still waiting for a callback in regards to that.  Credit is completely trashed it's down to 500 as of right now.  SSDI claim takes a year on average in the state of kentucky so I'm looking at October or November before I'll even hear anything about that.  VA claims... they drag their feet and try to get people to quit by remanding the case over and over.  I've been to 6 compensation and pension appointments so far.  I've cut out all frivolous things and am able to pay our phone bill, electric, water, and non food items every month but this is taking its toll on all of us. My wife is anxious and stressed out constantly we don't fight or anything like that and our kids starting to pick up on us constantly being stressed out... which absolutely kills me.   I can just tell that it's straining the hell out of our marriage.  I'm already in my own personal hell dealing with my PTSD.  I'm just stuck waiting...  sorry for the wall of text guys.

I have had my job for almost a year now making 12/hr. So I have $1000 saved up which I would like to use towards a down payment. I know I\u2019ll just need an extra 400 for fees and such. I\u2019ve applied for food stamps so that feeding myself won\u2019t be an issue for me.\nI also would like to get an apartment because they are cheaper than dorm rooms right now but I can\u2019t get a co-signer due to not having family.

He gets some of his therapies through the achool system, and he's not medically fragile or needy enough to qualify for things like SSI.\n\nAll in all, I'm making about $6000 more than I was 5 years ago, but the cost of the premiums plus his appointments are going to come to between $9k-11k per year (roughly 18%-20% of our income now)\n\nAny suggestions?

        "original": "So, this is something we didn't plan on but later reflected on how we did it once we saw the growth in our bank account. I was going to school on the GI Bill at the time and my spouse was working part time at Pizza Hut as a driver. The 25K Figure includes both of those incomes.\n\nFirst, neither of us Drink or Smoke. Our addiction is video games and there we would maybe spend 300 for the entire year on subscriptions/new games/micro transactions. Knowing a lot of my other friends I know this saved us a crap ton of money compared to them.\n\nAs far as food goes we spent probably 400 dollars a month of food. This was because of Ramen and other cheap food we are OK with eating. Also, free Pizza sometimes from my spouses job.\n\nWe lived in a cheap 2 bedroom apartment that total cost was $800 for everything. Rent, Water, electricity, and Cable Internet. We always had a roommate and we would just have them pay a flat fee of 350$ to stay there with us. This was located about 10 minutes from Purdue Campus and next to a Bus Stop.\n\nOur phones we switched to the lowest plan with 1GB of data. This cost around 70 dollars a month.\n\nOur car insurance was low partly because we are able to use USAA and our military service. We were down to 70 dollars/mo for BOTH cars liability only. My spouse got in minor accidents while delivery pizza and we kinda just ignored them since we didn't care about how it looked. Gas was about 100 for mainly my spouse.\n\nSo our expenses per month were 450+400+70+70+100+50(misc expenses/gaming)= 1140 (call it 1200). That means we spent around 13.5K for the year.\n\nThis gave us a huge buffer and we had a lucky year of no major car repairs and 11.5K increase in funds. This didn't happen every year but even though were were making under minimum wage full time we were able to save a lot of money. We even had health insurance through the ACA (We had a free plan that sucked).\n\nWhen reflecting on this, the biggest spender for a bunch of people is Food/Drink/Smoking. Seriously you could be spending an extra 200-500$ a month on just that. If we spent that kind of money our saving would have been in 1/2 and a major life event could have a much greater chance of devastating us. Most of my friends have this as their major problem and really need to work on fixing it.\n\nGood luck out there and make smart choices for you.",

        "original": "I've been a long time follower of subs like r/personalfinance, r/frugal, r/financialindependence and am very excited to see someone has created this sub and it is thriving! I\u2019ve seen a few success stories here recently and I think that it could be a great installment type of thread that this sub could incorporate. I know for me, when I was struggling hard, I would love hearing and reading about people who started where I did and became successful. It fueled me to work harder, save more, and try to better myself. \n\nSo, in hopes of helping someone keep their faith in the process, here goes nothing:\n\nMy family came to the US as refugees in 1998 after hopping around from country to country for a while, due to the war in Bosnia in 1992. We had very few personal belongings other than clothes that fit in a suitcase and my parents\u2019 life savings that my mom kept hidden in her clothes (probably around $8k). We were extremely lucky to get sponsored to come here by a religious refugee assistance group even though we weren\u2019t of that faith. My parents had to repay the plane tickets to get us here, but other than that, were able to use their savings to afford a (cheap) car and some necessities: clothes, food, etc. I remember having no furniture in the house other than a mattress, a table and one chair. \n\nMy dad worked as a maintenance man for apartments and we started accumulating used furniture and would typically live in whatever neighborhood he was working at, as one perk he got was reduced rent. My mom started working at Walmart as a cashier, where she still works to this day. They did everything they could to raise me and my 2 siblings, instilling a ridiculous amount of work ethic in us. My parents divorced when I was 13, my dad was deported back to Bosnia, and I began working pushing carts at Kroger at 14 years old. I made $5.25/hour and worked after school and on weekends. The federal minimum wage increased to $7.25 by the time I was a senior in high school so this was the most I made during that time. I felt like I missed out on a lot of things my friends were doing, but working also helped keep me away from sex, alcohol and drugs. During this time my mom was able to handle the bills on her own, but I paid for all of my clothes, any food I ate outside of the house, helped with my part of the phone bill, etc. \n\nIt turns out that I was a very fast learner and took tests well. No one in my family had gone to college so navigating the school system was a challenge.  In a combination of hard work (which gave me good grades) and luck, the school guidance counselor took an interest in me and put the idea of college in my head. They knew my family\u2019s financial struggle as I was on reduced lunch and they knew that I worked (you had to make your school aware if you had a job, at the time). The counselor connected me with resources that helped me tremendously such as waivers to take the SAT/ACT for free, free test prep courses, and a few opportunities to visit colleges. I ate this up and quickly realized this was going to be my path.\n\nI ended up getting into one of the best state schools and used my life story to write compelling essays for every scholarship I could find. My family provided no financial assistance other than letting me live at home some summers, and I worked part-time while going to school full time. All in all, I graduated college after 4 years with about $25,000 in student loans. This was for a school that cost $20,000 per YEAR according to their website, and I even studied abroad for 7 weeks during the summer before my senior year. I kept costs low by living with roommates in apartments in the shadier parts of town. I found a food services job on campus which provided probably half of the food I was eating on a regular basis and cut my food spending in half. I received food stamps ($100-200) which covered the rest of my food spending for the month. A lot of my friends were much better off financially, and if they were ever unloading things (clothes, furniture, textbooks) I would jump at the opportunity to take it. Sometimes I\u2019d take things I know I didn\u2019t need to sell for a small profit. The one thing I wish I could\u2019ve done was donate plasma, but being that I lived in Europe for a few years, no place would allow me to donate. My last college roommate did this weekly for cash.\n\nAfter college, I secured a job paying $43k per year in the field I studied, then got a promotion after a year and a half and a pay bump to $50k. I\u2019ve just accepted a new job that I\u2019m starting in 2 weeks making $60k a year. My past 4 years since graduating college have been very comfortable middle class living, while paying off student loans. I made the mistake of getting into some credit card debt, and financing a used car. In the past 1.5 years, with the help of reddit and Dave Ramsey, I\u2019ve started educating myself on personal finance. I\u2019ve used the snowball method to pay down over $20k in debt in that time. I intend on being debt free by May 2018 and then using my money to save for retirement and an emergency fund. I have a dog, I travel multiple times a year, and I am able to afford eating a healthy diet to keep my medical expenses low (all luxuries).  \n\nMy intent with this essay is to hopefully inspire people. I\u2019m sure there is someone out there who is going through very similar things to what 16 year old me was going through, and I want to say: Don\u2019t give up! My biggest takeaways would be:\n\n1.\tWork hard. This isn\u2019t the only factor to success but sure is a helpful one. When at work, you should always be the person who\u2019s willing to learn new things. No tasks should be \u201cbeneath you\u201d and you should try as hard as possible to avoid thinking \u201cI\u2019m not doing that because that\u2019s not my job\u201d. In my experience, managers see the friendly, hardworking and eager people and when there\u2019s an opportunity for a promotion or raise, you\u2019re first in their mind for the position. Of course if your work environment is dysfunctional and your work isn\u2019t appreciated, you should only do what you can manage, and search for a new job as much as possible. Also, don\u2019t be a brown noser \uf04a People see through that. \n\n2.\tBe resourceful. There\u2019s lots of ways to make extra money or save a little, and many people could identify one or two things in this category to incorporate into their life. Some people already are taking advantage of every opportunity and it\u2019s hard for me to give examples that will fit everyone\u2019s experience. But in my experience, things like living in a poorer neighborhood, getting a job that has additional benefits (like grocery stores that give you an employee discount, restaurants that feed you, gyms that you can utilize the showers and cut your water bill at home, etc), flipping gently used furniture that you find on the curb, donating plasma like my college roommate.\n\n3.\tKeep a positive attitude. This is probably the hardest thing to do when you\u2019re completely broke. I\u2019ve been there and still struggle with this sometimes, but it\u2019s necessary to keep a positive attitude. It helped me to picture my goals, imagining all the ways my life would be better in the future. The road to digging yourself out of poverty can be long, and you\u2019ve got to dig in your heels and just know that there are better things meant for you.\n\nAnyways, I think I\u2019ve rambled a little, but I tried to give an overview of some of the hurdles that I had to overcome and how I did it. I realize that I\u2019m very privileged being a white, straight female in the US. I also realize that I had some tremendous instances of luck to get where I am now.

        "original": "Acorns is an app I downloaded about two years ago. It directly links to your debit card, and with every purchase you make it takes the spare change from that purchase and deposits it into your account in Acorns. For example : if I were to buy a soda from a gas station, let\u2019s say it cost $2.40 acorns will then withdrawal .60 cents into your acorns account. Then, acorns invest your money into small stocks and gives you a free personalized portfolio that you can check and manage at any time! \n\nWhen I downloaded acorns two years ago I didn\u2019t touch it nor even look at one time. I decided I would use the money in my acorns account to spend on my honeymoon with my wife. When we were about a week away from the vacation, I checked my account and it was 500$, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. Acorns, is essentially a spare change jar that uses debit/credit transactions instead of physical dollar bills. It seriously has become a lifesaver for me and my wife when we are low on cash. It\u2019s also especially great for those who aren\u2019t that good at saving: because it automatically does it for you,  and the amounts are SO little you really don\u2019t notice your saving. \n\nI hope some of you take advantage of this app! As A 23 year old fully employed full time college student with two children, it was really done wonders for me and my family! Hope this helps, good luck!\n\nEDIT: also if your a college student they will let you use Acorns free of charge for four years until you have competed your degree!

        "title": "I saved $14,500 in 2 years making $26,000 per year (pre-tax)",
        "original": "I saved  $14,000 in 2 years making $26,000 per year (pre-tax).\nMy life circumstances are an example of how one can live a relatively happy life on a low income,  save a stable amount per month (I save ~$525-625 per month), and remain debt-free.\n\n\nPrecondition \u2013 Life outlook/philosophy  is one of the important factors in being able to live debt free on a low income.  One has to have little desire for consumption-based goods beyond food, shelter, and clothing. If I feel deprived because I don\u2019t own a car, or have a smart phone, or any type of luxury/pleasure item, then I have not yet eliminated my desires for purchasable pleasure objects . Desires should be shifted to experience-based pleasures, such hiking/walking, running, reading, meditation, cooking, chess, yoga, writing, playing a musical instrument, photography/drawing/painting, etc.\n\n\nOnce the core desires are shifted to experiences, then a plan is put into place so that one can stay out of debt and save money while working a low income job. \n\n\nWorking life \u2013having a high paying job makes budgeting, saving, and staying out of debt an easier prospect, but what about those people who for one reason or another are not able to acquire a good paying job? In my case I felt at ease working low paying jobs because of the low level of commitment and responsibility required for near minimum wage level work. As long as I showed up on time, did not call in sick every other week, and was accurate and fair in my work, then my employer was usually happy with my job performance. I do not have to bring the job home with me, can leave it at the office, and am free to do what I like in my off hours without any undue stress or expectations from my boss. The obvious negative aspect is these types of jobs usually pay minimum wage or a buck or two above it. \n\n\nBudget \u2013 I set up my budget on a google spreadsheet,  listing a week by week simple analysis of any income and expenses. My take home pay is currently $845 bi-weekly. I give myself $70 per week to spend on anything I would like, but it is all I can spend \u2013 so all of my food, toiletries, and everything else has to be purchased from this $70 amount. (Last year I gave myself $80, but when my home state decided to raise income taxes and I ended up losing $6 of income per week, I decided , partly to spite the state govt., to cut  my weekly spending by $10 a week, so instead of losing $25 out of my savings every month, I was now gaining $16.) The budget spreadsheet is effective, mainly because at the beginning of every week (Friday for me) I give myself $70 to spend in 7 days\u2019 time. While it can be challenging, I see it as a fun challenge and I rarely feel deprived of anything I may want or need.\n\n \nRent \u2013 spending $70/week while making $1690/month leaves $1375.  I am a single male with no dependents, so I am free to choose a dwelling as cheap and filthy or as rich and luxurious as my remaining cash will provide. I currently live in a major metropolis within walking distance of my downtown job. I pay $765 to live in a 1 bedroom condo with a roommate. Internet is included in rent, and the only utility to pay is half the electric, which averages to $20 month. Total rent/utilities/internet = $785/month.\n\n\nSavings \u2013 after giving myself $70 week x 4.5 weeks = $315/month, and adding rent $785, total monthly fixed expenses are $1100. I add $50 to this for miscellaneous costs, for a grand expense total of $1150. $1690 income - $1150 expenses = $540 savings per month. Some months I save more due to a short month. I average ~ $600 month in my savings.\n\n\nBi-Yearly bonus time \u2013 The best time of the year, for savings, are the 2 months out of the year when I receive 3 paychecks per month instead of 2. The extra $845 goes directly into savings, and I don\u2019t notice or miss the extra money, because week by week I get $70 to spend, rain or shine.\n\n\nThe \u201cbut how do you live without a car?!\u201d question. I grew up in a suburb where owning a car was as necessary as having air to breathe. No car = no work = no life.  Suburbs are built and planned for people who own cars, period. For people who live in rural areas, a car can also be a necessity due to the vast distances one must travel to get to work and places to buy things. Knowing that I would most likely be working minimum wage jobs due to my psychological work preferences, I looked for places to live where owning a car was not a necessity. Suburbs? No. Country life? No. Urban  = yes. I also found that living in university towns with a population density between 75,000-15000 also was a good place to live for people who did not want to own a car. During my lifetime I have lived mainly in university towns and big cities, and have not owned a car for the past 25 years.  The benefits of not owning a car are getting good exercise due to walking around town. This leads to good health, which means doctor visits are few and far between. \n\n\nSpeaking of doctors, what about health insurance?  I always carried health insurance when it was financially reasonable to do so. Prior to year 2000, health insurance in general was a decent system that allowed people to remain healthy, both physically and financially. At the beginning of the millennium, the USA health system went bonkers, and as premiums rose to ever greater heights, average Joe\u2019s making  $40,000 or less were severely penalized for simply having a health insurance policy.  Recognizing the health insurance system was off the rails, I declined to no longer participate. My health was decent due to all the walking I was doing due to not owning a car, and if I happened to have an emergency situation which required a hospital stay, I decided that being a low wage worker meant that I had too little to lose anyways \u2013 as Bob Dylan once sung, when you got nothing, you  got nothing to lose. If I ended up owing a hospital a large sum of money, I would go on a monthly pay plan and slowly pay the bill off.\n\n\nWith my budget spread sheet set up, I lived my life as best I could, and as each week passed I watched as my bank account grew to new heights. In 2012 I quit my low wage job and took my $30,000 in savings and traveled around the world for 2 \u00bd years. When I returned to the states I took another low paying job and began the process anew. I currently have $16,350 in savings, with zero debt. If my savings continue to grow at the current rate of $500-600/month, I am planning to resume my travels in 2019. \n\n\nThe best benefit of working low wage jobs? Easy to quit, and easy to gain. \n",

        "title": "An Overview of Poverty",
        "original": "Hi guys/gals,\n\nTo start, this is an awesome idea for a sub. Big ups to the mods for creating this, and hopefully people will benefit from the advice on this subreddit. I\u2019ll keep this post relatively short as a brief overview of understanding poverty.\n*Note: if people want, I\u2019ll continue adding useful information to this thread*.\n\n\n**Background Info**\n\n\nMy name is Manny, I\u2019m 29 years old and I grew up in poverty. As a kid, I saw my parents struggle financially, my dad worked extremely long hours, and they got stuck in the payday loan trap and we lost our childhood home. As I got older, I realized that most of their situation was due to *poor financial management*. \n\n\nFast-forward to now, I worked my way through graduate school and got a Masters in Public Health because I wanted to make a career out of helping the public. I\u2019m fortunate enough to work in a small team that launched a few pilots in clinical settings centered around poverty and while I had my personal anecdotes from my childhood, I also realized a trend in those who are economically challenged. I\u2019ll touch on a few topics here.\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m married, have 2 little ones at home, and make a *reasonable* income (the nonprofit sector isn\u2019t necessarily great for salaries, but that\u2019s not why we do it), and we\u2019ve learned how to properly budget along the way with a single income. With that being said, let\u2019s get to it.\n\n\n**What type of poverty are you in?**\n\n\nThis may sound like a silly question, but there are basically two types of poverty: generational and situational. Generational poverty is just what it sounds like \u2013 you basically grew up in poverty, and chances are, so did your parents and their parents before them. Situational poverty is when someone falls into poverty as a result of something happening \u2013 an accident resulting in injury, being laid off of work, some kind of medical expense, etc., and that person wasn\u2019t able to recover from that situation.\n\n\nChances are, if you\u2019re in generational poverty, you probably know many tips and tricks in terms of frugality. You\u2019ll likely know where the best bargains are, where the thrift stores are located, what kind of safety net programs are available, etc. If you\u2019re in situational poverty, you\u2019d likely have some kind of financial education, know how a 401k works, how to invest your money, and how to shop around for the best interest rates for different financial tools.\n\n\nThe point is, once you identify what type of poverty you\u2019re in, you can build from there. You can use tools from the *other* side of poverty. Many people make the mistake of assuming that what they know is common knowledge, when in fact it probably isn\u2019t. So for example, if you\u2019re in generational poverty and you know how to find good deals/bargains, you\u2019d probably think \u201cduh, who doesn\u2019t know how to do that?\u201d. Same goes for situational poverty and opening a 401k, for example. **Share** what you know with the sub, because what may be obvious to you may not be as obvious to someone else.\n\n\n**Know What Resources are Available to You**\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re in situational or generational poverty, the financial situation is still the same. **It\u2019s okay to get help when you need it**, there\u2019s no shame in doing so. There are tools and resources to cover your basic needs such as housing, food, and clothing. Each state and county has websites that will point you in the right direction. If you live in: Minnesota, North and South Dakota, or Montana, you can use: www.bridgetobenefits.org to see what programs you may qualify for. *note: I\u2019ll update this list to cover the rest of the country*.\n\n\n**SNAP**\n\n\nShort for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as the EBT Card or Food Stamps. The eligibility of the program and the amount you receive monthly goes by income, family household size, and/or whether someone is a senior or disabled (the income requirement is slightly less for the last bracket). I\u2019d post guidelines, but they differ by state and often fluctuate. Here\u2019s the FAQ link for the program:\nhttps://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligibility\n\n\n**Food Shelves and Pantries**\n\n\nAlmost everywhere you go there will be at least one food shelf or pantry available to you. They can have their own locations, be located in schools, or even medical centers. They won\u2019t go in depth with information such as income levels, paystubs, or citizenship \u2013 so don\u2019t worry about those. Feeding America has a food pantry/shelf finder that they keep up to date, just plug in your zipcode.\n\n\nhttp://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank/\n\n\n**Other Financial Assistance Programs**\n\n\nThe county has other programs available that provide financial assistance, daycare assistance, emergency cash assistance, and housing assistance. Google your county website and check their sidebars for these resources. \nAdditionally, many of the food shelves also offer additional services such as financial planning, cash assistance, and housing. The Salvation Army, for example, offers all of the above, including assistance with paying utilities, clothing, food boxes, emergency shelters, and even after school daycare programs.\n\n**Catholic and Jewish Charities**\n\n*Thanks for the suggestion @SqueehuggingSchmee*\n\nThese charities can be found nationwide, and they usually go by those exact names. They offer a variety of services, including: food shelves/pantries, clothing assistance, housing assistance, financial assistance, obtaining furniture, and much more. A lot of them also have financial advisers that can help you manage your finances, do your taxes (services are free, of course), and even provide temporary cash assistance for utilities.\n\nAn important thing to note is that these services aren't just for people of that religion -- they are open to anyone who needs assistance. I live in Minnesota, so I'll list the Catholic Charities website for the twin cities for reference. You can find your local Catholic or Jewish Charities with a simple google search.\n\nhttps://www.cctwincities.org/what-we-do/\n\n**Take the Time to Learn About Finances**\n\n\nSeriously. Financial management and living within your means is key. I know it sounds clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s because this concept is true no matter what your income level is. This isn\u2019t intended to downplay anyone\u2019s situation, it\u2019s to make the most out of it. \n\n\nFinances weren\u2019t exactly taught in school, we were too busy learning about polynomials (priorities, amirite?). Learning about finances is an investment in yourself. Get into the habit of:\n\n1. Checking your bank account regularly\n2. Making a list of items you need to purchase and adhering to it\n3. Minimizing the amount of trips to the store you need (we tend to buy a little extra here and there, and that adds up)\n4. Consider a financial management app\n5. Reduce the amount of automatic reoccurring payments you have for non-essential items (seriously, if you have monthly box subscriptions, Netflix, Hulu, Xbox Live, and a $20 blackcard membership, this adds up. This isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t have fun, but narrow it down to maybe Netflix for *some* entertainment, and you don\u2019t need that massage chair at Planet Fitness\u2026cut your membership down to $10/mo and focus on your health, not fancy perks).\n6. Don\u2019t use Credit Cards for amounts that you cannot pay off in its entirety during that billing period. This is the basic rule, and granted there are exceptions (0% APR offers for 1 year and using that for a big purchase that you can RESPONSIBLY pay for during that time). Otherwise, you\u2019ll end up throwing money away in interest fees.\n\n\n**Stop Buying Things You Don\u2019t Need**\n\n\nLet\u2019s face it. We\u2019re a consumer country. We\u2019re flooded with advertisements everywhere. We have a \u201ckeeping up with the Jonses\u201d mentality. Once you realize that this is a toxic mindset to have, you\u2019ll be much better off. \nGrowing up in poverty, my friends and I had an overwhelming urge to show that we weren\u2019t in poverty by being flashy. It\u2019s not uncommon for people in poverty to buy $200 pairs of Jordans, buy the new iPhone, and get into a car they couldn\u2019t afford. For me, personally, I blew whatever money I had on PePe Jeans, $150 timbs, etc. etc., despite being poor. \n\n\nWe don\u2019t need this stuff. Although now I could *afford* to buy the newest iPhone or some timberlands, I have a $100 MetroPCS LG Android phone and I wear Converses that I\u2019ve had (and taken care of) for 2 years. This isn\u2019t to say to become a slob and not have pride in how you look, but looking decent isn\u2019t expensive.\n\n**Stop Eating Out**\n\nYou'll be surprised how much it adds up. You think $5 here, $3 there isn't that bad, but if you're someone who frequents a restaurant, be it drive-thru or sit-down, I invite you to pull up a monthly account statement and add up all the times you've eaten out. \n\nEating out is pretty common for people in poverty, particularly because in many cases it's easier to eat something (or feed a family) off the dollar menu than preparing food at home. But, if you purchase the *right* foods and prepare them yourself, you can significantly save money by breaking down the cost-per-meal for foods prepared at home (bring it down to $1-$2/meal as opposed to the $3-$5 you spend in one sitting at a restaurant. \n\nThe key is to buy items that can be prepared into several meals. This includes but is not limited to:\n\n1. Rice\n2. Bread\n3. Whole chickens with everything in (if you're trying to stretch the dollar)\n4. Potatoes\n5. Canned meats such as tuna, albacore, etc.\n6. Eggs\n7. Sandwich meats and cheeses\n8. Canned (or bagged) beans\n9. Frozen veggies (usually much cheaper than the fresh produce isle)\n10. I'll add more based on suggestions\n\nNow, whether or not these items are the *healthiest* options or appropriate for some people (diabetics, etc.) is a whole other topic. The point is to emphasize that there are items that can be purchased, for relatively cheap at that, that can make multiple meals that are very inexpensive (and aren't junk foods). \n\nAlso, consider asking your local grocery store when they typically have sales on certain items such as meats and produce. Typically, grocery stores restock items during off hours (mornings, etc.) and sell items that are about to expire at a discounted price. This is typically done early in the mornings (7-9 am) on weekdays, though which weekday it falls on depends on the store. \n\n**As I mentioned earlier, I\u2019ll continue adding to this thread if people want. For now, my lunch break is over. Feel free to PM me or comment on this thread and I\u2019ll do my best to keep active with replies. Thanks!**\n",

With help from r/personalfinance I was able to take some strides in financial responsibility this year.  (Money in my family is more taboo than politics.)  But I have a question regarding how to best spend my tax return.  \n\nI'm 25 and my goal is to be debt free when I graduate in August -\n aside from my student loans and car loan.  I think this is totally possible.  I have had a good credit score in the past (I think 720 a couple years ago) but missed a car payment and went from a 640 to my current score of 576.  I have no big purchases I plan on making soon, except for moving into a new apartment with my brother after graduation.  I would like to be as close to 700 as possible so I don't have to front a massive security deposit. \n\nI plan on using my tax return to pay these debts.  The federal return is $3,134.  Here's what I have to pay off: \nBank loan: 1,233.52 (no penalty for full payment)\nCredit card: $946.29\nLeaving a surplus of $954.\n\nWith the surplus I at least need to get my car serviced.  I am way overdue (but as far as I can tell I have no serious issues).  I am not sure how much that will cost.  I would like to go to the dentist.  It's been years.  My school has a health service network that may have some discounts, but I do have dental insurance.  I probably have a couple cavities or other issues that need to be dealt with in more than just a cleaning. I have no emergency fund.  I have $480 in my savings, and about $1,000 in my checking account.  I work about 20 hours a week and make about $2,000 a month as a bartender so there is some flux there. \n\nHere are my questions:\n1. Am I smart to pay off these two debts in full all at once?  Or should I make a large payment, and continue paying off the balances monthly? \n2. Will these immediately help, hurt, or have no major effects on my credit score?\n3. How should I best allocate the rest of my tax return?  \n\nHappy to provide more information as needed.  Thank you for reading and any advice is appreciated. ",

My unemployment will pay my other bills, and I can afford food/clothes/hopefully save some money back up with my Pell Grants.

I know I can\u2019t be alone in this and hoping there are a few here that are in a similar boat.  \n\nI\u2019m in one to help address my credit debt which piled up as a result of being a one-income family around the time my son was born.  All bills were barely covered by my salary and everything else (food, clothing, gas, etc..) went on credit cards for about 2 years.  With high interest rates (lowest was 18% and highest 29%), I got to a point where the minimum payments were not doable for me.  I\u2019ve been in with the company I chose for about 2 years now with 2 years left.  I have paid off 4 accounts in that time period, currently paying 2 off now, and have 6 remaining.  Basically I\u2019m at the half way point now. It\u2019s definitely been difficult and have had to learn to budget better as well as working a full time, one consistent part time, and two occasional part time jobs to help make this work and save a little bit (~$50-60 a week average).  As with a comment on a previous post, I\u2019m fortunate enough to make a higher than average salary but student loans, mortgage, child care, etc.. make that check disappear very quickly.  Please don\u2019t take this as a complaint as I am thankful for what I have, but we make more than the maximum to qualify for any help or relief at all.  There was a time I felt there was more incentive to throw my hands up and say F it, but I\u2019m not wired that way and want to dig my family and I out of it even if it means juggling multiple jobs for a time to make it happen.  I keep my thoughts on where I want to be a few years from now and enjoying my family in the moment.  If I didn\u2019t have either of those things, this whole thing would be crushing.\n\nBankruptcy has been discussed but we believe we can do this without having to do that and in a shorter amount of time.  We chose to live in a town that is more affordable for the short term but want to get out to a better town within 5 years.  Bankruptcy would make that all but impossible.  Of course if it comes to it and the remaining 6 accounts I have yet to settle end up suing me, that may be my only option but so far so good and the light at the end of the tunnel is starting to be visible.\n\nFor the most part, I\u2019m happy with the program I chose and wanted to know any experiences of anyone else here.  It would be great to hear from those currently in them and those who have finished a similar one.  I\u2019m also hoping anyone thinking about it can use this as a resource to help determine whether they should do it or not.\n\nAnyone with a heavy amount of debt, keep plugging away!

        "original": "This may be a long one, so bear with me.\n\n10 years ago, the one person in my life that ever really mattered to me, my grandfather, died. At the time, I was 20 years old, living with him, and had just started a job answering phones for a helpdesk. At the time, I had a decade old car that always needed maintenance, and I was barely clearing $30,000 a year. After my grandfather died, I fell into severe alcoholism and any extra money that I had went to either drugs or alcohol. I was barely surviving, paying rent, feeding my addiction, and letting credit cards fall by the wayside. I made a habit of maxing out credit cards, paying the minimum monthly do on all of my loans, and taking numerous Payday advances. Every month I was in the red by $500 or more.\n\nThis went on for the next several years. It was a constant cycle of barely making enough money to get by, wasting the little bit of money I had, and repetitive life breaking debt. Honestly, I was very lucky to be able to hold down my full-time job, just making enough for rent, my vices, and instant noodles. I had dug myself into a hole of close to $200,000 in debt. Finally, I made the choice that I either needed to kill myself or turn my life around. I couldn't keep living the way I was.\n\nSoon after making this decision, I decided to admit myself to a rehab facility and get the addiction part of my life under control. It was the first step that I actually took to building a better life for myself.\n\nWhile the addiction part of my story probably won't resonate with everyone, it is something that I like to point out because I feel that most people have some addiction or vice that partially controls their lives. From alcohol, to smoking too much weed, to playing too many video games. The story tends to be the same, with different aspects.\n\nI would love to tell everyone that after I got sober I was able to pull myself up by the bootstraps and slowly dig myself out of the hole I had made. The truth of the matter is, I had far too many credit card payments, medical bills, and student loans. Even after cutting out my vices, every penny I made went to paying off debt. At 27 I made a choice. The right choice for me was to file bankruptcy. That is definitely not the right choice for everybody, but for me it cleared up over $2,000 a month.\n\nI continue to work, and eventually moved myself into a new location in the same career. By doing this I doubled my income. Any minute that I was not at the day job, I was Finding ways to work online or create a marketable skill that I could monetize on. My normal day consisted of working 18 hours, 7 days a week. My body and mind were beat to hell, but I was able to continue making payments on all of the remaining debts that I could not clear out with bankruptcy.\n\nRoughly three years later and I am happy to say that, other than a minimal car loan on a 4 year old car, I am completely debt-free. I have paid off a hundred thousand in student loan debts, all of my bills are completely caught up, my credit is repaired and even higher than it was pre-bankruptcy, and I am a few years ahead on mortgage payments\n\nMy advice: the first step to any progress is to determine what is holding you back. Once you identify the factors in your life that are keeping you from doing what you want, fix or get rid of them. After that, work at something that is going to benefit your life. Lose a little sleep to work online, or pick up a second part-time job. Stop falling into the trap of credit card debt and cash advances. They are cancer.\n\nI know I am just some asshole on the internet, so take what I say with a grain of salt. Figure out what works for you, and go do it. Good luck to everyone here, and I truly wish you all the best in going forward with your lives and dreams.",

But I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any way I can afford to pay rent and bills without working full time (or more), and I struggled enough in high school working full time, let alone college (I have mental illnesses that affect my executive function). I was thinking and researching ways I could earn extra money to save to help me lower my hours and I saw americorps. I live close by to the Denver campus currently, so there wouldn\u2019t be a huge move. \n\nThey provide room and board, in addition to about a $400/month stipend. That means I\u2019d have ~$150 to save monthly if I cut out my hobbies (embroidery) or ~$100 if I kept up with them. Which means between 1000-1500 saved by the end of the program. They provide an education award at the end of a little less than 6k. This would pay completely for about 3 semesters of community college. I could then take out minimal loans and also use those to help me reduce my hours. \n\nFinancially this seems to be a very smart move. But I have a few concerns, mostly that I would probably have to put my education off another year. Americorps requires at least 1700 hours of service in 10 months which ends up being a little more than full time. I could do maybe one or two online classes during that time. In addition, I have exercise-induced asthma that may make it difficult to perform the types of work most programs focus on (for example; building homes for Habitat for Humanity). \n\nSo I was wondering what other people\u2019s perspectives were on this, and if anybody has person experiences with Americorps I\u2019d love to hear about it.

As this is pretty low income in the UK, I thought I\u2019d share how I do this as it may be applicable to any low-income people in the UK.\n\nI track every penny I spend on a spreadsheet I made where I separate everything up into columns, e.g.:\n\nRent (\u00a3367 + \u00a37.5 Wi-Fi) \u2013 very cheap for my city and includes everything. I do however live with three other guys so it\u2019s not a long-term solution, but I like the people I live with right now and the landlady is great, so it worked out well for the time being.\n\nPhone (\u00a312) \u2013 I use my sisters old iPhone 5 which I repaired for \u00a310 a couple of years ago, I will use it until I cannot fix it anymore. The \u00a312 is on a BT mobile contract.\n\nFood (\u00a3128 per 30-day month) \u2013 I buy most things at Lidl now which has cut my costs considerably, so I aim to spend less than this per month and put the rest into other categories.\n\nTravel (\u00a345.2) \u2013 I travel to my girlfriend\u2019s city twice a month so I know how much it will cost.\n\nRepayment (\u00a350) \u2013 I repay an interest free loan which I will have fully paid off in Jan 2019. I will add this money to savings when the loan is repaid.\n\nHoliday savings (\u00a350) \u2013 I am going to start hiking on weekends as a minibreak (I enjoy being in the countryside, it\u2019s something I used to do so I know I like it already). I would like to save up enough to go to Asia at some point next year though. \n\nEntertainment money (\u00a350) \u2013 I can spend this on anything each month, this usually means cinema, the occasional beer with colleagues and maybe a restaurant. (Although I really hate restaurants, it infuriates me if I eat a burger at a restaurant and realise my homemade burgers are better. Tipping also annoys me as I probably make less money than them.)\n\nAll the columns are averaged over the number of days that I have been tracking them. I\u2019m currently on day 88 so I feel like my average is pretty accurate to what I actually spend and that it is sustainable for a long period. I therefore have \u00a3503.05 left over which I save. Half goes into a Vanguard index fund. (I played poker online when I was younger and have learnt to be emotionally comfortable with large swings in the short term \u2013 I have been keeping an eye on the market more than I usually would recently though.) I currently leave the other half in my bank account. I am planning on moving it over to a 5% interest rate savings account which last for a year before the interest is reduced.\n\nI also made a video about this, basically the same but you can check it out if you want: https://youtu.be/M76JTA1fcY8\n\nEDIT: I will pay the loan off in Jan 2019, not Jan 2018.",

I\u2019ve always wanted to post in personal finance but felt too poor to do so. \n\nI\u2019ve made some poor decisions the last two years leading me to this point. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. No one will help me any further, for good reason I don\u2019t blame them. \n\nAbout me:\n-college grad\n-lost my job two days ago (on good terms, they said I could come back in a few months if I want) \n- fianc\u00e9 is unemployed also looking for a job, no school experience \n- engaged, living with my fianc\u00e9 and two roommates\n\nFinancial situation:\n\n-Roomie makes a lot of money and is our best friend. Understands our situation and is taking over Rent and utilities until we\u2019re back on our feet \n\n- Two loans out. One is $120 every two weeks for the next year. This was feasible with my job. The second one is four payments of $120 and a grand finale payment. Both will most likely go into collections... I\u2019m not sure what to do about them. \n\n- vet bill when my cat almost died. Haven\u2019t been able to make a payment in so long idk what\u2019s going on with it. \n\n- A month 1/2 ago my grandparents lent me $1400 dollars to get caught up. I used this to pay to fix my car and pay off a third loan and some other payments. I don\u2019t think they are willing to help me anymore.\n\nMy main concern:\n\n- I owe $671 in car payments since January. I called the bank yesterday and the lady was so mad and mean. I told her I get my next/last paycheck next Friday (I didn\u2019t tell her it was my last), and that every penny of it can pay the car. She said it was unacceptable and I needed payment today. Asked if I could borrow money from anyone. I said probably not... next thing I know a repo truck was at my parents house and they were calling me super pissed off. \n\n- Besides all this we have no money for food, gas, or my medicines. I\u2019m not even sure where to start here. \n\n\nSo... I don\u2019t know what my options are.\n- my mom told me to look up a bankruptcy lawyer and I may be able to keep my car. Is this true? \n\n- My grandparents and Aunt are well off but doubt they want to help me. I would rather not ask anyways. \n\n-Despite my financial problems my mental health problems and anxiety are almost leading me to suicide. I have one more day of insurance but don\u2019t want to go to the hospital. I do have a therapy appointment today though. \n\nWhat is your experience with bankruptcy, or losing your job while in debt? \n\nEDIT: \n\nThank you all so much for your advice. I didn\u2019t think my family would help me but my parents just paid my car so I don\u2019t have another payment until May. I feel so bad but they did what they could because I can\u2019t get a job without a car. \n\nI also forgot 1k in credit card debt but it\u2019s only $20 a month so no big deal. \n\nI\u2019ve also started to apply for unemployment and food stamps, also looking for a new job.

Basically the new job would be resume building experience. Prospective rent would be half of my income (which I know I should aim to spend only a quarter). As well i would have to pay for a flight there, put a down payment to be a part of the program (with monthly installments available), pay for international health insurance, as well as costs associated with moving. Im looking at roughly $1,000 USD to get to the new country and establish myself. \n\nAt this time my income is stable but I have next to no savings.

(how she tripled her income between 1985 and 1991 has to do with a fly by night trade school and the lottery starting up in our then-midwestern state and looking at tradeschools to fill these new positions; not important, but the point is, that is a thing that happened.)\n\nyet, several years and a job transfer to socal into this financial boon, i noticed that we still weren't doing any better.  she was still going into debt with fingerhut, still buying magazines in the hopes of winning the publisher's clearing house, still taking me shopping with her tax refunds, and we still never seemed to have the money for essentials despite her income tripling.  i took note of all of this, and about four months pregnant, i insisted she let me take over her finances. i framed it as \"i'm bored, stuck at home pregnant, i need something to do.\"  my mom's response, and i quote, was, \"well, you can't be worse at it than i am.\"\n\n i created a budget for groceries. clipped coupons, and made the savings each week an adventure, coming home crowing that i'd saved $10 or $15.  i started fudging her check register - a check for $28.43, i entered into the register as $30, or $33.  any found money (such as tax refunds) went into savings.  anything left over from the basics went into savings.  within six months, she had the first savings account she'd had, ever.  granted, it was maybe $500, but $500 in savings was a couple of tires, or a car repair, or a plumbing disaster already taken care of that in years prior would've been a missed bill.  i gave her a tiny allowance for garage sales (her favorite pass-time), and if she came back to me for more, later, i said no.  she thought i was a genius.\n\nanyway, when my son was six months old, she had to move.  long story, but it was a choice between taking severance at 53 or moving with the company.  i counseled her to do the latter, for her own well-being, but that left me on my own.  i immediately enrolled in my own fly by night trade school.  i recognized nearly immediately that it was useless, but i did my six months' time and ignored their promises for placement and with my newfound typing and \"wordperfect 123\" skills, immediately signed up for temp agencies.\n\nfast forward six months, i'd 'graduated' and was temping for between $8 and $10 hour.  (those of you in that range currently should be OUTRAGED; this was 25 years ago.)  i was living with baby daddy so he was paying the rent, but i was covering childcare, child expenses, personal expenses, our personal food (baby daddy was a bit of a dick).\n\nfast forwarding again 1.5 years, i was again on my own.  with a toddler who was disabled, paying:\n\n$510 rent for my own apartment  \n$265 car payment  \n$130 car insurance  \n$400 childcare (yeah, this was awhile ago)   \n$35 for electricity  \n$100 a month, roughly for gasoline  \napprox $300 credit card payments (because i had by that time 17 lines of credit due 30% to wanting to feel like i had money, so shopping at discount retailers for new sheets and christmas presents for my son, the other 70% covering legit expenses where i fell short - car repairs, fridge repairs, etc.  by the time i was 23, i was 20K in debt between the cards, car, and student loan.   \nwhat little was left for groceries.  (we lived on rice a roni and tuna/peas/mac and cheese at this time -- white trash buffet for sure)  \n\ni'd already been couponing at this point for a few years, so knew how to make the grocery and diaper budget stretch.  lots of tuna helper and luvs.\n\nat this time, the time i got my apartment, i had a real job - not a temp job - that paid $1800 a month gross. plus, $200 a month in child support and $335 a month in SSI due to my son's disabilities.  so my net on this was roughly $1700 a month, and you can see from the simple math above that this left me with nothing after the bills were paid.  healthcare was cheaper and better in the early 90s, so that was almost free, to be honest:  i was able to take my son to doctors that i couldn't dream of him seeing now.   about $10 a month of payroll deductions.  so my son's myriad appointments cost little more than the gas and parking, which at the time was very minimal.  early 90s, remember.  but when i say 'minimal', i'm speaking from my standard of living today, where a $20 parking fee doesn't bother me.  at the time, it HURT paying $5 for same..\n\nyet, i managed to build a 'cushion'.  i did this by:\n\ni calculated my monthly expenses in total and divided by two, because i was paid twice a month.  each payday, i'd enter the net into my register, subtract that half, so that i knew from the get that was money i couldn't spend. yes, it left me with $5 in the register, but the bills were already accounted for as they came due.\n\nthen, every time i swiped my debit card or wrote a check, i entered it PLUS in the register.  $37 at ralphs became $40.  etc. honestly, it took only a few months before my check register showed 20% or so less than i actually had. i pretended i didn't have that extra 20%; every month, i transferred the excess to savings, ensuring my math was perfectly accurate so i never bounced (and i never did).\n\ntax refunds were not \"catch up on bills\" or \"spoil the kid\".  they went straight to savings and i pretended i didn't have it.\n\nlong story short, within about two years of this routine, despite bringing home a pittance, i had an actual savings account.  so that the next time  my ex slashed my tires, i could pay in cash to replace them, rather than charge them to my already maxed out pep boys card.\n\nno, this didn't help me to get out of debt.  what it did was help me SURVIVE while not accruing MORE debt, and in poverty finance, that's legit the first step.\n\nso that's it, at this point. if you're interested in how i went from this to clawing my way out of debt and having more in my checking account than my mother saw combined in her entire lifetime, i'll be happy to share it, but for this part, it really was just a matter of finding savings where i could and playing funky math with my registers. it did require diligence, but when you're balancing on shit, you sort of need every idea you can come by to not topple over into it.  and because the bulk of my family is still poor, i can also share the mistakes they continually make that keep them there. i see them, but they don't, and they aren't interested in listening.  but the mistakes are obvious.\n\n",

I finished a degree (by 20), but it turned out to be pretty fruitless.  I believed in having a job in my career field before graduating and like many others learned they sold us on promises they couldn't uphold.  (Pro tip:  go to community/reputable college or a trade in demand.)  \n\nGot married at 21 (no big wedding so we spent less than $300 for everything necessary.)\n\nRecession hits:  we both lose employment and go to rock bottom at the same time i end up pregnant (prior trying before recession became a thing.)  \n\nThe only thing we could initially find was walmart for both of us.  (Both of working for $8/hr and still qualified for assistance.)\n\nI ended up losing my job there due to having to get kids out of daycare sick and they do not have a flexible or friendly call off system.  Many companies moved to a point system.  \n\nTrip 2 to college:  STEM degree associates but didnt have enough to finish a bachelor's due to prior itt tech loans.  \n\nI was rehired at walmart while finishing coursework and worked 3rd shift opposite of my husband so we didn't have to worry about daycare or one of us losing employment for a kid being sick etc.  \n\nDuring this time we ended up in public housing, food stamps, Medicaid and pipp (utilities).  He also had 2 back surgeries that would periodically put him out of work.  \n\nEvery little change had to be reported and any little change could throw me off budgeting.  \n\nFinally i found a breakthrough with a temp agency as a lab tech for a company.  Pay raide and beginning real job benefits.  I would work 60 hours a week (their cap.)  \n\nAfter 9 months I had an offer for a better paying position as a quality tech for a food manufacturer.  I hated this job with a passion but i ended up getting massive overtime since no one else was reliable and they struggled to get people in to work.  (60-70 hours a week.)  \n\nAbout this point my husband finished welding certification and was working gaining job experience as well.\n\nSix months after that i landed a job in another state where i make a decent salary, have great benefits, enjoy my work and the people i work with, have opportunity for advancement, and my husband is also making more from the position he found after i moved us.  (I know moving is not easy and i made huge sacrifices to be able to do it.  The more flexibile you are to leave where you are the more opportunities are out there for you to pursue.)\n\nNow my goals are to pay down my debts (credit cards and student loans) so that i can own a house.

I'd like to use my personal story as an example: I've had mental health problems most my life, but no real problems. Then I had a nervous break down almost 4 years ago. Went back to school since I couldn't keep my job. After 2 years, was told I should quit school because it was complicating mental and physical health issues. I went and got my CDL and drove bus for a year. After jumping through a bunch of hoops, my doctor said he couldn't sign off on my medical recertification and lost my license. I'm not supposed to do school or job training or any job that causes \"undue stress\" or exacerbate my condition. There's more, but the gist is this: My ability to earn is limited by external factors. And there are a lot of people here who have the same problem.\n\nI'd really like to see some resources, discussion, options that address some of the following key issues I've seen come up and remain unaddressed in this sub and pf:\n\n* Disabilities. Many people are unable to complete basic physical tasks, work 40 hours a week or learn new skills. Information on \"alternate\" employment and learning opportunities would be huge, as well as on applying for permanent or short term disability. Organizations out there that can help, websites that can help, etc.\n\n* Child care problems. If you have a child your ability to earn is automatically limited. 24/7 child care centers are incredibly rare, even in urban areas. You can only work hours you have child care, and the jobs you take have to cover the cost of care at a minimum. If you are lucky enough to have child care assistance, you can only accept jobs that don't subject you to the welfare cliff. If you make too much you lose the assistance and can't afford the job anymore.\n\n* Support networks. If you live in a HCOL area, but are disabled or a single parent, moving may not be possible. If you need help from friends and family regularly for basic tasks, you may be at the whim of their schedule. Many people in these situations are completely dependent on the help of friends and family. It limits their ability to find work and make money. Finding alternative support networks is incredibly difficult if not impossible. Resources for flexible employment and information on organizations that can help fill in the gaps in support networks would be invaluable.\n\nSome things I feel I have to offer:\n\n* For those who have difficulties attending school or job training, self-paced learning may be an option. Saylor Academy, Code Academy, Khan and others offer the opportunity to study as you need and can until you can test for college credit or certification.\n\n* Your local unemployment office may be able to work with you in finding positions you can hold. There are frequently people available to sit down with that you can explain your limitations to, and then as a team you can set out to identify whats available to you.\n\nEdited formatting issues.",

        "original": "I got my dog while coming out of being super poor. I still underestimated the financial impact, but I was in a more stable financial place with a steady serving job, going to school and not quite so starving. But I had plenty of friends that were not in the same place and had a dog or cat. And I think there should be some real talk on this forum about being a poor pet-owner. \n\nFirst, that everyone might be in on you should never own any animal while you\u2019re in dire straits. But the solution is not everyone get rid of their pets! Some people might and should, but let\u2019s be real. It\u2019s depressing being poor and these are not breed standard show dogs. \n\nThey\u2019re prolly rescues, I knew a lot of strays being saved by myself and friends. And they love you. Sometimes it\u2019s the only thing that got us through. Coming home and someone loves you. Maybe you can\u2019t get your life in order, but you can keep a dog/cat happy. Some people have no idea how shitty you can feel and suddenly life is not so bad. And again, most of these pets were not these super adoptable animals. They\u2019re scruffy, ugly, lovable mongrels. So I\u2019d like to see where people can talk about taking care of yourself and a pet and when it really is just too far out of reach currently.\n\n\nSecond, what you need to budget for if you\u2019re serious.  \n\nSo the big obvious CON:\nThey\u2019re expensive. They need food and not exactly the cheapest. Def not the most expensive. Research what you can do for budget. \n\nAnd they need a vet. Also research your options. No matter what they are, you\u2019re so much better off with spay/neuter. If you thought adding a pup/kitten dependent was expensive, try not adding a dozen more. (No breeding ideas either, watched this go so wrong with people I knew and was so expensive. This is not a good \u201cbusiness\u201d to try!)\n\nTake parasites and fleas seriously, because guess what, they can give you both and/or very gross and costly consequences. \n\nPRO: \n\nI\u2019ve seen people not take care of themselves, but suddenly take a budget/job/job search more seriously because they want to take care of them. I made hard choices, responsible ones, because it wasn\u2019t just about me anymore. Easy to go out and drink on a Saturday night when there\u2019s no one to answer to. Not so easy when I\u2019m missing puppy cuddles and I\u2019m watching $ disappear quick. I kept it to 1-2 drinks or found myself spending much more time at home. I had somewhere to be. She can\u2019t stay locked up in the apartment all night.\n\nFinally, depression is so rampant in being poor. Sticking to budgets, trying to get yourself together. Long shitty weeks at hard shitty jobs. So much harder to stay down when they\u2019re at home to lift you up. I really feel like this made a difference in my life with my best friend, Maggie the Magnificent . And it made a difference in a lot of my friends lives and mental well being. \n\nBut I\u2019d like to know if anyone had tricks/tips to being a poor pet owner. And what everyone thought budget impact versus responsibilities/goal keeping along with emotional health consequences. I thought this was a good place to discuss. What do you guys think?",

        "original": "Forgive the essay, but my life is a rollercoaster.\n\nBackground:\n\nMy parents were atrocious with money. As in, they inherited a house, sold it, and blew almost all of 400k in a few years. As in, we lived on a campsite for a year, in a tent, as a family of 5, when my baby sister was still around 5-6. As in, they used to go through my bags and take my money that I, at 14-16, made selling crafty stuff. Anyone who knows me already knows who I am from those 3 lines. :P\n\n\nThe money issues were not the only ones, so I left home at 16 and was helped by a youth homelessness project. Although I was legally homeless, I never slept rough, though I did spend a couple of nights on the bare floor of a bare flat that was full of paint fumes. At the time I was on welfare, sitting A-levels, and working bit jobs to make up odds. My total income was around \u00a38k/y, of which 4k went on housing, but I still saved 2k after living expenses were done.\n\n\nThen, though the only year of uni I did, I carried on the bit jobs and got a living assistance/maintenance grant. Realized I made more by the hour on tutoring than I would in a graduate job and dropped out of my degree.\n\n\nI was off government support and establishing an actual registered business at 19. Paid my last debts (\u00a3400 owed to child benefit from when I was looking after my little sister) at 20. \n\n\nFast forward five years and I'm 24, financially stable as a self-employed writer and translator, debt free, with \u00a313k in the bank and \u00a36k in shares, married, with a kid that got to 15 months costing me under \u00a31200.\n\n\nSo not a \"rags to riches\" so much as a \"rags to nice rags\" story. But I've been through loads of situations, seen loads of the most dangerous financial traps, and come out on top without resorting to surviving off forage or weaving my own clothing fabric.\n\n\nSo AMA about being a \"welfare brat\" and the path I took out of it. I just want to help whoever I can with my experiences and tips.\n\n\nTagging u/rassmann as requested for official approval. Starting in 1h 15min from now, but just drop your Qs in whenever. :)",

I'm not considered low income anymore, but for 24 years of my life I was below the poverty line. My single mother has been all of her life, and my husbands family rings the same tune. Some of our family is in poverty due to stubborness, others by lack of oppertunity and disability. I criticize no one who is below that line, this was my life. \n\nIt is currently my sister in law's life. It has been her life for over 30 years. My husband and I are adopting her eldest child. A boy, 12 years old. My SIL uses all of the government facilities that she can, to our knowledge and is still struggling. She has never bought the kids clothes, her groceries come from donation pantries and her appliances and furniture found from the side of the road or hand me downs when she is fortunate. These last few years her luck has gone from bad to worse, and there is nothing we as a family have been able to do other than continue to enable her. There have been times these last few years the kids have gone without properly sized clothes, without electricty and without food that wasn't from home. \n\nMy SILs youngest daughter is now living with her Biological father. Well cared for, fed, happy, healthy. Her Son? Not so much. He's been bounced around from home to home to couch to closet. He's been in and out of school so much he's going to have to repeat. He's been bullied and picked on so much he's made last minute decisions to alter his appearance in drastic ways. \n\nWe are taking guardianship of him on the 9th. This is the very first time in his life that he will have a permanent address, a home, clothes that fit, a meal every single meal time. Best of all, he's staying in the family. He knows everything and has consented to it as well as all involved adults. This will allow my SIL to focus on herself, her money and her life. It will allow a 12 year old to be exactly that, 12. \n\nSo honestly, in my opinion, unless you have been where either this 12 year old has been, his sister has been or his mother. You shouldn't really be telling people what to do and what's best for them. \n\nThat's all I got. If the mods keep this post up, ask me anything. If you wanna downvote me, do it. But inform yourself of individual situations. \n\nThanks. ",

I hope it helps some people here have hope.\n\nI dropped out of college in my second year due to longstanding medical difficulties. I was unemployed and without an income for several months, and when I was finally able to go job hunting, all I could find was a 20 hour a week, 7.75/hr retail job stocking shelves. I was living on less than $8,000 a year, and despite living in an absolute rathole of an apartment with relatively cheap rent, I had to juggle bills every month just to stay afloat.\n\nAfter about a year of constantly dealing with power shut off notices, a crummy job, eating maize porridge for two meals a day, and the simple stress and anger of poverty, I had had enough, and decided I would make one change at a time to better my situation. Here's what I did:\n\n- Got rid of my car and bought a bike. This was remarkably difficult, as I live in the midwest where winters get cold as shit, and it meant an hour bike ride to and from work, but I saved a lot of money on gas and maintenance.\n\n- Joined a garden co-op. In exchange for working a certain number of hours a week, I was allowed to take home a *lot* of free vegetables and potatoes. This greatly reduced my already pathetic grocery bill.\n\n- In addition to the above, I cut out all non-essential grocery items-- no more coffee, cookies, or cheap beer.\n\n- I started volunteering at church and the local museum to help build my resume.\n\nWhen I finally had some money saved up for a deposit for college, I wrote a heartfelt letter to the dean of admissions explaining my situation. I was allowed to re-apply, and in the meantime, I searched for all the scholarships I could possibly find. Thanks to my efforts, I was able to attend my first year back without having to pay a single penny. I kept my 20 hour a week job to save money on the side, and was able to complete my college education.\n\nI got a job in IT making 45k a year, and thanks to my \"poverty-PTSD,\" I was able to save a lot of money. After a couple of years, I moved to a state with higher IT salaries and make just shy of 60k. \n\nThis was a remarkably difficult time in my life and I understand how crushing poverty is. I know my situation does not apply to everyone in this sub, but I hope it provides some hope to at least some people.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "original": "I've always had a terrible time renting. I think just because I've never really had a lot of money, I haven't been able to be particular about where I live at all. I've always been vulnerable to slumlords. I was doing OK for a little while but I had to move out on my own after a breakup in my 20s. One of my first apartments was this tiny little studio in this old rehabbed hotel-turned-apartment complex. There were no outlets in the kitchen and there was the occasional mouse. It was fine until the ceiling started to leak after an ice storm had broken the roof apart from the structure of the building. The management company ignored my pleas for help for weeks and weeks and eventually realized they couldn't fix a leaky roof merely by putting fresh drywall over it (seriously). They realized they had to move me to another building. I still had something like 8 months on the lease so I had to move to another building they owned, which I was super happy about because they had a great track record /s/.  \nThey moved me and my new boyfriend to this shitty apartment complex, farther away from where I worked, where the rent was more expensive, and it was in a slightly shittier neighborhood. I had no money, what else could I do? We moved into the 3rd floor walkup on Valentine's Day (in Chicago, so it was like 15 degrees at the time). The problems started very quickly. First, mice, all the time. We put out tons of traps. We killed two or three mice PER DAY for MONTHS. They sent exterminators, it never fixed the problem. Then there was a fire. We woke up one morning at 5 AM to the sound of sirens and breaking glass. Many of the units in my building were straight up on fire. We had to gather our belongings into a few Ikea bags and sit in a bus that the Red Cross parked outside. It was literally 0 degrees that day. There was no structural damage to OUR part of the building or our unit so we were legally allowed to enter the building and, because the fire was caused by ARSON and not shoddy wiring, we had no grounds to break the lease. We didn't have the money to move anyway but my parents didn't want their daughter to die in a fire so they were willing to front me some money.  \nThe fire caused them to do a lot of work in the building with spooked the mice. They were gone. It was nice for a few days until we realized they were keeping the roach infestation at bay. Exterminators didn't help. One crawled on me in the middle of the night and I said \"fuck this, we need to move.\" We had some money saved up and we hired a lawyer and we broke our lease and we found a new place to live.... but we're broke, and when we go to sign the lease, the landlord informed us that the lease would only be 9 months because she was going to sell the place afterwards. She didn't tell us this when we saw the apartment and initially chose it. We had our backs to a wall and signed, spending the next 9 months in a place with something like half our belongings packed into boxes.  \nWe eventually moved out of that place and into the place we're in now where, because I have what can probably be considered renting induced PTSD, I basically expect any and all interactions with landlords to be terrible. And, even though my landlord is nice, and my apartment is nice, I still live with fear that we won't be able to re-sign the lease, or that they'll randomly raise our rent $300, or we'll find our we're living under a raccoons nest or something.  \nI'm tired of flushing $17,000 a year down the toilet because that's just what it costs to rent something DECENT in the city. And with all of this, I still don't feel like I'm on solid ground, ever. I don't make a ton of money but this has really made me want to be good, save my money as hard as I can, and earn some fucking EQUITY, and feel like a human being with a place in the world.  \n  \n\n**What are YOUR renting horror stories?**",

        "title": "While not the safest and best option, if you are considering the military to escape poverty, you can absolutely do it.",
        "original": "Hey all,\n\nI'm a long-time lurker of r/personalfinance and I am really glad for the formation of this subreddit.  With that, I wanted to share some of my insight and experience for anyone who is young and is considering joining the military. I can not recommend this to every single person, but for anyone who is young and in high school and has been looking at the military as an option after high school due to the current cost of higher education, I hope this post will provide you some insight to make the best possible decisions should you follow the military route.\n\nTo give a baseline on where I was on the socioeconomic ladder: I grew up as an impoverished immigrant living in America. My family of 4 spent the first 15 years in the United States living in a tiny 1 bedroom apartment with my mom and my sister in the bedroom and me and my dad in the living room.  My dad had a bad back so I much slept on the floor while he took the couch.  I also went to bed hungry more times than I want to remember and if I was eating dinner, a bowl of rice and pepperoni was pretty much a luxury meal to me back then.\n\nDuring my senior year of high school, all my peers were applying for colleges and excitedly talking about what majors they were to declare if they got accepted into their dream school.  If there is one thing I can remember about adolescent poverty, it's that you feel SO removed from everyone else being excited over their future prospects while you feel like you're trapped behind a glass wall watching all your friends dream of a future that you realistically can not obtain.\n\nI was young, angry, and poor but I knew that I wanted to go somewhere in life after high school while all my friends left for college so I started looking at the military.  To be honest the decision was pretty easy, the people I was close with the most in high school were ALL going away to college.  I was faced with the prospects of literally having my entire social circle gone the moment summer after high school which made me take the military route extremely seriously.\n\nNow given that the US military has 5 branches (it's easy to forget the Coast Guard counts but they are the red headed 5th branch), it's extremely important to select the best branch that culturally aligns with who you are and what are you looking for.  I would equate to joining a particular branch of the US military as joining a company with the best \"cultural fit.\"  I ended up selecting the United States Army and served 6 years with a 1-year tour in Afghanistan which was the best/worst time of my life.\n\nBut the perks that come from serving:\n\n- First ensure that you have the Post 9/11 GI Bill in your enlistment contract, this is what will 100% fund tuition for any public university in the United States as well as a monthly living stipend based on the cost of living in your surrounding area.  This is called \"Basic Allowance Housing\" aka BAH.  If you went to college in the Silicon Valley area in California, you could literally collect $3k - $5k a month in BAH with tuition already covered separately while going to school while everyone else is borrowing money to finance their education.\n\n- You are eligible for a VA Home Loan when you get out, this allows you ZERO down for a home.  The downside is that you'll have a significantly higher monthly mortgage than someone who used 20% down for conventional financing, but you could be starting off your adult life with a free college degree and access to a $0 home loan. If you feel like the rate of saving up for a downpayment is not catching up to the rate of inflation of home prices, you can lock something in with $0 and then refinance a few years later to lower your monthly payments on your home.\n\n- While this was more circumstantial, but I was insulated from the 2008 recession while I was in the military.  I still had a steady paycheck that I was able to routinely send back to help my parents whereas my peers had their parents withdraw their ability to support their kids for college and many of my peers panicked and started taking out loans to continue their education.  Some dropped out of college entirely or transferred to cheaper schools and spiraled into a few years of depression because they had to leave their dream school due to financial reasons.\n\n- The discipline and the environment that the military can provide completely changed my attitude on how I saw myself, others, and the world.  I am a lot more mellow now but I can't say that happens to everyone, some people come off the military with severe emotional damage.  But with the proper mindset and pro-active search for FREE mental healthcare as a veteran through the VA when you get out, it is definitely possible to translate your experience into powerful learning tools and condition yourself to persevere as to not let yourself or others down in the civilian sector.    \n\n-  If you're really smart, you can start investing and using your military pay and put money towards a Roth or stocks since you won't have to worry about rent or food expenses like that of your college peers. That's my largest regret, not using every moment of my Army time to invest through my entire enlistment contract. \n\n- The meticulous care and maintenance devoted to my aid bag and my rifle was something I carried over to my care.  I took the initiative when I got out of the Army to start changing my own oil and then I started looking how to replace my fuel filter, my cam follower, air intake filter, spark plugs, coil packs, etc. which has saved me THOUSANDS annually in car repairs.  \n\n- Aside from attaining financial capital through the GI Bill/VA Loan, the military can be a giant brotherhood so there is a social capital you have earned amongst a particular demographic in society that can make the \"catch up\" game more feasible.  My professor in college was extremely impressed that I was a combat veteran and gave me a letter of recommendation for hiring my senior year of college which led to me getting a job offer just two weeks after collecting my diploma from my university.  While there is a stigma of the damaged PTSD veteran, there is also a stigma that the military molds young men and women to perform high-risk operations with an expected level of precision and discipline to mitigate injury or death in a combat environment which can be marketable while looking for your first job out of college.\n\n- There are MANY programs to assist veterans should you slip up.  There non-profits dedicated to helping veterans who may be in danger of losing their housing.  If you graduated with your degree and are struggling to find employment, there are a variety of Veteran career mentoring networks (especially on LinkedIn) available that will help you translate all your military experience into a business oriented manner that the business world can identify with.\n\nThe military comes with a lot of risks (dying/getting maimed/emotional trauma), but for any young person considering it as an option to boost themselves up the economic ladder, it completely changed my life.  I understand not everyone is an angry kid that wants to go to war, if you have any questions or doubts or are looking for any insight from me for even the safest job out there in any of the branches feel free to PM me.  \n\nTL;DR Joining the military can make you emotionally/physically tougher and you get a free education, $0 home loan, a lot of non-profits to help you even when you get out.  Your attitude, your education, and your financial intelligence will be the three most defining things that can get you out of poverty.  \n\nBecause of the Army, I went from an impoverished kid sleeping on the floor who went to bed hungry to a man still in his 20's working a $90k salary at a major tech company with investments growing, zero debt, and a massive appreciation for every bit of helped I obtained from the Army, in college, and through /r/personalfinance.

        "original": "**Edit - I am feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the advice and support, but I appreciate it greatly. I am going to sit down and go over this thread with my husband and try to answer each one of your comments to the best of my ability! I made it to the grocery store, bought a weeks worth of affordable food and came home and started cleaning my bathroom. Baby steps but steps in the right direction!**\n\nHey guys! Throwaway because my closest friends know my reddit account, and this isn't something I am comfortable sharing with them at this time. \n\nThis might be long, so apologies in advance! I'll put the TLDR at the top for those who want to skip the juicy details. \n\nTLDR: 28F and 30M couple. Medical hardship, bad financial hygiene, and shitty life choices have put us back in massive debt. (Student loans, medical bills, credit cards, payday loans). We are preparing to file bankruptcy and need to know where to go from here. \n\nI am 28 and my husband is 30. We both have moderately paying jobs for our area. (35k ish each) No kids, only a cat. On paper that seems pretty great but in reality, we aren't doing so hot. \n\nWe were both raised with horrible money hygiene. My mom taught me the magic of floating checks, payday loans and ignoring debt collectors. We always lived in run down \"ghetto\" apartments that didn't do credit checks, because my mom couldn't keep good enough credit to get us into decent places. We often lived in weekly hotels and even lived in our car a few times. I know my mom did the best she could with what she had, but it didn't set me up for success later in life. \n\nMy husband's mother passed away when he was a young teen and he moved in with his brother. They both got a decent inheritance. My husband's was set aside until he turned 18 and his brother received his right away. His brother spent exorbitant amounts on luxury items as a way of grieving. He bought fancy cars, computers, big screen TVs and hot tub that was used a couple times etc etc. He ran our of his money fairly quickly. He got married in this time to a woman with equally expensive tastes. Once the money was gone, they both were in for a bit of a shock and dealt with a lot of credit card debt, repossessions, etc etc. When my husband turned 18, he still lived with them and used a lot of his inheritance continuing to support the lavish lifestyle. They lived in luxury apartments, had trips to Disneyland, etc. My husband and I were dating around the time his share ran out.\n\nNeither one of us had any clue what the hell to do so we made quite a few bad financial decisions ourselves. Quite a lot of credit card debt, shitty roommate situation which led to apartment charges going to collections, and just a handful of other assorted debt. \n\nWe tried to get in the right direction, and by the (very shitty) advice of husband's sister in law, took out student loans to make ends meet. As it currently stands, he has no degree and isn't really close, and I am a semester away from an associates. (I have a job in the field of study, so it wasn't all for nothing). Neither of us had any sort of long term plan to repay the student loans and SIL just told us to \"defer them until you can afford them.\" \n\nAbout five years ago, I landed a great job with an amazing company doing what I went to school for. And I made a lot more than I was used to!! It was full time so I put off finishing my degree until I was comfortable enough to juggle both of these. \n\nDuring this time, we tried really hard to get our finances in order. We settled for debts we had long since ignored, payed everything on time, got new small credit cards to start rebuilding our credit and were even looking towards the future of possibly buying a house. Things were looking pretty good for our future.\n\nThen, about two years ago, a longtime health issue I had under control for years flared up and caused me to end up in and out of the hospital with procedures. I ended up on a medical leave for about 3 months while I did what I could to get this back under control. I withdrew from school (I had been back in for a few semesters, paying out of pocket to finish my degree. I was on bedrest for most of it and took a huge hit to my paychecks. We didn't have an emergency fund, so this is where things really started to slip. (Credit cards, medical bills etc). \n\nAfter getting it back under control, I went back to work and tried to collect the pieces of my life which had been on hold for a few months. In an effort to make money to get caught up, I took a personal loan from my mom and got involved in an MLM (on the shitty advice of my SIL again, big surprise). It was pretty successful for me for the first few months, but when my health got out of control again, I lost the ability to do both and ended up having to close up shop, leaving me in debt again. \n\nThe constant \"bad luck I had\" (aka bad choices leading to bad consequences) caused my health issues to flare up and on top of that, my depression to get REALLY out of control. I spent the next year trying out several different medications (along with several different shitty side effects) until last December I finally found one that worked good enough for me to return to some semblance of a normal life. \n\nMy mental health issues manifested pretty badly, in the form of online shopping addictions (makeup specifically, shout out to /r/MakeupRehab for helping me kick that habit). My house got out of control (and still kinda is) and I resorted to eating out because I was too depressed to get up and clean my kitchen to cook real food. I am working with my doctor to get that under control currently. \n\nAll of this has led me to where I currently am. I made about 15k less than normal last year due to missing so much work and have quite the damage report to show for it. \n\nI am currently terrified to answer the phone unless I recognize the number because we have several debt collectors calling daily. I rarely check my mail, and if I do, I don't open it. I have been suicidal because of the overwhelming feeling of it all. (I'm not anymore though!) My husband and I are still in this together and have a healthy relationship but the stress is taking its toll on both of us. We are so caught up in depression that we can't even bring ourselves to clean the house, so we eat out, have put on a lot of weight, and are just overall miserable. \n\nWe want to change this, and we are willing to hear whatever you guys have to tell us. We are aware that eating out is killing our already thin finances. We are really trying to work on getting the strength and motivation to clean our house and start cooking healthy stuff again. \n\nWe have a plan to file bankruptcy and get a semi clean slate. We are too far in medical and consumer debt to recover at this point so we want to start over and hopefully avoid this going forward. We are aware that our student loans won't get discharged and we have a plan to call both our loan companies and get on IBR. \n\nCurrently -\n\n1. We are currently about 1300 dollars in payday loan debt. \n\n2. We are behind on my rent every month, which as a result has led to my landlord to raise it twice ($200) in the last 6 months (sadly we are month to month, long time tenant of 5 years, and it is completely legal where I live). \n\n3. I live in an area going through a massive economic boom and a major housing shortage, which has caused rent prices to skyrocket by about 500 dollars over the last 3 years, so moving isn't really an option at the moment. We already pay \"below market average\" where we are, but we live in a bad area and sacrificed \"luxuries\" like air conditioning and a dishwasher etc by living here. \n\n4. My husband and I share one (necessary) car, as we allowed our second to be repo'd last year, when we couldn't afford the payments anymore. \n\n5. We have minimum coverage on our car, cheap rental insurance (we live in a sketchy neighborhood). \n\n6. My husband's student loans have recently started being garnished from his checks, hitting us while we already down. \n\n7. I have the incredible opportunity to get a $2500 interest free loan from my employer which I am considering taking to pay for bankruptcy costs and long overdue car repairs. \n\n\nSo if you have read this far, thank you. I ask you PF, what the hell should I do? It all sounds great on paper, but I honestly have no fucking clue if its even a smart plan, or what else my options might be. Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated!! \n\nQuestions - \n\n1. How do I reach out to the student loan people to get them to stop garnishing? I've read about IBR and loan \"rehabilitation\" programs, but with barely enough to cover rent, I won't be able to pay the $350 each they expect us to pay. Is it better to wait til after we are on our feet again and then contact them? \n\n2. What do I need to know to file bankruptcy? I know there are legal aid offices that charge $750, but what do I do to start the process? \n\n3. Should I try to pay off the payday loans I've taken BEFORE filing bankruptcy or should I do a payday loan rehabilitation program? Should I just let them overdraw me and then include them in my bankruptcy? I want to get out of this cycle more than anything. \n\n4. How the hell am I supposed to budget my money when I am already months behind? I liked YNAB for a while, but the cardinal rule is not to budget money you don't already have, and while that is a nice idea, I need to know who needs to be paid the following paycheck so I don't get my power turned off. It is hard to budget money you already have when that money is gone as soon as it hits your bank account. \n\nAlso, for those wondering, BIL and SIL are not doing so hot themselves and we have FINALLY learned our damn lesson to NOT take financial advice in any form from them anymore. Seriously, wtf was I thinking? ",

Fortunate for me, my grandparents who were a lot better off had a house in a nicer community and took me in. Despite where we lived, my grandparents were still not as wealthy as everyone else in the area and never had extra money. I grew up, and am best-friends with a bunch of kids who had every single thing handed to them. In middle school when we would hang out, I never had money to spend like they did. They were always able to go to the movies, and cool restaurants downtown while I had to stay home. Growing up, I swore to never struggle like my mom just because the hardship she endured scared me. When I turned 16, I got my first job at a movie theater and finally started making my own money. I made about $450 every two weeks and it was such an empowering feeling. My entire first year of working I never saved anything because now I had more money than my friends, and when they weren\u2019t able to go out and do what I wanted to do, I paid for them. Then, my senior year of high-school I got a job at a deli with a pay increasing of about $200+ every two weeks with the same hours and started making more money than I thought I would ever have. I was able to buy my own car in cash, and pay for everything and anything I needed. I slowly started saving money, and a few months later I ended up joining the Army. Fast forward 4 months and 16 days later, I now have $4,505.70 in my savings and $105.63 in my checking. Considering that I have every single basic need paid for by the Army, I try to only spend between $50-$100 every two weeks. By doing that, I\u2019m able to put $500+ into savings every two weeks. I also have a $20,000 bonus from the job that I picked. When I get out, school will be also be paid for. Ultimately, I just want to inspire people who feel like they have nothing. Though I don\u2019t have many years under my belt, I know what it feels like to be discouraged, and feel worthless. If you really want something, you can do it.

Structurally my house is in good shape and I want to share how I did it with no out of pocket cost.\n\nNine years ago, my now ex-husband was laid off for over a year, my job was the only income, and our AC went out. Not only is this a necessity in Arizona but I have a heart condition and heat can be deadly for me. We paid for a portable AC from Costco (which we later returned). I was desperate and very down. Then my co-worker mentioned that on the news, our city was replacing AC for free for low income families. I called and long story short, we qualified! Not only did we get a new AC unit in a few weeks, they also \"weatherized\" our house. The city redid our insulation, sealed wherever they found cracks where air was leaking out, etc. They would have replaced windows too but we had replaced ours the year prior. All this was from a federal grant to our city's housing department that was not widely advertised. I did not have to pay it back. It was a stroke of luck that my co-worker saw it on the news and mentioned it to me. \n\n**But it gets better!**\n\nAfter the AC was replaced, the city rep I was working with called to tell me about another grant we were eligible for. It was a \"Neighborhood Stabilization\" program again through the federal government.  Basically, they want homeowners to live in their well-maintained houses and not rent them out. It stabilizes the neighborhood and in theory improves it, and crime rates, etc. This program however, was not completely free. A lien would be placed on my home. Every year I lived in my home, a percentage would be taken off. After 15 years, the lien would be removed. I had to have the home as my primary residence. I couldn't rent it out. If I sold before the 15 years were up, I would have to back the balance due from my home sale. As we planned to stay here long term, this was a good program for us. \n\nTotal work included: testing for lead paint and asbestos, a new roof, exterior stucco and paint, a FULL kitchen remodel including cabinets, tile flooring throughout, new toilets, home rewired and grounded, and interior paint. We could have also gotten desert landscaping but chose not to. Our house was 50 years old and looked great. Total was around $40,000.\n\nI had to do a lot of paperwork and we had to tolerate about 4 months of remodeling. It was definitely worth it.

I\u2019m always looking for smart purchases. \n\nSocks, \u00a37 a pare. I have 15 ish pares of these, way out of my budget, socks. I got them a few years ago and looked after them well. I work on my feet a lot and these removed so much pain from my life. Whenever someone starts working like me, my first recommendation is good socks. \n\nUnder shirt \u00a310. Same idea as with socks. I have 6 of these thick T shirts. They are a perfect fit and super comfortable. They keep my nice shirts clean for days on end, so I don\u2019t have to buy extra of them. \n\nKindle \u00a3don\u2019t remember, I got it 2nd hand. After getting this I sold all of my books using a phone app. I used most of that money to buy back 80% of my library on the kindle. Iv saved ~ \u00a380 on books with this since. Because of it, I also read a lot more. \n\nSaut\u00e9 pan 28cm ~ \u00a328.Got it from amazon, makes cooking easy and energy efficient. I cook more/better food to take to work with greater ease. I eat better/spend less/wash less because of it. \n\nWet stone 1000/4000grain \u00a322. I also bought a \u00a34 from a super market. Every week and a bit I sharpen this knife. It\u2019s my one stop shop for cooking and because I sharpen it. Even a crap knife, well sharpened, is as good as a \u00a3100+ knife.\n\nFountain pen \u00a312.

        "title": "Creative Ways To Save For The Debt-Burdened Working Paycheck to Paycheck--Nothing new, but doing them all at once can make a huge difference (long post)",
        "original": "I'm going to caveat this post by saying that I'm not exactly poor, but my net worth is -$60,000 and was closer to -$105,000 about 2 years ago. I live in a city, rent an apartment with multiple people, and pay a shitload in student loans (2100k/mo). I have a 'good job' but still live paycheck to paycheck, have no retirement savings, and haven't contributed to my savings account since I lived with my parents for 3 months about 3 years ago. Needless to say, I look to cut costs wherever I can. \n\nThese are some things I do to help myself stay honest/sane/above the red. I don't want to offend anyone who thinks these things are too privileged for this subreddit, trust me, I hustle my butt off, but I think, at the very least, it could help you think a little bit about some of the things you can do in your own situation that seem like necessities but that just require a bit of extra sacrifice, or even help you meet halfway on some things. Here we go!\n\n1. I have a part time job--but not just any part time job! Yup--I work my full time job which barely pays all my fixed costs (rent, 2 loan payments, and parking) and then work part time at a gourmet food store to pay for everything else. The best part of this job? It feeds me. If possible--GET A JOB THAT FEEDS YOU. Sometimes I get free leftover wine from the wine tastings too, luxurious! Maybe also consider a gym job for a free membership, or really anything that you want discounted. Retail is alive and well and the flexible hours and perks can help you along if you're working 2 jobs or even if it's your full time.\n\n2. I walk to work. Usually only in the spring/summer/fall because I live in a city in the northeast and I would freeze halfway there otherwise. A monthly pass on public transportation is about $90/month here. I got myself a supportive backpack, pack up all my things each morning, and head out on the 1.5 hr walk to work. On days I work at both jobs (4/7 days), I have just enough time to walk between jobs as well. No commuting cost and no need for a gym. Win win!\n\n3. I got mad smart about credit cards. I love credit cards---I think they are amazing when you know the terms and have control over yourself and your finances. I have two credit cards that I use for everything--I actually don't use my debit card! After all my fixed costs are paid I just use the leftover to make large, chunky payments on my cards. Here's what I use and for what: \n * Citi DoubleCash: This is my every day card. I use it for everything. Why? I get 2% cash back on everything. No categories or ever-changing rules. I've always been on top of my credit and was able to get a no annual fee card. But, either way, this one typically pays off quickly even if you need to pay the fee (~40/yr I think). I have about $350 in free money already.\n * Capital One: I have had a Capital One card for about 8 years. Only about 2 or 3 years ago I was able to convert to my first no annual fee card. This is mainly my back up cc but it has some great benefits too. First, if you have a CapitalOne Caf\u00e9 in your area you can get 50% off of any coffee you buy there. Yup, a large cup of coffee for something like $1.40...not bad! Additionally, I charge my Spotify account to this card and was able to sign up for a deal that gave me 50% off my subscription for a year...I paid $5/mo for Spotify for a whole year--a necessity for all my long commuting walks. Sadly, this is coming to an end this month, but it was definitely worth it! This card gives 1.5% cash back on everything. I have something like $600 in cash rewards on this card because I try not to touch it and haven't in a long, long time. Another thing to look into is to see if you can pay BIG things off with these kind of cards. About 2 years ago I owed $8000 to my graduate school through a Perkins Loan. I had the money in my savings at the time and the interest rate was close to like 10 or 12% or something absurd. The day it was about to start accruing interest I called up the school and paid that baby off. The best part? I put in on my credit card. Used the last of my savings to pay off my card and that sweet 1.5% cash back was all mine. I felt a little better knowing I actually earned some money back ($120) on making a 8k loan payment.\n\n4. If you rent (and like myself you probably live with 2 to 3 other people), you will know the pain of broker's fees and how much of an absolute waste they are. Unfortunately, they are hard to escape sometimes. There's not much you can do here except stay in the apartment you have rented for as long as you can. Last year I moved and luckily it was into a place where one of the previous tenants was still staying so we didn't have to pay a broker's fee! The only other thing I can say about rent is that when you are moving to a new place sometimes the landlord will require First, Last, Security, and Broker's fee (aka, 4 months of rent). Sometimes, if you look good enough on paper, you can negotiate staggered payments or even drop the Last month requirement. Good luck--we all know it sucks out there! :[\n\n5. Care.com/Craigslist. I sometimes get the opportunity/time to babysit some cats when people go away. It's awesome for my soul and wallet. Also, get smart with Craigslist ads--spot the scams and know your shit. I have found several gigs and a few part time jobs over the years on here without selling myself into a sugar daddy situation *shudders*. I have also bought some nice furniture here--check for bed bugs, folks, don't ruin your life! But I've never had a bad experience--just have your wits about you. \n\n6. Look into refinancing any of your loans, if you can. I had about $23k in grad plus loans with a 6.9% interest rate. I was able to refinance these into a private loan at 5.29%. This isn't for everyone--I still have a staggering amount in federal loans (now at 5.5% interest) but I figured that, in the worst case scenario, I could still afford the $451/mo private loan and could put my federal loans on hold. In the long run I will save thousands in interest. \n\n7. For all my friends who get paid bi-weekly instead of bi-monthly (going to biweekly was a shock to me at first) you will know and live for your 2 months of the year for your extra paycheck! Forget it. Forget it exists. Put that immediately into savings or make a lump sum payment on debt. It's monopoly money. You get 24 paychecks like everyone else. Sorry. :]\n\n8. Please dear god switch to a credit union, if you're not there already. Most don't charge fees for owning an account there. On top of that, they are local and are usually staffed with really great people. One time I miscalculated a credit card payment by $0.45. Yea. Yup. And was charge a $35 overdraft fee. I walked on over to my credit union and explained the situation, they saw it had never happened before, and gave me the $35 back and educated me on overdraft protection measures I could opt in to. I was so jazzed about that for a whole week. \n\n9. Pack your lunch (but who has the time when you work 2 jobs?). I try to pack my lunch, most of the time. But other times I just want to go out and buy something. Luckily, I have a collection of punch cards I bring with me everywhere for my someday free thing! I also found a place that serves food buffet/mezze style and they give you 30% off any food you buy there after 2:30pm. Worth the wait!\n\n10. Taxes. There are many sites online where you can file your taxes for free. I used turbo tax last year and was about to use it this year when I realized I was getting charge like $90 to file! No way I'm doing that! So I found that creditkarma will file your federal taxes free--check it out! Unfortunately, I 'made too much money this year' and didn't qualify for free state tax filing. Honestly, I'm still in the middle of trying to figure out filing the paper form and where to mail it to, but it will be free and worth the $40 saved. \n\nI don't know if this helps, but this is what I tell people when they ask me how the hell I can pay so aggressively on my debt. I know many people who make a significant amount more than myself who just don't handle their money well and think I make more than them because I still have a decent quality of life and can make all this work. It's not easy, but it's possible!\n\nEdit: I also just called my private loan provider to try to negotiate a lower interest rate and was able to qualify for a 3.6% fixed rate to replace my 5.29% rate with the same provider. Always worth a shot, it seems!",

This might be obvious to some people, but none of my peers ever have any idea these programs exist and just resign themselves to being in thousands of dollars of medical debt. \n\nIn my state for example, there is a family planning medical assistance program which gives women free birth control, pregnancy checkups, reproductive healthcare, and sterilization. Men can recieve reproductive healthcare and sterilization as well. I'm hoping to get approved and get the tubal ligation of my dreams - if I am approved it will be 100% free. \n\n\nI also get dental care through a town clinic for a flat rate of $35/appt even if I get multiple cavities filled. They don't do more extensive stuff and I may need a root canal or two soon, so I'll be getting in contact with a dental school (another great place to get affordable care.) If you can avoid having crippling depression and completely destroying your oral & physical health through 10 years of suicidal ideation and total neglect, you can save a chunk of change there too, but that ship has unfortunately sailed for me.\n\n\nMy local hospital also has a financial assistance program so I get emergency room services for free. This saved me literally $5,000 last year while trying to figure out an issue with my heart (which has been diagnosed as benign PVCs, woo!)\n\n\nThe thing is, these are never really advertised or easy to find and sign up for.

I\u2019m 28, live on my own. Make around 40k a year (rounding up). Because of student loans, I live paycheck to paycheck. Whatever. That\u2019s fine, I\u2019m managing.

I recently got a raise at my office job which means that we are now over the income guidelines in my state; my family will lose our food stamp benefits as well as our Medicaid eligibility. A lot of my raise is going to get eaten up just by adjusting to a life without government assistance; something to be proud of for sure, but I would love any advice from people who have already gone through this transition.\n\nMy financial details:\n\nIncome: Wages went from $25k to $35k last week. Living very frugally, I had been able to pay all the bills paycheck to paycheck with just $25k and I am hoping to avoid overspending just because I'm going to be making more. My union is supposedly finalizing wage negotiations this month (after 2+ years!) which could potentially bring my wage for the same job up again to as high as $40-45k (maybe even retro pay!) but I can't be sure if/when that will happen. When my schedule allows I also donate plasma twice a week for an extra $70/week. My wife doesn't work but is considering applying for a job as a dental assistant making about $30k, however we need to look at how much that would cost us in daycare (at least $200/week) and how it would affect our taxes (EITC) to see if it's worth it for her to have less time with the baby.\n\nAssets: I have no emergency savings. We don't own a home, we rent a tiny 2BR apartment for $600/m and desperately want to upgrade to a bigger place when our lease ends in November so that's going to be a priority. My 403b is 8% and matching, it has $14k in index funds as of today but I don't believe I can or should withdraw any of that until I'm old. I took a portion of my tax refund and bought some penny stocks in a taxable Robinhood account that dropped in value from $3,200 to $2,300 in the past few weeks; some poor investment decisions were made.\n\nDebts: My wife has $3k in credit card debt at 24% APR. We have been making the minimum payments. I plan to liquidate my stocks once I've recovered some of my losses and use that money to zero out the credit card debt. My mother-in-law recently loaned us $1,300 to repair one of our two cars; she doesn't want to be repaid but I insist on finding a way to pay her at least something back every month. The old car is rusty and squeaks a lot but it runs now and is paid off, and the other car is brand new and has monthly payments of $250, purchase price of $20k with APR of 0.9% (a wealthy family member co-signed or I would never have qualified for such a low APR). I also have a few thousand in miscellaneous unpaid rent/utilities debts from my previous marriage. These debts are 5+ years old and might even have charged off at this point, hurting my credit score pretty bad. I have $50k in federal student loans at 6.8% APR which are set to income-based payment plan; the payments right now are $0/m but I expect them to increase once they know I'm making more. If I make 10 years worth of qualifying payments (including the $0 ones) while working this government job, the entire remaining balance will be forgiven. I have already been working here 4 years. I also have $25k in private student loans at 5.5% APR and they will not accept less than $110/m on these which is interest only I believe. Obviously I would like to pay these off after credit cards so the interest stops accumulating. I'm actually behind on my Navient loan payments right now so I have to ignore calls from their collectors several times a day.\n\nLost Benefits: almost $400/month in food stamps we will no longer be able to collect, and we will have to buy health insurance. I can get (relatively) cheap insurance through my work; for a family of four the total premium would be $156/m. If my wife gets a dental assistant job that comes with free dental work for your whole family typically which would be nice.\n\nTL;DR I recently got a substantial raise and am losing my family's food stamps and medicaid as a result. I don't know how to middle class. How do I middle class?",

        "original": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm 28 and moving out of my parents house for the third time. I grew up pretty poor. My mom was a single parent, my father took off and didn't pay child support. We lived in public housing until I was in middle school when my mom was able to buy a house through some social program. She's doing okay financially now, but doesn't have the means to help me out if I ever had a crisis of some sort. \n\nThe first time I moved out, I was 18 and a complete idiot. I had a boyfriend that kept getting fired and I racked up a ton of debt  trying to keep us a float when he couldn't pay his share. Eventually I just couldn't do it anymore and we ended up getting evicted. I broke up with him and moved back home for a year. The second time, I moved away from home to go to school. I didn't realize how little you get from student loans and spent a year living on spaghetti and ketchup, had no social life to speak of, a room mate that bailed on me last minute, then another one that stole from me like crazy. I left after a year of that and I've lived at home ever since.\n\n\nI finished university in the city I grew up in and then some how managed to get into and finish med school. Now I'm a resident and make pretty good money. My only debt is my student loans, but they're manageable, and I have some money saved to get me everything I need to set up a place of my own and then keep the rest as emergency savings. \n\nNext week, I'm moving into my first apartment alone. It's not something overly fancy like most of the other people in my program have moved up into since graduating, but it's enough for me and my cat and I don't want anything more than that. I make enough to pay all the bills with a bit left over to save and be comfortable, but I have this voice screaming in the back of my head all these what if's that are making me incredibly hesitant to actually go through with it. \n\nThe thought of not being able to pay my bills again terrifies me. I've spent years rebuilding my credit from the mistakes I made at 18 and saving to be able to do this properly, but there are so many things that could go wrong. I know that I'm in the perfect place to do this, and things are likely to just going to keep getting better, but I'm so scared of screwing all of this up and going back to living in public housing, eating disgusting things, and never knowing if I'll have enough to make it to the end of the month.\n\nAm I ever going to stop worrying about the what ifs, or is this just going to be a part of me for the rest of my life? I can't stand the stress it's causing me and I don't want to turn into a crazy hoarder because of it. ",

        "original": "Short version: Parents kicked me out when I was 16 because I was bisexual. I was homeless for a while. Luckily graduated, figured out how to navigate the financial aid system, went to CC for free and got money back in the form of grants that helped pay my bills, and then got a work-study job for 1.5 years where I helped other people with their financial aid, so I know this shit backwards and forwards.\n\nMost people don't realize that community college is so heavily subsidized that many people below the poverty line can actually get \"paid\" to go, rather than having to pay anything. I'm not saying this will be an option for everyone, and it's definitely not an income substitute, but it makes the difference for some people. \n\n*If the amount of grant and scholarship money that you get is more than your tuition, you will receive a check for the difference.* You do not have to pay grants or scholarships back. Because I qualified for a lot of grants, I was lucky enough to get several thousand dollars back every semester, which made it possible for me to work and go to school at the same time.\n\nHere's how I did it. First, I had to qualify for grants. This means filling out the FAFSA. In order to get the most grants, I filed mine the February before the school year started, and every February after, but you can fill it out at any time.\n\nSegway into the mess that is dependency: The biggest reason students get screwed by the FAFSA is because they are required to include their parents' tax information. Look up whether you will have to. I used the following two exemptions: \n1. Technically, if you are in any form of temporary living situation, such as a hotel or even crashing at a friend's until you get back on your feet, you are homeless. If this happens, make sure to reach out to a church, a counselor, a social worker, someone, so you have a record of it. **If you have been homeless in the past year, you do not have to put your parents' incomes on your FAFSA.**\n2. The second year, I had to file a dependency appeal. Because I had documentation that I was forced to leave my parents' house under and abusive circumstance, I was approved. It's a massive ordeal, but it was worth it.\n\nAs a 17 year old with PTSD, you can imagine own income was scant. I qualified for the maximum aid. There are more exemptions, but if none of them apply to you, apply anyway to see what you get. Note that most advisers aren't going to spend the time it takes (hours) to really look into all the details of your case with you, and many are incompetent and will tell you the wrong thing. Do your own research. Double check everything.\n\nIn total, I got about $10,000 a year in grants - about half federal and half state. That doesn't include scholarships. All in all I was getting a check for about $3000 every semester just for going to school. I did not take out a single loan.\n\nI just wanted to share this info because a lot of people don't realize that community college is possible for them, and still more get discouraged or misled because they don't know how to navigate the system. I helped a lot of people do it, and I'm here to say it can be done.",

        "original": "Thanks to all the people (mostly men it seems) who posted stories of how you got the jobs that led you out of poverty. \n\nHere's a tougher problem - **getting women who were victimized as children and/or adults out of poverty.** \n\nYou know how on job applications they give you a box to check off if you're a Veteran because Vets get preferential hiring? Well I WISH our nation would pass a law allowing survivors of abuse, any gender, to get preferential hiring. \n\nI know I've read, over the years, terrible statistics on survivors of abuse of all kinds, plus mostly immigrant torture survivors, and poverty. \n\nSurvivors get mentally messed up from the abuse, to say the least. In our uneven health care system maybe they can find good counseling support, but there's never any guarantee  they have or can find quality help.\n\nAs a result, it's hard for survivors to build or rebuild their lives. If they're REALLY lucky (sarcasm) their abuser is a stalker, or their abusive birth family is still in contact with them one way or another. So even after they get out, they might still be dealing with ex-partner stalking, or relatives asking them to care for them.\n\nWhat this does is SUCK the LIFE ENERGY out of survivors. \n\nImagine you're running a race called \"Training and Career Goals\". Ten laps around this high school track and you're out of poverty! Yay! \n\nBut for an abuse survivor, or for a woman who still hasn't left her abusive situation yet, your abuser(s) are on the sidelines, throwing  every kind of harmful item you can imagine at you while you're running: hot coals, rubber bullets (and you know he could switch to real bullets at any time), a net at your feet, trash, bungee cords, paint, bleach, staples from a staple gun, maybe even acid if your abuser is in a killing mood, etc.\n\nBut there she is, she is still running, batting this stuff away, still fighting the fight to get to the end of the race. If she has children and that is often a HUGE motivator that keeps her running no matter what the abuser(s) are throwing at her.\n\nUnfortunately, she's had to stop a lot. Dodging the projectiles makes her go slow. She stops to cry sometimes because it's not fair - it's not FAIR that the other runners on this track, *whom she can see*, don't have ANYONE throwing crap at them. The other runners are able to focus. Hell, some of the other runners even have supportive friends and family in the stands, cheering them on. \n\nThey finish the race before her, often much more quickly than she does, but she keeps going because she knows she doesn't want to raise her kids in poverty no matter what the abuser(s) do to her. \n\nShe finally finishes the race. The acid got some of her hair to fall out. Paint spatters all over her clothes. Bruises from the rubber bullets. She has this dazed look in her eyes of shell-shock. \n\nShe's not \"enthusiastic\" like the un-abused people who finished before her. She can't believe she actually got through all that, so she's not jumping up and down and cheering - instead she's processing, quietly, in her mind, and always has a sense of paranoia about her because she's always distracted, worrying if he/they are going to invade her life again now that she's finished the \"Training and Career Goals\" race, and try to take that away from her too!\n\nNow she goes on job interviews. She's up against the un-abused and well-supported. The other job candidates are not dazed, quiet, or distracted by pervasive, low grade fears from the past. The other applicants are the cute puppies with wagging tails that employers love. \n\nShe is more like an abused puppy - skittish, shy, tail hesitantly wagging a little, hoping for the job.\n\n**How to THESE kinds of survivors get out of poverty?** Don't say this is just a tiny percentage of the population so we don't have to worry about them. \n\nStats from here: https://ncadv.org/statistics\n\nECONOMIC IMPACT\n\nVictims of intimate partner violence lose a total of 8.0 million days of paid work each year.\n\nThe cost of intimate partner violence exceeds $8.3 billion per year.\n\nBetween 21-60% of victims of intimate partner violence lose their jobs due to reasons stemming from the abuse.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2008, 142 women were murdered in their workplace by their abuser, 78% of women killed in the workplace during this timeframe.\n\nMore info:\n\nhttps://www.chn.org/2014/10/16/intersection-poverty-domestic-violence/#.WsjVSNPwZTY\n\nhttp://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1049731516662321?journalCode=rswa\n\nFour out of 5 victims of partner violence are women: https://talkpoverty.org/2016/09/19/want-reduce-domestic-violence-treat-like-economic-issue/\n\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/issues/poverty/news/2013/02/27/54953/low-income-victims-of-domestic-violence-facing-a-political-super-storm/\n\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/23/domestic-violence-statistics_n_5959776.html\n\nhttps://ncadv.org/statistics\n\nJust look at all these statistics.

        "original": "Step 1.) finish high school or get your G.E.D. I dropped out at 16 (as my sister did, my mom, my grandma and probably her mom). About 2 years of having no goals I had to change and took my sister and myself to take the damn test.\n\nStep 2.) if you come from low income family most likely community college will be free for you. I maxed out Pell grants and it covered my tuition for the three years. I went for Communication.\n\nStep 3.) get a serving job that has a bar. I was always a server in college. I worked about 25 hours a week and always made $500 a week. It\u2019s fast money and it\u2019s good physical activity. DO NOT settle for minimum wage paying cashier jobs. Restaurant work is tough but after 6 months it\u2019s kind of fun! And I\u2019ve always worked in corporate restaurants - the promotion to manager is usually pretty sweet. $50k starting and 2 weeks paid vacation. The hours suck but the people you work with are usually solid people and a good time. But it is a viable career option. You can then work your way up to general manager and they break 6 figures. I obviously didn\u2019t do this - I stayed a server through school- but it was definitely a consideration for me. I mention it here as a career option bc many people don\u2019t think of it.\n\nStep 4.) use your degree or certificate! I transferred to a 4-year university and completed a degree in business (better for job prospects). I highly advised to please choose a relevant and demanded degree. And most importantly be passionate on what you want to do. My sister go a degree in social work and she has had no desire to look for a job for the two years we\u2019ve been out of school. \n\nStep 5.) Leverage your network. Who do you know? Where do they work? Does the school hold job fairs? Go to it. Does your advisor know of internship opportunities? Talk to them. My gf\u2019s dad worked at a big company and I asked him how I can get into their internship program.\n\nStep 6.) research and practice interview skills. Really you have to. It helps so much. \n\nStep 7.) clean up the resume periodically and apply to internship after internship after internship. I only applied for paid internships. I interviewed in total about 8 internship places. My first internship was with my gf\u2019s fathers company (not his division or office but for corporate - he sent me a link to apply) but it took me two years to get that position! The first year they said sorry and even tho I was devastated I gave it my all the next year and got it! My first internship, it was super competitive and they paid $20 an hour. I ended up taking the $65k starting offer with this company. My second internship was minimum wage but it was still amazing. I made it work. \n\nNote: if you need certain experience volunteering is a good way to get these skills on a resume. I joined an LGBT club in college where I was a PR officer - that looked great on my resume and it was relevant work experience \n\nStep 7.) review and update the resume again\n\nStep 8.) keep applying to internships. If you are finished with school or about to graduate apply for full time positions. You may luck out and have an offer from where you interned. \n\nStep 8.) keep networking. At work and in your personal time. I went to a better position within my company within 1.5 years. \n\nI get that college is not for everyone but this is how I did it. I\u2019m currently working on my MBA that work pays for. \n\nThe most important takeaways here are the network and the effort. Keep applying. Even when you don\u2019t know if you should apply. Apply. Every interview you go on makes you better for the next one. There were a lot of opportunities I didn\u2019t get but I still very fortunate to the 3 that were life changing for me. \n\nI hope this helps someone. Keep applying!!

So I was ecstatic to know I qualified and could finally seek care for things I'd been ignoring for years. \n\nFast forward to March when it was time to re-certify. I used my 2017 tax returns, which disqualified me. I'm self-employed and managed to have a couple *really* good months at the beginning of 2017, but it's been steadily downhill since then. When I told the woman on the phone that her estimated income for me sounded way too high, she suggested I do a 3-month Profit and Loss statement for my business to accurately reflect my recent earnings. \n\nWhen she told me the income maximum, I didn't think there was any way I'd be below that and almost decided not to do the statement at all. It's way easier when you're denied and depressed and used to everything going wrong to just kind of give up without putting up a fight. It's what I always do. Well, used to always do. I'm trying to get better about it. They don't know my situation as well as I do, and after doing the P&L, I realized even I don't know my situation as well as I thought I did. My income fell well below the maximum and my appeal was approved over the phone! \n\nIt's such a relief to know I'm not losing my insurance at the end of the month (I was already trying to cram in every appointment I could to cover my bases) and it's such a weight off my chest. I can't believe I was just willing to roll over and accept defeat. But I know I've done it so many other times in other similar situations. Learned helplessness is real thing when you've lived like this long enough, but you don't have to give up! \n\nI hope this encourages someone else to try that appeal, to be your own advocate.

We had a nice house, a nice car, regular holidays, etc etc\nMy parents paid for my on-campus accommodation here in Sydney for the first three years of my five year degree, and my rent for the final two.\nI got a car from my parents for my 21st birthday as it was a necessity for my degree.\nI sold this car last year as it needed a lot of work (~$5000) and it wasn't worth that, so I financed a new car. Despite the ongoing costs I don't regret doing this; I got a very good deal and not a day goes by when I don't absolutely love driving my car. It actually cheers me up.\n\nAnyway! On to now.\n\n\nI am in my mid 20s, working full time and renting in Sydney with my partner.\nSydney is incredibly expensive, overpopulated and gross. We will move when our careers allow it but for now I'm stuck in this shithole of a city.\n\n*****Important to know******\n\nI moved jobs mid March as I needed to escape a toxic environment.\n\nMy ex-employer currently owes me about $5000 for not paying me as they were supposed to when I left.\n\nAs a result, there was a period of about one month where I drained what little savings I had and put a good dent in my credit card balance (hello $500 left.)\n\nI am taking this asshole to court to recover the money that is rightfully mine, but it's a long and arduous process that has really taken a toll on my mental health.\n\n**The new situation**\nI love my current job; it is a dream come true. The only downside is that I have taken a pay cut of $60 per week (after taxes)\n\nA small price to pay for my sanity.\n\n\n**i make $950 per week/ $3700 per month AUD after taxes.**\n\nAll of the expenses below are my share of things:\n\n=*I have compulsory HECS (university fee) repayments of $50 per week*\n\n=Rent is $260pw ($1080pm)\n\n=We currently spend about $125pw each on groceries (so about $500 per month)\n-*I think this would be the easiest place to start cutting back*\n\n=My car repayments are $110pw\n\n=Petrol is about $25pw\n\n=Health insurance is $11pw\n\n=Pet insurance is $12pw (I am a vet and deem this very necessary)~\n-Our two kitties cost about $50pm in food and over a year come to about $1300 for insurance, food and preventatives. They are here to stay!\n\n=*I am paying off a credit card at $100pw*\n-the balance is about $5000 at the moment, down from $8000 a year ago. I would say \"yay progress!\" but over the past three months with everything that has gone on with previous employer (and my bad habits), I've got a new $6000 balance to pay off\n\n=My car insurance is $100pm\n\n=My phone is $80pm\n\n=Our home and contents insurance is $60pm\n-this covers stuff inside the house, as well as our phones/laptops/camping gear/ski gear/glasses/sunglasses/etc etc for theft/loss and accidental damage outside of the house which I think is quite important\n\n=Electricity is about $100pm\n\n=Water is about $40pm\n\n=I have a Spotify and Dropbox account which are are $11pm\n\n-I have my entire degree essentially on Dropbox and prefer to use Spotify rather than illegally acquiring music. \n\n=Gym membership is $150pm \n-I am painfully aware that this is expensive. I have a history and anxiety/depression and I gym 4-5 times per week. I love my gym. It is an escape and excellent therapy\n\n=On the topic of therapy, I see a psychiatrist every month or so to deal with my stress and other issues.\nEach visit puts me $65 out of pocket so I try my best to go regularly, but no more than once per month.\n\n=I set aside a monthly budget of $200 for a daily coffee and other little unnecessary things like IPL treatments\n\nSo, in theory, my total monthly expenditure is about **$3400** per month right now at this very moment. I'm sure I can cut that down somehow \n\n\n**All sounds manageable right?**\n\nWell, here's the issue\n\nI cannot seem to get it through my thick fucking head that I need to cut back.\n\nThis past fortnight was particularly rough, as I had car rego, CTP and the annual service due. Bye $750 on the credit card. \n\nThese were compulsory expenses but it still hurts to see the hit to my credit card \n\nWe also had to board our cats while we went away for Easter. Bye $350.\n\n-I'd like to point out this isn't a regular thing; up until my current job I could always board the cats for free at my place of work. This is no longer the case so we had to board them at our expense last minute.\n\n\nBut it's the little things\nA quick grocery trip here\nA new skirt there\n\nI don't need to buy this shit and still my brain goes hurr Durr but you just got paid look at all of that money the skirt/new food processor/miscellaneous shit I don't actually NEED is only $20\n\nThen it builds up\nAnd up\nAnd then by the end of my pay fortnight I've used my credit card again.\n\nI do not make much considering where I live, however I know full well it should be enough to keep myself afloat without using a credit card and I should be able to put away just a little bit each payday.\n\nI have tried (and clearly failed), to write myself up a spreadsheet each fortnight and record my income and expenses. All it's done so far is make me depressed and angry at myself for seeing the wasted money.\n\nMy question to you wonderful people is this:\n\nHow the everloving fuck do I snap myself out of this?!\n\nWe have a chest freezer and I pride myself in filling it with sale meat and bulk-made food, but I know I can do better.\nMy partner and I both like to eat healthy and rarely go out/get takeaway (I'm talking once or twice a month max)\n\nI want to meal prep better\nI want to go a whole fortnight without touching my damn credit card\nI want to have even $1 in my savings at the end of a pay cycle.\n\nAs a side note, please bear in mind where I live. It makes me insanely jealous when I see people in the US buying groceries so cheap. For example, 1kg (2.2lb) of chicken thighs here is $8.50 on sale, but normally around $10\nGroceries are not cheap here, but I always check unit prices and buy the cheapest option. I'm definitely not a brand snob\n\nSo please, any advice is greatly appreciated as I cannot continue the way I am.\n\nThanks :)\n\nEDIT:\nI should probably point out that I've also got a very large and productive veggie patch which is slowly becoming a good source of any herbs/tomatoes/salad/citrus\n\nI'm also trying to sell handmade jewellery online to supplement my income\n\nAnd as of today I've taken note from another r/PF post and signed up to lots of online survey sites and whatnot",

        "original": "The way the job market is, the way everything just seems to keep getting more and more expensive, it's all just getting overwhelming sometimes.  My way of looking at it is not just looking for more income, but really reducing the amount outgoing.\n\nHere's what I'm looking to do in the future:  pay nothing on housing, almost homesteading like.  Eventually go offgrid.  Take my time back.  When your monthly needs are very low your time spent meeting those needs should be low, as well.\n\nBut how?  At the moment, we make pretty low income, and I am in school with one year left.  We live pretty cheap as it is, but still those monthly bills come due.  We live in an older paid trailer (steal of a deal I bought in cash a few years back), lot rent is cheap.  It's okay for now, nothing fancy, everything in here was cheap or free, but it's clean and it's home.  I'd like to move it to some land a few miles away on hubby's grandmothers land (he will inherit when she passes, she wants us out there now).  In process of getting things worked out to get this done, it's 4.6 acres.  Water well and septic already there.  Once moved, would like to garden to cut food expenses.  Electric hook up available but would eventually like to go solar (later, when can afford it).  Would have to get big propane tank for heat.\n\nWhat this would do would cut any housing expense (other than maintenance and repairs), cut water/sewage expense, and would get big propane tank and fill it when needed to reduce monthly gas expense.  Electric would be the same until we could afford to do solar later on (still weighing the costs and pros/cons on this).  \n\nWhat would be monthly expenses after this?  We already cut the tv cord, have antenna for some stations.  Would need to keep internet, same company, my future job would entail telecommuting (what I am in school for now), plus streaming tv.  Cell phones are basic no data cheapest plan I could find for towers that are here, that would stay the same.  Vehicles are paid, same liability only insurance.  Commute to town/hubby's work about the same as they are now as we live out of town already, I think the mileage difference is about a mile from town/business.  Gardening to help reduce grocery expenses, we already have deep freeze and stock up on sale meat.  \n\nOur monthly outgoing expenses for housing, utilities, and vehicle insurance runs about $900 now.  Not bad.  But I want it lower.  I want the ability to feel like working part-time at a paid job is enough to cover this and free up more time for things I \"like\" doing.  I'd like to be able to pay off upcoming student loans fast (I've done it before).  I'd like feeling like everything coming in isn't just to survive this month.  And next month.  I'd like feeling anything above that I can sock away.  Sure, I'd be living trailer-trashish, with older vehicles, but who cares really?  I don't.  \n\nIs anyone else going this route?\n\nETA: sorry for the wall of ramblings, just where my head went this morning.  Ty for reading.",

Come graduation, I tried for over a year and did not get a single callback. Eventually, I didn\u2019t even see writing or journalism jobs advertised in my area.\n\n23k in credit card debt because of mental illness and an uncomfortable urge to self medicate by buying shiny electronic things and thinking I can pay them off. I have ADHD with a psychiatrist and meds. Impulse buys actually don\u2019t happen while on meds - that weird gnawing uncomfortable feeling of not being able to buy a thing goes away.

TLDR at the bottom. \n\nI\u2019m a 22 years old female and grew up in a low income household and my parents were (and still are) pretty irresponsible with money. Once I started realizing in high school they were irresponsible and would be entirely unable to help me in my adult life I started trying to figure out how to prepare myself for adult life. I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of depression and anxiety and made some shitty decisions along the way. \n\nI\u2019m currently 4 classes away from my AA degree and work a job I love making $400-450 a month. Monthly now I have $100 car payment, $30 phone bill, $150 car insurance payment, and ~$50 I\u2019m necessary things like groceries and gas. I also have no savings and my car windshield is cracked and I need $300 to fix it. Also, 400-450 is a really rough estimate. It all depends on hours and I work in a mall so hours can be great or shit. Now, I won\u2019t go into detail but my dad kicked me out in October of last year because I wanted to stay with my boyfriend on days I work late or days I work in a row to save gas an wear and tear on my car. My family is a toxic environment, not supportive, and I feel like I can\u2019t grow being around them. So when he said it was all or nothing (staying with my boyfriend or my dad) I chose to leave. \n\nI would add, I\u2019ve been spending less on things like quick fast food and eating out meals because my boyfriend didn\u2019t grow up poor or low income and can\u2019t seem to grasp that I can\u2019t just spend money when I want. I use to cave and spend all my money outside of bills but now I\u2019m starting to put my foot down and save money but it\u2019s a slow build. Mind you, I\u2019m not looking for advice on my relationship please. \n\nI\u2019ve been looking for a second job for 3 months and had great interviews and followed up but I keep getting ghosted.

I\u2019ve been trying for the past 2 months to find someone to stay with, letting them know I\u2019m able to help pay bills and will clean and all but NO ONE has space or it\u2019s like $600-$700 a month for a ROOM. \n\nIt\u2019s coming down to the wire and I need help. What are the best options for me to find a place to live for those two months? My dad won\u2019t let me back in and my mom doesn\u2019t have room for me. I\u2019ve thought about just transferring stores to we\u2019re my boyfriend lives during summer and going home with him but I wouldn\u2019t have a car, I don\u2019t want to burden his family\u2019s summer, and I would have to pay to get there and come back. Should I just stand up to my dad and say if he doesn\u2019t let me back in I\u2019ll be on the street?\n\nTLDR; I make ~$400-$450 a month, full time online student, living secretly with my boyfriend in his dorm, needing a place to live in 3 weeks for the summer while he\u2019s home.

But now I\u2019m feeling like we screwed ourselves.

        "title": "Free File tax prep can still be used today to e-file your taxes. Also, here are some last minute tax tips.",
        "original": "If your income makes you eligible, you can access Free File tax prep services from major brand names like TurboTax, TaxAct, HR Block, and FreeTaxUSA by using this IRS portal page:\n\nhttps://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/jsp/index.jsp\n\nThat page shows the eligibility for free federal and free state e-filing. There is also a link at top to a tool that lets you enter your income and state to get a filtered list.\n\nBy choosing one of the options you are eligible for, you get access to fully featured tax prep service without the upsell you might get if you instead started at the commercial vendor web sites directly.\n\nBecause of a system outage at the IRS on Tues 17 April, the IRS has extended the filing deadline by a day. So today Wed 18 April you still can take advantage of this if you haven't already filed.\n\n---\n\nFor /povertyfinance readers, I can think of a few tips to make sure you explore when preparing your taxes.\n\n1\n---\n\nFirst, make sure you **choose the right filing status**. If you are unmarried but have a dependent and provide more than half the cost of keeping up a home, the Head of Household status offers a bigger deduction and wider tax brackets. If you are married, it's usually better to file as Married Filing Jointly rather than Married Filing Separately.\n\n2\n---\n\nSecond, make sure you **know whether you can be claimed as a dependent** or not. IRS Publication 17 chapter 3 lists the tests for qualifying child and qualifying relative. If you can be claimed as a dependent, you don't get to use a personal exemption, whether you are claimed or not. Also, if you can be claimed as a dependent, many tax deductions and tax credits are not available to you. You don't get to decide whether you can be claimed: the IRS tests determine it.\n\n3\n---\n\nThird, make sure you **claim any dependents** you are eligible to claim. If you have a child with a partner you are not married to and you all live together, take the time to determine which parent should claim the child. If you live apart from your partner, you can decide which of you should claim the child, but a Form 8332 may need to be filled in if the parent who lives with the child wants to let the other parent claim the exemption.\n\n4\n---\n\nFourth, see if you are eligible for **Earned Income Tax Credit**, by reading the 1040 instructions for line 66, or using the online interactive tool at IRS. This is based on your income, and how many dependent children you have. It is available to people without children, but you need to be 25-65 and your income has to be within a certain range. The EITC is what's called a refundable tax credit, and it can be worth thousands, and it can be gotten even if you owe little or no tax, though you do need to have some earned income. In many cases, if you are eligible for it you will find that instead of owing any federal tax, you receive money.\n\n5\n---\n\nFifth, if you made any **contribution to a retirement account**, such as a personal IRA or a workplace 401(k), see if you are eligible for the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit, which lowers your tax by a dollar amount equal to 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5 * (your contribution up to 2000). See details on Form 8880. This credit can reduce income tax toward zero but not beyond that, as it is not a refundable credit.\n\n6\n---\n\nSixth, if you are a more than half-time student and are not being claimed as a dependent, see if you are eligible for the AOTC **education tax credit** based on education expenses not covered by tax-free assistance. If you are a student and are being claimed as a dependent, that credit would instead be available to whoever is claiming you. IRS Publication 970 has details.\n\n7\n---\n\nLastly, if you did not have health insurance coverage, there are several avenues to explore to find out if you are **exempt from penalty**. If your income was below filing threshold for your filing status, you are exempt. If you live in a state that did not expand Medicaid to adults and your income was under 138% of federal poverty level, you get an exemption. If you had a coverage gap of just 1 month or 2 months, you get an exemption. It's hard to get an affordability exemption if your income is very low, because ACA marketplace subsidy called premium tax credit makes coverage affordable. See Form 8965 instructions for guidance.\n\nAlso, if you got help paying premiums because you used ACA marketplace insurance with premium tax credits, use info from your Form 1095-A to complete Form 8962, which will let you know if you received too much tax credit or too little tax credit. If your income ended up being lower than you predicted when you enrolled, **you may get additional premium tax credit**. If your income ended up higher, there are caps on how much tax credit you need to repay if your income is under 400% federal poverty level. See Form 8962 instructions for guidance.",

In 2013 I found out I had stage 1 pancreatic cancer and severe diabetes. Luckily, the cancer went into remission. The cancer did come back in 2015, but it's back in remission, thankfully. Because of my health insurance, the medicine for my diabetes wasn't fully covered and they didn't even give me enough medicine for the entire month. My blood sugar was between 250\\-500 on a regular basis, resulting in me nearly passing out while I was working at Wal\\-Mart. Afterwards, I started having black out spells and seizures, which completely prevented me from working all together. All of my diabetic issues seem to have disappeared since the blackouts started, though I have no idea why or what changed in that regard.\n\nThe blackout spells started around August 2016, and continued on a semi\\-regular basis till I had a stroke back in August of 2017. Since then, the black outs have mostly stopped, but the seizures are still happening. I have been seeing a neurologist, a psychiatrist \\(I started hearing voices after the stroke\\), a cardiologist, and my regular doctor as often as I can, but nothing has gotten accomplished health\\-wise. The neurologist hasn't run any more tests since the initial test and keeps telling me he doesn't know what's was causing the black outs or really found anything out regarding the stroke I had or the damage it caused. The cardiologist won't tell me anything until I go back for results in June. And my doctor just keeps telling me he isn't a brain doctor so he can't really help. He did write me a prescription for seizure medicine, but it has only been semi\\-effective. Just the other day I had a seizure that put me in the hospital despite having been taking my medicine regularly.\n\nWith everything that has been going on, I haven't been able to work at all. I have been getting welfare money and food stamps for my 2 kids and temporary state disability but I haven't received welfare cash aid in 2 months now and the state disability must be renewed before they will send money, but I haven't gotten the form for my doctor to fill out in the mail yet. In total, I was getting about 700 a month from both the welfare and temp. state disability and our rent is 695 a month. We were paying a few hundred dollars a month, but since we haven't been able to pay anything at all over the past 2 1/2 months since the welfare money didn't come in and I haven't gotten much disability money\\-\\-and the little I was getting had to go to paying the electric and gas bills.\n\nThe only reason we haven't been evicted up until now is because of my nephew, the $2,000 in income tax I had gotten for working what little I did in 2016, and my oldest daughter's friend who loaned us money, and the FAFSA checks my oldest son had been getting. No one in my family other than them has been willing to help and my nephew won't even answer the phone for me anymore since he knows our financial situation. I have no friends I can ask for any sort of assistance and my family has mostly stopped talking to me since all of this started happening.\n\n**TL;DR** Health issues have prevented me from being able to work at all for over a year now and I have no one left who I can ask for help.\n\nMy oldest daughter is struggling to pay her own bills and can't help me and my oldest son moved back in to help watch over me and take care of his siblings while he tries to finish his A.S. degree. He has been searching for a job for months but hasn't had any luck so far.\n\nNow this is where I am today: [https://imgur.com/a/rGAyPSW](https://imgur.com/a/rGAyPSW)\n\nRent is 695 a month but they are charging 750 because of late charges.\n\nI have no idea what to do and have very little time to figure it out.

Now the balances were a little high as we did have to use them a lot about two years before because we had also been laid off at the same time back then (we worked for the same company that lost a contact)\nWe had fiercely been looking for work for over a year before I finally was hired with a really great and big company this January. Now back at the end of January my husband finally got a job as well with the PD. This background check he has been going through is VERY extensive and he just finished up his background meeting to go over the packet he had to fill out. Credit was and is a factor with all of this, they oddly ignored all the credit card debt and ONLY brought up the fact we had left an apartment before our lease was up and what they were charging us for that and that we haven't paid. (long story short, our apt was robbed, weeks later I was assaulted and attacked at my mailbox, they tried to rob me, while alone and 5 days later our apt was tagged with slurs and threats, I assume they saw the police called after I was attacked. We begged the apt to let us move, even to another property they owned on the other side of town so we could keep our lease, and they would still get paid they wouldn't do it) Anyways, they made my husband call to set up and arrangement and make a payment. We did but now we are both worried that our debt is going to be an issue. My husband explained and showed that prior to us falling down on our luck we have always been very responsible, paying everything and always on time, his credit score was 780 before this! \n\nI guess my question is, what is the deal that jobs cannot hire you due to credit issues? I mean most people aren't paying because they need jobs or are struggling and a job could help them. Sorry for the long vent but I was just a little scared.

        "original": "**EDIT: This is offered as an affordable alternative to a ramen diet for people on a ramen-level budget with ramen-level cooking skills and facilities, not as the One True Way that everyone should eat forever. I agree that there are healthier diets -- just not on $1/day.**\n\nThis is my basic recipe that I live off of when I need to spend as little on food as possible. It only costs ~$20/month more than living off cheap ramen but is WAY healthier.\n\nThis recipe is especially great for people without kitchen access because all you need is an electric rice cooker (~$20 new at Walmart, cheaper at thrift stores), a place to plug it in for 30-60 minutes, and a source of clean water. You do not even need a refrigerator because all the ingredients are shelf stable. You can cook once and eat from the pot all day because it takes a couple days to go bad at room temperature.\n\n\nCook in a rice cooker:\n\n- 1 cup rice\n\n- 1 cup lentils\n\n- 1/4 cup vegetable oil\n\n- ~5 1/2 cups water\n\n- Season with whatever you've got\n\n\nFurther instructions / tips:\n\nCost: My ~$1/day cost estimate is based on Walmart prices in the continental U.S. If you have access to an Indian grocery, you can probably save money by shopping there for rice and lentils. Indian groceries also offer a much wider variety of lentils, which they call \"dal.\" Be sure to calculate and compare per-unit prices (dollars per pound or ounce) to get the best deal.\n\nCalories: Use an online caloric needs calculator to estimate your personal daily caloric needs. Subtract calories from any other food sources (e.g. free food at work etc.). You can then adjust the basic recipe in ~350 calorie increments by adding or subtracting 1/2 cup rice and ~1 cup water. \n\nThe ~1,800 calories/day of the basic recipe meets my maintenance needs as a middle-aged woman with a desk job. When I've needed to lose weight, I halved the rice to drop down to ~1,450. If you have a physically-demanding job or otherwise get a lot of exercise then you will want to add rice to ensure sufficient energy to get you through your day.\n\nWater: Rice cookers and personal taste vary, so adjust the amount of water up or down each time you make it until you achieve the consistency (moist or dry) you prefer. \n\nFlavor: The basic recipe is very plain but this makes it a culinary blank canvas you can \"paint\" with different flavors each day for variety. So experiment with whatever you have on hand. I've used leftover sauces from other meals, fast food condiment packets, various spices and herbs, hot sauce, salsa, soy sauce, etc. Most tips for doctoring ramen should apply.\n\nUpgrades: If you can afford it, upgrade to brown rice for better nutrition and extra fiber (your poops will be amazing!). Upgrade from plain vegetable oil to other cooking oils (e.g. extra virgin olive oil etc.) to impart a different flavor. Experiment with different types of lentils/dal for variety.\n\nNutrition: This recipe is MACROnutritionally (carbs/protein/fat) balanced and the lentils/rice combo forms a complete protein, but it is not MICROnutritionally balanced. Here is the nutritional data for the basic recipe, to help you determine which nutrients you'll need to get elsewhere (click \"Total Nutrition Facts\" to get the summed values for the entire recipe):\nhttp://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+cup+uncooked+rice+1+cup+uncooked+lentils+1%2F4+cup+vegetable+oil\n\nA daily multivitamin/mineral will help but getting nutrients from food is best. So, whenever you can afford to spend a little more on food, you should add eggs (vitamin B12) and a wide variety of cheap in-season fruits and veggies for more complete nutrition. \n\nIf you are unable to buy/store/cook fresh foods, some good canned/jarred foods to supplement this with include sardines (vitamin B12, some calcium), tuna (vitamin D), sweet potatoes or spinach (vitamin A, some vitamin C), mandarin oranges or tomatoes (vitamin C), and sunflower seeds (vitamin E). Also, hard cheeses (calcium) don't necessarily have to be refrigerated to be safe to eat, they just get moldy faster at room temperature. \n\nI've spent several years tinkering around with a diet based on this basic recipe so please feel free to ask me any questions. Also, please share any ideas you may have for possible seasonings, upgrades, or modifications.\n\nI urge everyone to try my personal favorite variant of this recipe, which is a Lebanese dish called Mudajara. Upgrade to extra virgin olive oil and add carmelized onions, cumin, salt, and pepper. Mudajara is easily the highest deliciousness:cost dish I have ever eaten in my entire life!",

        "original": "Hello, 23F here. I post here on occasion, but my background is that I was poor all my life. I came from a poor family, and I am currently quite broke. Jobwise, I'm in a career with (what I think) is high earnings, but currently the only visible skyline to me is about $40k. I'm currently making about $30k a year (just barely), and I will be switching to a fulltime (salary) job in the next few months. If I continue aggressively pursuing money and stay in big cities, I could potentially claw my way to $75k+, but that's a faraway, impossible fantasy right now. \n\nThat being said, my monthly payments always make it to where I have nothing towards the end of the month unless I aggressively penny pinch, which usually means sacrificing eating better and obtaining normal health stuff like checkups. \n\nMy rent is $800 and will be going up $50 every year, my student loans are $600/mo, my utilities total to $250, the phones are $200. Groceries tend to be about $200/mo. The fianc\u00e9 (husband in two weeks) makes ~40K a year and has a $400 truck payment, $200 truck based needs, and about $200/mo for gas since his job(s) are so far away. Other house stuff goes around $100-$300/mo and any \"\"\"fun money\"\"\" we have goes to occasionally getting dinner once a month at a \"\"nice\"\" restaurant. \n\nI'm thinking of the future and feeling terrible. Will I ever own a home somewhere that's nice, like, lower middle class in a big city? I look at zillow sometimes and look up my \"ideal\" living situation: A condo, 1bed/1bath, 780 sq ft, close to where I work (since I can't possibly get a car). I found one for $165k (its considered a steal where I live) and if I put down $35k, I could have a monthly payment of $680/mo. \n\nThat's insane, though! Like, in all aspects of buying this, or any other kinda home. A $35k deposit? We can barely save $100/mo. And I'm sure there's other fees you gotta pay to buy a home. But it feels so clausterphobic that no matter where I go, rent will just keep going up by $50 wherever I go, even if I like the space. I could move to cheaper places, but I don't want to live somewhere where I'll be mugged or robbed again, like I have before. \n\nI'm so.. profoundly sad at this idea that home ownership doesn't seem to be plausible for me. I could buy \"fixer upper\" homes in dangerous, poor areas, but that's just repeating the cycle of where I currently live except I would be stuck there in a 30 year loan. \n\nI did everything I was told would be right- got good grades, went to college for my dreams, got scholarships. I followed all of the advice when I got when I was older, and now that I'm here everything seems so.. bleak. I grew up wanting a 4 bedroom house with a walk in closet and was made to feel like that was a possibility, but now I find myself gutted at the idea of not being able to afford a freakin 1 bedroom apartment because that cap is too high. \n\nAm I entitled? Am I in over my head? Is owning a home just not in the cards for me unless I sacrifice safety and stability and commute time? I feel so overwhelmed. I feel like this is going to be my life forever. I didn't want to post on personalfinance because everyone there seems like they can own and buy things no problem. ",

        "original": "My husband and I are stuck in a hard decision right now. I have never posted here, but I get a lot of great advice in this subreddit and am hoping you guys might be able to help us figure out a smart way to go.\n\nWe have been stressing and worrying over this for about a month now and it feels like we don't have any options. We are talking ourselves into circles and I don't want to make a bad choice that will screw us over in the next 5 years.\n\n*Sorry this is so long. I tried to shorten it up, but I don't want to take out too much detail. I am not great with the automotive info, but I tried to have it make sense and can get more info if necessary. We have talked about a lot of options, but I just put the main ones here.*\n\n**Backstory:**\nWe had a 1992 Subaru and a 2012 Ford focus\n\nWe bought our Ford Focus 3 yrs ago on a 5 year loan with an 8.99% interest rate and pay $225.00/month. We have a pay off amount of about 4750. It has about 215K miles on it. In good condition it is valued at about $3800 private party and about $1k for a trade in.\nI got in an accident 2.5 years ago and they put in a new transmission. We started having major transmission issues. We were nursing it along but ended up towing it home and  parking it in front of our house about a month ago. It is also now leaking coolant and we don't know the cause of that. It is not driveable.\n\nWe had about $3,000 saved up and started looking for a used car in that range. The Subaru's alternator went out so we were renting a car and decided to rush and buy a 1999 Saturn for $900. We got the Subaru fixed the following week. Then the Saturn started having a transmission problems the week after, my stepdad and husband figured it out but also found out there is a problem with it burning oil and that it isn't going to be worthwhile to keep it without taking the engine apart to fix it because of how much oil it burns. - We are listing it to sell for $1K to try and get our money back.\n\nIn the meantime, we were looking into getting the Ford fixed. This model Ford has known transmission and TCM issues (there was even a class action lawsuit) but we are outside the extended warranty for the car and the transmission apparently has no warranty on it through the manufacture (not Ford). There is a good possibility it is the transmission, but also possible it is the TCM. If it is the Transmission we are looking at $5k to fix it, which we cannot do. If we are looking at the TCM it is $500 for the part plus labor which is more doable. We have to take it to Ford to diagnose because they need to determine if it is the computer or the transmission and apparently only Ford can do that.\n\nThe ford is at our house and the ford dealer is about 20 miles away. We can have a tow truck take it for about $200 or rent a uhaul for about $110. The diagnostic will be $220.00. Depending on what it is we will either have them fix it or we will have to tow it back home and sell it. I found a site through this board that buys cars and it offered about $1100 for it, even if it isn't driveable.\n\nI am worried that the Ford is going to be a moneypit now that we have 210K miles on it. If we end up putting a couple grand into repairs and anything happens over the next 2 years on the loan, we won't be able to afford to pay it off early and will be stuck in an even worse place.\n\n**Options:**\n\nIf I pull from all of our reserves we have about $6000 I can piece together. This would leave us with almost nothing in savings. \n\n*Option 1: Try to get the Ford Fixed. Spend at least $500 to just get it there and back and diagnosed. If it is the TCM it will cost about another 1k.  Best case $1500 and we have our car back, worst case it is a $5k transmission and we are back at square 1 and minus $500. \n\n*Option 2: Pay off the remaining 4.7K on the Ford. Sell it to the website, and use that money along with what is leftover as a down payment on another car with another loan. (2-3K depending on if we get our money back on the Saturn)\n\n*Option 3: Something we are not thinking about???\n\n\nNotes:\nWe can't afford to have two car loans at once. We can barely afford to have 1.\nWe cannot have just 1 car. My husband works and goes to school and I work two jobs and have a lot of doctor appointments and they all take place in separate areas of the city.We are putting at least double the miles on the subaru right now and it is eating up gas and causing us both stress. We can make it work for a month or so, but not long term.\nWe have no bussing options here. We are about 20 miles from a major city, we both work in the major city but there are no lines to get us from here to there.\nWe have no family member we can ask for help/money and we don't have anyone who has an extra car we can borrow. \n\nIf we have to finance we are going to do research to try to get a good car and get one with low miles. We have bad luck with things going wrong on financed cars but we also need something reliable. No car=no work/school. We have okay credit (I have a 650 and he has a 730) so I think we could get a decent rate.\n",

This is a big TIL for me because I thought we were doing decent. I also spend roughly $200 on LYFT rides because I don't have a car, and it takes me to a 20 minute commute a day vs an hour commute if I take a lyft. however, bus rides are only $2 AND if I walked about a mile, it could be for free. \n\nI also know a lot of the issue is that our wedding is next month so I've been going HAM buying everything we need for the wedding, and we also have been replacing our very old house-wares because we're in a new \"nice\" apartment and got tired of getting metal flakes in our food. *All* of our stuff needed to be replaced, so every paycheck I would calculate the bare minimum to pay for everything else and then go on a shopping trip to ikea or amazon. \n\nMy student loan doesn't kick in until August, so I actually have $620 extra laying around per month that's all been funneled away into wedding stuff, updating our stuff, house, and buying a wardrobe for me because all of what I had was old, baggy, full of holes and just not appropriate for an office. I thought I was doing decent by always buying cheaply or on sale, but.. it adds up a lot. Plus that lyft issue is pervasive. \n\nOn the last thread, I got a lot of really good advice. The biggest one was to chill tf out, which I hadn't been doing. As it stands, we will investigate what it'll mean to lower our phone bill, but I don't anticipate that happening since my job semi-relies on having a new iphone (photos, notes, mac integration, etc. It was very much a business purchase). I also live in the biggest city in Ohio, so it's a decent midwest place to live. My job/career, however, flourishes in big to huge cities.

My mom has been helping me out with money for that, but next month my relative that I live with expects me to pay $500-$750 (per month) just to have a lil bedroom in her house. I have no clue how I'm going to come up with that money by next week!!!!! (Currently I have no money). \n\n\nI am 24 years old, female, and I do have high functioning autism (aspergers).

        "original": "Hey everyone,\n\nThe past few years have been quite the rollercoaster ride. For starters I am a 28 year old male living in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2016 I had been laid off from a position I held for 8 years (big box retail working in the warehouse for those wondering). It was my first time experiencing a dramatic life change like that and did all I could to secure a job. I have no education other than a highschool diploma. I applied to many places in LA. Fast food, waiter, data entry, even other warehouse jobs. 3 months had passed and my emergency fund was running thin and still had no job offers. Some interviews but, never any calls back. It was around this time I took up selling items of eBay, drop shipping if you will. I know there are mixed feelings about this but at the time this was a viable option. I also started to drive for Lyft to supplement my income as well.\n\nI'd like to dive into a bit backstory of my life. When I was around 22 years old my Dad had been laid off from his job as a clerk at an insurance company. As the only other person in my family working at the time it was up to me to provide. I had to max out credit cards and even took a second job. My father's car also broke down and we shared my vehicle. This was a year long struggle until my Father finally landed a job which he is still working today and has climb the corporate ladder. This has left me several thousand in debt as well as my Father who he too is also paying off his own.\n\nFast forward to now and I finally am back to work. I own my own freelance business as a Audio Engineer and Video editor. I know what some of you are thinking, no education. When I was 14 I was heavily invested into music thanks to my grandparents and parents. No they were not stars or professionals but, they grew up as music lovers. This was the only interest that ever meant anything to me and I pursued it anyway possible. Coming from a low income family I learned on my own how to produce music, mix and master. At 21 years old I slowly picked up video editing as, to me at the time, made since to combine music and videos. Remember MTV?\n\nThrough the help of mutual friends I was able to land cliets in mid 2017 and finally began making income. My portfolio was getting bigger and I was actually working in a space that I truly love, being creative. I also stopped driving for Lyft as it takes massive amount of hours to reach barely minimum wage. On top of that, paying for gas.\n\nHowever, yesterday I was hit with an IRS notice that I owed $9k unfilled taxes. Remember that eBay thing I mentioned? This is entirely my fault as I did not file my taxes correctly. I have since gone to HR block to have it all correct and thankfully had it reduces to $6k. Yes, still a lot of money. So in total with my other debt from previous years. I am sitting at \n\nCredit cards: $8k\nCar: $19k\nIRS Owed: $6\n\nTotal: $33k\n\nI know, this is far less than your typical debt situation. I was able to consolidate my credit cards on to a 0% APR card for 15 months, so that helps a little. I want to continue pursuing my freelance business however currently I am making $1k a month before tax. I put away 30% as recommend when owning your own business. I do have Lyft as an option but for those who never did ride share jobs. You sometimes get lucky and make $100 in 2 hours or you make $100 in 10 hours. Living in LA with a bunch of other entrepreneurs also doing ride share, I tend to make that $100 on the latter. Gas has not even been factored in and maintenance in my vehicle. When I was driving for Lyft during my eBay year, I was averaging 300 miles a day to make that $100. However having to put gas in every 2nd or 3rd day on a tank that takes $50 to fill. It almost seems not worth it. \n\nIf I was to do Lyft and try to also do my freelance job, I would more likely lose money and hours as well as focus when I'm tired from driving when working on a huge client project.\n\nI've been pretty good at being level heading through the previous years but this year is different. I believe it's because I finally have my dream job and I don't want to lose it.\n\nAny advice, tips, help and more as very greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: \nForgot to mention some bills I pay monthly. I do live with my parents who have been very supportive and tend not to make me pay for anything but I can't help it because I know they are struggling also\n\nRent: $50\nPhone: $0\nGroceries: $50\nGas: $50\nCar: $380\nCredit Cards: $150\n\nTotal: $680 est.\n\nEdit 2: Fixed my monthly bills.

It's my third priority with only helping my family and fixing my health above it, at this point. I'm 5 years into living rent-free with my Dad, keeping his house and helping with his 13-year-old. Five years sharing a bed and room with a now seven-year-old girl. it's past time we moved out. I got on the waitlist for some quality affordable housing,  saved up the total deposit and first-last months rent and set about reducing debt to have lower monthly payments once we move.\n\nOf course, the other shoe has to drop, My car dies and needs a $3k part. The car is worth less than $500 and already in need of other major maintenance. I took 2 days off of work, put a thousand dollars down and got a car slightly bigger than a hamster cage that accelerates slower than a ten-speed bike with no significant scheduled maintenance for a good year or two all so I could get the mpg I need for my commute to not cost me half my paycheck. I did my research and bargained my way to a payment that lets me save up the $1k again in about 2 months, if I reduce the extra I'm paying on my debt. I'll basically be back to where I was again in two months, right when I will be moving.\n\nTechnically I'm not behind, but holy fuck do I feel spread thin and stressed and generally like I just ran a marathon through a shit trench. Dealing with scummy car dealers, doing mad research on vehicles, spending hours crunching numbers and figuring out options, missing work I can't afford to miss, everything is just piling up.\n\nThen this evening I wake up to get ready for my graveyard shift, and my Dad tells me my little one broke my laptop. She twisted the power cable in such a way that the connector broke loose and twisted, cracking the case hard enough to break the fan drop the connector into the guts of the laptop. \n\nI didn't cry when my car broke. I didn't cry when I signed over that thousand bucks I bled and sweat for. I didn't cry when I signed on the dotted line for that loan. However, I bawled when I found out I lost my laptop. I nearly threw up, from crying so hard. I still feel sick to my stomach thinking about it hours later. When I texted a friend and told them, after getting to work, I nearly had a panic attack explaining the situation.\n\nI'm not awake during the day. I don't get to the library, I don't get to watch regular tv, my laptop is basically my sole source of entertainment/relaxation/etc. and possibly vitamin D since I don't get sunlight. I play rimworld to stay awake during my shift, I use a complicated excel spreadsheet for my budgeting, use the kindle chrome app to read books from the library. Work is now my only access to computer/internet. A new one isn't an option. It would set me back a month or two and I'd lose my spot on the waitlist. It's stupid, utterly incomprehensible that this is what caused me to snap. I feel dumber than a box of rocks but there you have it. It's not that major financial hurdles and crisis that get to you in the end; it's the small stuff.",

        "original": "In 2014, my ex kicked myself and my daughter out of our house. We ended up in a shelter called Family Promise. The way it works is that you live in a church for a week, then on Sunday morning, you pack up and by Sunday evening, you start your next week at a new church. \n\nFor a kid, being in a homeless shelter has the potential to be quite traumatic. Having heard only indirectly about a movie called Life is Beautiful, in which a man makes the concentration camp into \"a game\" for his kid... I hatched a plan. \n\nI had a cube I'd made in machining class. Since my daughter was deeply into Transformers (robots), I told her that this cube was Red Energon. We had to protect it from the Decepticons (the bad robots). Every time we were riding somewhere in the car, I'd have her fend off the decepticons, \"pew pew!\"\n\nWe'd pick random vehicles along the road that were obviously decepticons, and every Sunday, we'd pack up \"home base\" because \"it was discovered, and we had to hurry to escape before the Decepticons stormed our base!\" \n\nI grant, it can be hard and tedious sometimes to play these games. You're already under stress, and it's not easy to \"play pretend\" with your kid while you are dealing with all this crap.\n\nI do think it's super important, though, to remember that *your kids are going through this, too, and it's stressful for them also.* As a parent, it only takes a little effort to pretend.\n\nTo this day, she absolutely loves Transformers. She never outgrew it, and we still sometimes pretend to fend off Decepticons when driving around (she's 11, so only if we're alone, because it's not COOL, you know). \n\nShe remembers her time in the shelter with great fondness, instead of with the original sense of fear she experienced. She talks about it and wants to volunteer so she can help other kids going through it.\n\nSo if you find your kids are struggling with poverty, find a game that you can play together, or some way to spend time with them. Talk with them. \n\nAlways remember that even if they aren't aware they're poor, they know *you're* stressed out. Making a point to give them attention will change their whole view of the experience.\n\nTL;DR: While homeless and moving from church to church each Sunday, I played \"Moving our Transformers base to escape the Decepticons\" with my daughter. She now looks back fondly on our time in the shelter, instead of with fear. ",

        "title": "By Popular Request: How I Became Homeless and What I did to Get Out",
        "original": "In another thread, I casually mentioned that I had been homeless in 2014, and someone asked me how I ended up homeless and how I got out of it. The bulk of this is my response. I've added a couple of things to it. A number of people have PM'd me and asked me to post it as its own post.\n\nThere's not TL;DR for this, sorry. It's just not a story easily told in a paragraph or even two. \n\nHere's the original comment: \n\nI moved to where I live now to be with a guy. I used up my retirement account and lost my 401k by the laws of the state I was in (it wouldn't transfer, and I couldn't close it out, so it went away outside of my contributions, which I used for survival as well).\n\nWhen I was with my ex, I didn't save because he kept using it and discouraging it, \"We'll have my retirement to live on. We're together, we're a family, this is for the rest of our lives\". I fell for it, so I had nothing when he decided that he'd had enough and that was that.\n\nI wasn't working because getting child care for a kid with diabetes would have cost more than i could make at the time. I was writing books and had just started to make some money at it, though, and I had big plans on continuing and improving that. I wanted to work from home, so it was a huge deal to me to \"make a go of it\".\n\nThen when he decided he was done, he kicked us out and moved his new girlfriend in two days later. I had nowhere to go, so I used 211 and was lucky to get into Family Promise.\n\nWhile there, I decided that, at 42 and making barely minimum wage, I NEEDED to better my life. I went to the local chapter of \"workforce\" type thing \"NH Works\" is the name of ours. It's an employment assistance program.\n\nBecause I was homeless, I was eligible to go to school... I knew, though, that I couldn't get myself into a year or two of it... I needed something NOW. You only get 6 months at Family Promise, so after much discussion, I went into a 8 week \"boot camp\" for machine operation (machining/machinist).\n\nJust as my session was going to start up, they decided not to run it. I went to my local Representatives' websites. They had \"scholarship information\" on one (It was Sheehan). I called to ask them about it, and explained my situation. Sheehan called the school the next day and the class was back on.\n\nSo I took an 8 week boot camp and struggled along, getting up at 5 and going to bed at midnight to study my tookus off. In the middle of it, I lost my vehicle in an accident. Being uninsured at the time, it was horrible. I had nothing. No car, no money, and the accident was pinned on me (even though it wasn't my fault), so I ended up owing money for that, too.\n\nNow, I had 4k debt, no way to get around, and I was terrified. The shelter let me use their van, fortunately, but \"intentionally made it hard on me\" (in her own words). She tried to make me \"make [your ex] do it\" with regards to driving my daughter around. Yeah, right...\n\nSo, I did manage to actually succeed. This while my diabetic child was diagnosed with non-functioning thyroid, I was fighting my ex who was trying to take custody of my daughter because I was homeless, etc. etc.\n\nIn the end, I was able to take my top earning potential of $9.50 an hour and make $15.00 at my first job as a newly trained machine operator.\n\nAfter that, things were still SUPER hairy and hard. I got eviction notices monthly \"because if you fail to pay, we can go forward with the eviction\" because I was super late with everything because I started out behind and my rent was low for the area but still high.\n\nI got on every list, used every possible thing I could find. I applied for EVERYTHING and often re-applied at any change of circumstances. I spent a lot of time at the local Welfare office.\n\nIn the meantime, I had my job taking $25 a week extra out of my taxes. Come the first time tax time rolled around, I spent it ALL catching up and even paid a month ahead immediately.\n\nThat was 2015 and I thought I had gotten ahead enough that I would have no more late fees. I started to go upwards with regards to saving a bit of money here and there.\n\nThen in 2016, i had ANOTHER car accident (again, not my fault, but this time at least it wasn't blamed on me. I was insured, too... and I had gap insurance). However, due to other circumstances (medical), I lost my good credit rating. I ended up buying a car for $1000 and putting myself behind on bills (as well as the missed work).\n\nCome the next time that I got my taxes back, I got caught up again. I also, at that time, started putting $20 a WEEK into a retirement account.\n\nWhat gave me the courage to do that, even as it seemed everything was falling apart, was the fact that I read somewhere that we automatically adjust to what income we have.\n\nCurrently, the only help I get is Section 8 housing voucher. I don't qualify for anything else. Times are hard and lean, but I have a retirement account and I have a small savings and I'm making all the bills on time. I get a nice return and never owe at tax time, even as my income is now \"high\". Technically, I'm above poverty, but in my area, I'm significantly below \"basic subsistance\". I drive an old beater, yes. I live in a cramped, small apartment, yes. I have few amenities, yes.\n\nBut I'm paying things off each year at tax time, and so that's improving my lot in life inch by inch. One HUGE thing is using that tax money in a way that supports you, because the temptation to \"enjoy it\" is HUGE.\n\nHope that helps a little bit. Mostly, it's just keep on keeping on, really. Force yourself to save by taking it out before you ever see it, and make it inaccessible. That's key. When you DO get it, you'll have a chunk to use to catch up on whatever you can, or pay towards principle.\n\nSo yeah. Plug away at it. Find a way to save. You'll adjust. You will. \n----------------------------\n\n*Here are a couple of big things I forgot in that, since it was sort of \"stream of consciousness\" commenting.*\n\nRight out of the homeless shelter, I had a great job that offered a lot of overtime, very flexible on the OT both in amount and time frames. However, a couple of the guys there wanted me to have sex with them and just would NOT quit. I finally told one that if he didn't desist, I would go to HR. He went to them ahead of me and claimed I sexually harassed him. Because I had missed so much 'scheduled' work hours, they wouldn't even listen to my side of the story AT ALL. They just ended the position. I was then unemployed for the holidays of 2015 and was denied unemployment twice due to errors in who the unemployment agency was trying to get information from (apparently temp-to-hire positions are tooooo confusing). \n\nAlso, right after leaving the shelter, literally as I was moving into my new apartment, I was contacted by someone from N.A.M.U.S. I am the daughter of a missing person (reddit verified in the /r/unresolvedmysteries sub), and they were trying to reactivate my mother's cold case. Since I was a witness to the disposal of her body, it was a very traumatic time to be reminded of why I have no family and no one to turn to. It's another whole rabbit hole in and of itself, but suffice to say it was an emotional struggle at JUST the right time (sarcasm, yes). \n\nAnyway, again... If I can do it, you definitely can do it. I'm autistic, dyslexic, I have severe PTSD, had severe insomnia (a year or so ago, I managed to get past that, at least), scoliosis that leads to chronic extreme pinched-nerve pain in my back to the point I sometimes can't get up from the bed without pain pills (thanks to muscle cramping making it impossible), a speech impediment, a bulging disc (aggravated by car accidents).... well. I'll end the list there before you get bored. Suffice to say that I can tell you that you CAN do it. If I can do it, you definitely, completely can do it. ",

I have a certificate program, a college diploma, and some university behind me. And while I do make a little bit of money here and there as a self-employed actor, my career hasn't reached a point where I'm consistently landing professional gigs.\n\nMy current day job is in the retail sector. I've been with this company for about 4 years and am serving as an assistant manager, but am still making minimum wage and have no benefits. My company has repeatedly slashed hours in the wake of a recent minimum wage increase, and has reneged on their promise of giving me a minimum of 35 hours per week. It has reached the point that I'm beginning to worry about consistently paying my rent: any unexpected expense is enough to potentially ruin me. And while there may be some room for improvement, I am already fairly frugal with my spending habits.\n\nMy question is: what decently-paying jobs are available to someone with my current educational background? I feel like so much is closed off to me as someone with an arts background: the job market is so saturated, and many positions seem to require bachelors degrees for what seem like fairly simple positions, leaving only minimum wage, part-time retail or fast food open as options. \n\nIdeally, any job I apply to would be something with some flexibility (to allow me to pursue acting auditions or opportunities as they arise, as that's still my end-goal).

I'm working one job and applying to others. And I'm in school working towards a degree. The advice I'm asking for is how to get through the next few weeks.\n\nEdit 3: My student loan deferment was denied. I'm trying again to apply. It's probably a hopeless endeavor, but I have to try something. The payment is scheduled for 11 days from now, and I dont have the money.\n\nFor the last year I've pretty much been living paycheck to paycheck. I've gone through 4 jobs this year because of scheduling conflicts/low pay/not enough hours/other problems. It's a terrible cycle I've been in. I run low on money, get a new job, finally start having money, get excited and hopeful, lose that job, run out of money, repeat.\n\nI've been working two jobs since January. I wasn't making enough money to really put anything into savings or buy anything, but my bills were getting paid. Well, I went out of state for two weeks in April that ended up being more expensive than I thought it would be. Truthfully it drained almost all of my money. My checking account, savings account, you name it. Then I came back to find that one of my jobs closed down. I was also incredibly sick for a week after coming back. Because of being out of town and my poorly-timed illness, my last paycheck was only like $50 and I won't be getting any money this paycheck. So right now I have $74 to my name, and won't be paid again until the 25th of May.\n\nI'm desperately looking for jobs right now, and I have a place to apply as a last resort if no one else calls back. I already know my bank account is going to go negative. I have a lot more than $74 worth of bills coming out soon. I'm trying to call as many places as possible and see if I can defer my payments. \n\nI'm not really sure what advice I'm looking for from you guys, but anything you can recommend I'll look into. Thanks for your help, I'm so tired of living like this. It's exhausting. \n\nEdit: I was going to add all this as a reply to a  comment, but decided it would be better off here. I've cut out my unnecessary bills, and I'm trying to defer the others. I applied for a deferment for my student loan, I should hear back within 10 days. I'm looking at options now for my car loan. Monday I'm going to call about another bill. My dad paid my car insurance for April. \n\nMy boyfriend is amazing and very helpful. He has a great paying job and even though I will feel awful asking, I know he will help me put gas in my car to get to work. I live with him and his family. They're not very wealthy, so there's not *a lot* of food in the house, but I won't go hungry. \n\nI'm stocked up on supplies for my pets, so I won't have to buy them anything for a while. I don't really have much of anything I can sell to make spare cash, but I do crochet and I try to sell stuff on Etsy. Unfortunately I've only ever had one sale. \n\nI'm going to set a date (trying to decide now which day) and if I haven't gotten a call about a new job, I will apply to my last resort place. It's actually somewhere I used to work. I liked the job itself, but had some problems with the way it was run. It ended up causing me so much stress that I had to leave for my own health. So I'm not trying to rush back, but I know that they would take me back, and if I have to I definitely will do it. \n\nMy current job is awesome and pays really well. Unfortunately, January-September is slow there and I'm only getting 15 hours per week. We are already getting shipments of Christmas stuff (no joke), and once that season starts hours will pick up. I'll probably be near 40 per week. And if I have a second job by then, the hours and money will be great. It's getting myself to that point that's the current problem.\n\nAnd I already know someone is going to comment that I should go to trade school so I'll address that now. I'm not interested in any career of that nature. I'm in school on and off as I have the time/money for a career that I want and is hiring. Unfortunately I still have about 2 years of schooling left. Trade school is a fantastic idea for some people, but not for everyone. For me it would take time/money away from me pursuing a good paying career to study a field I'm not interested in/won't really use. ",

SNAP and she barely makes enough to keep a roof over our heads.\n\nTo add to the fear factor, we have no family or friends close by. We moved here for the exact job I just got fired from.

I've also been told the main reason I can't get ahead is because I can't travel.... but I can't afford to travel until they give me a promotion/significant raise so I can hire help for my wife or fly in relatives to help her while I'm gone.... what a wonderful infinite loop to be in.\n\nNow that the back story is out of the way, here's my current status\n2 months behind on mortgage\n1 month behind on all utilities\n1 Box of collections letters and other medical bills I can't think to touch much less pay yet\n1 wife and 4 kids to feed and house\n2 of those kids are confirmed diagnosed with autism, 1 of them non-verbal and severe case, the other more mild but still VERY much on the spectrum\n\nGiven our current financial state and my current state of absolute burn out from IT, I'd almost rather deliver pizzas or wash dishes at the IHOP down the street anymore.  Unfortunately that doesn't pay the bills.\n\nSo here goes nothing assuming I no longer have a job come Monday\n\nPlan A:  Take two weeks off to recover from burn out and then go looking for another job (this decision is severance package dependent)\n\nPlan B:  Assuming no severance package, immediately apply for unemployment for myself, disability for my two Autistic children, apply for disability for my wife, and get started on food stamps.  (Fun fact I'm currently only able to budget $250 on a good week for groceries, food stamps will pay $500+ for the same time period.  Because I make as much as I do we would have to have two more kids to qualify for them).\n\nPlan C:  Crypto Mining (severance package dependent)\n\nTrying to find a path through these weeds and could use some advice.\n\n\n- edit - the aftermath -\n\nTl;dr is i ate my crow and still have a job.  Will definitely be brushing up on PowerShell and tweaking resume though to start the hunt.   Thank you to everyone for their comments ideas and advice even the controversial advice.",

        "title": "Preparing For A Baby: A Single Mom's Guide",
        "original": "At the end of 2015. I found myself pregnant with my now 20 month old son. It was not planned, I was not in a position to rely on my son's father, and I've always been poor. I did have a full-time job, a beater car, and an affordable rental home but almost no cash or resources to spare in preparing for my first child. I thought I'd write up a post that may help other women (or fathers/couples!) in a similar situation and explain some of the things I did or learned along the way that really helped me. \n\n\n1) I applied for pregnancy Medicaid. I received this immediately and it covered ALL of my routine ob/gyn visits as well as almost the entire labor and delivery. I  had an emergency c-section and ended up staying in the hospital with my son for 9 days. Medicaid covered almost the entire bill; I ended up owing about $200 after the hospital stay but the hospital I delivered at had a financial program for low-income women (you have to ask!!) so my final out-of-pocket cost was $40. Absolutely amazing considering what it costs to have a baby and I was able to attend all appointments and never thought twice about having to see my doctor unexpectedly for issues along the way. All of my prescriptions during pregnancy and for three months afterwards, were absolutely free so ask your doctor to prescribe prenatal vitamins. You should take them anyway but buying them OTC is expensive so get them free from the pharmacy by telling your doctor you need a prescription because of cost. It does seem though that the quality/availability of care through Medicaid is very dependent on your geographical location as I've spoken with other mothers who did not have such an easy or good time with pregnancy Medicaid. Talk to your case manager when you sign up and ask about your best options. It really pays to do your own research as the system is usually really overwhelmed and your case manager only has so much time/effort/care they can give you.  Also, sign up for WIC and SNAP right NOW. \n\n\n2) Lean on your family and friends. Everyone loves a new baby! I was very, very fortunate in that I have an incredible, supportive family. My sister bought me so many gifts that I'm not sure I could of done it without her. My dad assembled so much baby equipment and furniture for me that it was basically a second job for him. Cousins, aunts, co-workers, friends all bought gifts. Do not be shy about accepting them or telling them exactly what you need if they ask. Which leads me to number 3.\n\n\n3) Have a baby shower. If you don't have anyone close enough to you that will throw one for you, plan it yourself. It absolutely does not have to cost a ton of money. You can make cheap but good foods like cold pasta salad and hamburgers; just host it at your home or in a public park (weather permitting of course) to save on a party hall rental. I know this seems like a social sin to throw your own baby shower but you have to do what you have to do and most people won't care anyway. People will bring gifts so I would highly suggest creating a registry. When I was pregnant , babies r us was still around and they had a million options at a million price points. They even gave you a gift card worth 10% of the final amount of things bought off your registry a few months after your due date so search around online for the store offering the best options for deals near you. Even if you don't have a shower, create a registry at any store that offers incentives. Add the items you're going to purchase for yourself and then buy them off the registry to get the incentives. \n\n\n4) STOCKPILE. I knew I would not be paid for any type of maternity leave so I began buying supplies I knew I'd need immediately to have them on hand when I was out of work after my son's birth. This GREATLY reduced my financial burden and the accompanying stress because I didn't have to worry about diapers, wipes, etc. Every month of my pregnancy, I bought at least one jumbo box of diapers and one jumbo box of wipes. I also suggest buying bulk sale items when you come across them and have the extra money. I have not bought diaper rash cream, baby lotion/shampoo/soap, or baby sunscreen since I was pregnant because I still have stockpiles of it and my son is now 20 months. I managed this by buying a ton of it whenever I came across a good sale. You will always end up using it and most products have a very long shelf-life. If an item(s) is very heavily discounted and you know for certain that you will need it but not for 9 months or so, I'd buy it as long as you can store it. It's also helpful to stock up on children's Tylenol and such because when you live alone, there is no one you can send to the store at 2 am when baby has a teething fever. \n\n\n5) Buy what you can second-hand and then resell it when you no longer need it. Bassinets, pack-and-plays, clothes, etc. Browse thrift stores and places like Once Upon A Child very frequently because they get new items often and you have to be quick when something good comes in. Buy clothes in sizes 1-2 up when you come across good deals on them because you're going to need them soon anyway. I bought my son clothes all the way up until size 12 months when I was pregnant and never had to buy any the first year of his life. Also try Facebook marketplace, Craig's List, and friends with growing children. Do not worry about fancy equipment like electric bottle warmers or lace dresses, buy basic. If baby is clean, fed, and well looked after, it does not matter if his outfit is trendy or if you have a baby wipe warmer. I had never been around babies so I solicited the advice of a million different websites and almost every parent I came across. Gather information about what you'll really actually need and use vs. what you want or are not sure about.\n\n\n6) Sign up for coupons. Companies love to throw coupons and the occasional free item at new parents. Sign up for formula coupons (I know for sure that both enfamil and similac offer them) even if you plan on breastfeeding. They'll bombard your mailbox with good sized samples and substantial coupons. Look online for rewards programs like the one Pampers offers, too. Sign up for all of it. This is questionably ethical but I also had my sister sign up for the same coupons using her address and my due date. I was able to use twice the amount of coupons this way. \n\n7) Find out about subsidized daycare. There may be a waiting list so see if you can get on it now and research the daycares that accept it. Research and apply for every single social program available BEFORE baby arrives. \n\n8) This last part is mostly for the women who are doing it alone like me. Do not be scared to ask for help whenever you need it. I was and I suffered. I look back now and wish I just would of spoken up. If you need a break (and you will) from baby, please reach out to someone you trust who can babysit for a few hours while you take a nap or do something for yourself. Do not burn yourself out because your mental health and parenting skills will suffer. Look into mommy groups, talk with other women online, see a therapist, whatever you need to do. I have found that most of the women in my situation are desperate for friends who understand what they go through so find some. Don't let anyone make you feel ashamed. Ever. These things happen, we do what we need to in order to survive, and we love our children. PM me if you need to talk. Pursue child support adamantly. The state will file for you if you receive assistance but you really have to stay on top of them to actually achieve anything. Also, don't rely too heavily on the child support. Think of it as extra cash because if you end up losing it or never getting it or whatever, it won't hurt your finances so badly. Caring for a baby alone is SO FUCKING HARD and if it ever gets easier, I'll be sure to let you know but it is possible to do it. \n\n\nEdit: This is getting some attention so I wanted to add one more bit of advice. If you haven't put any effort into it before, it's now the time to construct a plan for financial longevity. For me personally, this meant education. Be honest with yourself about the amount of effort you are really willing and able to put in so that your plans/goals are achievable and grounded in reality. It's great to dream big but don't end up racking up debt in an attempt to get a BA in your childhood dream field of philosophy only to drop out after two semesters because life is hard (it is!) or eventually graduate with hefty loans with no job prospects. Don't put it off either. It's going to be really difficult but it's going to be difficult in our type of situation anyway so try to do something that will put you in a better earning position within a few years. ",

I already had $8000 in student loans from my first attempt to get a degree, though for this at least, the payments were put on hold since the incident (the interest continues to accrue, however). My monthly expenses are $800 or so a month, and while thankfully my roommate is lenient enough to cover bits and portions as she can, her money is not endless, and only adds to the debt. I also trade my cooking abilities for her paying for all the food.\n\nFor the good parts, I do have a working car that is relatively cheap to use. It's a two-door and over ten years old, though, so I cannot use it for ride sharing. Perhaps most importantly, my credit is--at least for now--fairly decent at about 740ish because of my efforts before all of this. We are also trying to move somewhere cheaper without the urgency of our last move... but this comes with the caveat that all of the places we're looking are accessible only by car and not public transit.\n\nIs there any way to dig myself out of this hole? And is there a good way to prioritize these debts? Should I just live in my car? Am I just dragging my dearest friend and roommate down? I feel completely trapped. I'm only going to make less and less money, and accrue more and more debt. Not going back to school is, for many reasons both good and bad, not an option (if only for another source of loans).\n\nThanks for any ideas and whatnot ahead of time! I really want to make things work. I've been pushing for years now, and don't intend to give up--but I've definitely hit a brick wall on this one.",

        "original": "**This is in Canada**\n\nLong story short, when I was 19 I opened a business with the $10k I had for tuition when I realized that the college program I'd enrolled in wasn't going to get me any job I wanted. I had a business partner a couple years older in the same artistic industry who I shared the commercial lease and space with, and kept my expenses all within my budget to operate for a year without seeing a profit. \n\nAfter 4 months that partner decided they weren't that serious about their business any more, bought a car, moved into their own place and then told me they wanted out of the lease we both signed over a year and a half early. \n\nLots of other drama came with this, but the long and short of it is that I got to keep all of the equipment that the partner had bought thanks to my lawyer friend, but I was unable to find a replacement and had to start putting my now-double lease payment on my credit cards that were $3000 between the two, and eventually couldn't afford the hundreds of dollars of minimum payments on top of it and defaulted. Thankfully my property manager found another tenant and let me out early, but it was too late for my credit. \n\nSince then I've had very unstable employment between working from home, a few contract jobs, etc. Had to move back in with parents, got rid of my car, just been in a rut of anxiety and depression for the last couple of years while dodging creditor calls because I never knew when I'd have money next and didn't want to lose the only spending money I could get. \n\nThis past year I've been trying to get my act together, taking care of a lot of other loose ends like speeding tickets that I'd ignored in my depression and now the only debt I have left is those credit cards that I hadn't heard about for the past couple of years. \n\nToday I received a letter from the collection agency for the smaller one of those credit cards that originally had a $500 balance. It says they're willing to settle for $360 \"based on my current financial situation\" (which is still pretty broke but I have some money coming in every month), but it also says the amount owing is $1200 when I know that balance never went above $500. Would 4 years be long enough to build up $700 of penalties on $500? It also says I could do payments, and doing it in 2-3 payments would be way easier for me, but I'm worried that they'll add on extra fees or taxes to do it that way. \n\nIf I understand correctly, receiving this letter restarts the 7(?) year wait until it falls off my credit, so it seems to me like I should just pay this, but then I still have my other $2500 card..should I try to contact the agency collecting for that or wait until they make me a similar offer? \n\nThis is way longer than I thought, but hopefully clear and detailed enough. I appreciate any and all help, thank you! \n\n",

At that time, I was struggling to make payments on a 2010 Honda Civic (long story, but parents had helped me buy it while I was in college, on the premise I would take over the payments when I got my \"out of school job\" but boy were they wrong about my ability to get a full time job, let alone one that would cover $250/month payment and $200/insurance). I sold the car before I moved because I couldn't afford it and used the little I got from the sale after I paid the loan off to help me with the move assuming I would find a car for a decent price in my new home.\n\nFast forward 2 years and I have saved around $4500. I have been looking for a decent used car, but it seems like everything here for sale privately is either SUPER high km's and people want a lot of money for the vehicles because they have put a lot of work in, or they are newer cars that are selling for around $8000-$10,000. A lot of sketchy sellers too, ones that don't have records for their cars, obvious problems upon viewing things like that. My dad used to help me with my car shopping when I lived in my home province (he is a mechanic) but since I have moved to my new location I have no family support to help me even go look at vehicles. My SO doesn't drive. For perspective, where I live, it is a 90 min ferry to the closest city or actual used car dealership. On the other side of the ferry there is transit I could take, but having someone to drive me would make life a lot easier to shop for cars - this is one reason I haven't been looking as much as I probably could have been. I have friends I could ask, but I would likely need to pay for half of the ferry costs (around $50) and then give them gas money for their time and trouble. I don't have a lot extra right now so this is a worry for me, especially if my search is fruitless.\n\nI miss having a car, but I have done well with the bus and walking to my job where I work full time. I can scrape by and save $200 a month - this goes into my 'car fund'. My job is busy right now because it is the summer so I am guaranteed my full time hours, but in the winter it's not always as steady. This is a reason I'm iffy about getting a car with a payment. I am already paying around $350 a month towards my student loans and I pay for most of the groceries etc right now as my SO has been hard up finding work in his field. \n\nI guess what I am looking for advice on is, \n\nIs it best to wait it out and keep looking for something half decent where I'm at? And keep saving in the meantime? Make the best of transit and hitchhiking for summer adventures?\n\nOr would it be a good idea for me to look into getting something from a used dealership, something that I know has a warranty, records, and low kms? Need something reliable to visit my family in my home province around a 1000 km drive away.\n\nI have no idea what to do going forward and I'm frustrated and need help.

I have state insurance so who I can see is limited and the waitlist for any sort of appointment is usually 2 weeks to a month. I\u2019m a patient at a community health center and last week I used their website to contact my primary care provider to let her know that I planned on attending community college but I had not been vaccinated for chicken pox, had them as a child, had no way of accessing my previous health records, the school had sent me a form (which I attached to my email) and wanted to know what to do. A nurse called me to make an appointment for a physical which today I found out has nothing to do with my current issue. I go in this morning and the doctor has no idea why I\u2019m here, doesn\u2019t have the message I sent or any notes from the nurse I spoke to, and was just very short with me. I also have no definite answer as to what needs to happen as the doctor wouldn\u2019t talk to me about it until I brought in the form that I had already sent them.

I\u2019m not a doctor or any health professional but I just feel like it would have made things easier if the nurse communicated with my doctor and they just added the test to my lab work before I went in.

Let me give you some background info about myself.\n\nI am a 21\\-year\\-old college student from the Netherlands who currently lives in Denmark. Although Denmark is not the cheapest country to live in, the fact that I do not have to pay any tuition fees and that I live in the outskirt of Denmark, makes living costs doable. In fact, I currently save 40&#37; of my income \\(50&#37; of which goes to traveling, 20&#37; to investing, and 20&#37; to general savings \\(buffer, emergency savings, and opportunity fund\\).\n\nI currently live in a student complex which is a nice place. Rent is higher than what most of my peers pay, but I get 32m2 for \u20ac400/$475 with a private bathroom and kitchen, which I think is worth it, as I need my space for my computer set up and my electric drums. Luckily, the complex allows its tenants to play instruments till 10 PM, but I usually stop earlier for the sake of being polite to my upper\\-neighbor \\(I live on the corner, my left\\-door\\-neighbor has no respect for me, so I couldn't care less about her\\).\n\nSadly, my drum teacher will be moving to the city soon, as he has been accepted by a music school \\(proud of him\\), and he will be going on a three\\-month tour in North\\-America playing with a band, so he has things going for him. He needs to sell many things to cover for his move and due to he will be living in a home\\-boat, so he does not have that much space. Therefore, he is selling one of his drum kits. As mentioned earlier, I have an electric drum kit, which are nice, but not exactly the same as acoustic ones. He is selling his for \u20ac470/$560, which is cheap, as drum sets can be expensive. I mentioned to him that I did not buy an acoustic kit yet due to I did not want to bother my neighbors that much, and due to I am not sure if future landlords would want me to play the drums. However, as mentioned in *The Richest Man in Babylon, \"To attract good luck to oneself, it is necessary to take advantage of opportunities\" &* \"*Men of action are favored by the Goddess of Good Luck\".* As I luckily have an emergency/buffer/opportunity fund, I decided to take the opportunity to buy his kit, because I would other keep postponing the purchase of an acoustic kit. As we are friends, and I was his student, he will sell the kit for for \u20ac400/$475 and he will deliver it tomorrow \\- neat!\n\nBut that was not all. As his mother\\-in\\-law will stay in the house he currently lives, which is a lovely place, he told me that she wants to rent out the basement \\(aka his drum studio\\). The room is as big as my whole apartment \\(including the kitchen and bathroom\\), will allow me to have a private bathroom and kitchen as well. The cost? Most likely \u20ac300/$355 a month, all\\-inclusive! Besides rent, I pay for insurance, media license \\(mandatory in Denmark\\), and internet. So if I would move to this apartment, my living costs would go down with 45&#37; while having a bigger place and not having to worry about playing the drums/music loudly, as the room is quite sound\\-proof, and the mother\\-in\\-low plays instruments as well, so she would not be bothered by it. \n\nI mentioned both deals to my dad, and he thinks I found two gems at once. My drum teacher will ask the mother\\-in\\-law if indeed the rent would cover all other expenses. Even if it does not, saving \u20ac135/$160 in rent a month will be huge on a yearly basis. I think I will take this offer. This shows how having an opportunity fund will allow you to take advantage of opportunities, and that having a nice network will give you access to some sweet deals.\n\nI am very happy, and it looks like chapter three in my live \\(chapter two was moving out from home to a foreign country\\) will be an exciting chapter!",

He does have family nearby, however, that could help.\n\nCurrently where we live now, we have one paycheck making a little over 1k a month, and get an extra 400 from someone renting out one of our rooms. We do own a few pets, but half of them belong to this tenant so she helps us with paying to take care of them. Bills and mortgage add up to 1k, so if we lose this tenant we're pretty fucked, but it's not looking like that will be in the near future. Our groceries can end up between $70 for two people plus 1 dog and 2 cats, to $150, depending on what we need to get for that pay period (2 weeks) and how much my husband needs to eat (hyperglycemia). Then gas is $70 at most. The rest of the money is either saved or used if something comes up (Which seems to happen alot). Current savings is at $100.\n\nNow the job situation where we're at now: I mentioned the car needs to be fixed up. It is able to drive 20-30 minutes before it starts burning. We know what we need to do to fix it, but because the way the set up around the engine is and neither of us are experienced enough to put everything back correctly nor know someone willing to fix it for us, we rather pay a mechanic. So until then, we're stuck looking for jobs in our town. Which is federal minimum wage or part time cashier/customer service work, and I can't afford to take anything less than what I'm already making. I've gotten offers for management paying 10k more yearly, but the closest one was 40 minutes away and I wouldn't be able to make it to the interviews. Husband has issues with his arm, last visit we made the doctor suspected the muscle atrophied but we couldn't do any further follow up visits due to gas costs getting out of hand. So he is limited in what he is able to do as well and job hunting has been rough for him. As I said, at the new house he does have family and could get some work from them.\n\nWe do plan on visiting the family he has near the new house before making any decisions, so we will have a chance to talk with the locals and get a feel for the area first. My question is, would it be smarter move than staying where we are at? We've tried cutting back and have tested the waters with a lot of different options, and we're pretty much in the best positition with financial spending as we could possibly be. I'm not getting rid of the pets as they help with my depression. The mortgage is pretty much what's doing it in for us, as we were doing great before we got the house. But rent in the area has gone up so much and even with our tenant moving with us and helping with rent we still would be paying roughly the same as with mortgage. I just feel like moving to a place we wouldn't have to pay for would be a smart choice at this point, but I may be thinking irrationally due to feeling trapped where I am now. Thoughts? \n\nEdit: Thank you for your advice and being kind! I realize now it seems like we would be jumping the gun, so we will hold off for a while.",

My credit score is absolutely tanked, but I've never had a credit card. I've defaulted on student loans (<20k i think) because I was essentially forced into taking them on by a well-meaning (but misguided) aunt when I was 20.

My boyfriend has a great credit score, and I no longer want to be a burden on him for rental approvals, etc, and frankly, I just want financial independence. My bf and I have been together for a year and a half, have lived together for about a year, and I am the happiest I've ever been. I still struggle with bouts of depression, but I feel more able to tackle reality than ever before. \n\nI've been working fairly hard at saving since getting a better job in February, and I currently have 2k in my savings and another 1700 in my checking. \n\nBut then this week my appendix decided to betray me, and I have no health insurance, and I am so, so fucked aren't I? \n\nWhat can I do? I haven't received a bill yet. I only stayed one night in the hospital, but I had a CT scan and laproscopic surgery.\n\nI'm trying not to freak out, but between the stress of this whirlwind emergency and trying to figure out my financial situation, I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown.\n\nI appreciate any and all thoughts, feelings, and sentiments.

        "original": "TL;DR Baby on the way, difficulty working due to disability, and then unexpected expenses come up.  Husband brings home half as much income as he used to, vehicle is about dead, have cut monthly expenses almost as much as I can think of.  Don\u2019t have any clue where to go from here.\n\nSide note before I start: We chose to have a baby despite this and are only having one.  I didn't dream about my wedding day - we eloped - I dreamed about having a baby.  The pregnancy has made my body worse but it's worth sacrifice to have the one thing I've always wanted.  One of the conditions is slowly degenerative so it was going to happen anyways.\n\nProblem 1: Illness. I have a chronic illness and we knew I might end up on disability in a few years.    It's not going to kill me, it's just a lot of pain, limits my mobility and causes severe fatigue.  For example, I have to use a wheelchair for more than 1/4 mile walking.  In the past 2 years, my health has declined more than expected.  \n\nProblem 2: My ability to work.  I have been working full time but had to leave my previous two jobs because I couldn't physically do them anymore.  With my current job I have an ADA accommodation to work from home two days per week and I do a good job so they never question what I do.  But\u2026those home days I rest a lot and it's the only way I have been able to keep working this long but even that\u2019s not really helping anymore.  \n\nProblem 3: My current job.  My current job has been trying to get rid of me for the past two years since they found out about my disability three months into the job.  They have implied several times that my position won't be there much longer because they want to turn it into a different position (that I can\u2019t do) but have also implied it will still be there and I would be able to do it part time and work from home (will I still capable of working?).\n\nProblem 4: Husband\u2019s job.  Husband\u2019s company went out of business and he had to take a new job that pays less.  He currently brings home HALF of what he did when we got married.  He hates it there and has been looking for work but there\u2019s not been anything available.  \n\nProblem 5: Truck is breaking down.  We had unexpected problems with our house and now his truck is about to go out.  We\u2019ve put about $1,000 into in the past 2 months and the transmission is on its way out.  At the point I figure it's probably a wash and needs replaced because it will be more expensive to repair than replace.  Plus, with baby on the way, a safer vehicle would be ideal.  \n\nCurrent expenses are house, utilities, internet, cell phone, insurance, Netflix (no cable), student loan ($300/month), SUV ($400/month) and 1 credit card ($75/month, been paying $150).  We are considering all options, including trading the SUV (2016 Honda CRV) for something cheaper.  I worry about reliability and safety due to local traffic.  So what do you recommend?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the advice everyone. It made me sad but it helped. A few things to mention: We just bought the house and they didn\u2019t make it ADA like they were supposed to so I am unable to access a couple parts of my house (like one of the bathrooms) on a bad day. A long time ago we have cut almost everything we possibly can, including TV, phones, etc. hence the stress. After I am forced to quit working, we will be able to survive with one vehicle even though husband doesn\u2019t want to in case of emergency. His job tanked because he\u2019s in the oil field. His first company went out of business, the current one pays $8 per hour less, much less overtime and he hasn\u2019t been able to find a new position. \n\nLastly and bittersweet, I put our information through benefits.gov and when I can\u2019t work anymore, we do qualify for government assistance. This is depressing but reassuring because it means I can quit killing my body (literally) by trying to keep working and we\u2019ll be okay. \n\nThanks everyone. It\u2019s hard to accept I\u2019ve reached my physical limit but knowing it\u2019s not the end of the world and that we qualify for help makes a world of difference. ",

This is a little long so sorry in advance.\n\nSo I was homeless for a long time, like 5+ years due to mental illness. Money was a constant source of worry - when I had it, I slept in hostels & ate basic food. When I didn't, I... did neither of those things. Usually I didn't.\n\nThanks to some special people, hard work and an incredible amount of luck, I'm now in an OK position. My mental issues have all but disappeared bar the occasional moderate depressive episode, and I make 33% more than the average wage in my small city. For the first time in my entire life, things are going OK.\n\nI don't say this to brag, just to offer context. I've gone from nothing to comfortable in a really short time, and it's left me with issues.\n\n* Spending more than the bare, bare minimum on living expenses gives me incredible anxiety.\n\nAnd I mean the bare minimum. Until about a month ago I was living long term in a traveler's hostel, sharing a bedroom with fifteen other guys since it is literally the cheapest sleeping option in the city. The only reason I sprang for a single room in a houseshare is because my girlfriend confided in me that she was really uncomfortable with me living like that.\n\nThe same goes for food - I still get the urge to 'save money' by going food banks/kitchens & Sikh gurdwaras. I know every hobo trick there is to get free food, drinks and services in the city, learned through years of necessity. I've weaned myself off of charities because it was pointed out to me how scummy it is for me to take from them when I don't need it, but it's difficult to break that habit.\n\n* I find it very difficult to spend money on myself.\n\nI don't really go out, or do anything interesting. If it wasn't for my girlfriend dragging me out of the house, I wouldn't do anything more interesting than playing video games, online chess & watching TV. She's bullied me into spending money on some trips here and there - I never regret these when I'm there, but spending the money is terrifying.\n\nThat's the case with both these points - I don't think that living like a homeless guy is the best decision for me or for my mental health, but I'm just so terrified of losing all my money that parting with it is incredibly stressful. I don't know how to explain it.\n\n* I am absolutely terrified of losing my job.\n\nLogically, I know my job is fine - I work in a really niche IT sector, it's skilled work, I'm not easily replaceable and I'm quite good at it. But I also know that it's my saving grace, and the money is the only thing that's keeping me from going back to where I was. I get incredible anxiety around feeling that I'm not working hard enough, or achieving enough. This anxiety stunts my productivity, which in turn worsens the anxiety. I've been reliably informed that I'd have to do something pretty terrible to be fired at this point, but even so.\n\nThere's that old saying - 'wherever you go, there you are'. I feel exactly the same as I did when I was on the streets, except now I've been given something very valuable that I can very easily lose.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what I can do to get myself out of this headspace?

        "original": "Hi, poverty finance. I think this will be a long one. It would mean so much to me for anyone who can manage to read through and give me some encouragement. \n\n\nI want to say beforehand, I am not making excuses. I *know* some of these things are my fault, my own doing. I can't go back in a time machine and change my bad decisions. I'm only providing information so I can get the best advice with context. \n\n\nI've been in poverty my entire life. I don't know any other way. \n\n\nMy parents come from nothing. My father speaks two languages, but he is completely illiterate in both. He dropped out of school in 2nd grade - I find him very naturally intelligent but he is an extreme pushover with zero self-confidence. My mother dropped out of school in 9th grade, spent some time in white power gangs, lived on the streets during most of her teen years, etc. Both of my parents were severely abused and neglected as children. My parents have always worked back-breaking, hard labor, graveyard shift jobs making peanuts. They never ask for raises or promotion because they are \"desperate\" and don't want to risk making bosses mad and losing their jobs.  At one point, they were 7 of us + 2 dogs living in a 500 sq ft 1bd 1bth home. I only wore hand-me-downs from my 10-years-older than me sister. My parents ironically feel proud being poor - I think they see it as an identifier, part of who they are as people. I sometimes try to give them advice or point out opportunities for them to succeed, only to see my mother inexplicably brush things aside in favor of more bad decisions. \n\n\nI wasn't taught how to drive and I never took my SATs/ACTs. My high schooling was an absolute joke. I taught myself everything by reading books in my spare time. I did attend college but ended up dropping out because I was so behind in math and science, I would need to take multiple math and science courses that would not be covered by FAFSA. I've spent my adult life so far working minimum-wage retail jobs, customer service jobs, and even helping my parents at their workplace.  \n\n\n5 years ago, in my early 20s, I started dating my older, divorced boss. I quit my retail job so we could officially be together. He comes froman upper middle class family. Last year, we both lost our jobs. He decided to go back to school, while I struggled to find another job after needing emergency surgery with a long recovery time (3+ months), and I am still unemployed (but looking). It's also hard because I don't drive (and I don't think I ever will....I'm too terrified of it now, as much as people berate me on a nearly daily basis for not learning). He has since found a new job but one that pays much less than his previous job.\n\n\nWe cannot afford our current lifestyle and he has no desire to change anything. I had lined up to move into my parents' basement - rent free - if he agreed. He did agree. This would have been great for both of us. I would be able to move to an area with more options for jobs and he would be able to save nearly all his money. Two months away from moving date, he tells me, \"We are staying here.\" He renewed the lease without my knowledge, with his parents paying most of our rent. I felt betrayed that he didn't even discuss this with me...and that I was stuck looking for a job here. I've talked about looking for a job in another city close by, moving there myself. He \"refuses\" the idea. \n\n\nThere have been many other problems in our relationship too but we've always promised we would work through whatever it is, we wouldn't just give up. But it's starting to be too much for me to bear. Tonight, he admitted to me that he does not respect me at all, he doesn't understand why I struggle to find a job, why I can't make more money at the jobs I've had in the past, he dangles marriage above my head until I get a respectable job making respectable money. \n\n\nI feel so, so trapped. \n\n\nI feel I am done with this relationship. I want to be on my own and I want to succeed on my own. I want to be successful by doing what I need to do. I'm never going to be successful by someone who is constantly putting limits on where I can work, when I can work, where I can work...and then expect me to miraculously make tons of money. Least of all, I can't be with someone who does not respect me. \n\n\nAll of this to say.....what the hell am I suppose to do now? I have no other family than my parents and I cannot move in with them (they are already supporting one of my nephews who is still in high school). I have no job, no savings, nothing. I could probably ask my parents for a loan and find a shady place to move into. But I honestly don't know where to go from there. Can I really make it on my own? I've never lived on my own before. And I honestly want to just get away from this area. I hate this entire place. All it has is bad and painful memories for me. Most of my loved ones have died, I have dealt with stalkers in the past....maybe it's just the heat of the moment, but I just want to run as far away as possible. \n\n\nBut realistically, what can I do? I may be homeless without any employment at the end of this month. I'm scared. I've never been on my own before and I've never had to completely take care of myself. ",

Furthermore, the only way to get to class is a bike ride to a train station, then a 45 minute train, and then another bike ride or uber ride. Also the city they are moving to is very dangerous crime-wise in the area between the train station and the university, so I don't feel safe biking and would probably need to uber to class 3 days a week. Finally, my classes are from 6:30-9pm so it's a fairly dangerous time for me to be out. \n\nI have been looking for apartments nearby for weeks and have been completely let down by realtors and friends alike, watching my options vanish between my fingers. My only remaining options are in areas of fairly high crime and poverty in which I genuinely fear for my living conditions. I don't have any useful friends remaining, my parents can't help me out more financially, I don't think I can take out another loan, and I don't have time to work because of the multiple projects I have to complete during the summer for my degree. Also the prospect of roommates terrifies me due to previous negative experiences.\n\n\nAs far as the facts go I was in a hurry to rent an apartment and told my current airbnb host that I would be out by June 3, since, otherwise, I would owe her the entire month. To seal the deal, I had an \"ok\" place lined up and it was given away because the owner forgot she wanted to let me rent it out. I am now facing being possibly homeless while still trying to go to school, complete projects, and line up a new apartment where I can feel safe, while also juggling an internship I will be starting soon (in order to complete another department related requirement). \n\nAlso the federal loan I got last year is running out so if I don't get a place quick and stay here 1 more month I will not have enough money for the deposit on a new place and I will be technically \"stuck\" in an unmovable position.\n\nIs there anything that I am missing? I feel as though the school is treating me unfairly since I planned out my life in this area and now am in a very difficult situation due to them moving to such a difficult area. Lastly, I wanted to point out I have been searching for apartments since 3 weeks ago when the university move was made final and was announced to me formally.\n\nIs there anything I can do that I am not aware of and will not put me in an overly uncomfortable situation? Is there any advice someone here can offer me?  I already barely eat food and I walk to class. I have thought about donating blood or selling my belongings, but even that won't get me a home. Anyway, sorry for the rambling, but I have few places left to turn to...\n\nBest-\n\n",

Then I had to drop to part time when DS was 6 months. Next was a job for me that was pitched as full time, but ended up being barely part time at a huge pay cut. After some of that there was a few solid mental break downs and me not working or working very part time for about 6 months. DH took some FMLA to help me out, but that got denied so he lost that job. I started working full time, but lost that job and its amazing benefits because of anxiety fueled attendance issues. Luckily I found a great job with a big pay RAISE within 1 month. Then DH lost his job for bullsh*t work drama at the same time I started my new job, and he couldn't find work for approximately 3 months. \n\nNow we're both working, so my parents gave us the money we needed to move out on April 1st. (Not because they were happy we could afford our own place, but because they dislike DH very much) We still weren't/ aren't totally ready, still have high balances on 3+ year old credit cards, barely even out of collections on some bills, and unfamiliar with how to budget with our new incomes. \n\nSo now we have a credit card with a $2,000 max at a balance of at least $2,500. Another credit card with a max of 900 and a balance of at least $1,100. $1,000+ medical debit we have already gotten reduced due to income. We're also like 500 behind on health insurance now. Most of these debits are in collections now or will be shortly.\n\nThe other things that are f*cking us is how we have been putting off buying things we need because of lack of money. Now we have several $100+ things we need ASAP, like a new car seat due to the old one being expired, clothes that fit us because we've so stressed we lost weight, and an oil change for one of the cars since its been like 6 months since the last. Also we have several \"non essentials\" on our budget that DH refuses to let go of, including cable, weed, vaping, and eating out. \n\nI feel defeated and confused. It seems like I always forget to put something in the budget, usually the important stuff we're behind on or needs we've been avoiding. \n\nMy question is where do we start? I have some concept of Dave Ramsy's material, but it still doesn't make much sense to me. Do I start with credit cards or back bills or some of our big needs? Do I take a shotgun approach and throw a little at each? How do we get back on track?\n\nThank y'all in advance for the advice. ",

He was supposed to start work immediately but it got pushed back a few weeks, meaning he didn\u2019t get a pay check for almost 5 weeks after we arrived. His saved money literally lasted one and a half weeks. The extra money I had went towards rent, food and bills. \n\nMy boyfriend got extremely depressed because of the way we have to live, e.g eating cheap meals like pasta and rice, sleeping on two single bed mattresses pushed together (both were given to us, as we couldn\u2019t afford to buy a bed) not having a TV or wifi. He doesn\u2019t eat leftovers so cooking up a huge cheap meal to eat all week is out of the question. He also eats like twice as much as I do so meals for the both us are bloody expensive. I\u2019m THOUSANDS in debt and want to pay it all back as soon as possible, but it feels impossible. I don\u2019t mind eating frugally for however long I need to in order to get back on my feet, but my partner refuses to eat \u201cstudent food\u201d as though he\u2019s too good for it. I also am in no rush to furnish our apartment or to upgrade the furniture that was given to us for free from my family. Without these things, my partner gets upset that he\u2019s living like a student again. It\u2019s like he refuses to believe that we\u2019re broke. The worst things are that he barely saved any money before moving so it\u2019s his fault that we have to live like this because the money I saved went towards covering his share of the rent, that his family didn\u2019t have money when he was growing up so this method of thinking just came out of nowhere and he just spend his money on crap like junk food and the convenience store. He never buys himself new clothes or anything his money just disappears. He\u2019s also gotten annoyed at me penny pinching before because \u201cits not healthy to restrict yourself.\u201d It\u2019s just so hard to try and live frugally in order to better my life when the (equally poor) person by your side is shitting on your money saving methods and disagreeing with everything you do. We both work entry level jobs so it\u2019s not as if we were rich before before we moved. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019m in the hole and it\u2019s gonna be hard to claw myself out of it. I can\u2019t afford to pay $100 to get wifi connected, or to pay half for a new TV or a couch. I can\u2019t afford to eat meat every day of the week. Hell I even quit smoking before our finances got this bad because I had a feeling this shit would happen. How am I supposed to cut back further on shared expenses when my partner refuses to?

If you were still hungry after that, my mom would break out the Top Ramen packs. I didn't try most of the vegetables I love now until I was an adult. You bet I'm overweight because my entire diet consisted of awkward fasting and carbs. \n\nWe lived in a 2 bedroom apartment, all the kids in one room.

I have 1 credit card left to pay off. It's down to $1000 and I'm honestly in shock. I'm so close, and there's this part of me that's kind of afraid to feel what it feels like to not be in debt.

Chat with me about growing up poor in foster care, personal finance for lawyers, my personal battle against \"poverty mentality\", how an financial idiot has changed her ways and any other personal finance topics which I am qualified to discuss. Background information is below \\- otherwise, ask away.\n\n**Foster Care:** I'm from a flyover state where I grew up in foster care from three until I \"aged out\" of the system at 18. I lived in a lot of homes during my time in care and occasionally returned to my parents.\n\n**College:** Most of my homes received government benefits \\(as well as a stipend for keeping me\\). Very few of these families were good with money \\- so I was starting from scratch when I turned 18. Having no idea what to do, I followed the lead of my peers and applied to and attended a private four year college.\n\n**First Job:** After graduation, I got a job in D.C. that paid \\~$30,000 a year. I had to watch my spending pretty carefully, but overall felt that I had ***made it***. My biological family members saw me doing well and regularly hit me up for money and I let them because I didn't have a backbone at that time.  Still, I managed to make some progress on paying down my loans \\(thanks to a payment matching program at my job\\) and paid off $10,000 of my loans over three years.\n\n**Law School:** I had no room to grow in my then\\-current job, so I went to law school at the suggestion of my boss. Despite a significant scholarship, I ended up with some pretty serious student loans \\(due to cost of living, bar exam expenses and accrued interest \\(@an 8.5&#37; interest rate\\)\\) when I graduated in 2013.\n\n**Bad with Money:** I did well in law school and landed a good paying job after graduation \\(Big Law\\) \\- but didn't know anything about money and so I sort of wasted my good fortune for the first two years. I was paying my loan minimums and saving on the bare minimum. I also encountered some financial stress from my biological family's constant request for handouts. I hated working 80\\-100 hour weeks \\(and not being able to ever make plans\\) and so started looking for ways to leave the firm life, which I knew meant I would take a substantial pay cut.\n\n**Better with Money:** I started reading Mr. Money Mustache and other financial blogs and books in 2015 which inspired me to do better. I paid off my student loans this year and now I am working to pay down my other lower interest debt.  I left my firm job last year which required a pretty substantial pay cut, but I am still definitively middle class. I am finishing up my foster parent classes and preparing to rock parenting as a single mom. AMA.\n\n**TLDR: Grew up in foster care, went to college with loans \\(sigh\\), took a low paying job and left when I couldn't advance. Went to law school with loans \\(sigh\\), graduated and got a great job.

I'm 27. I'm currently a Geospatial Analyst for a goverment contractor. I used to like the job but  staring at a computer screen 24/7 and almost zero conversations that happen are starting to eat away at me.\n\n I make $43,000 a year. I have a $40,000 student loan, plus two more smaller student loans that are $5,000 each. I have a car loan that I pay $250 a month and only have about $6,000 left. Then I have rent and utilities which is about $700 a month. Overall I'm able to save close to $650 a month. \n\nI am wanting to get out of my current career and get into something where I can either help people or atleast have human contact throughout the day. I'm personable and I feel not talking to anyone all day is killing me. I have some sales experience along with automotive experience. I'm not trying to be a car salesman because that just doesn't feel right for me. \n\nSo my question. Is it stupid for me to potentially change careers from what I have now to something that pays about the same but is in a different field? The issue with my current field is that once you get out, usually to get back in you have to start fresh. Pay included. I don't want to be jumping around jobs but I'm kinda getting frustrated that at 27, I'm not doing something remotely that I enjoy. I don't want to let my emotions get in the way but it's just hard. The only other factor that I should consider is my girlfriend. We've lived together for 3.5 years nowand we're committed to each other. She has a stable job and only debt she has is a car loan which is relatively similar to mind but she still owes about $14,000. She has a pretty good savings account and I have an ok one. Most of my money has gone to cutting down my loans as quickly as possible. \n\nI know I'm not in as bad of a situation as a lot of others but I feel the advice would be best suited coming from this sub.

I've recently completely changed my eating habits to a low-carb diet. Nothing as crazy as keto, but with my PCOS, I've found it's the only diet that works for me to lose weight and manage my symptoms.\n\nUnfortunately, it's also doubled my grocery bill.\n\nI meal prep, shop sales, and cut costs anywhere and everywhere I can, but it's still tough to eat healthy on a shoestring budget. Carbs are cheap, and protein sources are freaking expensive.\n\nI clear between $1600-$2,200 a month before taxes in self-employed income. You can imagine how much ends up going to taxes. More than half goes to rent (thx California) and most of the rest goes to bills (auto insurance, utilities, internet, student loans). I've also got a fair amount on a new credit card (from recent moving expenses and car repairs) that I'm trying to pay down before the interest kicks in in November, and realized I couldn't do that and continue my diet at the same time.\n\nSo, I bit the bullet and applied for CalFresh. ~~Waiting on the case to process atm.~~ I got denied, but I'm going to try again in one of my slower months.\n\nIt took a lot to swallow my pride and admit that I was living beyond my means, even though I felt like I was being as frugal as humanly possible. I cook at home, don't drink or smoke, don't go to bars/clubs, and shop at thrift stores for my clothes. I can still barely save anything by the end of the month.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is this: there's no shame in asking for help to eat healthy. There's a reason it's called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It's tough to get the nutrition you need if you can barely afford food in the first place. Plus, by eating healthy, you can save on medical expenses down the line--barring chronic/genetic illness.\n\nTL;DR: If the government is taking 30% of my income, it may as well feed me.\n\nEdit: Wow, holy shit this blew up.

I wasn't quite sure if following advice from other posts would be the smartest decision given that everyone has unique circumstances. This post is a cross post from r/personalfinance since I didn't get many replies there. With that short apology out of the way, here's some core info regarding me and my state of living.\n\nI am 22 years old, living in Eastern Canada, in the Greater Toronto Area, with my parents and little sister. Due to severe anxiety and depression I am currently staying at home and seeking therapy and other medical support to aid my health. I aim to return to college in September, for which I have applied for financial assistance. Due to my disability, my current student loans (318 CAD/mo) is being paid by the student loan body. Therefore, I am making 0 CAD and in two years will have to start paying my debts again at 320+ CAD.\n\nMy relationship with my family is incredibly strained, which is a core factor for my mental health issues. I hope to one day get out of the house and start living alone. The issue lies in being unable to work full time at this moment, let alone successfully find a job. I quit my job at McDonalds earlier this year and have been searching for employment ever since.\n\nI am down to barely triple digit savings, and am currently trying to look for employment through government and not for profit agencies, but the official pipeline is slow and tedious, perfect factors to amplify my anxiety and panic attacks. I do have 25$/mo savings that I invest into, in a tax free savings account. My mother has offered to help me continue adding to the savings. I have 300 saved up there so far. \n\nWhat steps can I take to try and leave my parents' home and ensure my survival with low income? The cost of living in our city is very high, and due to political issues, employers are more hesitant to hire people than ever. My money sense is very poor. I'm pretty stuck as of now. Any and all help and advice would be greatly appreciated.",

I\u2019ve been with this company for about 4 years now\n\nI live with my girlfriend and her family (we have the finished basement to ourselves and they\u2019re Asian so it\u2019s not weird)\n\nI had a lot of CC debt from when I was younger (20-22). Around 20k that I knocked down to 14.5k after 4 years. 3 months ago I consolidated all except 2 of my cards (the ones paid off I kept and don\u2019t use except for gas)\n\nThis month I made the decision to let the consolidated amount go to collections and see what happens. I was paying $450 a month at around 10.5%. I literally can\u2019t afford to pay anyways\n\nIn December I got a new car from Carmax. I was offered it with 0 down at 18.99% interest. I thought the high interest was okay because in a few months I could refinance at a better rate no sweat. The consolidation hurt my credit by 60 points and I\u2019m unable to refinance the loan still\n\nI\u2019m using T-Mobile with 4 lines. I switched from sprint to save $115/mo. 3 lines was the same price as 4 monthly so I use one line as a GPS in the car. My girlfriend and I each have a line, and the last line I use 24/7 as an internet hotspot for work. There are no other internet options in my area, and with TMobile One International there\u2019s no speed or data cap. I use about 100GB a day sometimes and it\u2019s all at 4G LTE speed\n\nSo now, here I am with this every month :\n\nRent : 300\n\nCar : 538\n\nCar insurance : 138\n\nPhones : 200\n\nWork costs : 50\n\nTotal: ~1226\n\nI make around 1300 after taxes. Plus food and gas and I\u2019m not getting very far\n\nI am aware of MintSim and how much that could save us, but I need a source of internet and having $125 for the TMobile line plus $40 for our lines isn\u2019t far behind keeping with TMobile on all lines and avoiding the ETFs\n\nI have considered buying a cheaper car and letting our current car get repo\u2019d just to save the $600/mo. But to have a reliable-ish car would cost 3-4K and that would take over 6 months to \u201cbreak even\u201d. Still would be worth it?\n\nI started my own LLC with a goal to get game contracts and outsource the work to people in third world countries. So far it\u2019s going great, I have 3 separate contracts for 5,000 each. But I won\u2019t get paid until they\u2019re finished. \n\nCombine that with my telecommute day-job, and I have no time for a second job delivering pizzas or ride share. \n\nMy credit score is 550 right now. I called Lexington Law 2 days ago to see what they can do, because credit karma shows 1 late payment, 58% CC usage, and NOTHING else negative. LL found 22 negative marks, including a ton of late payments and they\u2019re working on removing them now at $130/mo (I\u2019ll cancel before the next charge hits)\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do to get out of my situation I\u2019m in. I have around 7000 in crypto (I used to mine) and 500-700ish in savings\n\nHelp. ",

I\u2019m on the brink of going insane, running away, or committing suicide. I just can\u2019t do this anymore...\n\nBackground:\nI\u2019m (27/f) college graduate with an honors degree from an amazing university. Did amazing in high school & college. Your typical girl next door on the path to greater things raised in a lower middle class working family. There have been few times in my life I\u2019ve ever wanted for something, until the last few years. I\u2019m saying this so you have a perspective on what comes next can literally happen to anyone. \n\nI met my fianc\u00e9 (28/m) when I was 18, the summer out of high school.  He has always been poor. Grew up in the hills with his dad in/out of jail and his parents on&off drugs his whole life. So he had a low chance of breaking part of that cycle. He\u2019s one of the most caring, thoughtful, real & intelligent people I\u2019ve ever met and we instantly fell in love. He had a history of drug use but the first 6 years of our relationship was only smoking marijuana with other recreational drug use here and there. We\u2019ve been through hell & back and now all I want is for us to get through this. Right now is the worst we\u2019ve ever been. \n\nThe last two years we\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes. I graduated college and we moved out to finally live together with some roommates.  We live in one of the #1 cities for opiates. One thing led to another (both of us having injuries and pain medicine rarely being prescribed thanks to new laws) and now we\u2019ve both been hooked for the last two years. \n\nWhat has this caused? \n- One credit card for 1000 \n- One loan that I defaulted on. After one missed payment they took the full amount from my bank account which is now -1500\n- I lost my job a few months ago due to mental health problems/anxiety & tardiness. It paid $1000 a paycheck and was an amazing job. Now I\u2019m waitressing at the restaurant my fianc\u00e9 works at so I can be paid in daily tips...  (of course I had finally went to a therapist for my issues on a Friday, and work knew about this. They decided to fire me the following Tuesday... so I lost my insurance covering my therapist that was going to help me with all of this). \n- A second loan that I was making bi-weekly payments on that I no longer can because I lost my job. I owe at least $1800 to them if not more. \n- A $300 a month car payment. I missed last month and my payment for this month was yesterday. I told myself once I was caught up I\u2019d trade it in for something cheaper but I can\u2019t even do that right now. I don\u2019t want my car taken away. \n- At least $1000 if not more in vet fees so my cat wouldn\u2019t die a few years ago that I stopped paying. I think this might be in collections. \n- Another bank account that is -600 and a third bank account -500 (these were accidents and not intentional)\n\nI\u2019m getting a ton of phone calls every single day from numbers I don\u2019t know. I know it\u2019s people calling to collect money from me on all these loans and negative bank accounts. I absolutely don\u2019t have the money right now. Everything we make goes towards us surviving and not being sick. We can\u2019t go into any sort of rehab because we don\u2019t want our families or roommates to know. Thank god our current roommate is practically family & rich and has been ok with us not paying rent but they\u2019ve started asking lately. \n\nI\u2019ve no clue what to do. I know I need to answer these calls to figure something out but I don\u2019t even know where to start. I need a better job but I don\u2019t want to start another job again unless I\u2019m clean, which is a feat in itself. I\u2019m going insane and just can\u2019t do it anymore....\n\nIs bankruptcy an option? Or not worth it? \n\nAnyone have tips on where to start? (Obviously, getting clean, I know this. But that\u2019s obviously harder than it sounds.. please no negative comments). \n\nThank you...",

I was really excited and turned down a few things because they had promised me full time work from May until sept at about \u00a38.78 ph...\n\nHowever, the communication was awful, not telling anyone where they needed to be etc or basic info for the job and and after a number of teething problems when I did finally get to work, in four days of being away, I only \u201cworked\u201d just shy of 20 hours paying for my own travel, fuel, food etc. \n\nI haven\u2019t got any more work for the rest of the month apart from one tiny festival for another four days...

This overdraft has to be paid off by the end of the month otherwise it goes from 0% interest into a standard charge for using that much. I can\u2019t pay any of it off. I have no savings, no stash, nothing to sell, nothing to help with this... I thought my new job would be enough.\n\nBasically, I\u2019m better off killing myself (and really close to doing so tbh, I have a tonne of pills in front of me and honestly the only thing that\u2019s a comfort to me is that I fucked up my life but at least I can control my death). I can\u2019t afford my psych meds anymore even if I borrowed \u00a38.80 from someone because it would just be more into the debt pool that is my account.

It's 18 months and I'm 6 months in. I have a big scary exam on monday but all I can do at the moment is try not to cry because:\n\n1. My social security payment (centrelink) dropped from $450 a fortnight to $250 a fortnight.\n2. My part time job went from fortnight to monthly payments. \n\nI'm just scraping by. I moved in with my partner so now Centrelink thinks we can produce money out of thin air and has cut both our payments. Mine is a Job Seeker payment because they refuse to treat me as a full time student since I'm a post-graduate student. Problem is I can't use my bachelor degree to get a job because I have no research or lab skills and I'm in a science, lab heavy, field. This means on top of reducing my payment any time I make more than $100 a fortnight, they force me to apply to jobs I cannot meet time requirements for, go to monthly meetings to report my progress and now take a three week class on \"job skills\" covering very basic tasks like using a phone, a computer, how to interact with co-workers etc. I honestly think if I put that half cert on my resume it would make me look worse when applying for jobs. There are no alternatives and if I don't do it they cut me off. \n\nI have a lot of debt (~$10k) to my parents due to my old car being smashed in a car accident and needing a replacement for my job (although the main job I had then fired me over it) and my cat getting sick and needing a life saving operation. My emergency fund of $5k was used last year to buy the car and deal with rent issues. I've never been able to build it back. \n\nI'm so sick of worrying how I'm going to get out of this hole. I'm in the process of applying for a graduate position but that doesn't start until July next year. I hate that I keep asking my parents for help and combined my partner and I owe a lot of family money. All I'm asking is to be supported enough to pay rent and food from Centrelink for 12 more months then plan on paying taxes like a good citizen for the rest of my life. They don't see it that way. \n\nSorry this got super long, it's just been hitting breaking point for me. I will edit more information in with income, expenditures etc if it will help anyone advise us. Thank you for reading this. ",

This week was the first 20 and since I got 200 from family from graduating I pull 100 from that for savings too. I\u2019ve always tried to save back money but things always came up before I could save anything substantial.

She does not leave the house. Her mother is her caretaker (for lack of a better word) and  her mother has some of her own issues with her physical and mental health. Her mother has given up, and can no longer take care of Friend. The two of them have a sort of messed up relationship and her mother does not want to help Friend in any way.

She lives in California in an area that is very expensive. I live in an even more expensive area, and am tied to where I\u2019m at, so I am not able to step in as a caregiver.  \n\nShe does not know how to drive. She has a pet cat that she is extremely attached to and needs for mental support. She has no credit. She had a job when she was very young (17/18) but has not worked since. She has no one she is close to or knows except myself.  She does not have any idea how to take care of herself and has so many fears about leaving her home. She has recently started going to therapy weekly. However, she\u2019s been like this so long, change is not going to happen rapidly. \n\nI need to help get her in a place to live. She would like to live alone, she is too scared to live in a roommate situation. She would like to be somewhere in northern CA (so she is close to myself, or my mother). I don\u2019t know that this will work. I told her I will make phone calls, drive places, stand in lines with her, hold her hand in any way she needs. But, I really don\u2019t know how to help her with no credit, such low income and no help from her mother and all of this needs to be accomplished by September 1st. \n\nIf anyone has advice please, please help. I\u2019m so worried about my friend. I\u2019ve known her since 2nd grade and I\u2019m concerned she might take her life from the current stress she\u2019s under. \n\nTL;DR\n\nAgoraphobic, no car, have $1200 a month, no credit, no extra help, in northern CA and need a place/ way to live on that amount of money by Sept 1st.",

        "original": "Hello r/povertyfinance. I wanted to break down my budget for you all to see if there is anything that will assist you all in your budgeting, or possibly any plotholes in mine that I have missed! I recently posted a comment here about my budget that gained some attention and I assume that more of you may find it beneficial. \n\nFor starters, I am a late 20's male in the southeast US. The cost of living here is substantially less than other parts of the country. I also do electrical work for $14 an hour. It is very labor intensive and not for everyone. There is also a good amount of overtime. I get paid weekly, and my checks are usually about $520\\-$540 after tax. \n\nMonthly Income: $2160 \\+/\\-\n\nI follow the 50/30/20 plan:\n\n|&#37; of income:|Reserved for:|Allotted:|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|50&#37;|Life Neccesities|$1080|\n|30&#37;|Novelties |$648|\n|20&#37;|Savings/Debt|$432|\n\nLet's break this down some more. I go a little overboard for my main living costs, but I make up for it elsewhere.\n\n**50\\% of Income: $1080**\n\nLife necessities are things that you cannot live without. This includes travel costs (Whether you drive, Uber/Taxi, Bus, train etc.), Housing, Food, etc. I bought a house last year because a 1,600 sq ft. house was cheaper than a 350 sq. ft. studio apartment in town, by about $300 a month. Plus I don't have to move every year. It does not come without it's problems though, but I will not go into that here. \n\n|Bill/Requirement:|Cost:|\n|:-|:-|\n|Mortgage|$780|\n|Food|$120|\n|Transportation|$180|\n|Trash|$12|\n|Electricity (Average)|$90|\n|Water|$18|\n|**Total:**|**$1,199**|\n|**Over/Under Budget:**|**\\-$120**|\n\n30**\\% of Income: $648**\n\nNovelties are things that you **CAN** live without. This includes car ownership (since one has the ability to Uber/Taxi, Bus, train etc.), cell phone, internet, etc. I drive a car from the 90's and I have maintained it and done all of my own work on it for 10 years now. It still runs like brand new. The other day I had an issue and texted my boss saying I was going to be late. Using nothing more than a $50 toolkit that I keep in the car, and a YouTube video, I was only 3 minutes late. There is no reason one cannot work on a vehicle these days. I also have a perfectly clean driving record. I do not go out to bars, and I a cheap bastard. I like video games and collect movies, but I wait until I can find them at thrift stores and yard sales for $5 or less. \n\n|Bill:|Cost:|\n|:-|:-|\n|Phone|$80|\n|Internet|$45|\n|Subscriptions (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.)|$20|\n|Car Insurance|$34|\n|Cable|$0|\n|Trips|$0|\n|Friends|$20|\n|Clothes|$0|\n|**Total:**|**$199**|\n|**Over/Under Budget:**|**\\+$449**|\n\n20**\\% of Income: $432**\n\nSavings and Debt payments are important as well, with Debt coming first. The only debt I have is my mortgage, but I do not file it here. I did not attend college, and I do not have a car loan. I only use my credit card for gas and food and only buy things when I have the money already available to immediately pay off the card. \n\n|Bill:|Cost:|\n|:-|:-|\n|Savings|$300|\n|Debt Payments|$0|\n|IRA|$100|\n|Investments|$100|\n|Rainy Day Fund|$125|\n|**Total:**|**$600**|\n|**Over/Under Budget:**|**\\-$168**|\n\nOverall, I am $161 under budget each month. This money usually ends up in savings as well. As I am currently still in the 90 day probationary period with my employer, I do not have health coverage. Once I do, this $161 will go toward it and I will make adjustments as needed. \n\nNow many of you will point out the \"Food\" column in the first section, and how I spend $30 per week at the grocery store. I want to break down how I do this now. First things fist, I do **NOT** have a sweet tooth. I also follow a very lean diet as well. I typically focus on a diet filled with:\n\n* Rice\n* Steamed Vegetables\n* Chicken Breast\n* Beans\n* Frozen Pizza (Occasionally)\n* Ground Turkey\n* Sandwiches/Wraps\n* Salads\n* Water\n* Gatorade/Lemonade (Using the Powder Mix)\n\nThe novelty items will cost you more and should not fall under your normal food expenses. These items should fall into the 30&#37; section of your budget. Slowcookers are your best friend when budgeting. One of my favorite dishes is as follows:\n\n1. Put 4 chicken breasts ($5\\-$7) in the crock pot with a large jar of salsa or BBQ sauce ($1\\-$2). \n2. Cook on high for 3.5 hours. \n3. Add in a bag of frozen vegetables ($1\\-$2)\n4. Continue to cook for another half hour\n5. Shred the chicken and mix\n\nThis meal will feed one person lunch/dinner, for an entire week, for only $7\\-$11. A Double Qtr. Pounder combo at McD can cost you that. You can eat it in a bowl, over rice, in a wrap, sandwich, etc. \n\nYou also **NEEEEEEDDDDDDDDD** to pay attention to the \"price per unit of measurement\". Just today I was looking at Lemonade mix. I don't think I need to tell you which one I purchased.....\n\n|Product|Cost|Cost Per.

First off, I use an Android app called \"Financisto\". it allows for one to keep track of their accounts by MANUALLY entering transactions and transfers. Gone are the days when you check your Bank app, see a healthy amount, use your debit card, and then overdraft all because of a pending transaction not showing up yet. There is an iOS alternative called 'Balance\" that I used to use as well. \n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JynVvkZO1uVsP86Xz_pE_cr7kQAI3k1kXysEtufhWZU/edit#gid=905971680) is a link to a Google Spreadsheet I made some time ago. I am giving it to you for free in hopes that it will help you. Simply key in your Monthly income at the bottom, and the \"Allowed\" fields will automatically do the math for you. Any negatives will highlight red, and positives will highlight green. \n\nI am open to any questions/criticism and I hope that this sparks some healthy conversation and advice amongst our community.

I use a wheelchair or prosthetic legs, and Canadian winter is hell if you're using a wheelchair. It's impossible to go anywhere, especially far distances, so barrier free access to public transit is a must for me. The reason I desire those cities is because I'll be studying interior design for the next 4 years in Mississauga, and most of the jobs relating to that are in Toronto or near by. Right now I'm looking into RGI housing in Mississauga and Toronto, but are there any other ways I could find places that are affordable on an ODSP income?\n\nI pay for school through OSAP, a bursary from the makers of my prosthetics, and ODSP which is my only form of non academic income right now. It's tight at times but I make it work by paying for things with my credit card or line of credit and then paying that off with whatever money I get next. I've managed to do an introductory program and graduate with zero debt because of it so far. Now I'll be studying for a bachelors degree and tuition is more than double what I used to pay because it's a 4 year BA. I will also no longer be eligible for the bursary after next year because of my age, so that will really make it hard and I might have to start taking on debt or find a way to make money.\n\nJobs are difficult for me because no employer I've met so far has been willing to accommodate my needs. I just need to be able to do the job sitting down, and occasionally walk around to stretch my legs (when wearing the prosthetics). My only official on the payroll job said no when I asked to do it in a wheelchair, and then ended up closing shop the following year anyway after I had to take an extended leave due to leg pain from standing too long.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to both pay for school and also live somewhere cheaper than the school residence. The residence is nice but it comes out to almost $1000/mo and that's a lot. I only plan to stay until I can find a subsidized apartment.\n\nDoes anyone here have any resources I could check out or advice? I just want to be able to live somewhere cheaper than the residence, that's located somewhere with easy access to my school, and that is wheelchair friendly. Any tips for school funding, or saving money in general are also greatly appreciated. I don't follow a budget, but I think I should start one so I was going to give YNAB a try. \n\nIf you made it this far thanks for taking the time to read it all. :)",

I'll be living on about $1,000 a month for rent (400), utilities (~150), gas, food, and other needs. I already live with one room mate and our landlord won't allow more. \n\nMy job costs me 45 hours a week at work and unfortunately they placed me 35 miles away so I'll have an extra 10 hours a week of driving. Im looking for something I can do for some extra money that's not putting even more miles on my car (I cant drive for uber or lift because of the age of my car). And I have a variable schedule to top it off. \n\nTldr; living on <$1000 a month because I was stupid and chose a college I couldn't afford. Can't refinance because of debt/income ratio. Trying to unbury myself and any help/ advice is greatly appreciated. ",

        "original": "So I make about 28k per year. My fiance currently does not work. She's pregnant with our baby which is due in October. We rely on my income soley right now. And we do ok. Now that I'm making 28k instead of 26k (just got a raise) we have around $300-$400 extra per month after bills and groceries etc.\n\nI just got the opportunity to get some amazing overtime. And I'm taking it. I'm not sure how long it will last but I know it will be 1 day a week for at least 3 weeks, at double time. I'm expecting maybe an extra $250-$300 after taxes per week while it's going on. It may even be extended another 2 weeks past this.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what to do with this money. Of course part of me says save it. Which is logical. But I know there's places we can use it also.\n\nFor example. We live in a tiny 1br apartment. Once the baby comes we will pretty much have outgrown it (we also have a large dog). So my first idea was use the extra money to get us into a 2 bedroom rental house. Which I've been able to find a few for the same price I'm currently renting our 1br. Or for something a little nicer for maybe $75 more per month. This will give us the room we need and we can stay there for a while longer.\n\nAnother idea I had was to get my car fixed. I have full coverage but I hit a deer and couldn't afford the deductible at the time. This extra money from overtime will give me enough to get my car fixed. Which is mostly body damage to the front end. \n\nAnother idea I had was to use it to pay off a few bills in advance (Like auto insurance which cost me $197 per month) so I don't have to worry about them for a few months, and it will free up some of my paycheck.\n\nWhat should I do? We currently live paycheck to paycheck, this past paycheck was the first one since my raise from 26k to 28k. So it had a little extra on it that helped us out and made us not feel so broke. Now with this raise we might feel a little more comfortable than we did before. \n\nIf you want a monthly breakdown it goes like this. \n\nRent and water: usually around $656 \n\nElectric: $65-75 \n\nInsurance for car, and motorcycle: $197 + $50\n\nCar bill: $144\n\nMotorcycle bill: $163\n\nGas: $80-90\n\nFood and toiletries: $150-200\n\nPhone bill: $50\n\nAnything extra we usually try to save some. And use some to go out with. Since my fiance is pretty depressed just sitting home pregnant not able to do anything all day. So when we have some extra money we try to go out once in a while on a cheap date night \n\nHelp!",

        "original": "Ok so I am a high school teacher and I\u2019ve seen a few comments here and there about teens panhandling, or living in severe poverty. In addition to any advice you\u2019ve already received about shelters and such I want to remind you that high schools exist. Even if you\u2019re not a student there. \n\nGo by any high school. A good time is at 3:30 or 4, after most student have gone home and the office staff isn\u2019t slammed with people coming in (this is mostly for your privacy- not because they would mind helping you). \n\nGo in and tell whoever is at the front desk your situation and say you need help. \n\n\nThey\u2019ll call CPS. You need to know that up front. We\u2019re legally obligated to do this (mandatory reporters) or we will lose our jobs.  But the sad fact is that most of us in the school system KNOW that CPS isn\u2019t going to do that much in many situations- so it\u2019s likely the school will start taking care of you in some capacity right then. \n\nAfter that, here\u2019s some services many schools have and don\u2019t advertise-\n\nAfter school programs- especially if you pick a title 1 (impoverished) school. They\u2019ll feed you, possibly clothe you, and provide you a safe place to be for a few hours.\n\nSchools have locker rooms, which means they have showers. Every school I\u2019ve worked in took kids in and gave them personal care items (sometimes students would do this on a daily basis)\n\nCommunity money pot. I know our school has a community \u201cpot\u201d managed by our principal. Us teachers throw money in there when we can and our principal uses that money to buy necessary things for kids. Idk if this is strictly legal, but our school does it on the DL. Our principal buys groceries and delivers them to kids in the community, puts gas in students cars who need it, buys them clothes for job interviews, pays medical bills. Whatever. I wouldn\u2019t go in asking for that because the school may not have it, but if you have a specific financial need that would immediately improve your situation, the people who work in schools do it because they love kids. Any teacher I know would gladly pull out some cash if they got an email saying there was a homeless teen in the office. \n\nMany schools also have teachers who foster. Schools are kind of a hotspot for this for obvious reasons. You\u2019re likely to be introduced to a decent foster parent if you hang around long enough, and many teachers would be willing to request you specifically if given the opportunity. We know how shitty the foster system can unfortunately be. I\u2019m not saying that every teacher makes a fantastic foster parent- but you don\u2019t devote your entire life to working in a school because you hate/want to abuse kids. \n\nGED tutoring. Schools offer this for free ALL THE TIME. If you\u2019re older and have dropped out or need to get your GED for some reason, there will always be someone at a school willing to tutor you for free. I do this constantly.\n\nCommunity connections. Schools know where the food pantry\u2019s are (or have their own- often called a backpack program). They know where the good shelters are. They know how to get you signed up on food stamps and medical cards. They know what clinics have a free program. They have vouchers for clothing and personal care items. They know what churches have care programs. Schools are CONNECTED inside communities. \n\n\nFinally, all the kids I\u2019ve worked with who were legitimately homeless wound up making their own situations worse. Don\u2019t start smoking, don\u2019t hang out with drug addicts, don\u2019t sleep in public places. Be smart. Endure. Get help ASAP. It\u2019s a lot easier to dig yourself out as a smart and healthy teen than it is as a drug addicted and beat up 20something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I just need to air out all our expenses and try and see through it. I feel like I need a plan because this is giving me anxiety. \n\nApparently the electricity company hadn't come to do a reading in 10 months, and now that they have, have 'readjusted' our bill... which comes up to 1,400\u20ac for this month (what the hell? 'estimated' bill for january-march was already 500\u20ac...).\n\nHere's a breakdown of our situation:\n\nI work at my own in-home daycare. I used to make 900\u20ac/month, now it's 480\u20ac. I will be working until July, then hopefully start another job in September. Come September, my grandparents will be giving me 500\u20ac because I will also be studying, so that will definitely be better. I used to be declared as an autonomous worker and pay 150\u20ac per month. I was late paying the last month and I have a 330 \u20ac bill coming up for it. I also have student debt (2000 CAN$) that I am due to pay (back home) but haven't started. \n\nMy husband makes around 1,500\u20ac per month, but it's really variable as he's a freelance translator. He pays 330\u20ac every month for his status as autonomous worker. \n\nWe pay our kid's school which is 120\u20ac for tuition + 170\u20ac  for lunch. The youngest is home with me for the moment. \n\nWe don't pay rent (my ILs are our landlords) but we do pay the community fee for the building (400\u20ac), and around 500\u20ac in gas, electricity, water. I know this is exorbitant. We really try to be careful but the appartement is huge and costs a fortune in heating. \n\nThe grocery shopping comes up to around 400 \u20ac a month. \n\nInternet + phone is around 80\u20ac. \n\nI can't think of any more significant/regular expenses. We don't have a car and walk almost everywhere. We cloth diaper. I breastfeed. The baby wears hand-me-downs and the oldest wears clothes two sizes up until they don't fit anymore. I haven't shopped for myself or my husband in ages. Healthcare is free here. We almost never eat out. \n\nMy ideal plan would be to start working, part time, in September, while I study. I have some contacts and believe I will make something happen; with my grandparents' help, we will be fine. My masters is also career-oriented. \n\nMy problem though is the mental pressure meanwhile. I work 7 hours every day and am empty-handed on the 15th of the month. I look for the cheapest milk bottles and save 10c. I forgo peanut butter when times are tough. Buying sunscreen for the kids almost gives me an anxiety attack, and I feel a huge pressure in my stomach just thinking about opening the banking app. I don't know how to cope with the mental pressure, this new stupid electricity bill is giving me major anxiety. We will never get ourselves out of this hole, let alone have savings. I feel like less of a human being and I know it's not true.

I\u2019ve used up all my savings throughout this past semester. Honestly, I\u2019ve never been this low on money before, and it\u2019s really hard because my boyfriend was my main support. I talk to my friends, but I try not to burden them too much.\n\n\nI\u2019m seeing a therapist next week cause I can get a couple free appointments at school. But, I still don\u2019t know how to supplement my income to be able to pay rent in a month. I\u2019m also concerned because once school starts, I can\u2019t work this much anymore. Not having money is starting to impact other parts of my life (not seeing the doctor or dentist when I need to, not being able to do little things that I enjoy cause I\u2019m working so much and can\u2019t afford to, etc.)\n\n\nLooking for any advice. I feel like I\u2019m drowning.\n\n\nTLDR; college student running out of money. Don\u2019t have enough income to live on - lack of support from family.

        "original": "I currently live in a suburb with a reasonable cost of living and a wonderful spouse who, like myself, has a decent paying full time job. Though we still have to watch our spending, we aren\u2019t necessarily struggling. I\u2019ve been wanting to go back to grad school for years and this past March I was accepted into a top program in my desired field at one of the top public institutions in the US...I was kind of riding out the high for a while, but now that the time has come to actually, y\u2019know, do it, I am losing my mind because I have NO idea how we are going to afford this.\n\nTuition for the next two years is going to be around ~$40k a year. I\u2019m trying to find scholarships for grad students but am coming up short. I\u2019m also applying to assistantships to hopefully get tuition assistance (and the teaching experience I desperately want), but that\u2019s also up in the air. I will absolutely have to take out loans, but at this point it\u2019s just determining how much. That would be fine with me, honestly, since my potential earnings (and near guaranteed job placement based on this institution\u2019s stats) would help mitigate the misery of heavy student loan debt. However, it\u2019s not my only debt because (plot twist!) I\u2019m a moron. I\u2019ve started to taking a close look at my numbers and this is where it gets ugly. \n\nI bought a MacBook in December 2016 because my old one was beat to shit and, as a designer, it felt justified. I did use it for work until I switched jobs in April since my old work computer was always crashing due to lack of memory (no matter how many times IT came to fix it). I put it on a credit card because of coooouuurrsseeee I was gonna be responsible and aggressively pay it off by the time the interest free period was up...\n\nLies. All lies. I paid it down to about $1500 but then, due to a few manic episodes and a royally shitty holiday season where I had no money but felt an intense obligation to buy everyone I had ever met a gift, I wracked up $1400 on a different card. I ended up merging the two amounts onto one credit card, interest free (which will be up in October), which I added another $200 to when money was tight and I needed gas, etc. This card is now at $3100 and some change. \n\nAlso, my husband and I moved and due to all of our money going toward the security deposit and furniture, I put our ~new household necessity shopping trip~ on another card. That\u2019s another $600 on an incredibly high interest card. \n\nAnd, because I am a Responsible Adult\u2122 I owe approximately $600 in medical debt that moved into collections before I knew I had it (had minor surgery last April, didn\u2019t get a bill from anesthesiologist until September, already my final warning????? Also, bills from doctor visits that I didn\u2019t know weren\u2019t covered by insurance.) I think I may owe another $200 in medical expenses but I never open my mail because I\u2019m scared and stupid. \n\nLastly, (it\u2019s not over yet!) apparently I owe the past two years worth of city taxes, which is another ~$600. My husband gave me our tax return money ($550) to pay it, and I don\u2019t really know what happened to it to be honest. I kept needing something here and there and had no money in my account so I didn\u2019t want to drain my account by using all that right away (logic?) and now it\u2019s been two months and let me tell ya, I don\u2019t have an extra $550 laying around. \n\nI need a plan and I need one fast because 1) if I were my husband I would have left me by now and 2) we worked out a budget for the move and our new life in this new city, and even with no luxuries and no spending money factored in, we\u2019d be $265 short each month. \n\nCurrent ideas:\n-Clean out my life and sell anything that might be worth a couple bucks. Could sell my old laptop for parts, old books, etc.\n-Freelancing...I have an old coworker that approached me asking for a website. If I can keep doing that, it\u2019s relatively easy money for me. I was also approached by my alumni institution a few years back trying to buy an illustration of mine. It was right before my wedding and my meds were off so I was terrible at replying and we never finished the deal, but maybe I can reach back out because it looks like the administrative assistant I was talking to left and it\u2019s been a while?\n-Ask for $$ for my birthday from my parents. My dad was going to get me an iPad because I\u2019ve been looking to get one for years and it would be a big help to have a tablet for design purposes (I do a lot of illustration and logo work), but now I feel guilty about it. \n-Use my stockpile of gift cards. I know I have $100 in Visa gift cards and a few random food/store ones.\n-Pick up odd jobs and tasks with apps and stuff in my spare time. Could use recommendations. \n-I\u2019d like to sell plasma because I used to be a regular blood donor and am not needle-phobic, but I just got a tattoo in May and have another one in July. (Before anyone says it\u2019s a bad idea to spend my money on that when I have all this debt...I know. I booked it before I realized how big of a hole I\u2019m in. It\u2019s redoing part of an old tattoo that makes me feel like shit because it is shit, and my choices are to just spend the rest of the money and at least feel better about my leg or to lose the down payment and keep the shit tattoo.)\n-Pick up a second job. My husband started doing Uber for a little extra spending money for himself, and I definitely wouldn\u2019t mind picking up something. That being said, I would probably prefer to do something on par with my skill level to hopefully make a little more than minimum wage. \n\nTl;dr: I am a garbage human with garbage money management skills and now I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t be able to go to school because this debt isn\u2019t going anywhere and I\u2019m going to have to move down to a part time job in September. Please help me make a plan, or tell me if it\u2019s even possible to fix at this point \ud83d\ude43",

Ran a $25 ad on FB and doubled my daily appointments. With the newly raised prices (which nobody has complained about) and a sign that says \"we \u2661 when you pay with cash\", I am seeing a huge jump in profits.\n\n2. Talked to my mom and she was happy to be \"laid off\" as receptionist and collect unemployment. She was recently diagnosed with a super rare form of cancer so working for me was all she could do for years, but with her new diagnosis, I'm pretty sure she'll qualify for all her SS benefits. \n\n3. Replaced my sub-par assistant with a summer break assistant, who does a much better job and is paid hourly rather than by the dog. \n\n4. Both my standard poodles were \"hired\" as demo dogs for an industry convention next week, which means an additional $400 in my pocket. \n\nBAD NEWS:\n\nMy original goal was to pay off the $300 in collections I had in the next few weeks and open up a modest line of credit for my shop. Really, all I wanted was about $300 a month for padding. \n\nHowever, 5 minutes ago I got an email from Credit Karma and a balance of $5k was added to collections. This was an ER visit last summer that I tried to prove low income for, but twice I sent in my paperwork and it \"never arrived\". The ER visit was incredibly stupid, I basically experienced a panic attack coupled with dehydration but thought I was having a stroke. They ran every test under the sun on me, hooked me to an iv for 2 hours, then released me with advice to \"rest and drink fluids\". I was uninsured at the time but qualified for Medicaid last november.\n\nRealistically, I could probably start paying $35-50 a month for the next two months, then maybe $100-150. However, I'm not sure if that's the way to go, since I read they restart your collections date every time you partial pay or admit your debt. \n\nI don't want to claim bankruptsy and I won't attempt debt consolidation if it means $3,000 interest/fees.

My SO makes $14.00 as well, also full time.  We live in a nice, safe part of town. There are much worse (read: unsafe) places to live here in Orlando.  I don't have to worry about my SO (f) going for a walk at night alone, I don't have to worry about leaving my window open to my bedroom at night, etc.\n\nWe live in an apartment that costs $1680.00 per month.  It's 3 bedrooms and it's split 3 ways among 5 people, so it's about 560 per \"room\".  Myself and my SO, another couple, and a single guy.  I've known these people for a few years prior to renting together, but surprisingly, we all met on Reddit.  The rent is way cheaper than if I lived with my SO only.  There is NO where I would want to live in town, and feel safe, that's $560 per month!\n\nI cook for everyone and do my best to keep the total cost under $425.00 per month for groceries -- I do a pretty damn good job of it too, which means that on average, each \"room\" pays about 35-40 per week in groceries.  ------ Cheaper than if I lived with my SO only.  My strategy is to only plan for dinners and lunches.  Lunches are usually leftovers from dinner that are easy to take to work.  If someone wants to buy breakfast items, that's on them.\n\n- Get some glass containers, ours are pyrex and they are amazing.  PACK Lunches - Don't go out!!\n\nWe split the utilities.  Here in Orlando, it gets hot.  The electric was $202.00, or just under $70 per \"room\" and I know that come July and August, it will be slightly higher. Still, it's cheaper than if I lived with my SO only.\n\nAnd I can go on with other ways we save.. but we all work together to actually save money.  I manage it all, however.  I pay all the utilities, rent, etc.   We use a cash app to request payments / send money, etc.  A few of my roommates aren't great with money, and me managing these things has helped them a lot, but to each their own.\n\nIf you are struggling with things, it may help to share the responsibilities with other people.   \n\nDo I wish that I was living with my SO only?  Yes, 10000% yes.  But, I'm going to have both our cars paid off by this time next year.  We just paid for our wedding in full, in cash (getting married in September). and other than about 50k in Student Loan debt between us, we will have no other debt (once those cars are paid off) and should have about $15,000 added to our savings.  \n\nWe both know that it won't be a permanent living arrangement, but it's giving us a leg up right now to pack away savings, pay off debt, etc.\n\nMy advice is to keep your head down and power through your issues with a clear mind, thoughtful consideration to where you want to be in a year, 2 years, 5 years... and do everything you can to make it happen.  The people I live with are great people, but it still sucks to live with other people.  But I'm keeping my head down and watching my bank account grow and my debts drop away.\n",

        "original": "So today I guess I was served through the post office that I am being taken to court by Credit Finance Inc. for $1190. This is from two just over $500 hospital bills from last summer. I had this weird hair follicle infection that was spreading across my legs. It was painful and being young and dumb I went to the ER twice over it instead of knowing about and visiting an income based doctor. Any way (another dumb thing I did) I never followed up with the charity form I turned in through the mail to get rid of the bill. I just assumed it was all OK since they didn't call me back. Yeah, I wasn't being very smart over it.\n\nWell I called them soon after I opened the letter at the post office (I spent about 15 minutes freaking out first) and they told me I have until the court date which is the 27th of July to pay it off or they will proceed with the court date. If I pay it off before then it will be cheaper. If I go to court over it then they are going to ask the judge to add interest to the amount and I will have to pay for court cost which is just over $90. So I am seeing that this will definitely be all the more cheaper if I just go ahead and pay it as soon as possible.\n\nSo I am in a place where I can pay this. During the summer I run a lawn business mostly to save up for my tuition and to pay for things like my daughters braces. I do pretty well. But I have read some horror stories the past few hours of this particular debt collector. One person posted in a forum that they payed them off. Then a couple years later they sold the debt to another collector and he had to jump threw hoops to collect proof from years prior that he had paid it off already. Another story that a woman posted (this one is more about a payment plan not paying in full) wrote a short story about setting up a very reasonable plan with them and they ended up taking double what she agreed to every month. Then there were countless other horror stories about this company.\n\nMy question is how should I go about paying this. I was thinking about doing a pre-payed debit card so I could pay them directly over the phone. I don't want them to have my bank information. What sort of documentation should I ask for. Should I ask for any kind of paperwork with an agreement before hand or what? I would greatly appreciate any advice anyone has to offer about dealing with a debt collector. Thanks.",

The older guy was an alcoholic who would drink multiple fifths of whiskey a week.  He lost his license and had a \"girlfriend\" who just used him for money and  took advantage of his loneliness  since his wife died.\n\nMy car broke down multiple times and I had to fix and then replace an engine putting me in 4k of credit card debt.  I donated plasma as much as I could, so much so I almost got a permanent scar...\n\nBottom line is, it was the low point of my life.  I voluntarily broke ties from friends and family because I had been dishonest about college and the immense guilt of fucking up my life caused me to literally run away from everything.  \n\nAfter living like that for nearly a year I started to mend my relationships.  My parents and family are far better than I deserve.  My sister helped me get a job at her company where after a raise I'm making $15.62 an hour, way more than I've made previously.  My parents helped me to get a reliable car, only asking I pay back half at 0% interest for as little as $100 a month.  They bought a manufactured home for me to live in and plan to put it in my name if I prove responsibility.  I never asked for any of this...it baffles me how much they care to be honest after how distant I was.\n\nI now work a 9-5 job (well 10-7) Monday through Friday with almost a month of PTO and extremely cheap health, dental and vision.  My lot rent is only $410 a month and utilities are $150 at most and that's in the dead of winter.  All of my debt is paid off and I have nearly $2k in savings already.  My life went from utter hell to stable and I really don't deserve it all.\n\nI think I just wanted to make this post to get this off my chest.

I never would have gotten here alone and God knows how long it would have taken to have a life even remotely similar if I tried to do it all on my own, it probably never would have happened.\n\nI really do feel for and empathize with people in poverty, of course some make shitty mistakes in life like I did but once you fall into a cycle it's so goddamn hard to crawl out.

I work full time in healthcare and personally make 40k a year, plus child support of 850 a month.  Which should be enough for us to live off.  But here's my year so far:\n\nMy ex husbands job messed up his child support so I didn't get child support for 4 months, January through April.  \n\nDuring this time, right after the holidays mind you, I literally maxed out every credit card I have, borrowed 2500 from my parents to pay for daycare and I have literally not had a dime to my name since.  I STILL can't get caught up. And just when I thought things were looking up....\n\nJune 1 I picked up my son from daycare and he had bruises and scratches on his neck.  Boom, rock bottom.  My daycare lady abused my little boy because he had an accident, long story, police are involved, but to top it off, now I needed new daycare, and I had just paid her for the month the day it happened.\n\nSo here I sit, July 3, short money for rent.  Found a new daycare but don't have the money for that or the deposit.  Car payment hasn't been paid, credit card bills that are way overdue.  I even took out a payday loan out of desperation.  Had an interview today that went really well and would be a huge raise but that would be a few weeks away minimum. I got a second job with Lion bridge I'm just starting, have been doing clickworker with my spare time, but I am literally out of options and I don't even know what to do.\n\nPaycheck to paycheck would be a severe underestimate, we are living day to day.\n\nAnybody know of any resources or is there a logical way to be optimistic that I am missing?

        "title": "Some personal experience.",
        "original": "I wanted to share some personal experience on how I survived during the lean times. I'll give you some background so I don't just sound like some indignant \"you lazy bastards, pull yourselves up by your bootstraps\". About 10 years ago I was hurt and rendered partially disabled. I had a $9 an hour retail job and was supporting myself and helping my mom. She was at risk of losing her house so I moved back in with her (I appreciated the cheaper rent) and helped her by paying ALL the bills and taxes so she could catch up her mortgage. During this time I learned a lot about how to spend and save money. I hope some of what I learned will help at least one person on this thread. \n\nFirst of all. Surprises are expensive. You become an easy target when you are in crisis mode. You're more susceptible to risk and high interest because you have no other options. For this reason you need an emergency fund. Take any amount you can set aside and do so until you have 3 months of expenses saved up. This will take a while and at some point a crisis will occur and you will need to drain it. DO NOT WORRY. This will pass and you pick up right where you left off. During this time continue to pay what you can to your debts. Once you have your emergency fund set aside then you look at your finances. \n\nThere are two ways to look at your debt; pay off the highest interest rate first, or pay off your smallest debt and then take the money that frees up and throw it at your debt. Both work but I prefer going after the highest interest first as those types of debt can become monsters. Best to kill them while they're small. \n\nSmall rules. \n\n1. Go without. There was a great facebook meme recently that something like \"if your first financial advice to me is 'skip the $5 coffee every morning' then you grossly overestimate the position I'm in\". Can you go a month or two without a haircut? Then do so. Pride is your enemy. Your responsibility is to your wallet, not your friends. Shitty people will look down on you for bailing on going out for a beer. Good friends will understand. \n2. When asked \"when did you realize you had achieved financial security?\" most people said \"at the grocery store\". The grocery store can make you or break you. My best rule here is to stay to the outer aisle; fruits and veggies, meat, eggs, milk, bread. The staples. Your phone has a calculator. Use it. Every grocery store has a salad bar where 1lb = $4.99 or $5.99. Figure out what you need and go look at the prepackaged version of it. Then run the math. I found spinach and some veggies is way cheaper from the salad bar. Shredded cheese is cheaper prepacked but Feta cheese is cheaper on the salad bar. It also works to get smaller quantities so you don't lose as much to waste. \n3. Preparation is powerful. I would buy a bottle of water every day I worked retail. One day a coworker pointed out that we sold 24 packs for the cost of 4 individual bottles. So I bought a case and put it in my car. I did that for a few months then I noticed all the travel mugs at the local thrift shop. I bought 3 of them at a dollar a piece and filled them at home. I went from spending about $7.50 a week on water, to $6, then down to nearly nothing. It will always be cheaper to prepare something and carry it with you. Even now I pack my lunch 5 days a week. I'm a grown man and my coworkers rib me about it but I'm spending $50 a week on groceries that make 21+ meals, and they're spending $8-10 a day on lunch...ON LUNCH. Again, pride is your enemy. \n4. Do everything and anything you can (legally) to make money. Pick up every shift. Do every hour of overtime. Sell plasma if you can. There are a ton of online resources to make money. There's a website called Naming Force where a company says \"we have this product, it does X. We need a name for it\". Then the online members contribute name ideas. The winner gets money. The other day a friend of mine got a paying job doing voice acting for a podcast. Keep your eyes open and look for opportunities. Get a part time job at a restaurant. It may only be 2 shifts a week but you probably get a free meal. \n5. Resources are available. Call 211, look for your local food banks, many utilities have programs for people at or under 150&#37; of the federal poverty level. \n6. Listen. Many people have advice. Mark Cuban recently said his best advice to get rich was to make smart purchases. If you find toothpaste on sale 50&#37; off then you buy a TON of it. Boom, now you don't need to buy toothpaste for a year and you just doubled your money. A few months back I found my deodorant of choice was being discontinued. It was on clearance for $1 per stick. I bought EVERY stick at the grocery store. Then I drove to the two nearest convenience pharmacies and bought every stick they had as well. I have enough deodorant to last me 2-4 years. \n7. Embrace the thrift shop. A while back I was dragged to a mall and I saw a shirt I really liked but it was $35 dollars. I took my hypothetical $35 and went to Salvation Army where I found 5 shirts I liked. Do you need sheets? Thrift shop. Do need plates? Thrift shop. Do you need underwear? Go buy your underwear new. Everyone has to put their foot down about something. How you spend money is just as important as how you save money. \n\nLook, I don't want this to be a rant. I believe in you. A while back I was wiping my ass with junk mail because I couldn't afford toilet paper. I'm not rich and I probably won't ever be, but I am debt free and living modestly comfortable. The majority of the world is in debt and this is a wonderfully nurturing environment. The one thing you need to do is remain positive. When I was at my worst I used to look down at my tattoos and think \"if only I hadn't squandered money on these I might be able to eat tonight\". That's fatalist. You have a mission ahead of you and the best way to succeed is to relish the process. You'll have a week where you see momentum and it will feel amazing. ",

On top of student loans, keeping up with it all isn't the most...fun experience in the world. I'm keeping up with payments and have been flipping on eBay to give myself some additional income.\n\nI have ADHD, but I'm unsure if my issue is directly related to it. I'll be minding my own business, not really paying much attention to stuff, until I see something that makes me think, \"Oh, I'd like to have that.\" But instead of stopping there, it spirals into a crazy, days-to-weeks-long affair where I can't stop thinking about buying that thing to the point where I will do damn near anything to get it. A not-crazy human being would wait. Me, it becomes a near-painful obsession, similar to having a particularly itchy mosquito bite, or a gnawing hunger that won't pass no matter how much you try to force it away. In the end, I still want the item, but making the itch go away becomes more of a priority than how much I want the item.\n\nA few months ago, around February, I bought a Macbook pro on credit. $2k. \n\nOn top of CC debt, I have $400 that I still owe to my therapist. The issue I have with my therapist is that while I'd love to make regular weekly payments like she wants, I...don't have that kind of income. She also will not set up any kind of online portal for payments - no Venmo, paypal, or even the patient portal like my GP has. It has to be cash or money order, which is harder for me to get to her because her practice is an hour away from where I live. The gas alone getting there and back home is a payment in itself. So I've been trying to come up with a way to just save up the money and give it all to her in one trip, but as I found out last week, she wants it now.\n\nSo I had a bit of a dilemma. My paycheck next week is already going to be wiped out by a student loan payment. Paying her would leave me with $50 for two weeks. \n\nWhat I ended up doing was selling my MacBook Pro and all of its accessories for $1570. I then shopped around for other laptops (I do need a laptop for programming/working from home), and realized that the Surface laptop was going for less than $700 for the 4th of July sale. \n\nAfter selling the Mac, I went and got the Surface. It pretty much does everything I need it to do and more, and I'm honestly not sure why I went with the more expensive option other than because of the itch, and because everyone else in my company seems to use one as their daily driver. It's also better looking.\n\nNow, not only do I have enough to get rid of the debt with my therapist, but I also have a little extra to either throw at a credit card or keep to use on pets/food. Haven't yet decided.\n\nMaybe it wasn't the most ideal solution, but hey, that's one annoying debt gone. ",

She should have gone to Unemployment, but she was angry and quit. \n\nI've been helping her the best I can, but I'm not in the best place financially. I have to move at the end of the month,I have a 15 percent garnishment being taken out of my paycheck. I'm working a second job because they reduce my hours during the summer (I work at a University) and it's 1099 work where you have to pick up shifts, and until today I haven't had a day off in over two weeks. My brother and sister won't help and have basically abandoned us.\n\nMy brother did hire our mom to be a baby sitter, but that only lasted a month due to my sister in law, and since then he's pretty much ignored us. So now my mom is two weeks past due on rent. She pays 100 a week flat, and her roommate has been nice to let it slide because I've been paying 100 every other week, but by the end of July she will be 400 in the hole. I'm not sure I can keep paying what I have every other week and still be able to move into my new place. I'm not doing very well financially either.\n\nMy mom has been applying to many places, but is having a very hard time finding work. Seems no one wants to hire a 59 year old woman. Another thing is her eyesight. She got new glasses last year, but now they give her migraines, but she needs them to work a register. She did work at McDonald's for one day, but they wouldn't let her adjust the screen and let her go after one day.\n\nMy mom went Social Services to apply for Snap. Here lies our problem. She needs affidavits from anyone who has given her money. I'm afraid if they find out I've been helping her, that she'll be denied. So I've got a lot of questions and need some advice on how to proceed with getting her help. \n\nMy main question is what is going to happen if I write a note saying I've been paying part of her rent. She told the case worker o er the phone that she's had friends helping her here and there, which is why they want the affidavits. \n\nShould she get a note from my brother?\n\nReally, any advice or help to steer us in the right direction, or to find other services she can get would help. Also, what should I do if she does become homeless? She can't live with me. Does her roommate have to give her 30 days notice before he evicts her?\n\nI'm sorry this post is a bit of a jumble. I am.under a great amount of stress, and may not be handling it very well. I've probably left out important details, so please, ask me anything to clarify and give the best advice. Thanks in advance to any and all help.\n\n**Edit** ok, some things I think would help clarify some points. My mom and I have a joint bank account. No surprise, but I've been helping her off and on my whole adult life. The past few years have been rough for both of us, but we've never been in this bad of a situation, which is probably why we have waited so long to try and get help. Also, she's never had this much trouble finding a job before, and as she's getting older, she's definitely got some issues.

        "original": "I've been trying to figure out how to reach out to somebody for help for the longest time--I figured, after years of thinking, that this might be the best place to do it.\n\nI'm a 22-year-old Pennsylvanian community college student looking within the next year to graduate, but what's making me nervous is what comes next. Back in middle school after some issues I was facing (involving my one and only period of time spent in detention), I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. It took a long while for me to learn about the basics of the disorder, what it was, and what I had to do to face up to it and live comfortably with the knowledge I had it day to day. The years to follow through the rest of middle school and high school were a little bit tough, but I survived. I graduated from high school and that same fall, I applied to and started taking classes at a community college in my local area, where I still go today.\n\nAnd now, as of this day, the 9th of July, 2018, I'm very close to graduating from said community college. But I'm very anxious as to about what comes afterwards: Life as an adult, living on my own. I'm slowly but surely saving up for the day I have to step out of my parents' door and find a place of my own, but I've no idea as to where to go or the measures I need to take in order to get there.\n\nI face a lot of troubles, admittedly--as I struggle with bouts of depression and emotional breaks--but I'm a lot better emotionally and wholesomely than I was back in middle school before the initial diagnosis was made. I'm a lot more confident and I'm showing a rather great example at a local dollar store I work at as a cashier and sometimes a stock-boy. I've earned many praises from customers and have been even visited by the district manager of the company I work for to be personally shown his appreciation for my determination.\n\nBut I can't do this alone. There are many publicly-accessible resources for college students, but I have no idea on where the foundation for my search for housing should even start, as I have no knowledge of the fine knowledge of leasing an apartment or even simply renting a room in someone's house so that I can be safely out of the elements. I'm afraid that if I sit on this any longer, after I've graduated, it'll be 8 years, minimum, before I even THINK about doing anything.\n\nSo in that case I've come to the conclusion I need to reach out for help. Does anyone here on Reddit have any knowledge of any sort of resources for individuals on the autism spectrum, or any such related disorders, that could assist those WITH such conditions to find housing in the northeast US? Or if there are any groups that provide emotional or financial assistance support to such individuals? I'd honestly prefer, if possible, to stay in the state of Pennsylvania if I can. I love it here.\n\n(Double-posted on suggestion by Reddit user dogGirl666.)",

We tried to do the best we can from reading around here, so let us know how we did. \n\nThanks, Jim and Emilie :)\n_______________________________\n\nA bit of context : we're Jim and Emilie, 18 yo, a couple for a bit over 4 years and living together for 2 years. We're estranged from our respective biological families (our choice). We're currently living for free in a old camping trailer behind a friend's family house. We're incredibly grateful they didn't let us become homeless, but it's far from ideal. \n\nTogether we have around 2K in savings. Jim owns a 2004 Subaru Impreza wagon, in good condition that he inherited from his grandfather (who raised him alone since he was 5yo). \n\nWe decided to move in the city for better jobs and education opportunities. There are no post-secondary institution in the middle of nowhere we call our hometown. So far, we've found jobs and a cheap place to live. Jim already started his new job, doing the 1.5 hours commute everyday. We are moving in on July 15th, and Emilie start her new job on July 16th. \n\nAs for the financial side of things, we just have a joint account and it work great for us, since we're both on the same page, finance-wise. \n\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n**Income** \n\n* $2400/month. \n\n*It's a bit conservative, but our work hours are not guaranteed for now, so we're budgeting for 20h/week each (net).*\n\n**Expenses**\n\n* Rent : $608/month, including utilities, appliances, parking and on suite laundry. \n\n*It's an old and tiny basement apartment, but it\u2019s clean and close to Emilie work and school. Plus, the landlord didn't mind our lack of credit history. We tried getting roommates, but it proved harder than expected as a couple. Since we were in a time crunch, we pulled the plug on the basement apartment. The random 8$ is our renter insurance.*\n\n* Food : $300/month. \n\n*Jim is a big and tall guy and his job is physically demanding, so he eats A LOT. Emilie loves to cook and she's already started a meal plan for us. We spent around $250 for food in June and it was a typical month for us, so we based our budget on that.*\n\n* Car & Transportation : $300/month for Jim's car (license, insurance, gas, maintenance, etc.). \n\n*It's expensive, but he works all over the city and outside, plus he needs to bring his gear and tools. He does the maintenance himself, and the car is reliable, practical and has a good fuel economy. We both have valid driver licenses*\n\n* Communications : $90/month. \n\n*We both have the cheapest phone plan (25$) and no phone balance. We also bought the cheapest internet plan we could find, as Emilie will need Internet for school.*\n\n* Education : ~$250/month (?). \n\n*Emilie will start part-time college in September. She applied to every program she could find for low-income students. We're hoping she can get everything subsidized/free, but we want to be ready in case we have to pay for some things.*\n\n* Health and personal care : $50/month. \n\n*For stuff like Emilie eyeglasses, dentist appointements, etc. We do our own haircuts. The rest goes for personal hygiene stuff.*\n\n* Fun stuff : $50/month. \n\n*For date night, or buying booze for a party with friends. We're still young, and love to have fun. We were pleasantly surprised to learn about all the free stuff the city provide thought. We also have practical and money saving hobbies. Emilie likes to sew and Jim likes to tinker on his car and build stuff.*\n\n* Everything else : $50/ month. \n\n*For stuff like clothes, shoes, household stuff, etc. We already buy our clothes and shoes from second-hand store (thanks to Emilie sewing hobby, we still look decently put together). Emilie has a work uniform, and Jim has an allowance from work to buy work boots. \n\n* Savings : ~$700/month.\n\n*We plan on putting any remaining money each month in our saving accounts. \n\n\n\n**SHORT TERM PLAN** \n\n\nWe plan on using parts of our savings to buy some essentials, like a bed. We don't trust a used bed (bedbugs are rampant in the city) and Jim needs a queen size because he's too tall for a double. We measured the apartment and a queen size will fit. We have already sourced a decently priced bed and mattress online and we'll go to the store to buy it on July 15th. Then we'll visit local second-hand stores for the other essentials. Then a grocery trip to buy the pantry staples we need. We budget to spend $1000 to buy essentials and furnish the place. \n\nAs for everything else we may need, we'll wait until we need it and budget for accordingly. As long as we live in that small studio apartment, there's no room for anything else. Except for a table and chair, for Emilie to do her schoolwork. We're confident we can find a used one for free or cheap nearby. \n \nOur mutual short-term goal is to find a way for Emilie to go to college full-time. This way she could get her degree in 3 years instead of 6. Jim will try to get a raise and more hours, or a second job. Emilie will try to get a better paying job, or a job with better work-study conciliation. \n\n\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN**\n\n\nLong term plan is keeping our head above the water and building a good credit. We are waiting to have our new official address to get credits cards for that purpose. We plan on paying everything with credit cards (and paying in them in full each month). Once we have enough saving, and a good credit, we want to get a nicer apartment. \n\nOnce Emilie has her degree and works in her field, our financial position will be better. Jim is hopeful he can get an apprenticeship with his current employer. If not, then he wants to enroll in trade school once Emilie is done with college.",

        "original": "*I originally posted this in r/personalfinancecanada and someone suggest I post this here in case y\u2019all have questions. \n\nI've always been a huge saver, ever since I can remember. \n\nI came through some hard times at the age of 17, and was on my own and made a cross-country move to Toronto.\n\nI put myself through university and graduated in 2016. I had paid off all my tuition working 3-4 jobs, with a $9k student loan by May 2016. I would say my GPA suffered slightly by the little amount of time I had due to working so much, which is something I knew I had to sacrifice in order to pay for school. \n\nA month or two before graduation, one of my part-time jobs promoted me to full-time, but was not in my field. I accepted it and starting paying off my student loan by chucking $1000 bucks at it each month until Nov 2016 on a salary of $40,000. Living in Toronto, I lived in a large (but very old/crappy) basement bachelor for $700 a month, but this allowed me to throw such a huge chunk of my salary at the loan. By Oct/Nov 2016 I had fully paid it off . \n\nIn February 2017 I landed a full-time position in field (yay), making $42k. I realized that since I knew I could pay $1000 monthly to my loan (which was now fully paid off) that meant I knew I could also save $1000, which I continued to do until the fall of last year.\n\nIn the fall of last year, I had moved into a much nicer 1 bedroom apt with my partner, but since we were splitting costs it still was only $750 monthly. My expenses remained generally the same ($200 food, $30 phone, $130 metropass) and I realized I could amp my savings up if I \\*really\\* restricted what I spent my money on. I challenged myself to save half my salary. \n\nSome months were hard, but in Feb 2018 I was given a raise to $45k and that's when I began truly throwing my $1500 into my TFSA. Last week, I was given another raise (50k) and now am able to save $1600 monthly.\n\nOver the course of the past 1.5-2 years, the satisfaction of watching my money grow has been somewhat...addicting? It's strange but there's some sort of high I get from seeing my cash balance raise by the thousands each money.\n\nI was paid today, and have hit the 30k mark, which for my age (25) I think is not too bad.\n\nI've got it all stored away in Tangerine 2.5 per cent HISA/TFSA. But here's what I would like to do:\n\n- continue to save $1600 monthly\n\n- I\u2019ve been finding means to increase my income in little ways like selling some unused household goods online or Facebook marketplace. This has been pretty profitable for me\n\n- continue to keep the majority of my money in 'safe' GICs or HISAs because a house, or big future expenses are possible\n\n- begin to throw $300 of the $1600 into WealthSimple balanced portfolio because compound interest is a thing\n\n- My company will take 3% of my pay starting in Feb 2019 for their contribution RRSP plan that is mandatory. They will match 3% if I contribute, on top of that, 3%. That would be 6% my money, 3% their contribution. I am thinking this is good, since it's free money and will do this.\n\nWhile I definitely have a handle on 'saving', I sometimes get somewhat overwhelmed in the 'what do with it' aspect.\n\nWanted to throw my story out, in case anyone had any additional suggestions.\n\nThanks, all. I\u2019ve been a lurker on this sub over the past year and it\u2019s really helped me stay motivated. I owe y\u2019all.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019M A LADY BTW!

        "original": "Warning! Long post!\n\nGiven  the rent prices in the bay area, I am finding it hard to save any money  as a low income employee (grad student). Most months during the school year my take home pay is about $1900...my rent is about $1100, for a small storage room converted into a bedroom in a 2br house...so  basically I am left with \\~$800/mo for food, gas (I commute), car  insurance + maintenance, gym membership, and incidentals. Most months I  break even or go a bit negative.\n\nI\u2019m considering alternative, ultra low rent housing options. I\u2019m a young, minimalist male, so I really don\u2019t need much to survive, and I\u2019m more than ok with \u201croughing it\u201d. Some options I'm considering are co-op living ($300/mo, some food covered) or I\u2019ve heard of boat owners at  marinas letting people live on their boat for a small fee (basically a person living there is a security measure for them). I was also considering finding a campground and living there since I have a tent,  but it seems like that is actually pretty expensive ($35/night!!!!)\n\nMy leading option right now is liquidating some of my extra belongings and buying a cheap long bed truck with a camper, and converting it into a stealth mobile home. The cost of not paying rent would far outweigh the upkeep costs of the truck and other costs associated with not having access to a home (eg a Verizon JetPack with data plan for mobile WiFi, eating out more frequently bc. no access to kitchen). Also, I think I\u2019d  be able to use friends houses (on occasion) for cooking and parking. My  commute would also be much much shorter, which is a big plus.\n\nSome problems that come to mind are\n\n* Having to go to a laundromat to do laundry all the time (not a big deal tho)\n* Finding a reliable place to park. I have a few spots in mind in the east bay near my work but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d work day in and day out. So there will probably be lots of time spent driving around looking for a place to sleep. Although, I\u2019ve been considering trying to find someone who would rent a pkg spot to me for a cheap price (eg $50/mo)\n* I like having roommates. Living alone in a truck/van would be pretty antisocial :/\n* Safety. With crime rates in the east bay being as high as they are, Id consider having a gun with me. But along with that, there\u2019s tons of legal  limitations and it seems like an unnecessarily extreme precaution. Maybe I\u2019d be better off with some mace or a fixed blade knife or something?\n\n**tldr I'm a graduate student considering living in my car for a while to save money**\n\nHas anyone heard of good ultra-low rent living situations?

I was once a upon a time, financially stable but stupid with my money, then my life took a dramatic change and since then it\u2019s just been a nosedive. \n\nLost my mom, lost my FT job, lost my relationship of 4 years (along with almost all my material possessions), having to move in with my aunt as a man in his 30s, 15k in credit card debt, 33k in student loans with no degree, no stable employment, house flooded and again lost more possessions, I haven\u2019t been employed Full-time since 2015, it\u2019s just been temp employment after temp employment and again I just landed a job that is temp.\n\nI\u2019ve learned that losing your job isn\u2019t that bad, looking for another job isn\u2019t that bad, it\u2019s the financial consequences that make it so stressful. So anyways the job is for 6 months there is a small chance that I may be able to get on Full-time later on down the line but it\u2019s very very up in the air at this point. \n\nI start 7/23 and it\u2019s $20/hr. I\u2019m forgoing any sort of benefits when they\u2019re offered I\u2019m not going to pay and invest in benefits when there\u2019s a possibility I may lose my job at any moment. \n\nI have an interview tomorrow 7/17 for a FT direct hire. So question #1. Even though I just accepted a job, if offered the FT direct hire position should I take it? How would that look? I need stability so my gut says yes, even if it pays less because I\u2019ll get other benefits (PTO, affordable health, chance to promote and get raises and other incentives that come with a FT direct hire). \n\nQuestion #2. If I don\u2019t get the direct hire job, how should I continue looking for such an opportunity? You\u2019d think I\u2019d have it all figured out by now on my 30s. \n\nQuestion #3. Is budgeting, paying debt and  saving? \n\nI haven\u2019t made $20/hr in nearly 4 years I need to take advantage of this as long as I can. Please don\u2019t go all PF on me, I know should be saving for retirement, invest in 401k but that\u2019s not my priority. My priority is; stable job, budgeting, debt reduction, saving, reaching financial stability again, continuing education to finish my degree, getting my own place! Omg what I wouldn\u2019t give to live on my own again, I\u2019m thankful my aunt is letting me live here but it\u2019s depressing and I\u2019m ready to date and be social again, be independent and just have my own space!\n\nSo I\u2019m asking for your help!\n\nTL;DR Life took a nosedive to rock bottom near homeless, in massive debt, can\u2019t get a stable job/hired on FT only temp jobs, live with my aunt in my 30s (embarrassing for a guy). Accepted a temp job that pays $20/hr, may have the opportunity for direct hire position with an other company interviewing tomorrow, how to accept and leave temp job if offered? I\u2019m declining benefits at temp job if offered, I\u2019m only concerned about stability in the short term.

        "original": "As a 47 year old non discharged bankrupt, I am trying to put a plan in place  for when I am discharged from my bankruptcy in 8 months\n\nI would be grateful for any advice that anyone might have. \n\nIt\u2019s a long and protracted story, so I will keep it as brief as possible. I\u2019m more than happy to answer any questions. I have also kept some details a little vague to keep it from being too identifiable!\n\nMy bankruptcy was not a result of gambling, credit card debt or any form of addiction. Until 3 years ago I owned a successful company working in a very niche market sector. \n\nIn regard to the business, over the 10 years it was operating I\u2019ve always been very responsible and ensured taxes, invoices and salaries have been paid on time and I constantly reinvested profits in to development to allow the company to grow and evolve. I was 6 months away from paying off our mortgage and having some real financial security.\n\nAs a result, a few years ago we won a couple of high profile contracts to design and build a product to be used on some global events. \n\nTo keep the company efficient, we contracted some of the development projects to a small family run business who I had worked with previously. We had worked well for a number of years and I had also helped them out of a very difficult period. The two projects used the same platform but where significantly different in how they where deployed and used.\n\nAt the time that the contracts where awarded the M.D. of the company retired to be replaced by another, younger family member.\n\nWe delivered on the first project with great success but 8 months later when the second project was due for delivery,  the  company failed to deliver on a number of fundamental components due to there own reoccurring cash flow issues. They did not discuss this or raise it as an issue during progress meetings. We had a working prototype based on the original project but the second project required a completely different electronics package internally. This had not been ordered 7 days before delivery and they had no design documentation for us to work with. At this stage the supplier had been paid in full for the work valued at about $350,000. I then had to spend another $180,000 to get the work completed and delivered to the client. They also failed completely to deliver on another aspect of the same project for which they had be paid in the region of $25,000.\n\nThis project was delivered but only just and due to the hard work of the team that I had to parachute in at the last moment, and my client was rightfully unhappy and demanded a refund on some of there costs which was in the region of $50,000. \n\nDespite repeated confirmation from the board of directors from my supplier, rather than enter in to discussions regarding a settlement plan, the new MD of the company issued an injunction claiming theft of IP and a few other spurious claims.\n\nHaving no other avenue, we had to engage lawyers which resulted in an 12 month stalemate ensuring that I was not allowed to trade or earn income from the product we had developed. Legal fees accounted for another $70,000.\n\nThere where some contracts and agreements in place, but the other side  in the dispute where just holding out for a settlement. As they themselves admitted, if we went to court, we had a very strong case and we would win, but any claim against them would result in them going bankrupt and the release of our IP would be held up further.\n\nOn the advice of our lawyer and after mediation we came to a settlement that wrote off there debt to my company, (in excess of $350,000 covering other existing projects).\n\nOur reason for doing so was that as a result of the performance of the product, we had been approached by a far larger market who had a real interest in our technology. So we assumed that while the settlement was far from fair it would be better to cut out losses and just move on.\n\nWhen the information was released it was far from complete and was not in a state that would allow us to immediately move in to production. It took another 8 months to bring it up to a required standard.\n\nThere is more to add to this story, but that is the basic back story. \n\nAnyway, as a result, my original company filed for bankruptcy at the end of last year and as I had taken out a personal guarantee against a short term loan to try and get the company moving forward, I had to declare bankruptcy 6 months ago.\n\nThe IP is now legitimately held by a second company that my then partner and I started to sell the technology in to this new sector. We sold our house to fund the legal dispute and to provide cash flow. The administrator was happy in this process and we where both insistent that everything be above board and done by the book.\n\nSo the reason for this long and dull tale is to seek advice on how best to rebuild my financial reputation and health once I have discharged my bankruptcy? \n\nI don\u2019t own property anymore, my relationship hasn\u2019t survived the trauma and stress of the last few years although we still get on and she is now my employer. When I am discharged and as long as there are no constraints I will become a director and 50% shareholder.\n\nThe signs for the new company are good although the money saved for the final development stage is no longer available and while I won\u2019t earn a significant income for the next 6 months, I will earn enough to rent a room in a house because they don\u2019t credit check you.\n\nI would be grateful for any advice on how best to proceed and work with the banks and financial institutions in order to quickly and efficiently rebuild my credit rating and personal finances.\n\nJust to make it clear, I am sure I have made some bad decisions over the years and especially during the period preceding the liquidation and bankruptcy. The main creditor was a financial institution that held the PG.\n\nAs painful as it was, bankruptcy was the only course of action that I had, and making that decision was the only sensible option. \n\nThere are people in far worse positions that I and I know I made errors. I am still motivated to make the new company a success.\n\nI would be grateful for any advice that I can get to help me move forward and put this behind me as a non home owning, 47 year old bankrupt needs to make a plan for the future.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this far!!\n\n",

        "original": "I am going to share my story with you in hopes that it might help someone else out there who might be in a similar situation. I am your biggest fan and I hope like hell others can feel the relief and joy I have experienced by eliminating my debt.\n\n\nI am a 51 year old single male who had about 3k in credit card debt, a car payment and a mortgage payment. When I bought my house I was married, but it didn't last long as this was our second time to be married to each other and we already knew the warning signs that things weren't going to be different. When she left, it was a difficult time financially as it took every penny I made to keep from losing the house. \n\n\nI floated this way for years, making minimum payments and making no progress on my debt. It was unfortunate that it took being in debt without any ability to get out of it to make me realize how much we can become slaves to our debt. It is life crippling to spend most of our adult lives paying off what would have only taken us a few years to save up and pay cash for. I recognized that I was never going to have nice things unless I was willing to go into more debt to have them thus compounding my problem. It felt like I had surrendered myself to a life of financial struggle without even putting up a fight.\n\n\nI did not have health insurance. This was a huge mistake because at my age it was just a matter of time before something was going to happen, and it did. I started having gallstone attacks. They were incredibly painful and I would have to make a decision each time.... either sit in my bed rocking back and forth in tears for anywhere from 4 to 8 hours, or go to the emergency room and go 1500 to 2 grand in debt with each trip. Sometimes the pain was unbearable and I just went to the emergency room. When you are in severe pain, the debt becomes less of an issue. However, when the pain is gone the new debt just crushes your spirit. I finally got health insurance and had my gallbladder removed, but by then I had accumulated over 20 grand in medical bills. I suffered through it for years before having it taken care of.\n\n\nObviously, I couldn't pay. I thought well it is medical bills so I will take care of them when I get in a better financial situation. I had always heard you can't be ruined over medical bills if you make an effort. I had my wakeup call when the local sheriff department served me a summons to go to court. I was being sued for unpaid medical bills. I called them to try to work something out and make a payment, but they told me I should have done that before legal action was taken. I had to put the full amount on my credit card for that bill. So I learned my lesson there. I contacted all of the other collection agencies about my outstanding medical bills and worked out settlement offers. Instead of making payments, I asked how much they would reduce it by if I paid the entire amount. I was surprised that a lot of them were willing to take 40 to 50 cents on the dollar. That was a huge discount, so I put them all on credit cards. Now I was safe from being sued, but I had 16K in credit card debt. This is where I got serious about getting out of debt. Below was my plan of action and how it worked...\n\n1. I consolidated my credit card debt to 2 or 3 cards so that I would have as few monthly payments to manage as possible\n\n\n2. I made the minimum payment on all of them except 1. I chose the one with the smallest balance and added 15.00 to the minimum payment. That was my monthly payment every month. I did not reduce it when the monthly minimum went down, I just paid the same amount every month. I didn't notice much difference at first, however after about 6 to 8 months the balance started dropping faster and faster on that card. I had to be disciplined for about 8 months, that was all it took. The momentum got crazy as the balance went down in bigger chunks every month. When the card got down to 0 balance I marked it off my list.\n\n\n3. I now chose my new card to focus on and took the fixed amount from the previous card and added it to the monthly payment of this new card I was focusing on. That became my fixed payment on that card for its entire life cycle. That balance dropped even faster than my previous card. It was crazy how much momentum this picked up, and it legit got me excited about the reality of me being able to get out of debt. I started looking for new ways to make money on the side just to add additional amounts to the payments each month. Not because I was struggling and needed to get it down, but because it became fun. I couldn't believe I was making this kind of progress this fast. It was like playing a game. Before I knew it, balance reached 0.\n\n\n4. Now to my last card with the money I was paying on the previous card being added to my minimum on this new card of focus for my new monthly payment. This card went really fast. I reached a 0 balance on this last card incredibly fast.\n\n\nWhen I was done, I had 20k in available credit on my credit cards and no credit card debt. My credit score improved dramatically and I didnt even care about that at the time. With this new found excitement and momentum I decided hey, what if I took all this money I was paying on my credit cards and started paying it extra on my car payment every month? Bam, car paid off 18 months early.\n\n\nHere I was with disposable income after being in nearly ruins just a few years earlier. I didn't get a better job or a pay increase. My bills did not go down, I just had to suffer spending all of my extra money on getting out of debt for a few years. If that sounds like a long time, consider this. Those few years are going to pass whether you work on your debt or not. The only thing you can control is what your debt situation will be once they have passed.\n\n\nI noticed people always talking about having a nest egg, or emergency fund. I read a book by Dave Ramsey which is where i got the idea to pay my debt down the way I did. 1k was the target, which I was able to achieve rather quickly since I had no more cc payments or car payment. With the momentum I had going, for the first time in my life I was able to look at the balance on my savings account and see 10k. It was liberating. It changed my life. It set me free. I didn't fear losing my job. I didn't fear car trouble. I didn't fear appliance failure in my home.\n\n\nI am a poor man. I live a humble life. And yet, I feel free. I feel at ease.

        "original": "[I am upset so I swear in this post, just warning]\n\nThe other day a coworker of mine brought up student loan debt. He has none because he didn't go to college. He makes a whopping $3 less an hour than me. I have 40k in loans for a virtually useless degree (well, maybe a $3/hr degree). But $3 more an hour means nothing when you're losing it all and more to Navient. He gloated, said that most bachelor's degrees are stupid wastes of time and money, basically (indirectly obviously) calling me stupid for digging myself this hole that I don't know if I'll ever be able to get out of.\n\nAnd the worst thing is that I don't think he's totally wrong.\n\nI look at two year degrees, vocational schools, community college and I wonder why the fuck no one stopped 17 year old me from signing my life away. \"You'll make more with a degree!\" they lied. \"Everyone has student loan debt, it's very manageable\" they lied. \"Having a degree will get you farther in life\" they lied. Nurses with a 2 year degree make literally double what I make. Kids from my home town started working at shops out of high school and now they're managers and make more than I do. I fucked up. I traded 5 years of my life for nothing. All the depression and panic attacks and all nighters and peanut butter sandwiches for all three meals was for nothing.\n\nI have no recourse. I have no opportunity. I can go to grad school now, sure, but that's another $60k that I'll heap onto my shoulders. It makes me want to throw up. It makes me feel trapped. But without grad school, I can't even move forward.  But then who's to say that my grad school degree will get me anywhere? I thought my bachelor's would, but look at where I (and a lot of people) are with that. My degree (a bachelor's in psychology that no one warned me was useless \"You can do anything with a psychology degree!\" I heard a million times. No. You can do NOTHING with a psychology degree.) affords no movement, no opportunity, nothing. My degree's value is maxed out at my current position - which isn't horrible, I am not in poverty, but I am still drowning in debt and I can't really adjust my lifestyle lower to pay it off faster. It's just there, choking me out every month.\n\nI have money in my bank account, I have savings - none of it is mine. Even if I had $40,000 in my bank account, I'd look at it and say \"this isn't actually mine.\" I thought my amount of loan debt was normal, but every time I bring it up with people I thought were in the same boat, they say things like \"I don't know how I'll ever pay back $18,000!\" or they have the same amount of debt or more, but they got a useful degree so they're making $80k a year.\n\nI lived with shitty roommates in shitty houses, I got grants and scholarships, I went to public schools, I got a good GPA and worked hard, I never traveled or studied abroad because I balked at the cost involved. I worked in the summer, I tried to save money everywhere I could. And fuck all good it's done me.\n\nIt isn't just the debt that gets to me. It's the fact that I've wasted so many years of my life for nothing. That I was promised prosperity and lied to, that no one stopped me along the way and said \"Wait! Is this the best choice?\" That I can't even fight back when a coworker calls me stupid because it's the goddamn truth. That I'm still struggling with things when everyone around me seems to have it more together. That I can't possibly live the comfortable (not even fabulous!) life that I was told I'd be able to. I can afford my life now, but kids? No way. A house? Ha. Retirement? Jeez. That I somehow fucked up more than all my friends, that I somehow managed to walk away with twice as much debt as everyone else.\n\nI don't know what to do.\n\nSo yeah. I think about my student loans and cry.\n\nEDIT: thank you to the 90% of you who have been supportive and encouraging, I needed it :) I'm going to stop reading comments for a bit because I'm dealing with some pretty horrible people in my inbox and stuff \n\nBut also, there have been a few concerning comments about killing yourself because of your student loans. Please don't look at it that way! I know it is a seemingly insurmountable scary thing but your life is worth much more than your income or debt. I hope you can reach out to a friend or someone in the comments (or me) to help with what you're going through.",

        "original": "Kinda long, so a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nContext:\nI\u2019m 18, my boyfriend and I just secured our first flat together because we\u2019re both going to the same town for uni. All our payments are due August 17th and we both have to pay about \u00a31000 each. We both work, earning around \u00a3700+ per month. Due to us both having just done exams, we haven\u2019t worked much the past 2 months so our upcoming pay is going to be like \u00a3200 if that. The problem here is my work pays a month behind, so my June-July pay is coming on July 23rd which will be the tiny amount from exam season. The July-August pay, which for me is about \u00a3750, is coming August 23rd. And then the subsequent August-September pay (of similar value) will come in the middle of September. Both payments will not make it to me in time for the August 17th deadline for the deposit.\n\nThe initial solution:\nMy parents are a little more well off than my boyfriend\u2019s parents, so my mother agreed to be our guarantor. She also said she\u2019d help out with the deposit - we\u2019d make as much money as we could and she would help pay the rest and then we could pay her back. Simple enough, means we won\u2019t be late paying it, and we can pay her back as we get paid.\n\nThe problem: \nMy mother has been abusive towards me my entire life by emotionally and verbally abusing and more recently gaslighting me and generally treating me like shit, as well as using the flat as a threat (eg \u201cI\u2019ll rescind my guarantor status and then you\u2019ll be in trouble!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll make sure they kick you out if you mess up\u201d). As of today, following an argument, she claims that our relationship is over and she wants nothing more to do with me, and is trying to kick me out. The kicking me out part I can deal with, because I\u2019m leaving in a month anyway. But my boyfriend and I are no longer going to have that financial safety net for our deposit. I WILL NOT have anywhere near the \u00a31000 needed on August 17th. A week later i\u2019ll have \u00a3750 of it but not all of it for another month. I can\u2019t ask other family as I have no other family and my mother will prevent that anyway. Can someone please give me some options because I\u2019m p scared right now that we aren\u2019t going to be able to pay in time. \n\nTL;DR - need \u00a31000+more for flat deposit, my mother was going to help pay and now isn\u2019t.

The termination is a culmination of drama between the owner of the trailer park and myself. My dad and I are both on the title so I could qualify, but I made enough to make the payments myself, and I make even more now. It's been fairly smooth sailing since I got my trailer and with strict budgeting we've made it work. I was and am proud of myself for getting my son and I a place. I can go into the details of the drama if needed, but I think that might be a case for /r/legaladvice. \n\nTo make it short: My dad and I are on the fence about suing this owner for harassment. She had only called me one time and chewed me out for a mistake that was made with their management team, never apologized, and now only calls my dad about anything to do with me or my home. \n\nI'd rather just put that on the back burner for now because I got a large raise, and now I make too much money for any government assistance. I got about $130 for food and $370 for daycare, now I have $500 in monthly bills and I am only making about $200 more monthly. I have to budget in for $300 more a month that I guess I'll just have to pull out of my ass. I am currently cutting down any unnecessary bills. I am still paying off student loans, and with the sale of my trailer should cover the remainder.\n\nWhat I'm scared about is finding a new place. Rent just blew up in my area. $500+ per bedroom, and I pay $520 for my trailer right now. So no way will I be able to afford an apartment. Ugh. Fine. I'll admit it. I also have a dog (we've got the whole emotional support paperwork and such) and a cat I got as a Christmas present. I've also been caring for 2 extra cats that were dropped on me. One that has bonded with my kiddo (sleeps with him/on top of him every night), and one that I'm quite certain will get put down if I can't take care of her. So you can see my dilemma and potential heartbreak with that situation. I'd consider calling the acquaintances that dropped off the cats, but they can't take care of them either. An extra bag of cat food didn't put me in the red, and I have veterinary connections that allowed for me to not worry about expenses. If you wanna hear my sad cat stories I got a couple.\n\nMy parents know of my situation, and will try and help me the best they can. They can't house me, but my dad said he'll try to help me with this next months housing payment.\n\nI guess this is more of a rant than anything. I'm super stressed and very upset and worried about where or what will be our next permanent housing situation. Even without the pets, I couldn't afford an apartment here. I'll have about $10k from selling, but who knows how long that's going to last especially without a permanent living situation set up.\n\nI'm considering moving out of state to a place where there isn't a huge housing boom, and most states pay my profession more than the current state I live in. Fucked, isn't it? \n\nAnyway. Thanks for letting me rant Reddit. If you can think up any solutions that might help let me know.",

        "original": "Please be understanding when reading this. I am 38 years old. Turning 39 in October. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder at the age of 12, and been on SSI since the age of 13. In 2015 my mother fell ill and sadly had to go to a nursing home. My father had many issues, drinking and gambling, and we could no longer afford to stay in N.Y.C. any more. The rents were too high. We moved to South Florida via a family friend. I was 35 at the time. I saved a few thousand dollars for emergencies, plus sold some stuff, along with my dad helping. We moved into a very cheap rental. 55+ Community. Florida is very different than N.Y.C. obviously. There, we had public transportation around the clock. Here, you need a car for everything. Luckily there's a small bus that takes you shopping, to the bank, etc; so you could live. My father's health started to decline, as he changed down here in Florida. He gave up the drinking after almost dying and thankfully being saved, and the gambling as well. Still, we just had just enough money to get by. Always did, as that's how I grew up. Suffering from my anxiety, I never held a job, never could even afford a car, so didn't bother learning to drive. I had some friends back in N.Y.C; but we've grown apart over the years. I am very sociable online, and once I get to know you, and feel comfortable, I am social. Anyway, on to what brings on the pending homelessness. As of August 1st, my landlord wants me out, as my dad passed away in the middle of June, and I could no longer afford the rent and bills, nor, afford living in a new place, just collecting SSI checks. I could pay the rent here for only 1 more month, but then I'll be broke. Everyone wants someone fully employed anyway. For the past month I've been searching for housing in Palm Beach County, where I currently reside. There is nothing. One shelter, and you first have to be homeless to apply, and the wait could be months. It's only temporary too. I got so desperate to go to see a halfway house. It was so dirty and bugs everywhere, and very sick people. One guy bothered me, and I ran home. They wanted rent there as well. I wouldn't leave a dog there. I am so scared. I have the emergency hotlines telling me how backed up everything is, and preparing me for the streets. I feel like such a failure. This is the my fault. If I was stronger with more motivation, I would have gotten a job and away from a not so great family situation years ago. I take medicine for my anxiety, and fear that I could die in the streets. I have no family or friends that could take me in. Very little family actually. I don't know what to do. I'm so scared. Being homeless is dangerous. Any advice/support would be much appreciated. Thank You so much for taking the time to read this.\n",

I've been homeless and pregnant due to bad relationship situations but i have always been great with money. I can make a dollar streach.\n\nI know how hard it is to not not have a lot left over after your expenses. To not be able to see a light at the end of the tunnel. We dont have a lot of money still but we have a consistent income now. \n\nSome tips that might help. \n\n1# Pay Extra.\nIf its 5 dollars of 10 dollars a week. It can help. You might not have an emergency fund (that siund be a goal). You might skip a coffee or get a good deal. Over pay your bills. \n\n Example #1 . I paid my internet bill this week by an extra 5 dollars. Next month I'll pay the full amount as normal or extra and build up a credit. That way if something comes up or goes wrong i can just pay whatever is left. \n\nExample #2. Ive been paying an extra 10 a week on my rent for the last 2 months and now im 80 dollars in credit. Im going to keep going until i have a full weeks rent (and then a full month) or until i have to use that credit in a tight week or in an emergency. It also keeps my landlord very happy. \n\n2# Stash the Cash\nSave your coins even if its 5c or 10c at a time. It adds up. It doesnt seem like much it doesnt hurt the budget too much. Stop using coins, your more likely to stop and the think about if you really want something if you have to break a note.\n\nWe have just bought a coin tin thats around 45cm (roughly 1.5 ft) tall and 20cm round. That is our house fund. When it is full I'm going buy a cheap bottle of wine and make pizza, sit down to cut it open and count it out into deposit bags and take it to the bank. \n\nI hope this helps. \n\nEdit. \nI also have an emergency fund. Savings accessable and on hand. I also get paid weekly so im not far off a paycheck. \n\nEdit 2. An expample where this has really worked for me was ehen i had both my kids abd was in hospital i didnt have to worry about oh no the power bill is due tomorow or our phone is due next week. I had a whole months bills paid ahead of time and i was able to focus on being a new mum until things had calmed down a bit. I aslo had savings aside.\n\nAlso i keep a ledger of bills due, amounts paid, balances and dates so i have a record and everythong is done online so there is a paper trail. \n\nLoan wise the only loan i have with interest is no benifit for me to pay out early so im leaving that alone but any other debt is 0 interest.

I\u2019m in dire need of some help and I don\u2019t really know what to do.\n\nMy situation is kind of complicated but I\u2019m gonna try to make it as simple and efficient as possible lmao. \n\nUp until last year, my grandpa lived with me and help me with the bills but he passed away in July 2017. He did leave me some money but unfortunately that is all gone.\n\nIt\u2019s currently myself, mg partner, and my son. I\u2019m 25. My partner is 24.\n\nI graduated college in December 2017.  She graduated college in May 2017. My son is 4. \n\nI work full time I make about $850 twice a month. She is currently working only part time bc we don\u2019t have reliable childcare. Right now we are working opposite shifts and we get her mom to watch my son for the couple of hours if overlap. Her paychecks aren\u2019t even enough to cover her car payment and insurance right now.\n\nI did apply for childcare assistance but I\u2019m waiting to find out if we got it. My son has CHIP and my partner has Medicaid. I\u2019m covered by my employer insurance and it\u2019s actually great insurance, with no monthly premium and only a $500 deductible. \n\nI don\u2019t qualify for food stamps, cash assistance or basically anything other than their medical, and possibly childcare assistance (waiting to find out)\n\nI own my house and two vehicles (one that I drive, one is currently out of commission but we were letting her mom use it to come back and forth to babysit (we live like 45 mind away from her and she doesn\u2019t have a vehicle).  My partner is still making payments on hers and she pays her own car insurance.\n\nHouse-$350/month\nCar insurance-$250/month\nPhone-$230/month for two phones\nElectric-$250+/month\nWater, Sewage, Garbage-$90/month\n\nCredit card 1- $170/month, total balance is $5113\nCredit card 2-$250/month, total balance is $4207\n\nStudent loans-$10 a month on an income based repayment plan, total loans are $60k\n\nMedical expenses-$275/month that my insurance won\u2019t cover\n\nIf I did the math right, that\u2019s about $1875\n\nObviously if I make $850 twice a month (after taxes) it\u2019s about $1700 so I\u2019m way over budget and that\u2019s not even accounting for food, gas, etc. \n\nAnd in the winter I have the added bonus of paying for heating oil.\n\nI\u2019ve been surviving off of the money my pap left me and then my income tax return (which I make last as long as possible to supplement my income cuz as you can see..) but now I\u2019m out of both and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nMy son goes back to school at the end of August, he\u2019s only in pre-school so like he is only there for 6 hours a day but it helps in terms of allowing my partner to work more hours or possibly get a better job. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to get more hours at work but outside of a second job I really don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nActually one thing I have been considering is my medical costs. I am on Suboxone for treatment for addiction. I honestly don\u2019t think I need it anymore to stay clean but unfortunately Suboxone is dependency forming just like any her opioid. My doctor told me today it would take me a year or more to wean off of them. I don\u2019t know how well I\u2019d be able to function if I cols turkey if but I\u2019m honestly considering it at this point bc I don\u2019t know what else I can do.\n\nOpen to all suggestions please.\ud83d\ude2b",

I\u2019m 26 years old and I live with my parents, and most of the problems in my family are not directly mine but affect me as well.\n\n\n\n\ntdlr; \n\nParents owe lots of money everywhere and have given up in life. I (26yo) struggle to do my PhD and feed them at the same time, with the fear that we might be homeless soon.\n\n\nSo as a family we own a house and a storeroom (used to be my dad\u2019s workplace artisanship). Both of these are on debt because my parents had taken rents to build them. These rents are still unpaid for at least 15 years (around 200k euro), and so the house and storeroom legally belong to the bank. My father is at the age to get his pension, but he won\u2019t get it because he owes around 40k euro at the insurance, which is too high to even achieve an agreement to get the pension and pay back slowly from that amount of money. They also owe to the power supplier, around 5k euro, and there\u2019s been lots of times that we were out of power at home for a week or so.\n\n\nMy father is old and he can\u2019t work anymore, he does small jobs like gardening and recycling. My mother is around 50 years old, and she does cleaning jobs, which is usually 50 euro per month right now. \n\n\nAs far as I know, the solutions that my parents have right now are 1) pay 500 euro to create a protection file for the house (there is a law that protects the first house so that we don\u2019t end up homeless) and 2) try to sell or rent the storeroom. My parents can\u2019t do any of those, because they have been defeated by life.\nAs for me, I\u2019m doing my PhD and work part time. My job gives me 50-350 euro per month depending on the work I get and the season. This is our food and internet money.\n\n\nIs there any way to help my parents and/or myself to have a better life? I dream of leaving home, but that needs a stable income, which means a stable 8 hour job, which means no PhD. \n\nDo you think I should stay home and feed my parents until they die?

        "original": "Hi Everyone. Throwaway account here, looking for some hopeful information in what seems to be a helpless situation.\n\nI'm 23 y/o looking to pay my last year of college. However, I'm in a very strange situation. Let me sum up some stuff real quick.\n\nI transferred into my current university last year. I was 22 y/o and my mother was eligible for a parent plus loan in addition to a small scholarship and other federal aid. Now, considering I'll be turning 24 y/o soon, I am considered an independent according to FAFSA. Therefore, I am not eligible to receive a Parent Plus Loan as I am no longer a dependent.\n\nAfter calling FAFSA, they informed me to remove my mother from my FAFSA form and then have my university re-pull from FAFSA so they can review my reward to determine if I need an increase. I had to wait a week for all to be updated. After waiting the week, I called my university and they informed me that they didn't look at my parental information anyways due to my age... Thus, no change in financial aid.\n\nHere's the tough part. FAFSA requires the prior prior year tax information which is 2016. In 2016, I worked for a company that paid me about 45k a year. I was making decent money, a lot of which was saved but is slowly dwindling as my father passed away and I was helping my mom out with a lot of finances due to his passing. With that being said, because I made said money, I am unable to receive enough federal aid to pay for this school year.\n\nAfter speaking with FAFSA, I informed them that I haven't gotten paid that sum of money in a year. They informed me to provide my university the pay stubs of my current job so that they can re-evaluate my financial aid. Side note. I currently work at my university making below $15/hr and only working 12 hours a week. Therefore, last year, I made around $4k only. Moving on... I spoke with a couple financial aid counselors from my university informing that I can provide them my pay stubs proving that I don't make nearly the same money. They said that they do not consider a decrease in income as a professional judgment. Therefore, they won't review my aid. They said if I had been unemployed, then they would be able to review. I went from $45k a year to $4k. I might as well not be employed. They think differently though.\n\nI've also tried getting a private loan (despite my lack of interest). However, I am unable to get a cosigner. I don't have family besides my mother and her credit is down due to other issues. Obviously, I was not approved for a private loan.\n\nIn addition, my late father was in the military, so I applied for dependent aid but that takes up to 30 days. My university is looking for payment by the 7th of August. I may or may not be able to get an extension. Not 30 days though.\n\nI've applied for scholarships and other state aid (TAP in NY). However, that's a waiting game and of course not a sure thing.\n\nI've also emailed my university's director of financial aid asking for literally any option.\n\nThank you for reading. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\ntl;dr trying to pay for senior year of college. No chance of enough aid.",

        "original": "My parents are deeply in debt and have generally terrible financial habits. They typically have less than $100 in their checking account and they almost always have to immediately push paychecks toward debts and bills. They have at least $3,000 in credit card debt that I know of, but I suspect much more. I know all of their credit cards stay very close to the limit and they make minimum payments before quickly spending the cards back up. They still owe on their house, a car, and some hospital bills.\n\nEven with all that, my dad makes frivolous purchases. For example, my wife bought us a Nintendo Switch. When I mentioned it, he literally bought a brand new Switch and several games the next day. He regularly mentions how tight money is, and he\u2019ll often re-sell his video games and consoles at a huge loss because of it.\n\nHe also asks me for money occasionally. He used to do it about every two weeks, and for somewhere between $100 and $200. I eventually (while handing him the money) tried to lecture him a bit, pointing a lot of this out, but it hasn\u2019t changed much. The main difference is that now he only asks for money about once a month, and for $50 or less each time.\n\nThen there\u2019s their poor living conditions. They do absolutely no cleaning and nothing more than absolutely necessary maintenance as problems arise in their house. The restroom is inarguably a glaring health hazard. They could genuinely be on TV for the state in which they live. I feel terrible saying it, but I need to paint a full picture. Additionally\u2014and contributing to this\u2014over the past few years they\u2019ve taken in three chihuahua mixes with various health problems, all of which freely relieve themselves on the floor. Sometimes that gets cleaned up, sometimes not.\n\nTo the point: my dad is over 400 pounds and turns 50 in two months. I know he could die any day. My mom is also very overweight, but I think she has a good 20 years more in her. What keeps me up at night is the thought that dad\u2019s going to die and Mom won\u2019t be able to take care of herself. I love her, but she doesn\u2019t deal with their finances at all and has some nasty mental illnesses which have rarely in the past caused complete dissociative states and extreme paranoia.\n\nI\u2019m terrified because I wouldn\u2019t even know where to start if Dad died and I had to make sure Mom was able to handle things. I don\u2019t think she can. My wife and I are only 26.

I don\u2019t know how many years exactly, but I think it was between 5 and 10. Don\u2019t know if this helps.\n\nTL;DR: My dad is at high risk of dying, leaving my mom with thousands of dollars in debt, three small dogs with health problems, and a disgusting house.

College is next month and I absolutely cannot no matter what work more than 14 hours a week. How do I go forward?\n\nI\u2019m 19 and I am a college student in NY going into my 3rd year in a 5 year program. My family consists of my single mother and two siblings. Last summer, I came out and there was a falling out between my (very abusive) mother and I, so I left in September. I got a part time job while going to school to pay for tuition (it wasn\u2019t much because of scholarships and aid), and I was lucky enough to have a place to stay rent-free (generous friend).\n\nThe housing situation didn\u2019t work out by January, so after a brief stint of homelessness I found one in February where I payed about $300 a month (another very generous friend) to rent out a room. This along with other expenses and tuition left me with nearly no savings. I had already applied for public benefits but I found out my mom was still taking the out in my name with my SSN so my only options were reporting her or hounding her to remove me from the case. I chose the latter, she chose to do nothing, and eventually she told me \u201cif you come back and quit your job you won\u2019t need to apply for benefits you\u2019ll just get them from me.\u201d So I went back on April 1st. I received no support.\n\nSchool ended in May and I found out my estranged father was still alive and in a foreign country (long story) so I rushed to visit him (not the best timing, I know). I left for three months and came back last week. My mom is now refusing to let me back in the house and refusing to support me financially. I had forgone the income of a summer job to see my father (after not knowing him for 16 years) because I thought I wouldn\u2019t need it if she supported me. Now I\u2019m broke, jobless, homeless, and school is right around the corner. My friends have given all they can and I can\u2019t ask any more of them. I still don\u2019t want to report my mom, but I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll survive without benefits. Even with the benefits, I can\u2019t afford even a room in a shared apartment (absolute lowest in this city is $500 for a room, and I was working max part time hours only making $600-700 after tax).\n\nAdditionally, last semester I only had class 3 days a week. This semester I have an unchangeable schedule of 5 days a week. I tried working max hours before and it burnt me out quick, so most I can work is those two days a week with the occasional day off (maybe 6 days a month instead of 8).\n\nWhat are my options here?

        "title": "Desperately Need Direction",
        "original": "I\u2019ve made nothing but bad decisions throughout my adult life and I\u2019m so tired of being unhappy with the way my life is going.\n\nFirst: my student loans.  I had a terrible time in high school and dropped out in the beginning of my senior year, after missing almost my entire sophomore year as well.  I got my diploma and then went to community college for 8 years, taking out the maximum amount of loans during that time.  I did not get a college degree, not even a 2 year degree.  I have about a year and a half completed.  I never had any idea what I wanted to do, but going to school and taking out loans was something that was pushed on me and I didn\u2019t really understand what I was doing then. I can go into more details if needed, but I now have a balance of \\~$67,000 that is currently on an income based repayment plan with a $0 monthly payment because I am unemployed.  I have 21 years left on this plan.  I started taking out these loans in 2002 and they are consolidated at a 4% interest rate.\n\nSecond: unemployment.  My employment history is terrible.  The only jobs I have had were at clothing stores when I was a teenager 18 years ago, two bank teller jobs I was fired from, and a handful of food service jobs I was also fired from.  The last time I was gainfully employed was in 2009.  At that time, I lost my job of 5 years because of issues stemming from my depression and anxiety, and from drug use.    (I had insurance with that job but it didn\u2019t cover any mental health issues, so when I tried to get into counseling it was denied.  I even tried to go through the county, but they told me I didn\u2019t qualify because I had some insurance, and they weren\u2019t concerned with what it covered.  I was able to maintain for about a year after that before getting fired.)  At that time I moved back home because I couldn\u2019t pay bills anymore.   I had lived on credit cards and run up over 10 grand in medical bills, and declared bankruptcy in 2014.  So I still have 6 years left with that on my credit.\n\nThird: health issues.  Besides pretty crippling depression and anxiety, I hurt my shoulder four years ago on a job training program.  Long story somewhat condensed, that injury progressed into chronic shoulder, back, and neck pain and I recently had surgery but still have a lot of issues with my spine.  I am in constant pain and am constantly going to doctor appointments, including 3 hour long visits every week with a chiropractor.  I\u2019m not physically disabled enough to get disability, but I\u2019m not well enough to work full time, either.  I am also recovering from some other blood related issues that make me extremely tired.  I take a lot of medication that would be too expensive if it weren\u2019t covered by insurance.\n\nI am feeling pretty trapped.  I rely on my health insurance so much and there is no way I can go without it.  I need to continue to qualify for Medicaid or I need a job with good benefits, and a part time job like that has been impossible to find.  I haven\u2019t even seen too many full time jobs that would work, because my medical expenses are so high that I wouldn\u2019t be able to cover them initially since copays and deductibles would start immediately and I know some services and medications might be excluded entirely.  If I get a part time job without benefits, making $200 a week before taxes would disqualify me from Medicaid.  I could work 20 hours a week at a minimum wage job, but it\u2019s not a long term solution, especially if I can never take more hours or even get more than a small raise.  Even fast food places in my area are advertising $9-$12 per hour.  I had an offer for a part time job at $11 per hour, but with periods of mandatory extra hours and no benefits offered, I had to turn it down.  I looked into delivery services but my driving record is also pretty bad and right now, and  I\u2019m lucky my insurance hasn\u2019t dropped me.  My state also has work requirements for food share, so I don\u2019t even qualify for that anymore.\n\nThings aren\u2019t as bad as they could be.  I obviously have a lot of financial support from my family, but it won\u2019t last forever.  I\u2019m in my mid thirties now and I\u2019m worried about the future.  I have no idea what to do or where to start to fix this.   Sorry if this is all over the place.  It's the first time I've tried to write it all out and it's embarrassing to say the least.  I want to have something to work toward and to have goals, but everything seems so hopeless and my depression makes me apathetic about everything, so I have no real passions, hobbies, or interests.   I just know I am tired of letting life just throw me around and I want to take control, but it seems like it's too late.",

She drives like a jerk (learned to drive from me) and got 2 speeding tickets and her insurance for the vehicle jumps up from $200 a month to $400 a month in about 30 days. The car payment is $600 so that brings the total to $1,000 a month for a gas guzzler. The loan is a 7 year loan. That means if we continue paying for it we will end up spending $72,000 on it which is the exact price I paid for my house in 2011. I barely qualified for that. \n I should have known I could not make $40,000 a year with a Wife and 2 kids and afford another house- I mean new vehicle. What was I thinking? It was the 1970s and I had a right to a decent priced vehicle? Anyways....\n I was also smart enough to put down $8,000 on the car. I could have bought 2 decent used vehicles or one excellent used one for that price. That was my tax refund last year. This years entire $8,000 tax refund went to paying off 1/5 of my federal school loan.\n \n Does anyone know the best way to get out of this car loan? I already went back to the dealer to try to trade it in for a used one and they said that was a big fat NO. They were not going to finance me for any used cars. Should I just give it back to them and pay off the few thousand or so I will owe them and worry about how I can get my kids to school and get to work with no vehicle? Any help would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: I couldnt afford to pay $800 a month and was looking to get out of this earlier. The extra $200 made me look harder. Also I know I could go back to the dreaded public transportation route in a city where the bus comes every 3 hours so the important thing is just how to stop this car bill.\n\n\nEdit 2: I am thinking of possibly buying a cheap used car and letting the Jeep sit with no insurance until I can the LTV at 100%.",

I maxed out the amount you can get from undergrad due to going to a for profit school.

Private and federal. I will set up a rehab plan for the federal idk what I\u2019m going to do w/ the private. I WILL NOT CONSOLIDATE UNTIL I GRADUATE SCHOOL.\n\nShort backstory:>! When I was younger I made the most stupid decision of my life, by going to a for profit college for love. Ugh, it last 3 months. Hit MAJOR depression and dropped out. Started over academically from a JC then transferred to the state university. Because of the for profit school, I took out so many loans and I have met the max amount I can receive as an undergrad. So even when I do get my loans out of default, I can\u2019t receive any more money. I\u2019m paying out of pocket for school now.!<\n\n>!During the last semester I was enrolled in, I found out I had a brain tumor. It\u2019s benign but, boy has it messed my life up. I was a creative and charismatic individual (as I\u2019ve been told), this tumor took away all of that. I haven\u2019t drawn, taken pictures, or done anything creative in years. I became zombie-like, in a fog, everyday conversations was a struggle and holding on to relationships were really hard. I lost the little ones I did have. My memory/focus is shot to hell. And I used to pride myself on having an excellent memory. I don\u2019t wish this on anyone, it\u2019s awful. And it comes in waves, some days are better than others. I can\u2019t tell you how I got it. I\u2019ve narrowed it down to two things, when I fell down the stairs and fell asleep w/ a concussion or emotional stress from the breakup and life (not close to family at all/ very little friends). I withdrew from classes after finding out but still had to pay for them. I didn't know about medical leave yet, so I paid for them. Couldn't enroll in classes until they were paid off. I just paid them off this year since I have a steady job. Now I can enroll again. !<\n\n>!This is where the HSA thing comes in. I finally started tumor treatment this year because I have insurance w/ this job. It\u2019s not the best, but the medication is expensive and would be way more if I didn\u2019t have it. The BEST thing about this job is that they pay my premium every month! And give me $500 dollars annually towards my deductible. They also encourage me to go to school and said it\u2019s okay to take online classes while at work!!<\n\nI said all of this for you to understand that I didn\u2019t want to come off as an asshole, because I wanted this post to be a direct and to the point but I ended up spilling my guts. Sigh. I\u2019m aware of what I should do, I just don\u2019t know where to start and it\u2019s overwhelming. Here\u2019s the numbers.\n\nI make $2500 monthly after taxes and only get paid twice a month. It salary based.\n\nHSA: $3,500 (needed)\n\nCredit Card: $1,780 (bal due)\n\nTuition: $3,345 (I\u2019m not taking a full load that\u2019s why it\u2019s kind of low)\n\nExpenses including rent: $920 (I split the rent w/ someone that\u2019s why it seems low. trying to make it even lower w/ a phone plan I saw yesterday.)\n\nMy thought process is:\n\nHSA: $3,500 / 7 (payments) = $500 per check. Done in 3 \u00bd months (will be debited automatically to HSA acct)\n\nTuition: $3,345 / 5 (payments) = $669 per check. Done in 2 \u00bd months.\n\nI don\u2019t eat out much (once a month, maybe), I like to cook, and I don\u2019t go out much so it helps the budget a lot.\n\nAfter my bills are paid, every month I have a little over 1k remaining. And I want to accomplish these goals by this year. I want to start school by beginning of next year and max out my HSA by the end of November for tax purposes. I know I can\u2019t do them all, but I can at least do two by the years end. Should I put most of it in savings and then start on the others? Should I start attacking the credit card debt first? Or should I save for medical first? Or what about myself? I don\u2019t know if I should pay myself first, lower my credit card balance immensely, get started on saving for tuition, or put away something for my health.\n\nThanks for reading. Any suggestion helps. I am stressed out.\n\nI\u2019m also thing about taking on a second job, preferably online to use some skills I have.\n\n**tl;dr:**  Don't know if I should lower my credit card balance immensely, get started on saving for tuition, or max out my HSA by November for taxes and a safety net for my health.

Everything feel ho-hum now.\n\nSo I was wondering if this is just me or if other people have made this correlation?\n\n**Edit: I wanted to add a reason that I wanted to ask this is I know I\u2019ve had mild depression the last few years and want to see if this feeling wasn\u2019t just a symptom of that, though I\u2019m sure it does have a hand in it.\n\n***Edit 2: Thanks to everyone that has commented! I tried to comment on as many as I could. I appreciate all the comments and different perspectives. I\u2019m glad most understood I didn\u2019t mean poor people are lazy and don\u2019t work hard (lord knows that\u2019s not true at all), when some one mentioned burn out that term was more in line with what I had meant.\n\nI just typically call myself lazy because I could do have time to do projects when I get home but often am just exhausted and just want to eat, veg out to the TV, and go to bed.

I haven't contributed since early 2016 when I discharged from the military and subsequently also left my civilian job. \n\nRetirement 2: Teacher Retirement System (TRS) from a state university. I have not contributed since early 2017 when I left the job. I called some time last year and asked about rolling it into another account. I was told if I wanted to avoid penalties I would have to wait for 5 years of inactivity. I also am not allowed to roll any other funds into this account.\n\nRetirement 3: Employee Retirement Systems of Texas (ERS/Texa$aver) from being a state employee. I have not contributed since February of this year when I left to be a stay-at-home-parent for our brand new child since continuing to work would mean my entire paycheck would go towards childcare. However, I recently received a statement citing administrative fees are being deducted from my account. \n\nI admit, I'm 30 and I know little to nothing about retirement accounts which is just incredibly embarrassing. Every time I tried to ask financial advisors at my employers, I would be thrown finance jargon that left me more confused.

Applied for a hotel front desk job on a whim, started 24 hours a week at 10 an hour. Just got put on full time at 12 an hour and grooming for management which means I\u2019ll meet my bills.\n\nThe more important part: climbing out of the mental hole I dug myself, or was dug for me by life, depending on your perspective. Being laid off damaged my sense of self worth. Endlessly fighting to keep my unemployment benefits and assistance benefits drained me and made me hate the system. I spent more time doing that than looking for a job. 300 applications and only 3 interviews, all outside my original field, destroyed what was left of my self worth. I couldn\u2019t get a job in or out of my field because, in the opinion of three different employment experts / agencies, I was overqualified. Moving wasn\u2019t / isn\u2019t an option due to family obligations. I couldn\u2019t afford my own rent anymore and had to move in with my GF, chipping away even more at my self esteem.  I tried going into business for myself doing photography and filming (still am to a certain degree), fell flat on my face. \n\nI see a therapist (thank God Medicaid pays for it). I need to be on anti-depressants. I go on crying jags about every third day, even now that some of the exterior things are sorting themselves out. The hotel work is way below my pay grade and skill set, but it pays the bills - but it\u2019s not fulfilling the way my old job was (education). \n\nI cannot shake the feeling that everything before was a dream or a lie, and I\u2019ve always been worthless. Even though I know none of that is true. \n\nI didn\u2019t take care of myself mentally during the darkest times. I let it consume me, and now I pay the price. Mental health has a big inertia to it, and I\u2019m fighting it. But - there is a definite causation between poverty and depression. Let no one tell you differently. \n\nSo to all of you fellow strugglers out there - find ways to take care of your mental health any way you can.

        "original": "First things first, I am not trying to hun you out to some MLM pyramid scheme cult fest. I just wanted to get that out of the way. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nI think this sub is such a valuable resource for people struggling with poverty. As we all know being poor sucks. With that in mind, I hope that sharing the career steps that I took to get myself to twice my states minimum wage will help people form their own plan to get out of poverty. For me, being poor was never about not having the capability to make more than minimum wage. It was simply not knowing how to get there.\n\nWhen I was 18 my mom kicked me out. It was for the better, stuff happens, yada yada. In my first 2/3 years of employment and being out on my own I stumbled a bit. I devoted time into jobs that had no room for advancement and I avoided school. Most minimum wage jobs don't care about you. They use you, screw you over and generally are the worst jobs. If your job is demanding so much from you that it interferes with your ability to earn a higher wage you should probably look for a new job. My advise when picking a minimum wage job is to always keep you in mind, because no one else will.\n\nNight time security guards and janitorial positions are gold mines for extra time to do homework. Does working night shift suck? Yup.  It also does generally pay more and leave you a bunch of time to do homework. While working as a night janitor I was able to get my area done up to 6 hours early. That left me time for homework and even a nap before my class in the morning.\n\nMy next career move was to get some sort of certificate or less than a year schooling that would help me stop living paycheck to paycheck. I started a certified nurses aid class at my local community college. If you can pass a background and drug test then healthcare is a great field to get out of poverty with. This class took 7 weeks to complete and doubled my wage. I was able to start a job at 14.50 an hour plus benefits within 5 days of graduating my class. My place of employment paid for several certifications. I also worked night shift as a nurse's aid and was able to complete hours of homework every shift.\n\n4 months ago I applied to a position at my local hospital that I was not qualified for. The position required a class that I opted out of because money. With my experience at my first healthcare job (only 8 months) I got the job anyways. I now work 12 hour shifts 3 days a week. I make 16 an hour working nights, which still gives me time to do homework at work. Overtime is readily available and easier to do only working 3 days a week. My schedule is fantastic, plus I love my job. \n\nIn the end what I want to say is if a job isn't working for you then find something better. Change is hard, but worth it. A job offering you a poverty wage and no time or room for improvement is a job that is taking advantage of you. There are programs available in most states for free nursing aid programs and other job programs that require up to 2 years of education. Don't let a job that isn't paying you enough hold you back from bettering your life. Good luck everyone!\n\n Please feel free to message me about any questions related to being a CNA or healthcare jobs in general.\n\nTL;DR Get a job that allows you free time to do homework, nightshift security, janitorial, stocker, and so on. Use your free time to put yourself through short term schooling, certified nurse aid, plumber, pharmacy tech so on. Don't let a job that isn't paying you enough take away from the time you need to get to a livable wage!!!\n\n",

Here\u2019s a breakdown of where I stand:\n\nIncome: \n\n16.35/hr @ fulltime job\n- 3% of income goes to 401k, matched\n- 3% of income goes to health/dental/vision\n- 20% tax rate\nTotal Net per PP: ~ 980, give or take if I have a bit of OT (never more than 2 hours)\n\n2.15/hr for about 32 hours/PP plus tips at my second job - I average $600/month here, but have some months of upwards to $1000 - but I budget conservatively at $150 extra/wk\n\nTotal Net: ~$2600 for about 55/hours a week\n\nMy Expenses:\n\nHousing: $425/mo including utilities and internet (required for my job where I WFH 1/day a week) - I have a roommate as well and we split the costs 60/40 - the 40 is me (I handle all the housekeeping in trade)\n\nCar: $206/mo payment at 7.3% APR for a 2013 Honda Insight (Hybrid) - 81 of 84 months left. I didn\u2019t qualify for a lower interest rate than this, and the payments are manageable at my income. It\u2019s not ideal, but the car is in perfect shape, I can do all basic maintenance myself and have a network of reliable friends and shops to handle any repairs, as well as a warranty (which is bundled into the loan payments). I also drive 140 miles round trip 4x a month to bring my kid to and from her father and the 49 mpg average in gas is a blessing here. Prior to this car I never owned anything that cost more than $2k (Hondas and Yotas!), but my driving needs and history of freak car repairs was costing a ton in gas/maintenance. I am not thrilled with the length of the loan, but my plan is to pay half the monthly payment every pay period and round up to $125 each time, adding an extra $44/mo to my payments until I can throw more at it. Ideally, I\u2019ll pay this off in 60 months instead of 84.\n\nCar Insurance: $204/mo. This is gross. I had an at fault accident last summer when I was uninsured (had lost my job and was on my way to my first day of a new job, in fact). So, I have that accident, citation, and ensuing SR-22 working against me. Progressive has told me my rate will drop at the end of my current insurance period next month, plus I will get another discount for continued service with them. I can\u2019t do much to change this right now, but am earning back my safe driving discount slowly and may opt in to their program where I keep their device in my car to track driving habits for lower rates. \n\nPhone - $45 on a shared ATT postpaid plan with friends with access to unl. Talk/Text and about 8gb of data. I use a four year old iPhone 6 and it works fine. I\u2019m comfortable with this expense for now. \n\n$20 for Planet Fitness. I have the higher package to allow my roommate to tag along and for the option of using any location - I currently use three different PFs depending on my schedule and have found that going to the one by work on days where the 11 mile commute home is forecasted to take an hour is an easy way to avoid traffic, save gas and make use of time I would otherwise spend in bumper to bumper hell. I\u2019m also much more diligent with fitness when I am using a gym so I am comfortable with this expense too.\n\nE-Fund: currently at $150 after depleting it for replacing two tires and having to purchase Triple A AND book a hotel after a pothole destroyed me on the interstate last weekend on the way back from vacation. It was midnight in a podunk town, we were on a bridge with barely any shoulder - I was grateful for the few hundred bucks  I had saved! Currently auto transfer $25/PP into this as well as having change from purchases rounded up and automatically added from my checking account. I plan to increase my contribution to $75/PP which will put me in line to hit $1100 saved by end of year.\n\nStudent Loans: $22k total. Currently deferred until 9/1 where my IBR kicks in at $122/month. I recently went 90 days late after three years without missing. It was negligence on my part, and my credit tanked 111 points. It sucks, but I am looking forward and focusing on keeping minimum payments met for now. \n\nGas: I budget $75/mo and it\u2019s usually enough. \n\nFood: I budget $125/mo and usually stay close. I shop Aldi/Hispanic Market and Kroger discount items. I eat vegetarian at home to save on costs and am lactose intolerant, so my budget basically goes to tons of produce. In past years I had a garden but we have no yard and live in a ground level apt with basically no sunlight right now - and I don\u2019t have a lot of free time - so I do pay for fresh food and am comfortable with it. I could reduce this, but it\u2019s been amazing for my health to finally afford good food after 30 years in federal poverty. I feel alert, nourished and full. \n\nI leave $20/wk in my budget for incidental costs (HH items, replacing chargers, etc). Anything not spent I transfer to savings at the end of the week.\n\nI leave $30/PP for spending money. I\u2019m very busy and don\u2019t get out much and most of my recreation is podcasts/reading/baking. I\u2019m an introvert and prefer spending my free time at home, so this is mostly to cover invitations to lunch with coworkers or the very occasional beer after a restaurant shift, etc. \n\nCap 1 card: Balance is $450/1250 spending limit. I am paying $225/PP this month and will have this knocked out by the end of the month. I plan to keep using it for gas and paying in full every month. I opened this with an original CL of $300 6/2017 and will get another automatic increase in November. This card alone raised my credit score from 495 to 640 in a year, which allowed me the car loan. Never missed a payment, generally paid in full every month until a dental emergency popped up this Spring before my insurance kicked in/before having an e-fund.\n\n$100/mo for a payment plan to my kiddo\u2019s orthodontist for braces. This begins in September.\n\nMy total budget is $1,515 after paying off my CC this month. This leaves me with a decent chunk of money left every month now. I\u2019m currently anticipating $400 in dental work (after my insurance covers $1000), which will be paid at $200/mo - (the dentist is the co investor in the restaurant I work at and is very flexible with us in addition to offering a hefty discount on services - HUGE blessing after 32 years of life without insurance).\n\nNow, the ugly. I have around 4k in medical debt collections and a pending custody battle. My credit score is at a paltry 571 Experian/504 TU/506 EQ due to the missed student loan payments and increased DTI from the car loan. The medical debt all dates back to last May. The hospital dismissed 4k of it for their in house services, but the physicians were part of another hospital network that does not dismiss debt, and at the time I had just lost my job and wound up having to relocate to avoid homelessness and find work. At a year old, it\u2019s still ugly on my credit report. I\u2019m unsure how to tackle this or if I even ought to. Part of me wants to just let it be and work on rebuilding by continuing responsible habits with my credit lines. The custody situation is contentious and high conflict despite my efforts at mediation, and I don\u2019t see a way through without an attorney. I haven\u2019t secured one, but my workplace EAP offers a program for a free consultation and discounted representation that I plan to take advantage of once I have details figured out. I\u2019m wary of throwing money at debt while this is hanging because the other parent is well off and has made it clear he is prepared to drop bookoo money on litigation. There is no neglect present in our case, so our state program declined my case as they are overloaded. \n\nAdditionally, while my income is livable in my area (Indianpolis), it\u2019s necessary for me to work two jobs to be comfortable and build a cushion. My family all live in Maine and relocating is sadly not an option because of the custody dispute. I\u2019m tethered here and while I have a community of support, I am essentially going it alone - especially financially. That\u2019s fine. Challenging, exhausting and endless feeling at times, but I have no time to waste on mourning my hand - I\u2019m just trying to play it as well as I can. \n\nI\u2019m burnt out. I\u2019ve worked two jobs for years on top of full time single parenting. My commute between jobs on days I work both is awful - 60 minutes. I\u2019m gone from 7:30 am until 9:30 pm those days and i have four days off a month. It could be worse, but it\u2019s a fucking grind between travel time and work hours. Fortunately, I enjoy both of my jobs and have two incredibly understanding bosses who\u2019ve done all they can to accommodate me when needed. I\u2019m working towards a promotion with my company that would put me at 45k/yr which is insane to me after living under the poverty line my entire life and not yet having a degree. I\u2019m not one to bank on things before they happen, however, so I am trying to figure out my best path forward should I never move up beyond my position now. I get paid well above the area average as a tier 1 tech support agent and my office environment is fantastic. I\u2019ve made it known I want to promote upwards and have been noticed, so right now instead of focusing on trying to complete a degree, I am grinding to make money. \n\nMy questions are - how can I balance the need to rebuuld credit with the need to be proactive about this pending legal situation and the associated costs? Should I focus on paying off medical debts that are aging? Should I focus on paying down my car loan faster? My student loans are not the worst, and I feel that making minimum payments for a year or two while steamrolling other issues is best. I think I\u2019d be best served by knocking out my dental issues (I have been in pain for years), then taking advantage of the attorneys available from my EAP and discussing payment arrangements before making a final decision on what to do with the extra money every month. \n\nMy goals are realistically to stay above water and rebuild my credit to the point that I could rent my own place or qualify for an FHA loan by the time I pay off my car in (hopefully) 2022. That way I can absorb the costs of housing back into my budget and focus on student loans more aggressively. \n\nBut for now - what is the most pragmatic way to allocate my extra $900/month and what is the smartest way to navigate my collections?\n\n\n\n",

Somehow I did my math wrong, really wrong, and I now have to work 11 hours a day for the next 3 days to pay bills and do the minimum for my son's birthday. Even with 11 hours, that just covers the basics, it doesn't cover gas and other small things that always pop up. My son's birthday only makes up a small fraction of what I need to pay but his is the only thing I can actually cancel shit on because it's not like I can just choose to pay $100 less on my power bill. Biggest thing that sucks is the thing I've wanted to do with him for years is pretty much out. We could only go because he was free on his birthday but I'm not going to be able to cover my own admission, parking, and gas. I did come up with an alternative for it that's sucky in comparison but about $35 less. I'm over here trying to figure shit out and feel so shitty actually deciding to cancel things for his birthday. I'm trying to come up with some of my own possessions to sell but I can only think of one thing anyone would buy and I gotta seriously discount it if I want someone to buy it before the bill is due. 11 hours a day probably doesn't seem like much to everyone but I'm a single parent, I also have to clean the entire house before Monday and we have things we have to do Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, plus basic taking care of a kid who insists on being up my ass 24/7 and doesn't nap. My job isn't one most can do 11 hours a day at, it's very physical with carrying heavy loads across the building all day and other laborious things. I fucked up my ankle a few days ago too so I'm limping, I wanted to see a doctor about it but no time now. I'm just going to straight up collapse next Tuesday. I'll still be seriously short on money even with the extra hours.\n\nThis is mostly just me spewing everything out because I have no one I can tell about this and I'm the kind of person who can't stop thinking about this shit. Maybe I'll calm down getting it out. If anyone knows where the magic money tree is, please let me know. Oh and if anyone knows something interesting I can listen to through these long days that doesn't burn through data, that'd be great, I have plenty of memory to download to my phone. It's a loud building with machinery, we all wear headphones, my standard playlist isn't going to cut it through these hours though.\n\n\nEdit: I survived the fuck up. I sold the system for $180 then by pure luck, we got an order at work. My job has a very small commission incentive and I get $2 for each piece loaded on the truck that pay period so I got an extra $30 from that. In the end I managed to get $170 more than the minimum I needed. I canceled the big attraction and substituted something for $10 then his dad popped up and said he'd cover the food today which is absolutely unheard of with him (however the coupon I jumped through hoops for so he could get our son a special toy at the store we're going to is now being used on half brother instead which has me irked a bit). I was able to get him some balloons as a result and I'm not super stressed over the money for his birthday. ",

        "original": "I apologize if this isn't the place for this. I just need to vent.\n\nI've been married for 4 years. I got married at 18 while I was still in highschool. It's odd, it's not for everyone but I love my wife and I still do very much. Sometimes I think I shouldn't have because of the financial toll it's taken on me. \n\nThe first year I lived with my mom and was looking for apartments but they were way too expensive where I live. Being the only one who worked, we just couldn't afford it. I worked at Walgreens making 11/hr. That was my first job I picked up in highscool and it was the best I could do at the time. \n\nFurthermore, I feel like I've screwed up my life because I didn't go to college like I intended to. Instead I just worked full time at Walgreens. We were desperate to get out of my moms house so we were looking for an RV because my Dad offered to live rent free on his land. (Mom was perfectly fine with having us with her it's just mom/wife drama pretty stupid imo)\n\nWe purchased an RV for 12k and moved onto my dads land for the next two years. Basically all I paid was $300 a month and that was going to my grandma who lent us the money to buy the RV. Eventually the RV started getting problems like boiler broke, started leaking, just things that were making it harder for us to live there. \n\nIn those two years I saved up money and bought my current mobile home. I put 18k down and been paying 190 a month the last year. My car also started to break down a lot more so I wanted to get a new one because I was tired of being stranded on the side of the road. 2018 Honda Civic. Gas mileage is so much better and now I don't have to worry about being stranded.\n\nMy wife and I now both work for amazon in a warehouse both making 15/Hr yet we're still struggling. Every penny goes to bills and debt and we're left with basically nothing. I feel very drained because I feel like my life is going nowhere and im just slaving away wasting my youth paying my debts.\n\nRecently all I do is sleep and I just don't have the motivation to do anything. Like I could even afford to go anywhere. Im worried its taking a toll on her as well. We've been at amazon for a year now and that's the longest she's ever been employed anywhere. I feel like i've failed as a husband to provide for her since she has to work. She has no problem working, she actually likes it because it gives her something to do.\n\nIn the end life goes on and im just another young guy working and living in this world. I just really wanted to vent. Never have. Thanks for reading.\n\n\n\nEdit: Sorry for the inactivity I had to run some errands. To clarify we only work 36 hours a week and sometimes my wife takes voluntary time off because of the long hours. We work 3 days a week 12 hour shifts. I never take the voluntary time off but I don't mind when she does because I know it can be really physically demanding. However, since she does take the voluntary time off sometimes her paychecks are between $500-600. Also this year around February, my wife took a leave of absence from work to go back to her hometown because of a sick relative. So I had no choice but to use my credit card to help with some bills at the time. After taxes a full paycheck is around $850\n\n* Car payment- $485\n\n* Phones - $100 (T Mobile)\n\n* Wifi - $75\n\n* Electricity - $80-100 (Depends on AC usage)\n\n* Credit card- $85 Minimum (Wife puts extra when she can $300)\n\n* Rent - $650-700 (Depends on water usage)\n\n* Mortgage - $190\n\n* Insurance - $150\n\n* Groceries and gas - $250\n\nSorry I took so long to reply to all of you thank you for being so supportive about this. This is the first time I really sat down and looked at my budgets and expenses. It's difficult for me to come up with solid numbers since my wifes paychecks vary a lot but it's the best I could do.",

I wouldn't have to feel like I can't breathe, because I'm drowning in financial stress and hopefully not feel like I have to argue with my husband about money. I could even start to put a little away in savings and not have to feel like one tiny emergency will tip us over into a hole we'll never get out of. \n\nIt seems pretty clear what I need to do, but I'm not looking forward to the physical and mental exhaustion.

We definitely do not qualify right now, however, because I do not get paid maternity leave we WILL qualify once baby is born!

        "original": "Obligatory mobile formatting apology. I don\u2019t even know where to begin. \n\nMy husband and I are divorcing. I\u2019m moving out of our home with my three kids and into my mother\u2019s house in less than two weeks. I\u2019m in school full time and I\u2019ve got about a year left. I don\u2019t have a job, though I have applied for a few in our new city. Earlier this year my husband transferred his unused GI Bill benefits to me so I could quit my job and get my bachelors degree. (I had been finding it hard to get a well paying job without one in my field.) Needless to say, now that we are divorcing, my income is drastically reducing, and I need help with my budget. \n\nFirstly, I don\u2019t get 100% of the GI benefit - only 70%. So I had applied for financial aid to cover the rest of my tuition. When it\u2019s all said and done, I will be expecting just under a $5k refund. Also, for those not familiar with the GI Bill, it pays for my tuition and I receive a monthly stipend for housing/living expenses. I receive 70% of the full stipend amount for my area, and it\u2019s prorated monthly based on how many days I attended school that month. For example: in December, I will only be in school for about a week and a half, so my January 1 payment will only cover about 9 days. My plan is to set aside some of my FA refund to cover my bills and expenses during the months when I won\u2019t get my full payment amount. Also, depending on my class schedule (I had to register late and it was slim pickings), I could possibly find a side job that pays cash and work it 3 times a week. At this point, I can\u2019t work a regular job and continue school because I don\u2019t have another parent to help me with my kids. My mom is already raising my nephew and I\u2019m not going to further burden her by asking her to take care of my kids too. She wants me to finish school so I can get a good job, but she\u2019s not my live-in babysitter. \n\nI\u2019ve added up my projected monthly expenses (truck payment, cell phone, insurance, credit card payments, etc) and I\u2019ll be able to cover them with my regular income. \n\nHere\u2019s where my question lies. I recently was in a YouTube spiral and I watched a video in which a girl talked about paying down/off your credit cards and using them for monthly expenses, followed by immediately paying them off with your monthly income. I know that this requires extreme discipline and it only works if your income is more than your expenses. So, I *could* pay off my two credit cards with a bulk of my FA refund. That would eliminate some of my monthly debt, save me a ton of CC interest in the long run, and boost my credit score (which would then enable me to transfer my truck out of my husband\u2019s name and into my name, per the terms of the divorce). I could use one of my CC that doles out points for everything for regular purchases like gas, animal food, kid stuff, and then immediately pay it off with my next GI payment. And in the months when I don\u2019t get my regular payment, I use what I had set aside from my FA. \n\nI\u2019m hoping that this will not only make my monthly living less stressful, but will also boost my credit enough to enable me to buy a house with an affordable interest rate when I graduate and get a job. \n\nIs this a financial mistake? What would you do differently? \n\n**I feel like I should add that my husband is not the biological father to any of my kids. My oldest\u2019s father does pay child support, but the younger two\u2019s father does not. \n\n**also, I will be owed 1/2 of our home equity after the divorce. We discussed a couple ways that this could be paid to me, as he\u2019s keeping the house, and I think my husband might end up paying for my truck until the equity balance is met. That\u2019s $386 a month. We haven\u2019t had the house appraised yet but I project that I will be owed around $10k. I had suggested he get a loan and just pay me in full so I can pay down the truck, refinance it into my name, and have affordable payments. But I don\u2019t think the terms of any of those kinds of loans are favorable. ",

We had about $8k in savings but that has since dwindled to $1k due to various emergency expenses. We don't make the big bucks, but we get by and generally are able to stow away $200 in savings monthly if we're doing alright.\n\nWe're both in our mid-20's, and neither of us are skilled workers. I have a degree in CS but I never planned on using it because I was forced through college by my parents. I'd be willing to go into something CS-related but I've forgotten most of the programming I learned by now.\n\nNow recently, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. Haven't gone in for final confirmation labs yet, but my doctor says it's likely Lupus. I'm going into full-blown panic mode as I think about what toll this will have on our already not-so-great finances, US healthcare being what it is.\n\nMy question is, is it worth considering moving to somewhere with more affordable healthcare? We've always wanted to move, but the biggest problem is we're not skilled workers. We work as caregivers for the mentally disabled. I was hoping to find an electrician or limited energy apprenticeship in the US, but that was before my diagnosis. Now it would take years to complete, so I'm not sure if it's the best move. I want to learn a trade but I don't want to be stuck drowning in debt.\n\nAnd I suppose as a more hopeful question, do we have any other options that I might not be aware of? I just feel trapped and like I have to figure out a gameplan soon. I wouldn't even care about the debt if it was just myself, but I don't want to die leaving an enormous burden on my partner. I want to find the best option for her in the long run.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

        "title": "Car problems: Live close to work but have toddler in Midwest. Moped? Scooter?",
        "original": "Hi all. This is a throwaway account because I am about to post personal details. I would love any and all suggestions about my current situation. \n\n  \nTLDR: My husband and I live and work within 5 miles of each other in a Midwestern college town. I go on the job market for a position in academia this year and do not know where we will be living this time next year. We have a toddler and my husband's car is our primary car. I use my car to get to and from work because I often work late. My car is probably on its last legs and, even if it is not, is more costly than it is worth. We are paying for regular maintenance and insurance but we don't use it often enough, in my opinion, to justify the cost. \n\nMy car (2005 Malibu Maxx) could be on its last legs. It has been having battery and voltage trouble for years. I have upkept it until this point at around 130,000 miles. I am getting an estimate today for the current problem (bad pun, sorry). We think it is the alternator or voltage regulator but won't know until the mechanic gets back to us. On the way home from work yesterday while stopped at a stop light my car decided to not be able to go anymore. It was still on but did not work. We pushed it to the side, jumped it, and limped it to a mechanic. There are other, non-critical problems with it: the windows don't roll down and the AC needs to be shocked.   \n\n\nMy husband has a recent VW Jetta and that is our primary car. I use my car to drive from our apartment to my work (\\~3.5 miles away). I often times have to work late since I am a full-time employee and working on my dissertation and so he handles our toddler's daycare pick up and drop off with his Jetta. He also works literally two blocks away from the daycare. I refuse to have my toddler in my car because the window/AC problem and it is summer.   \n\n\nMore information: We live in a Midwestern college town. We all live and work within 5 miles of one another and there are no highways on our commute. The bus system sucks and public transit is generally nonexistent. I am \"going on the market\" for an academic position this year which means I am not sure where we will be living next year. I really would not like to buy a new (to me) car right now because if I land a job position in Boston or New York I would have to sell it at (likely) a loss to me. Once I know my employment situation for the next few years I will be more able to make an informed decision about buying or not buying a car.  \n\n\nPossible Solutions: It is possible for us to carpool and we will carpool many times a week. However, I stay late for work usually 3-4 nights/week and would miss the daycare pickup time or they would have to load back up to come and get me later in the night. There is a bus system but it would take 1.5 hrs each way with a transfer to get the 3 miles to work. It is a college town in the Midwest so the bus system is really mostly a student housing/campus circular. I have a bit of savings to get a bike, scooter, moped, or motorcycle but I am worried about the Midwestern winters coming up. Also, I really don't know where to start with any of that type of transportation and would hate to sink money into a pipe dream because I don't know much about the industry or what to look out for.   \n\n\nIdeally, I would like to see what the mechanic says/estimates and make an informed decision for the time being. I wanted to post here to get your opinion on my situation. Personally, if the mechanic comes back and says it will cost $2,000 to fix the thing (which will likely have another $2,000 expense in a few more months because it can't handle winter) I will want to sell my car and use that money to buy an electric scooter/moped/motorcycle to get me to work for when I need to work late. Then I would carpool with my partner when I work regular hours/it is cold. Our toddler would only ride in the car and not on the scooter/moped/motorcycle. This solution seems too easy though. Am I missing something? I am tired of sinking money into this car and resent even paying insurance on it. Help. ",

She is in debt to multiple credit card companies, has burned through her retirement fund over the last couple years, owes on her cell phone bill, has no insurance for her necessary medication, owes on her storage facility with most of her keepsakes, and has just been denied disability for the fourth time and is *actively* seeking out another attorney to reapply.\n\nIn the meantime, what are our options? My income seems to be too high for her to qualify for any governmental assistance and I don't believe she is old enough (52) to apply for Medicaid. However, it feels like my income is not enough to pay out of pocket for her own health insurance or her debt..\n\nI'm sorry if this is all over the place. I am trying to do the right thing, but it seems impossible to give her everything she needs while simultaneously taking care of my fiancee and my needs/wants. I'm sure I left quite a bit of pertinent information out, so please feel free to ask for clarification if needed for advice. Thank you.",

        "original": "Hello, everyone. This may be a bit of a long post, but please, bear with me as I could really use a hand with my current situation. I am going to go out on a limb and say most people on this sub are on some form of government assistance. With that being said, for those of you receiving SNAP benefits, what do you receive monthly, how many dependents do you have, and what is your income? You don\u2019t have to give specific numbers on things like income or your monthly SNAP benefit, if it fluctuates, so a range would suffice, but I would like some insight into my situation. \n\n\nI receive SNAP and used to receive the medical card. From a legal standpoint, I have three dependents which are my fianc\u00e9e, my son, and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s little brother. From a reality standpoint, I have four dependents which are the dependents listed previously in addition to my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s second little brother. Well over 50% (just a hair shy of 100%) of my income goes to feeding and sheltering everyone. I am the only source of income and I make $14.50 per hour. My son is six weeks old and we were just able to put him on the SNAP benefits last week. Before we put him on, we were receiving $58 per month. After we put him on, they DROPPED us to $37 per month. They told me I made too much money. I nearly had a stroke. Here I am, almost in the red every month by just a few dollars and cents to make sure everyone survives with just the bare necessities of life, and I get told I\u2019m making too much money and don\u2019t qualify for more assistance even with a newborn being added as a dependent.\n\n\nI am almost at my limit mentally and physically. I am always stressed to the max because of everything going on. I started doing side jobs for cash because we need the money. Between my full time job and the side jobs I do, I average approximately 75 hours per week solely working. Adding in drive times and whatever else, it\u2019s approximately 100 hours per week. It is nowhere near sustainable and I know a crash is coming in the foreseeable future. For reference, I am 23, my fianc\u00e9e is 21, her oldest little brother will be turning 19 at the end of the year, and the youngest little brother is 14. We can\u2019t afford childcare so we don\u2019t really have a plan on her going back to work any time soon. The oldest brother is a loser because he\u2019s never had a job, he dropped out of high school twice because he was a freshman at 18 years old, and he does nothing but play video games all day. I have never seen someone live on their Xbox the way he does. It is infuriating. The youngest brother is much better, but he is more interested in girls than anything right now. Neither of the brothers does any chores around the house because they are both dreadfully lazy. My fianc\u00e9e had a very tough recovery from her C-section and still isn\u2019t even fully healed so that left me to do all of the housework. I am lucky to get four hours of sleep per night. I am basically forbidden from yelling at the boys. My fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mother hates me with every fiber of her being and the stipulation for me to move in here was to take care of the boys like they were my own children. Previously, I was a homeless, unemployed college student, so I took the deal because my hands were tied; I needed a roof over my head and I wanted to be with my fianc\u00e9e and unborn (at the time) child. \n\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do because I need the help. I can\u2019t stress the word \u201cneed\u201d enough. Her family refuses to help us because of the hate they have for me and I am left to figure everything out on my own. Other than continue to work more and more until I am physically unable to do so anymore, I don\u2019t know what else to do. \n\n\nI apologize for this becoming a rant, but I needed to get that out and it felt lovely.

I worked retail for 8 years and barely made anything and was paying 80% of my paychecks to rent while going to school. It was rough and one day I decided to get a different job. I applied with the federal government and got an amazing job making 16 dollars an hour. We lived in a high cost of living city and after living there for 8 years my wife and I decided to go across the country to a place with low cost of living. I used my credit cards to pay for the moving expenses and we used my available credit for spending on food, and just basic necessities and bills. It took 4 months for me to get a job here and we paid a good chunk of everything on these cards. \n\nAfter getting a good paying job again, in a low cost of living area, we are now struggling just as badly as we were in the high cost of living area because I now pay 750 dollar minimums every month on my credit card debt.\n\nMy job is good and my credit was great before I maxed my cards. We are unable to start saving because we barely make enough to get by while also paying off these cards minimums. I have barely put a dent in these cards because they leave our budget so thin. \n\nI\u2019m current on all of our bills, but I just feel like we\u2019re not moving up.\n\nI thought about debt consolidation, but that doesn\u2019t lower that payments now, which is something we need.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m wondering from this sub is where others would go from here. I have a bachelors and two kids and we are just barely scraping by on a wage that makes me probably one of the best paid people in my neighborhood- which isn\u2019t much. \n\nMoving here cut our bills and rent in half- but the debt we accrued is taking its toll.\n\nI mainly wanted to see what others thought and to see if anybody had any insight into how to get on top of massive credit card debt.\n\nThank you for any insight!",

        "original": "I was born and raised in the United States and I am originally from Virginia. I was taught that if your are poor, it was GOD\u2019s will for you to be poor. They prayed to god but nothing happened they were still poor. So they just accepted poverty and it continued from generation to generation. Education was not an important because they were poor and it was god's will...these are the lies I was told as a child and since I was a child I forced to accept this brainwashing. As a result I was treated like a slave from the family. As a child I was forced to believe that I was supposed to take care of them because I was the only one that could read and write...And the only one that didn\u2019t drop out of school.\n\nIn order for me to change my mindset I had to get away from the people that raised me and brainwashed me into believing that I was supposed to be poor. My life has been a consistent struggle but now I am at the point where I now make more money than I\u2019ve ever made in my life. And I have to see a therapist after being brainwashed from 4 years old until I was 17 years old and is also the year I broke free. I still have nightmares and/or dreams about the people that raised me as if they are trying to convert me back into their poverty ways. The only way to break free is to get away from the people and community if you can...and focus on getting your mental health in check as it is a continuous struggle for me. Note: I didn\u2019t start having nightmares and dreams until I got rid of poverty mindset..and I started to believe in myself and that I could create the life I wanted.\n\nI went into the Army and went to college. I read a lot of books when I was in college on self help that helped me some but there was always something off and I knew I was brainwashed. I started working on myself in 2012 to 2016. It took me 5 years to get out of the poverty mindset and start living my true life. To this day I sometimes have anxiety when I am around people that remind me of the people that raised me. So I just stay away from them...because they are brainwashed washed and I can\u2019t go back to the way I use to be. I can\u2019t fix people. I can\u2019t go back to the past. I must live in the present if that means distancing myself then that\u2019s what I have to do. It\u2019s my life I choose to live the way I want and do what mentally beneficial for me. \n\nWe don\u2019t choose the family we are born into but we can choose what we do after we come of age. It is our life and our time and we must focus on ourselves to ensure continuous success. I know for some it could hard to break free from a family that brainwashed washed them into believing been poor is a way of life...it is not a way of life. Once you become an adult your life is your own and it\u2019s up to you to decide what your going to do with it. Are you going to continue to believe the lies or are you going to find another way to help yourself in this life? It\u2019s all up to you!\n\nOne of the ways I broke free is to remove all spiritual aspects from my internal programming or internal mind...and then remove it from my heart. I was brainwashed into believing god existed and that I was meant to be poor...If I was poor it was god's will. I do not believe there is a spiritual being controlling us. I don\u2019t follow a religion I only follow myself....I only believe in me! If you read above it spent five years removing the brainwashing. Everything that I\u2019ve done has ensured my success and in September 2016 my life changed for the better. I could go into more details but I won\u2019t because most people aren\u2019t motivated as I am to change or to break free from brainwashing. I have to consistently keep maintenance of myself by controlling my thoughts and believing in me not a fake being. I also see a therapist on a monthly basis to ensure my mental health is in check and that I have someone to talk to. If I have weird dreams I keep a dream Journal and discuss it with my therapist. It can take years to get over being brainwashed but I am proof that you can. Your childhood can shape your life in a worst way or in a good way...my childhood shaped my life in a bad way and it\u2019s up to me to change. And that\u2019s what I did! I am the happiest I\u2019ve ever been in my life. \n\nNote: I relocated to California in 2016 so that my daughter can get into a good college however she is still in high school and once she finish high school in 2020...she will be the second person in my family to attend college. I was the first to graduate high school attend college and graduate. I have 2 degrees an Associates Degree and a Bachelors Degree.\n",

Tonight's just one of those sleepless nights for me where I just wonder about my future and how to get out of the shitty situations I find myself in financially. \n\nI'm a senior in college and my school requires health insurance (as most do). Neither of my parents have health insurance that I can be on so I scrambled to get covered by Medicaid. With no word back from them in time I am stuck using my financial aid to cover a $1,700 charge. On top of this, my dental issues are getting worse since I grew up with parents that did not take me to the dentist often. As a result, I  have tons of cavities and recurring problems. Of course, my school's health insurance doesn't cover dental but I'm literally laying awake every other night wondering if one of my teeth will just fall out. I got lucky before and was able to see a dentist in a city about 2 hours away for free that took care of my root canal and several other issues I had but I don't know when I'll be able to see him again.\n\nAnd to top all of this off, my car is in the shop again for something that should have already been fixed already and I'm bracing for another several hundred dollar charge. \n\n\nIt just really feels like nobody understands how scary all of this is when all I have is student loans, scholarships and a library job keeping me afloat. My parents help with nothing really and I get a few bucks here and there when they can but they're probably more poor than I am right now.

We have just enough to pay our bills, but usually no more. Recently, I started working online as an independent contractor. It\u2019s not going to be a steady source of income as I\u2019m working on a project that will eventually end. What I\u2019m wanting to do with the extra money is to pay down some debt. \n\nMy question is about one of my credit cards in particular. I am a plus size person, and I have been since I was a pre-teen. So when I was younger, I got a credit card to a plus sized clothing store. The balance isn\u2019t very much, as I am diligently paying on it, but now that I\u2019m older, things have changed. I have had some major health issues that resulted in me completely changing my diet, and I\u2019ve started losing weight. \n\nRight now I am still plus sized, but it won\u2019t be long before I will no longer be able to wear anything from the store my CC is for. Also, as far as I know, this company isn\u2019t affiliated with any normal size clothing store. So my concern is that I will have a card for a store that I won\u2019t be able to use. I\u2019m wondering what should I do? I have heard that closing a CC negatively impacts your credit rating, and part of my goal in paying down our debt is to raise that rating. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!",

Any advice would be great.\n\nEdit 1 : I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed at the moment and will check back in later this evening or tomorrow. I really appreciate the advice you've all given me so far. It's definitely comforting to have help and be given advice right now. Thank you !\n\nEdit 2 : We live in San Joaquin County in Central California,US. If it helps to understand the situation.\n\nUPDATE - We'll be moving into a hotel tomorrow. The cheapest we could find will costs us $2,080 a month and we roughly earn $3,000. During this time we'll be trying to continue to add to our moving fund and work out my grandmother's record situation. Also my sister has decided it to be best if she went her own way and has an interview set up for a second job. She hasn't decided if she'll be living with us at the end of all this. We've also talked our brother into finally seeing a doctor and will be looking into applying for Disability.

My sister and I are currently waiting for FAFSA and Pell Grant to kick in to buy is some time if needed. \n\nI'll be working for the next 8 days straight but will definitely keep thinking about and researching everything I've been told by you all.

I grew up in a poor, dysfunctional family consisting of a single, mentally ill mom and an older sister.\n\n-Single mom doesn't have a job, always relied on an \"acquaintance\" all of our lives to support us, and since college I have not lived with her. We've struggled a lot but at least I am not a financial burden to her anymore.\n\n-Older sister suddenly ran off to another country a couple years ago, and has never disclosed the details as to why. From my spotty knowledge she has changed jobs and apartments a few times now, and has asked my mom for money to help pay for the expensive apartment deposit (in asia, I believe it's called key money?). Mom took on a $5,000 debt to help her but this has taken a toll on her emotional health.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, they've both turned to me for money recently since I've been earning stable income:\n\n * Mom fell for a scam that demanded investing a lot of money for a \"big return\" (I don't know much because it's none of my business) and has trashed her credit, sold her car, and pawned off items to pay by a deadline. She is bad with technology, is easily influenced by scammers, and I've grown tired of warning her because she never listened to my words while growing up. I \"lent\" her $4,000 in total with the full understanding that I will not have it returned.\n\n * My sister has previously asked for $300 to help pay the costs of something she broke at work and has no one else to turn to for help. Now, she is asking me to send her $2,000 for another apartment contract she is signing onto. When I demanded to know why she's doing this, she says she is not feeling safe at her current apartment and needs to move. She insists she will pay it back eventually, when she hasn't even paid me back the $300 I lent her or the $5,000 my mom took out for her.\n\nWhat should I do? Or would would any of you do? I can send my sister the $2,000, but I'm really reluctant to because this is my emergency fund and I'd be living paycheck to paycheck afterward which is something I'm trying so hard to avoid. Am I heartless if I say no?\n\nWe're a very estranged family, but try to remain loyal to each other since we have very little connections elsewhere. It feels like I can barely manage to build up a few months of savings before someone comes and asks for money. I'm very tired of this.\n\n*Edit: words*\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the comments. I needed to know what was considered an appropriate response, and what wasn't. I'll think on this a little longer... I'm the type that at least tries to look at all my options.",

        "original": "Throwaway account. I haven't been able to admit this but my finances are in shambles.\n\nOn mobile, sorry for the wall of text. TL;DR: I have ADHD and no plans for the future. I have no self control with money. It's hard to admit this but I know nothing about money and I need help.\n\n~~I know a lot of people truly live in poverty because of health problems, lack of a support system, problems due to the economy or job market, and so on. I am against Capitalism and libertarianism and I am not a fan of this country. I can't stand it when people gaslight poor people. I'm afraid to admit what I'm about to admit because I know some people will have an attitude of \"just quit buying coffee every morning and maybe then you can afford a house!\" It is also popular in the media now to insult millenials and put a lot of blame on then for things. At the risk of adding fuel to this debate, I need to come clean.~~ Edit: I still stand by what I said, but it's not 100% relevant.\n\nI do have ADHD and I'm realizing that it's probably a bigger problem for me than I am aware of or want to admit. I can't focus well, I have a dozen different hobbies and interests, and I didn't do well in school. I'm smart and I can learn quickly but I also have trouble remembering things. I also suffered from depression, suicidal ideation, and PTSD for years. I was never taught how to handle finances, and when you're depressed and suicidal you don't really care about the future. You indulge in whatever you want that day, whether it be food or shopping or whatever makes you feel better. I'm not depressed anymore but I also still have no clue what to do with my future at the age of 27. (I did graduate high school in 2009 so who knows if whatever I picked would have worked out anyway.)\n\nI'm not here to blame the economy or my mental illnesses for my problems. I take responsibility for the bad choices I've made as an adult. I just think it's important to put it into context and provide all relevant information. I need to fully explain what I have overcome and what I still have to overcome.\n\nI have little to no self control with money. I've been living paycheck to paycheck for 8 years. I did go from an $8/hr job to a $12/hr job in this time. I don't make enough to pay for a mortgage or apartment, or car payment, or health insurance. Those things are out of the question. I make too much for Medicaid. My credit score is in the 500s.\n\nI am $27k in debt from student loans. I have a few job skills but they're in things that don't pay well and/or aren't in high demand. I've tried other fields of work and study but not much works out. I'm debating on going to trade school because I know I need to find a career and make more money. No matter how frugal I am, I can't live off of this amount of money forever. At the same time, I need to kill these bad habits and learn self control.\n\nHere is an example. Just this past weekend, I got paid. Immediately I went shopping. I didn't buy anything expensive, I do love thrift stores and clearance racks. But I bought clothes I didn't need. There's no predicting what I will buy so I can't just make up a rule like \"no more buying clothes.\" I love clothes, makeup, thrift stores, art supplies, cosplay, music, going to concerts, books, all sorts of stuff. (This is where the ADHD makes everything more difficult.) I have bills to pay and I should set aside whatever money I can. I just don't have the self control. It would help if I had goals in mind to encourage me to save money. But I don't have that, either. I just can't stop myself from the indulgences that make me happy. It's a leftover habit from the depression I dealt with for so long.\n\nI'd like to add that my health is in jeopardy, too. I'm 80-100 lbs overweight. I have no major health problems... yet. This is because I had no self control with food, either.\n\nThere are a few good things in this story: I have no kids, don't want them, and have a solid birth control method. So that won't be an issue. The few things I have managed to put a stop to are eating fast food and drinking soda. I haven't had those things in 2 months. I also have been keeping up with my student loan payments, even though I haven't really put a dent in them.\n\nI can't do this anymore. I want to be on the right track with my health and my finances by the time I'm 30. I'm not expecting to buy a house or anything like that, but I just wish I could save money.",

There\u2019s a reason I moved away from my family at 16. I\u2019m gay and they love me as long as they don\u2019t see it. So I NEED my freedom. I\u2019m coming up on a year being single and living here I feel I have to hide my life and it\u2019s just depressing not being to live my full self and well I\u2019m just ready to meet some people and do the things adults do.\n\nI\u2019m literally rebuilding my life from nothing. I have very few material possessions after my ex of 4 years kept everything we owned and going through a flood back in June.\n\nI have roughly 15k in credit card debt. I\u2019d like to get 5k of that paid off and have at least 2k saved up (emergency fund and moving expenses) and I want to try and either save up and buy everything when I move or buy things here and there so when I move I need it.\n\nI\u2019m just not sure where to start. I need all the basics again; bed, furniture, dishes, pots and pans, I mean I\u2019m starting from scratch.

I thought I would share what plans I have come up with to fix my finances and my spending problems, and getting help for my ADHD.\n\nMy diet is still doing just fine so far. Still no junk food or fast food or pop. If I cut down on my spending, I'll be able to cut down on caffeine too. I came up with a rule and I will go cold turkey on it: on days that I'm not at my second job or at a social event, I will go to the gym. It will help my restlessness and boredom in addition to helping me become more healthy and lose weight. (There is no way I can do all three in one day, I don't have the time and I'm on my feet enough as it is.)\n\nI'm leaving my debit card at home so I can't go on random spending sprees. It's working so far. I have a secured credit card that has a very low limit, $200. I don't use it often because I don't want to pay interest on it, so I might use that card for my spending money budget. It'll discourage me from spending too much on clothes or hobbies.\n\nI opened up a savings account and I can do online banking on it now. I want to put aside $1000 in it by the end of the year. I can probably have at least $2000-3000 in it by next summer. I also am switching all of my bills to autopay, on the ones that let me do so. I already did it for my car insurance and I just did it for my student loans. Next is my phone bill. Lots of times, companies will give you a tiny discount for being enrolled in autopay. Like $5. Plus this will force me to not drain my bank account needlessly.\n\nOne of my friends showed me a program my state has for people who make too much for Medicaid but not enough for health insurance. He's going to help me apply for it when I see him this weekend. I'll start there and hope they cover mental health services too.\n\nI have a new phone since I made that post (didn't have a choice but to order one, my old one wouldn't charge) and I'm not putting any social media or anything distracting on it. My ADHD makes me constantly bored and I want to either multitask everything or sit there on my phone too much. I want to learn to deal with my boredom. I don't want to be one of those people who is constantly on their phone. So there's another habit I will try to break.\n\nI still have no idea what I will do with my life in the future or if I will join a trade or whatever.\n\nThanks again everyone!

My girlfriend and I just graduated college, between the two of us we have about $10,000 in savings and $50,000 in student loans, which will start gathering interest in December. I got a job at a preschool but it pays minimum wage. I can commute from my parent's house for a few months but we need to move to the city when things settle down. (Neither of us can drive, and we can't keep asking my mom to drive us around for much longer.) My girlfriend has a retail job near the house and she's looking for a job in the city, but hasn't found anything yet. I'm thinking that she might not get anything until we move out and she has a local address.\n\nI know if we're paying rent and other expenses money is going to be *very* tight. I was thinking of applying for SNAP benefits once we move, but we have too much in assets right now. But we need to start paying our student loans soon anyway. If we put the majority of our savings towards student loans we can qualify for SNAP benefits, and we might end up paying less in interest down the road. I'm a bit worried about using up so much of our savings, but I think it might help us save more in the long run. Thoughts?\n\nEdit: I guess I worded this poorly. I'm not just considering snap benefits to avoid paying interest, but because even if I work 60 hours a week it won't be enough to cover rent, utilities, student loans, medical costs, and groceries. I'd like to use what I have saved to repay some of my loans before interest accrues. If I don't and I have to use my savings for groceries, rent, etc then soon ill have no savings and still loans to pay, but now with interest.\n\nEdit: neither of us can drive due to medical conditions. Right now my mom is driving us both to work, which is why we have to move out. Its embarrassing but we didn't have any other options, and were trying to move out so we can be independent.",

I am currently on both SSI & SSDI and bring in less than $800/mo. At my age permanent disability is pretty rare except in extreme cases so I'll be up for reevaluation in several years (so no chance of dismissing my student loans under permanent and total disability). While I hope to have improved by then, there's no guarantees. Working even part time is not physically feasible for me right now and my big fear is continuing to put everything into getting better only to improve just enough to no longer be disabled but not be well enough to work full time and support myself, thus thrusting me back into homeless, again. \n\nSSI has a $2000 asset limit so I can't really save and and any future income would directly affect (reduce) my benefits. There's also strict rules for cash gifts and fundraisers. The interest rates on my loans are monstrous and what were originally two $11k loans has morphed into over $30k debt that just keeps growing at a rate of $100+ a month even with payments for a degree I wasn't even able to finish.

        "original": "Earlier this year I was fired from a terrible job. Sadly, I thought it was my dream job & would move me forward in my career, but mngmt was horrible/nonexistent, everyone was set up to either fail or throw whoever they worked with under the bus, and I should\u2019ve left the place months before (the primary tip I got from a professional career coach I saw while I worked there was \u201cExit Strategy!\u201d )\n\nThe job definitely eroded my professional confidence. I had a direct manager who was explosively angry if I made a mistake, but just as often complained I was too slow or bad at my job if I asked for too much direction or couldn\u2019t figure out some inexplicable task. BUT I fooled myself into thinking things had improved and then was suddenly fired after taking a week off for a death in the family (by the senior manager who 3 wks prior told me how great of a team player I was and how invested she was in having me there because they needed more people like me in the company).\n\nI pulled myself together and found a contract gig with a small company a within a few weeks, but this did eat into the bit of savings my spouse and I had started building. We also put our plans to tackle paying off debt on hold since my paycheck from the new job isn\u2019t regular (the date & amount we get paid varies based on the length of the project assigned). AND our 2017 taxes ended up being 4xs more than expected so there\u2019s a bit of additional stress (Federal\u2019s on a payment plan, but state has to be paid off in the next 3 mos).\n\nAfter my last job being so bad, I\u2019ve been guarded but cautiously optimistic about my new job. It\u2019s similar work but a different model, nice company and people, and even though it\u2019s not where I want to be long term, it\u2019s a much slower pace that I kinda needed after all the bad. Based on my review last month I had started to hope that I would get a full-employment offer soon, but a few days ago I was told that they loved me and I was great, but they weren\u2019t going to have more projects at my level to assign after I finish my current one.\n\nI think I\u2019m kinda in shock... my spouse works full time, but I figure drastic changes should be made to the monthly budget/expenses ASAP. Since we just started building our savings back up again, there\u2019s barely a month before I need to find a new job. So...\n\nQuestion #1: What should I do to try and make things work financially while I\u2019m trying to find another new job in less than a year?\n\nQuestion #2: Should I be looking for a different type of job altogether? After first being fired (even if it was a sh*t company) and then basically being told I wasn\u2019t good enough/fast enough/smart enough to tackle more complex projects at the new job, I\u2019m worried there\u2019s something wrong with me.\n\nWhich brings me to Question #3: Considering the fact that we need to cut back on expenses and I need to find something in a month or less, is it a reasonable expense to go back to a career coach right now? Is there any way that I have enough time to rethink my career goals and figure out what else I want to do AND find a new job?\n\nSorry that\u2019s so long, but hopefully enough detail to help get any possible suggestions! And 100x thanks for whatever anyone has to offer!!",

It's interpreted as \"you don't want to spend time with us.\" I've asked for advice before and was criticized for not spending money because sometimes that's what you have to do to spend time with others. \n\nAre those of us on a budget seeking to make friends screwed?

Please go seek care  now if you any potentially life threatening symptoms. If you have something that could be potentially serious then get your ass to the ER now. They are legally required to treat you until you are stabilized if its serious, just try to go public versus private hospitals. Just search and go until you get checked out. I just left the hospital ICU after visiting an uninsured friend who was admitted the other day. She had a swollen leg for a few days and didn't go to ER until her family member who is a nurse told her to go to the ER asap based on symptoms she described. If she waited any longer she would be dead! She had a big blood clot in her leg that spread near her lung and heart. Stints were put in last night. If she had waited even less than a day she would've fucking died. Fuck the financial worries and fuck our healthcare system. I just FB'd live with her so she could talk to her baby before having another procedure done. If she hadn't gone I would have been holding a motherless baby at that moment. How fucked up is our healthcare that it nearly kills people b/c they won't go due to fear of costs b/c they know they may get care but will be screwed over once the Bill's come due. Sorry but I am still in a rage over how this could've turned out. I've always hated this system but I've always had jobs with insurance.

So if anybody is able to give me advice on how to support myself for the next few years, that would be so appreciated!\n\nRight now, scholarships pay for my entire tuition, so that isn't a worry. The real worry comes from making sure my bills are paid, my car is repaired, and that I'm not neglecting my future. I took a huge risk, and relocated to the other end of my state after finishing at a community college. The cost of living is so much lower here (I used to live in my state's capitol), but still hefty. I just accepted a part time job in my field that is fantastic for my resume, and has options to move up when I have another degree or two under my belt. However, this job doesn't allow for me to pay all of my bills right now.\n\nI took out my subsidized loans, and after figuring out paying off my credit card and repairing my brakes, there will be nothing left until next semester. My big question here is if it would be a better idea to take out my unsubsidized loans or pick up a second job (putting me at 50 hours a week plus full time school) to have a security net? If I take out my loans, it gives me a better chance to do well in school, as I've also been offered an outside internship that might get me to my dream job in a few years. But, the debt is terrifying in the event I can't get a well-paying job after school, since I'm entirely on my own.

No one else can just do my job. They needed a full time employee. My income went down to less than 1/2 of what I was making quickly. As of October 1st I will be on early maternity leave, due to my OB ordering me to rest so I don't go into early labor. So there will be no income after that.\n\nBills got out of control. We maxed our credit cards on daycare bills (keep in mind I'm still working 3 days a week) After October 1st, the kids won't be attending. But we still owe the daycare money. \n\nApparently we owe taxes to the state we used to live in... only $500 but we don't have it. 4 years ago we applied for SNAP after I had my oldest son and used it for the 12 weeks I took for maternity leave. That state wants the $700 back because of a mistake on their end. I have spent hours on the phone talking to numerous people in that horrible state. Whoever approved our SNAP file should have only given us $450 dollars for the three month period. So we have to pay ALL of the money back. \n\nWe owe like 10 months of HOA dues. I don't even know how much. I think $770. \n\nOur car note and insurance was totally manageable at $400 before all this happened. Now I get to decide if I drive or eat.\n\nDay to day bills are constantly due or late. \n\nOur mortgage is $1800 a month. No, we don't live in a fancy neighborhood, just the west coast.  \n\nRelevant Work Experience, Work Situations - \n\n* My husband has been working cable install for three years. He has prior years of consistent work experience. He is a USAF veteran and worked ground radio and communications. He makes about 2,500 a month after taxes. Sometimes less. \n\n* After my 12 week maternity leave, I will not be able to return to a full time position unless one becomes available. And it could be years. Months. A day. There is no guarantee one will open. I will look for another job obviously, but I will not make much more unless I go back to college and finish my degree. I made about $2,700 a month after taxes. Now it's about $800 a month. After Oct. 1st, it will be zero until January. I can't go back to work until then because in addition to recovering from birth, I will also be recovering from surgery that I will need at 2 weeks postpartum.  \n\nI'm at a loss as to what to do. I feel like we're going to lose our house. Our car. I cry everyday about this. I don't know what else to say to my husband. I've suggested him traveling for work, applying at the DOD, suggesting he work offshore, His father said he should join the union he is in... BUT husband would need to take a math class (that we can't afford and honestly, I set up his fafsa and got his application done for him he never followed through with it)  Husband says he applies to at least one job a week. He's had four interviews since Nov. 2017. I don't know what to say or do. Should we sell our house? Sell the car? I'm at a loss. We don't have cable, our cellphone bill is as low as it can be, I coupon and shop at Winco (super cheap grocery store) is there anything else I can do? \n\nMy mother keeps telling me to have the baby, get my surgery done and then take the kids and move back home with her... which might happen simply because we can't fucking pay our mortgage. Not because I want to. My mom is livid because she always thought my husband was \"mooching\" off me and this \"confirmed it\" for her. Full disclosure - after he got out of the military, he basically lost his mind and became a raging alcoholic. I quit college, moved him closer to his parents for support and worked full time while he was trying to get sober... usually failing to get sober. He drank a lot. I took care of him, mostly alone because his behavior alienated his family we moved to be near. So now that I'm really sick and pregnant AND things aren't working out for us, my mom thinks it's his fault for not stepping up. My mom has also made some pretty wild accusations.  **edit: he stopped drinking in 2013. Before we even had kids**\n\nAny advice is welcome. Job advice. Life advice. Bill advice. I just don't know what to do anymore. Thanks in advance, I will try to reply and answer questions. ",

Few months ago things were looking very bleak forcing us to consider returning to our country. Then we had some very promising interviews with a prospect of very modest increase in payscale.\n\nThen, the HR dropped a bomb on us that even under expedited visa processing, it will take anywhere from 6-9 months for us to be able to start working. In another university, I was told to expect a 4 months of wait. Worse than that, I was told that it might take longer and I still might be denied a visa because the current administration is extremely chaotic in how they are granting new work permits.\n\nI'm kicking myself for quitting the 'fire sale' I started during the initial 'scare' and getting kind of complacent again. My boss extended some more experiments for me to wrap up and I accepted it like a fucking idiot.\n\nNow, I'm frantically trying to finish my manuscripts for submission. My credit cards are being reported for delinquency docking my good credit score to below average. My spouse has been unemployed since June for the same reason. Out of some 13 interviews, only 2 of them had the courtesy to tell us that we immediately needs to figure something out with our visa because we will have this problem with every institute that we apply to (which made us aware of this situation to begin with). For perspective, last time my spouse's department had to apply for an expedited H1b for academia, it came through in 3 weeks.We should most likely get the visa to come back to USA but that is an indeterminate amount of time. I feel like I have no option but to sell everything that I can because putting anything in the storage hoping that we might come back is an  assumption. We definitely can't afford to pay $1600/month for an apartment which would also mean renewing the lease.\n\nI tried selling the car for which I'm still paying. A used car dealer offered $3000 less than the payoff price and I really don't have that kind of money right now.\n\nI sold some expensive computer components on ebay to recover some cash but Paypal is holding my money till 09/24/2018.  I have very few pieces of furniture from IKEA but no one wants to buy it unless I sell it for 20% of the price that I bought it for and it just hurts so bad to sell it so cheap. I will still sell it though, anything will be better than having to set up a curb alert for them.\n\nI am not sure why am I posting this here. I have a tiny amount of saving but IF I touch that, I won't be able to buy my flight home. So, I guess I am poor today because I have no money to buy grocery for the rest of the month and we're looking at credit cards that have any balance left.\n\nIs there anyone else who's been in the same boat?

Generally comes every 2-3 years.\n\nunrelated, I got ptsd, which meant as a teen, I was unable to work. I finally fixed my head, and part of that was moving away from my home city. I can not move back home, for my mental health.\n\nBefore I moved.away I wasn't able to work mentally, so I had very little money, so no savings. I was overdue an episode.\n\nI got a job... And an episode came. I have never had one this badly. I got so tired I couldn't eat after work. (Even with my partner cooking dinner) I would be crying in pain. I had recently lost about 30 kilos,  which meant my cardio had been improving.. for the first time ever I enjoyed running...

I'm laying in bed typing this because I'm so worn out, and in so much pain.  \n\n\n**The issue:**\nI live in Australia.\n\nDisability here requires  you be 'diagnosed, fully treated and stabilized'.

This is what allowed me to become what I am today.\n\nBeing kicked out is an extremely traumatic thing to go through. I've been through it, but it's not the end of the world by any means. In fact, it could potentially be a very, very good thing educationally-speaking. When applying for schools, there's this thing called the [FAFSA](https://fafsa.ed.gov/) that you fill out to receive financial aid in the form of grants and loans. It's free, and government ran. Normally, if you're under a certain age, when filling out your FAFSA, you have to rely on your parent's tax information to fill it out. But if you've been kicked out, or don't have a good relationship with your parents, getting this information can be a big problem.\n\nThe good news? As a person 21 or under, if you're kicked out, or lack stable housing, you more than likely will qualify under the McKinney-Vento Act as a person identified as a homeless or *at risk of being homeless* youth. Note the second part; you don't necessarily have to even be homeless and on the street to qualify. If you've been kicked out, lack stable housing (read: couch surfing, living with a friend, etc.), there's an extremely likely chance you'll qualify. \n\nSo can this hard time in your life be used to your overall long-term benefit? The McKinney-Vento Act allows a person who qualifies to check a box on their FAFSA that asks whether or not they've been homeless, or at risk of being homeless during a particular year, and causes them to be considered an independent for federal aid purposes, thus bypassing the need for their parent's tax information. Why this is advantageous is because more than likely, as a homeless (or at risk of being homeless) youth, you don't make very much money. Therefore, you will qualify for a large amount of financial aid for school in the form of a Pell Grant and Stafford Loan. The Pell Grant you don't have to pay back (as long as you follow the rules), and the Stafford Loan is just that\u2013\u2013a loan, so you'll be responsible for paying it back.\n\nBut here's another trick. As long as you don't move from the state you're currently a resident from, most schools will consider you an in-state student for tuition payment purposes, thus significantly reducing your tuition and fees. If you go to a state community college, you can very possibly go to school for free, and in fact, receive the difference between the amount of your tuition and the amount of financial aid offered to you back. If you go to an out of state school, your tuition can very easily triple, so if you're in this position, forget about going to Harvard for the time being. Focus on reality. While I'd shy away from calling this process being \"paid to go to school,\" that's almost what it's like. If you \\*\\*budget this money carefully\\*\\*, you can easily sustain yourself while being in school, find employment, and get your life together without the help of your parents. \n\nNow real quick, because a lot of youth tend to think Community Colleges are a joke, they're not. Most state universities have some sort of transfer program with local community colleges which allow them to transfer to the university after completing a degree at the community college. In fact, I'd explicitly avoid going to a University off the bat for the reason that Universities are more expensive, and thus, you would receive less money in-hand by going to a University versus a Community College. This part is super duper important. Again, remember, budget the money you receive from school, and you can set yourself straight.\n\nI hope this information helps those in need. I learned all this stuff after having gone through it. At this point in my life, I'm a certificated commercial pilot, have an associate's degree in Paralegal Studies, and will be graduating in Spring 2019 with a BA in Criminal Justice\u2013\u2013all due to the information I've included in this post.",

        "original": "I'm sorry, but this is long.\n\nTLDR: I need to save for a car, but if I make more money, I'll lose my benefits.\n\nI'm 66, have lupus, and receive $789 a month in SS payments. I luckily can pay my rent, utilities and internet with that, and it leaves me with about $30-50, depending on how much the utilities are. I spend that money on food, because they cut my food stamps by $36 when my SS went up $102 a month (went onto regular SS from widow's benefits)\n\nI also get $156.00 a month in food stamps, a lifeline phone and QMB Medicaid that pays my Medicare co-pays, deductibles with a prescription plan where I pay $3.50 each for prescriptions.\n\nI do also work a bit online, and make about $100 a month, which covers my prescriptions, miscellaneous expenses and extra food. \n\nI can make $1,025 a month and keep all my benefits. Subtracting my SS, that leaves me able to make $236/month and not lose my medicaid, but it will probably cut my food stamps to about $75 a month, so I'd have to use a lot of that for food, so catch-22. Also, since I'm considered self-employed, I have to set aside about 30% of what I make for taxes, although it seems absurd to me that I have to pay FICA while on SS, but that's  how stupid the system is..\n\nI need a car. I've been walking and riding the bus, but I live in Florida, and in the summertime, it's impossible to get much of anywhere because I have lupus and can't be out in the heat. I have to go by bus very early in the morning, and that limits me as to where I can grocery shop if I can't catch a ride. Also, my legs and joints are getting worse, so it's hard for me to walk as much as I used to, which cost me bus fares or having to pay someone to take me places. \n\nOnce I get a car, they can't count that against me, but saving the money to buy the car is impossible without losing some of my benefits.\n\nI found an organization that sells low-income people cars for about $2,000, but you have to have the money all in one lump payment. I don't see how I can do it. \n\nI'm not physically able to work at a regular job due to my lupus, but I'm not considered disabled under their system, because I've never received disablity. \n\nI've cut back as much as I can on my utilities. I keep my thermostat (a/c) on 81 and use as little water as possible. My internet can't be had any cheaper because of local monopolies, and it's my only link to the outside world, so I can't give that up.\n\nIt just seems hopeless.

It was a contract and I was supposed to go full time, everyone told me it'd happen, my boss and her boss included. I did a silly thing and additionally took some money to buy my daughter (who's living in UK and is, to tell the truth, much better off there than if she and my ex still tried living here) a laptop - I waited for years for my own father to buy me my first computer, so I wanted my kid to at least have as much, even if rarely was I able to send her any meaningful sum of money, since PLN to GBP transfer rate makes what's a lot of money here, seem like pennies there.\n\nAnyway, I did that, and then lost my job not long after. I didn't get any severance or whatever, since it was contract, and the company just kept me waiting later and later for a real response before they finally dropped me off. I worked as a graphic artist there, creating assets for a casino type game. I always wanted to work with games, however I could...\n\nAfter I lost my job, friends told me to try going freelance. It was hard in my country, a mix of depression, anxiety, on top of epilepsy and no real money besides my last paycheck meant I had to go for something crazy. I started drawing porn for money, for clients from other countries, receiving payments in dollars. In my country it's possible to live with just 600 dollars a month, so I did my best. Some months are hard, I don't have an actual business, if I get ill I don't have any health insurance, my anxiety about money (I'm from a poor family) is crazy high, but... I'm pushing through just to pay that laptop and whatever else I can back. I know it'll take a year or two out of my life, and I'm not getting younger, and it is a bit shameful doing what I do, but sometimes do what you have to do, not what you want or would like.

        "original": "This is my first post so I apologize in advance if there are some mistakes that are frowned upon..\n\nJust some quick information about myself, I grew up switching between homes between my mother and father, till I eventually landed with my mother and long time step dad. My father and I don\u2019t speak anymore because he was very into his career and school and provided me with nothing besides a few bags of chips when I would go over. \n\nAnyways, because of this I\u2019ve always been someone has considered themselves independent. I am 21 now and have paid for everything myself, from my school, to my car, to my food to it all. But with living expenses so high it has been rather tough. I\u2019ve racked up around $8000 in debt between credit cards and IRS payment. \n\nThe reason for the irs debt is because I work \u201cfreelance\u201d at my job which is owned by my step dads brother. I\u2019ve tried many times to become \u201cpermanent\u201d but they say I don\u2019t have enough hours weekly for full time. (I work 35+). \n\nI\u2019ve been applying to oh so many jobs in hope that I\u2019ll be able to leave this. I have no incentive to work, I get no benefits and frankly this place is a shit hole. But the boss doesn\u2019t mind because he works in another office which is taken care of. \n\nI\u2019ve contemplated joining the marines in order to find some stability but I just met a nice woman and I\u2019m not ready to leave just yet. They pay me a decent amount (18/hr) so it\u2019s hard to find another job willing to pay someone with little experience in various field. \n\nTo shorten this story up, I\u2019m just not sure what to do. I have all these credit cards(3) phone bill, car payment, tuition racking up on me and I can\u2019t seem to keep up. I\u2019ve run out of options and many times I don\u2019t even go to work because I feel it\u2019s just feeding me bad \u201cenergy\u201d. I\u2019ve been doing this high school with small part times working both at the same time. \n\nShould I stick this out till my debt is paid? Should I try to obtain another job even though it won\u2019t pay as much? I\u2019m not even sure the question I want to be answered. It\u2019s just been tough worrying about myself although I have been blessed with food over my head. \n\nAh.. one final thing.. my lease on my car ended a month ago and I still have it.. I\u2019m not sure what to do cause I\u2019m actually over mileage and it has a bit of external damage and frankly I can\u2019t pay for it.. let alone having to get a new one with money for a down payment I don\u2019t have..\n\nI tried talking about this with friends but everyone I know has a family that is very well off so no one seems to have this issue. My step father is willing to help but I know he himself isn\u2019t rich in money so I don\u2019t want to put that on him in a bad position\n\nAs for my real father, he actually recently started making lots of money. Maybe I should accept him in my life again so he can help? Although I rather not, since, before he had money he wasn\u2019t even willing to take me to dinner for my birthday but everyone else would receive something\n\nMaybe I\u2019m just the problem and I need a drastic change in scenery, to get myself straight. Any advice, or help, is greatly appreciated. I\u2019m sorry again for anything I said was dumb or written incorrectly. (And the length, I tried to skim it down)",

        "original": "Firstly, this will be lengthy and I sincerely apologize for that. I'm mainly posting to see if we are overlooking anything, or if anyone has tips to improve. That being said, my husband and I think we finally figured out a way to knock down our debt. \n\nBasic run down: I have a full time job where I just received a promotion going from 14.25/hr to 17.50/hr. I have yet to see what the actual amount, after tax and deductions will be as the new wage started 10/1 and I won't see it until the 19th. My husband has a part time job at 15/hr 22.5 hours a week. His current job may eventually make him full time, however, due to us only having one car and him having a paid side gig editing YouTube videos and his own channel (which is monetized), a full time job may cause more harm than good at this current moment. \n\nThe plan: Our credit card debt is $14,900 according to Credit Karma. Then we also have a car loan of 7,693 which is my Honda lease. This pay raise was 100% unexpected so all our current plans are based off my wage of 14.25 so I know some tweaking can be done once we learn our new normal income. \n\nI can't remember which method (avalanche/snowball) we are doing but here is a rundown of our plan for 5 credit cards. Note there are some credit lines missing which I think is a clothing CC and PayPal credit which we are still paying down with minimum payments, but aren't included on this plan we wrote down and will be tackled later. Basically, the easiest way to describe what we are doing is locking in payments and paying the highest interest rate down first. As the card balances go down, the required min payment decreases as well but we will not adjust the amount we pay and keep it the same. For example, for card A, the current min payment is $55 and in X months will be $20, but we will still be paying $55. In addition to that, we are also taking the highest interest rate card, and paying $100 a month, which is more than the min payment. Once that card is paid off, we will then move to the next highest card and include the $100 that was used to pay off the first card, into the amount we pay for the next card on the list. I hope this makes sense. \n\nExtra info: Out of our monthly income, we pay monthly, $1100 rent, $155 T-Mobile (curse the damn phone leases), $452 car payment, $105 car insurance, $14 Amazon Prime, $160 for husbands Uber/Lfyt rides, $140 my gas, and $350 for groceries/necessities. \n\n**Knowing that I will be getting more money due to my promotion, does this plan work, does anyone have any additional tips or suggestions?**  Any \"left over/extra\" money will be put into savings or added to the current card we are paying off. We **will** be be owing on 2018 taxes this year since one of us did not have health insurance at all, so that be a wound in a few months.\n\n\\*bonus info due to my excitement\\* An old medical bill that was in collections from 7 years ago finally fell off my credit this month, yay for 0 derogatory marks :)\n\nDetails: \n\n**CREDIT ONE VISA:**\n\nBalance: $977.00 \n\nInterest Rate: 25.65%\n\nMin Payment: $55.00 per month\n\nAdjusted Payment: $125.00 per month\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CAPITAL ONE:**\n\nBalance: $1,732.00\n\nInterest Rate: 24.65%\n\nMin Payment: $56.00 per month\n\nAdjusted Payment: N/A - Adjustments will be made as each card is paid off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CREDIT ONE MASTERCARD:**\n\nBalance: $1,464.00\n\nInterest Rate: 21.65%\n\nMin Payment: $76.00 per month\n\nAdjusted Payment: N/A - Adjustments will be made as each card is paid off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BofA CASH REWARDS:**\n\nBalance: $458.00\n\nInterest Rate: 21.74%\n\nMin Payment: $25.00 per month\n\nAdjusted Payment: N/A - Adjustments will be made as each card is paid off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BofA WHITE CARD:**\n\nBalance: $8,982\n\nInterest Rate: 15.99%\n\nMin Payment: $215.00 per month\n\nAdjusted Payment: N/A - Adjustments will be made as each card is paid off.\n\n&#x200B;",

I recently got into a car accident driving my friends car, totaling it, so I plan to to pay him 1,500 for damages and tickets i got. I also owe 700  to my only credit card ever which I have also missed a lot of payments on before. I am not sure if I will ever have to pay $1,500 for an ER visit for an xray, I was sent the bill a year ago but I got no mentions of collection.\n\nI am working full time for a security agency making average $300 per week. I have to pay $60 for internet, $60 for my phone,  $20 for my gym, $30 for food every week, and about $30 a week for gas.\n\nMy credit score is 537(should it be this low? identity theft??) when i did a free report.  I am thinking about taking a $10k loan in order to first clear my debt, return to school and blah blah. The remaining balance will sit in savings for the emergency situation where I can't meet the minimum payments, when i catch up to the balance I will simply pay that back.  Also when school starts I will take out a subsidized school loan to pay back this personal loan. Do you think Ill get approved?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHIS IS MY PLAN.

I moved out and got stuck in horrible landlord situations, scams (when did financing turn into leasing??) and ended up maxing out credit cards and hurting my newly born credit that I just started in February.\n\nAfter working part time jobs and grocery delivery gigs (goodbye InstaCRAP) I finally got a career that lets me utilize my degree. It's a paid internship program where I will be vetted in (officially allowed to stay in the role, based on my performance) and at the matching pay grade after 2 years. \n\nI got my first check and paid off a few of my credit cards and loans using on of those debt calculators. I will be debt free pretty soon and I'll be able to help out my fiance Long story short, he got into debt helping me throughout the year and completely ruined his credit, now I'm repaying him ten fold. I love him so much and he saw me through and continued to support me despite his financial issues, even when I kept telling him he didn't have to.\n\nI'm just so happy, I wanted to share with someone!

Right now I'm just getting over getting my car fixed and past inspection, and I was hoping to not have any costs this month except for the expected rent, food, and utilities, so that I could actually gain something from my paycheck instead of lose more.\n\nBut now something feels weird in my upper right (my right) side. I can't feel it from the outside, but it's like a bulgy feeling that sometimes feels like a pop if I move correctly, and other times I don't feel it at all. At night my side hurts like a dull pain on my ribs, and this bulgy thing feels kinda like a rib or something poking the inside of me. I'm also concerned it might be a hernia in the making. I've had this feeling for about 3 weeks now. The side pain feels a bit better if I press against it, and the weird feeling thing more towards the center doesn't usually hurt unless I move the right (wrong?) way and it seems to pop with a sharp quick pain.\n\nI've also gained weight though, despite exercising regularly and eating less than the required amount to gain, I somehow gained about 25lbs in the belly area, so it could possibly be fat sliding over fat or something, I'm not used to being overweight.\n\nAnyway, I know I should prob see a doctor (I don't think I have a primary doctor), but I don't want to go if they're going to be able to find nothing wrong (because this is a feeling, nothing on the surface) and charge hundreds more than my copay for random on-the-spot tests to find nothing, or something I could've found online.\n\nIf I go for a general checkup, but then point out what I've told you, do you think costs will be lower?\n\nI'll probably still wait it out for a while more to see if it goes away on its own.

        "original": "I know I'm not the only one here overwhelmed by my employment gap. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy where your employment gap grows even larger, further discouraging us from moving forward\n\nI've got news for us: Nobody gives a fuck.\n\nAt least, not nearly as much as we think they do. We are self-centered narcissists to so completely believe that a HR rep cares so deeply about our work history (or lack thereof).\n\nThe fear of addressing my unemployment history and the reasons I keep getting fired have discouraged me from making  a proper effort to put myself out there. How much of my life have I wasted living in that fear? It's not even living - it's some kind of zombie state in which we feel completely disconnected from society\n\nBackground: Five years ago, I was fired from a good clerical job for being so consistently drunk on the clock. They were cool when I was getting my drink on at 4pm, \"hey Gradatim is getting lit early\", but when I was clocking in drunk between 8:30am and 9:00am (for a shift that starts at 8:00am) I quickly exhausted all the goodwill I earned in my years of service to the company.\n\nSince then, I've held down two jobs. The first was a valet job parking cars, but I was let go after a few weeks because I was calling out on shifts (because I was too drunk to go into work). The second job was over the last holiday season at a grocery store. They wanted to keep me on permanently because I busted my ass hardcore, but I got tired of management bullshit and quit after 6 months. That's some hella entitled shit right there, we're dead wrong thinking that working under bullshit politics is beneath us. It isn't. What is truly beneath us is not taking responsibility for our lives. But, it's hard to see that. Okay, I didn't so much quit my grocery job as I bailed - so I'm not getting a positive reference from them either.\n\nSo, like, why even bother applying for a job. I've got great personal skills so I can easily hustle enough money on the street in the early AM to be drunk all day and night. And it must suck to walk into every job interview where everyone knows you're a worthless loser, or a worthless drunk, or perhaps both. Wow, what incredible narcissists we are. As it turns out, HR people are trying to solve THEIR problem. They actually don't care much about new hires, except for how they can solve the HR persons problem. If they need a warm body to do work, and you indicate you have those things, you get hired.\n\nI was offered a seasonal phone center customer service job. Pays $17/hr, a good clip better than the $14.30 I made at the grocery store last year, but far less than the $20 is started with as a clerk nearly ten years ago. I had to play dress up: trimmed my beard, and I found one last pair of pants & shirt from my clerical life that fit me and wasn't stained. I wore a tie. I walked 45 minutes to the interview, was a little sweaty when I got there, but I was an hour early to give me time to chill. It was a group interview with two other folks. I had to look up stuff online, compose a mock customer response, and talk about my experiences with customer service folk. They told me they'd reach out to me soon. I spent the rest of the day agonizing over a thank you email to the HR rep. After hours of writing and rewriting flowing prose, I said fuck it and cut the email down to just \"thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you\". She immediately called me with the job offer - almost as if she was just waiting for me to send a thank you.\n\nThat was my second attempt at applying for that same position. I had previously applied using a resume that completely describes my work history & achievements, and an elaborate cover letter that explained how my experiences fit the scope of the work duties. I was rejected, their exact words were: \n\n>We have reviewed your background and qualifications and while we feel you have some great experience, we have decided to move forward with other candidates whose background more closely align with the requirements for this position\n\nWell fuck that shit so I cut the most enriching work experiences I have out, and left just the most recent grocery job, and poof! like magic I got the interview invite.\n\nSo where do I go from here? Man, you should have seen my swagger after that interview. I was so pumped I went to a gadget store (there are still a few left in this country) to identify something I could aspire to buy some day with money saved up from this job. I'm immediately told that wholesalers are not welcome without an appointment - I've never been so honored to be asked to leave a place of business before. Usually its because my disheveled drunk self scares other customers, but here I am being mistaken for a salesperson!! I explain how my day went and the staff had a good time showing me stuff, the manager came to introduce himself, and mentioned that he would love to pitch me an opportunity to work there! I assume he can't match $17 but it's so nice to know someone else might want to hire me.\n\nMaybe others will want to hire me? Instead of explaining to people that I'm unemployed, or trying to convince people I'm not too young to retire, I get to say I'm currently employed.  I'm going to tell recruiters that I currently make $17 and can walk to work, and will need more if they want me to switch; even more if they want me to work farther away from home. I squandered the opportunity last year to use the grocery job as a stepping stone, I got complacent and didn't search for better work in between bagging groceries. I can also say that I work in a tech company. It might just be my perception, but without knowing all the details I think people draw more positive conclusions about someone working in a tech company than someone working retail - even if it is the same job duties. \n\nI'm not saying all my problems are solved, but I can tell you with certainty than none of my problems will be solved if I continue to be unemployed. \n\nTip 1: just fucking apply.\n\nTip 2: keep your resume short and sweet. It's an advertisement, not a cv. Entry level jobs need entry level resume's - learn to play the game.\n\nTip 3: don't smell like cheap beer. If you spend less than $2 on 22 ounces of beer, save it for AFTER the interview.\n\nTip 4: send thank you notes. always, no exceptions. \n\nTip 5: be nice to everyone. especially the people who you think don't matter: the security guard, the receptionist, other hopefuls waiting for an interview\n\nTip 6: just fucking apply\n\nPoverty induced stress can be like PTSD in that causes you to systematically underestimate your own self worth. I just needed to get over the hump. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLots of love,\n\n(me)",

        "original": "I am shaking while writing this, but I know that I need to suck it up and put it all out there. I've been struggling financially for the past few months and I am feeling so suffocated under all of this that I can't see a way out. I have been more stressed and anxious about this than anything else in my life. I could barely sleep last night, my heart beating out of my chest, knowing that I was going to type this post up and submit it today, asking for help/advice/suggestions/a way forward.\n\nI feel so overwhelmed I don't even know where to begin.\n\nFirst, some info about me: I am a 26 year old law student, in the middle of my final year of school. I go to school full-time, am a senior editor on the law school's law review, and I also work two part-time jobs (one is at Starbucks, the other is a legal internship for the federal government that limits me on how many hours I can work). I do about 12-18 hours at starbucks and only 4 hours with the government per week. On top of that, I am doing lots of post-graduation job searching, networking, applying, interviewing and other things to try and help me find decent-paying legal work after I graduate. I have little to no time formyself and It is *killing me*. I am stretched thin, tired, losing weight, struggling to keep up in school and on top of all this, I've always got money and my debt and my insufficient income to help me out on my mind.\u00a0\n\nI've tried reading some self-help financial books, but a lot of them seem to be geared more towards people who are already pretty financially stable, who need advice investing or saving for retirement, etc. I can't even begin to think about that right now. It scares me, freaks me out, makes my heart rate speed up. I am terrified that I've fucked over my future, because of stupid decisions and irresponsibility.\n\nWhen I graduate in the spring, I will have roughly $150,000 in student loans. That thought terrifies me. Currently, I have $17,931.87 in credit card debt. In late spring earlier this year, I opened a balance transfer card to send some of my debt over there, in the hopes of avoiding paying more interest on it. As you will see, that didn't come to fruition, and I've ended up gathering more debt since then...\n\nThis has all accumulated on top of my student loans for a number of reasons: cost of living increased much more than I expected, unexpected car troubles/emergencies hit me that I was unprepared for, and during both of my summers in between years of school, I was working away from home, unable to sub-let my apartment, and without student loans in the summer to help buoy me, was paying to live in a different city for work while also having to maintain my apartment at home. I ended up being unable to save anything from either of these two summer jobs, had to rely on credit cards to just pay rent/utilities/travel expenses/etc., and now, here I am. Drowning in debt, suffocating, feeling like there is no end in sight.\u00a0I'm not trying to make excuses, I know I'm in a deep hole and I need some help to get out of it.\u00a0\n\n\nI am terrified. I am feeling so lost and helpless and ashamed. I'm depressed and suffering mild anxiety attacks, which has never happened before. I never thought this would happen to me but I don't know what to do or where to turn or what to even *start* doing now to fix anything. I hope I haven't ruined my life and my future. I need some help, please.\u00a0\n\nTo help out, I've tried to outline my accounts, and bills that I know I will for sure need to take care of in the coming months. I don't get another student loan deposit till January. I don't know what to do, or where to begin, or how to move forward. I feel stuck and like there's nothing I can do, but I am motivated to try something to improve my situation.\n\n**Current Funds**:\n\n*Checking Account* - $4117.29 (The base of this is remaining from the student loans dispersed to me in August. I've got ~$350-400 coming in every two weeks, after taxes, from the two part- time jobs I am working. But it\u2019s never a set amount.)\n\nJan 1~ - *student loan deposits* ~$10,141\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Savings Account* - $600\n\n**Current CC Balances / APRs / Minimums**:\n\n*Slate Card* - $1413.77 / 24.99% / $25 minimum\n\n*Amazon Prime* - $5003.19 / 24.24% / $145 minimum\n\n*American Express* - $6147.12 / 9.99% until 11/11, then goes to 20.24% / $117 minimum\n\n*Discover* - $5367.79 / 0.00% until 09/19/19 - used this as a balance transfer card for previous credit card debt :( / $115 minimum\n\n**Future Expenses/Bills**:\n\nOct 20 - 150 due for total utilities\n\nOct 28 - 465 for November rent\n\nOct 28 -25 min for slate card\n\nNov 6 - 117 minimum due AMEX\n\nNov 8 - 145 minimum for amazon card\n\nNov 11 - 115 due for car insurance\n\nNov 14 - 115 min for discover\n\nNov 20 - 150 due for utilities\n\nNov 28 - 465 for December rent\n\nNov 28 - 25 minimum due for slate\n\nDec 6 - 117 minimum due AMEX\n\nDec 8 - 150 min for amazon card\n\nDec 11 - 115 due for car insurance\n\nDec 14 - 115 minimum due discover\n\nDec 20 - 150 due for utilities\n\nDec 28 - 465 for January rent\n\nDec 28 - 25 minimum due for slate",

Can you help me figure out what to do?\n\nBackstory: I've taken care of my mom financially since my 20's.  (now in my 40's, single again, no kids.)  I have 2 sets of bills, mine and my mom's.  The past 3 years have been a total fustercluck of major home repairs (hers and mine), hospital and physical therapy bills (hers) and some dumb spending decisions (mine, overspending on convenience items/services while going nuts working full-time and caring for a sick parent.) \n\nI now have $75k in debt.  Among them is an $8k loan that is interest-free if I pay the remaining $4k in full before March -- otherwise I'll add an extra $1,800.  $30k in CC debt, $40k home equity line. \n\nI can't sell my mom's place until Spring at least -- she lives in a condo and they are doing work on the building, and the condo will not pass inspection until the work is completed and inspected.  Once I sell it, I should be able to make $50k or so.  Speaking of which, she can't live on her own anymore so she's with me and I take care of her when I'm done working at night. So I can't take a 2nd job, though I try to work an extra day at week whenever the opportunity arises. I'm exhausted all the time to the point of getting sick, and I'm afraid of doing any more work than I'm already doing... I leave my house at 7:30am and get home a lot of days at 8 or 9pm. \n\nMy own home is 35 years old and hasn't been remodeled since 2000. I have 1 working eye left on my stove, my ventilation hood periodically falls off bc the cheapo cabinets are rotten and won't hold a screw, I'm so scared the cabinets will fall off the wall that I store most of my dishes/food etc in boxes on the kitchen floor. I'm doing the \"bathroom shuffle\" because the shower works in one, the hot sink water in another and the toilet in the third.  So obvs I can't sell or refi my home.  The \"good\" news is, I've already replaced the hot water heater, furnace, air conditioner and electrical panel in my house in the past 2 years, which is one reason I have no money.  Also had to buy a furnace, hot water heater and AC for my mom's unit.  Oh, and I'm about to be assessed $4k for the improvements on her condo building. \n\nI can take money out of my 401(k) but I'd be taxed 50% and I wouldn't be allowed to contribute again for 5 years.  I've already stopped contributing to it last year, which sucks because I get a sweet match. \n\nI've tried and tried to make ends meet but I've now missed 4 payments which are now paid, but my credit score is down from 750 to 599.  I don't even qualify for a consolidation loan from a reputable company.\n\nIf I make it until March, I will get a $5k bonus -- but honestly, that might help me make ends meet month-to-month for awhile, but it won't let me fix up my house -- and God forbid my mom needs another hospital stay.  \n\nShould I take the money out of my 401(k)?  Get a consolidation loan from, basically, a loan shark? I'm roughly $400-$600/month underwater -- I can usually get $200-$400 from working OT, doing quick jobs for others, etc. but I'm drowning a bit.  Ideas appreciated.",

        "original": "Hi guys, apologies if this post belongs elsewhere. I feel kinda \"too poor\" for r/personalfinance, and I'm not sure if r/frugal is quite where I should go either. I'm also sorry for how long this turned out. I'm mostly frustrated and blowing steam, but maybe there will be some useful suggestions here?\n\nBackstory: I spent my 20s brokebrokebroke thanks to the Recession and the lack of job market in my area (literally ALL my family is in this area, down to aunts/uncles/cousins, so I really didn't want to have to move away). As a result, I am now early 30s and trying to learn financial stuff I feel like other people already have a handle on. I don't even mean RRSPs and other acronyms - I mean basic \"how to budget beyond one paycheck\" financial stuff. I finally landed a decent-paying full-time job two years ago, and currently make about $50 000/yr (after deductions, I bring home just under $3000/month). This is literally double what I was making a couple years back, so I should at least FEEL like I'm rolling in it, right? But I'm still broke all the time?\n\nI should note I was also diagnosed with adult ADHD earlier this year, which might explain some of this. \n\nI was gonna go into a list of all the \"dings\" I've gotten in the past year, but it was just going to turn into this monster post. So in short: Since January, I have had unusual/unexpected major financial outputs on average every 2 months. About 6 so far. Things like vet bills, car repairs, insurance failing to cover medical treatments they'd usually cover, etc. Some of it was due to poor choices/planning on my part, much of it was shitty circumstances. But MANY times this year, I've found myself having to shell out $500-$1200 for \"extra\" stuff, and... as of October, I'm strapped. My credit (all $2000 of it) is maxed. I have nothing saved. I was an idiot and got into the payday loan thing over the summer to tide me over, and I'll have that cleared by the end of this month (I made payments on time so I dodged the crazy interests, but those loans still cost, and it's a cycle). There's already a giant expense coming down the pipe (about $600) for next month. Then... Christmas. At best, I'm looking at January before things get back to normal, and I've been hand-to-mouth since about June.\n\nI've been wanting to buy a new bed and a new TV for over a year now, and literally have never managed to find the money for either of those (I'm sleeping on a bed a friend of mine loaned me \"temporarily\" a year and a half ago). I'm supposed to hang out with my \"pyramid scheme\" friend tomorrow (she has other redeeming qualities!), and she's not aware that this $100 item she's trying to push on me (I wasn't planning on buying that either way) is literally more money than I have in my bank account right now. And that's becoming sadly usual for me, especially the last 6 months or so. By the time the big stuff is paid, I have NOTHING left for, y'know, fun.\n\nAnd I feel like I don't live that extravagantly. I haven't been going out much. When I see friends, it's usually either hanging out at their house or doing something fairly cheap. I buy cheap clothes (Ali Express type stuff). I coupon. I batch cook. I use a laptop from 2008. I love me some Starbucks, but I only go every two weeks or so. My car is paid for, I don't commute far, it's one of the most fuel-efficient cars on the market so my gas expenses are low (a bus pass would literally be more expensive for me at this point than driving). Like, I don't have any major shopping/gambling/addiction stuff going on eating my money. There's no one thing. It's just been one thing after another all year eating up my income. I'm single right now, and want to start dating, but I'm self-conscious of doing so if I'm literally scrounging for money to pay for dinner. \n\nOn paper, the budget works... my fixed expenses come to something like $1500. Variable expenses like groceries and gas probably another $400-$500. My rent is 1/3 of my take-home income. That leaves me theoretically with a few hundred bucks I should be able to play with after expenses each pay, but I keep having this other crap happening that puts me into \"Oh shit, I have $100 to buy food and gas and try to actually have fun with until I get paid again in 10 days\". \n\n I did apply for a higher credit limit today, though I have a hunch I won't be approved, since I've been sitting close to max for the last several months (that said, my credit rating is still good, and my payments have been regular). I know that's not really the answer anyway, it'll just create more debt for me to deal with later.  I've also started a side gig in the last month, but at the moment it's only paying about $100/month - I think it's something that'll pick up in time, but not right away. In the end, everything IS covered at this point, I just got nothing left after it is all covered. And for my present income, I feel like it shouldn't be this hard, my finances shouldn't be this tight. I should have SOME spare cash, but I don't. I guess I feel extra-frustrated because I spent YEARS being completely broke, because the jobs I had paid shit. So I hate being \"back there.\"\n\n  \nSo I've cut discretionary spending to the bone, used what credit I can, have started a second gig... if y'all have any other ideas, I'm all ears. Right now, I got paid yesterday, and I have about $70 to last until next pay. At this point, I feel like the only options are \"go into more debt\" (likely through a cash store unless I can actually get approved through my bank) or \"life's gonna suck for a couple more months. And possibly longer, if my car breaks down again or my cat gets sick again or my medical insurance screws up again or insert XYZ happens.\" ",

        "original": "Hey guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's been an absolute horrible year for me. The worst of my entire life. I was raised frugal and haven't had many issues with money because I learned to only buy essential things and save the rest. It's crazy to think in January this year I had almost $10,000 saved for a house. And now I'm down to $300. Which I now have to use for rent. I had moved out finally after being in a very toxic dysfunctional family for years. I was happy and had a full-time job and lots of money saved. Unfortunately in Jan I was fired because I contracted pneumonia and was out for 3 days (In my state it's legal. And I'm annoyed about it too.) It was sudden. I honestly didn't realize I would be out of a job and only receiving about 1 more paycheck. So after that I hunted for jobs but was extremely limited by distance. I don't have a car and public transportation didn't go in the direction of half the jobs I found. The other half denied me or never got back to me. So I was out of work for 3 months. I tried for unemployment but they never got back to me. I tried contacting them but their phone lines were always busy or dead. So eventually I land a low paying low hours part time job. Better than nothing. Then of course (with the way my year had been going) one week into working there my appendix decides to almost burst. I end up in the ER emergency surgery and am out of work for another month.  Of course I'm then stuck with all my rent/food/bills and lack of funds coming in. I'm barely making enough to pay my rent. Then after that I contract an infection from the surgery and end up out of work again. At this point I'm so low on money I have to beg my mom to move back in with her or I'd be homeless. She reluctantly agrees. Due to the distance I can no longer make it to that job and have to quit. So again back to making no money. My mom still asks for rent which is around $300 with utilities. But at this point I have no money left. I've always been super responsible/reliable with money. But because of this bad luck... or curse I have it's all gone. All my hard saving and never buying nice things for myself... eating at home.. buying cheap food etc. It's all in the gutter. I've been looking for jobs in this area but again no car (means limited distance) and because I unfortunately also have a back disease I can only walk for about 15 minutes before my hip pops out of place and I can't walk anymore. Meaning really I'm screwed. I tried online jobs and apply on the daily (If they're in my state-which a lot are not) but haven't heard back. I honestly am having such a hard time right now. I just want to give up and am feeling extremely depressed and useless. I don't know how to make a positive change from here. And if eventually I'll be homeless due to lack of money for rent.

Since that time I\u2019ve made leaps and bounds to correct my habitual bad spending and clear over-due debt (mostly medical). At this point I\u2019ve paid off the majority of my collections accounts or disputed them if I didn\u2019t have any knowledge of them. Basically what I have left is two collections accounts from the Dept of education.\n\n My question comes from this; I got a \u2018bill\u2019 in the mail from what looked like an emergency room while having no clue why I was getting it as I had had medical coverage for months at that point. I hadn\u2019t been to any Er or emergency hospital at all in years, and I\u2019m 90% positive I had cleared those debts. I asked my boyfriend if he thought I should look into it because the service date was pretty recent and he thought if I didn\u2019t know what the heck it was for, maybe it could be some kind of scam that is just looking for people to pay on debt they think they owe. The \u2018bill\u2019 I\u2019m referring to was just on a piece of regular printer paper. I have received bills from emergency rooms before and they don\u2019t just look like regular printer paper. They have all sorts of writing and phone numbers and such. This just looked very odd to me.\nAnyway, I trashed it. Didn\u2019t think anything of it until it showed up on my credit report. I still don\u2019t know why or where the bill was coming from, so I disputed it on TransUnion and it was gone. Sweet right?\n\nWell, as of a couple days ago it\u2019s back on there on the Equifax side. I tried to go on and dispute it, but it\u2019s asking for an account number that I don\u2019t have. So I googled how to get the account number, and it said to go to annual credit report.com and it would be on there. Every other collections account I\u2019ve had was on there with their account numbers EXCEPT for the one I\u2019m trying to dispute.\n\nI have no idea what to do. I have a phone number for Equifax but once I call them I have no idea what to say or more importantly what NOT to say. I don\u2019t have any knowledge of this date of service from this emergency room. What can I say or do to expedite this process?",

So I thought I'd just put it out there, I live in the UK and a lot of pub companies have live in, Weatherspoons, Stonegate and CosyClub, Oceana, Prisym, are a few big ones - but small independents often have live in as well. If childcare is your thing live in nannying jobs can also be good. \n\nNow live in isnt without its problems, I had to share a room with a nasty girl for a bit, you also never get away from the people you work with, if cover is needed you are always the first port of call, noise levels can be bad.

        "original": "Hello! I'm gonna start by saying that I love this sub and it has helped me tremendously to achieve a better way of living financially. Thank you!\n\nOkay so I have 2 job opportunities lined up and while the hourly rate is different one has commissions and the other doesn't. \n\nJob #1: Internet based rooting and data recovery website, I'd be hired as a tech making 10$/hr, I have previous history with this company, the job is somewhat stressful but more flexible in terms of schedule. The job is in English which is my second language and the chances of moving up are better than job #2. If I move to this job I'll be losing a 600$ bonus from my current job because I reached my goal or so I was told.\n\nJob #2: call center for a well known mobile carrier making 7.50$ + commission per line/phone sold + 75% off phone bill (my phone bill is 160$ right now with a rival carrier). When factoring in commissions and the 75% off which is a huge saving for me it comes around at like 9.25$/hr if my selling is okay like everyone else and 11$/hr or more if I do great. The call center is not cold calling, it's on my native language (Spanish) but the possibilities of moving up are somewhat slim.\n\nI am currently enrolled in college for a bachelor's in microbiology. My expenses are 650$ month give or take. I do not have a car note and I am just renting. Student loan is on hold since I'm studying, credit card debt is under control (~800$ used of my 5,000 limit), no children, have gf, I don't go out much, maybe every week to watch a movie on student day. \n\nI have till Monday to decide.\n\nI don't know schedule for any one of the two but I do know job #1 works 24/7 and job #2 could be 6 days a week. I really don't know what to choose and I trust strangers with more experience more than myself. \n\nThank you!\n\n\nUpdate: After talking with the people of job #1 they clarified that they don't quite like that I'm studying because they want a fixed schedule of 9-6pm Monday to Friday, I have a 3 hour class Tuesdays at 2:00 thus reducing my hours from 40 to 35 and next semester my schedule will change inevitably, they literally asked me if I couldn't just cut my hours of study. Making this job effectively 350/week gross (1,400/month) making job #2 way more attractive which I will pick up the sales experience on that specific carrier to later move to the company itself at some point.\n\nJob #2: There are a range of hours schedules I can choose from and the worst case scenario of comission is 300$ making it 1,600$ gross with a potential of 2,000$ some months (for refence the calls are inbound so the customers are already seeking getting something and it's a well known carrier with a steady climb of subscribers)\n\n\nThoughts after the update, should I still go for the first job? I was ready to say yes on the call until I reminded them that I'm studying.",

I have 2 dollars in my checking account currently. I\u2019ve been officially homeless for two weeks, but prior to that I was unable to work for two months. \nI just got a job (so excited!)  that pays 18 hourly and I would be working 40 hours a week until April when I would start having benefits and would be employed full time. I start in the beginning of November. \nMy rent I estimate will be at most 1600 a month,  lowest rent would be 1400 a month. The rent would be split between my roommate and I. I would pay 800 a month and I will probably move in in the middle of December.\nNot sure how much heat and electric would be, it would depend on the place that we decide to live at. I\u2019d estimate maybe 400 for heat and electric?\nI have no car and no car insurance which is great because that really saves on expenses. Just 40 dollars a month for transportation.\nI\u2019m also planning on going to college in January, but that can hold off until summer. I qualified for FASFA though, so I would like to take advantage of that for the spring semester.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do about my phone situation. I bought an IPhone X back when I had a job and could make the monthly payments. I ended up terminating the service which hit me with a 330 dollars early lease termination fee. If I were to return the phone, I would still owe 400 dollars on it, and wouldn\u2019t have a phone. \n\nI could buy the phone from them for 770 dollars and then do a prepaid plan for 30 a month. \n\nOr I could return the phone, but an IPhone SE for 70 dollars, and then buy a prepaid service for 30 a month. I\u2019d still have to pay the 400 for returning the SE.\n\nMy credit score is awful. It\u2019s at 489. Should I consider debt consolidation?\nMy total debt is 20k dollars.\nI have one student loan for 5,525 dollars.\nCredit card debt of 10,600 dollars.\nAnd the rest is in collections, a few of the credit cards are about to go into collections as well. I have two accounts in particular in collections that are hospital bills for 3,000.\n\n",
