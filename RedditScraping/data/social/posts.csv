1j4ou95,Self Sabotage,"Hi everyone! 

I'll try and keep it brief as possible, as if I didn't I feel as though I'd be here for quite some time.

To keep it short and to the point - I feel as though I'm ruining my own happiness by sabotaging the friendships I make, and I genuinely can't figure out why or how to stop.

Anytime I make a friend, I eventually drift a bit further and further away, never reaching out, just kinda keeping them there, but never interacting. I'll then sit at night from time to time, wondering why I have nobody to talk to, or why I feel so lonely.

I feel like the solution is so simple, but for some reason a part of me just doesn't wanna do it? 

If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, please let me know. Thank you.

I’m not sure what happened but at some point they just stopped speaking to me. It’s been over a year since I’ve talked to them.

1j4mrbh,I have no friends,"I am in high school and for 3 years I haven't had any friends or hung out with other people. I have 2 health issues that affected me a lot so thats why I was homeschooled for 3 years. This year I went to in-person school thinking that my medical conditions will get better and I will get lots of friends. Of course it was not like that, I walk in school everyone is on their phone and only friends with their old close friends. I try my best to make small talk to some people and no one even wants to talk to me. In 6th grade I would sit by myself everyday and had no friends. In 7th grade I had like 4 ppl I would sometimes talk to but still not friends. I feel like at the time trying to be in a friend group and talk to those people made me feel even more lonely and left out. I would walk with some people at my school and talk and then not even 3 mins later they completely forgot about me and I am behind them far away. I started hating people instead. I see ppl and I get negative/judgmental thoughts and even one thing irritates the hell out of me. I think it's cause of my health issues, not socializing for a long time and my parents that affected me a lot. One time a group of people were sitting next to me in class being loud and one of them is a girl who I used to be friends with in middle school but got into a fight with. It's been a long time and she's nice to me sometimes so we don't have beef with each other anymore. There's like another girl I got into a fight with in 5th grade and a girl I used to talk to in middle school but just kinda ignored me. They were talking loud, not extremely loud but still loud. Idk what got into me but I got so pissed off. I almost ended up standing up and yelling at them to be quiet. Idk what's wrong with me anymore. Another time I was in a class field trip and I saw them hanging out together while I was alone by myself. I felt so disappointed and lonely just watching them. After like 4 weeks my medical conditions finally made it impossible for me to go to school so I had to transfer to homeschooling which is what I am doing now. The area I live in is really small and not many people socialize a lot but I feel like I am slowly going insane everyday. I go to school and I fr want to beat up any friends or friend groups I see that are happy. Idk what's been happening to me and why my anger has been worse but I literally am sick of everything.

1j4ly2e,Trying to be in a friend group for D&D where one person hurt me before.,"Hi, to preface this I should probably say I'm undiagnosed, but have pretty strong indicators that I might be on the autism spectrum and often have bouts intense social anxiety.

TL;DR at the end.

So, I play D&D in a play-by-post format, which is like a discord server with a group of people who have an ongoing game where people post a few times a day. I was added recently by my best friend, who organises it, but it's been going on for a few months now. There's three other people there besides us, one of whom I have in my own D&D game but don't know well personally, and two I just met last month.

I talked with one of those two prior to being invited, and, context aside, we had a bad social interaction that messed me up for several weeks and continues to be a thorn I'm trying to get over. The other person says they don't feel emotions the way most do and thus thinks there's no problem. My efforts to talk to them and try to smooth things over were labelled immature and only stressed me out more, so I gave up to not make things worse.

Since then I've felt like an outcast in the group (they don't know what happened but know I've been distant) and I said I was just shy. I told my best friend, but she's also not a very emotional person, and I know she wants this group to work out because she wants all her friends to spend time together so she doesn't feel like leaving anyone out when spending time with others.

I get that, and I'd love to make lasting friends here too, since I've been lonely ever since my own friend group fell apart, around the time of Covid. Making friends is hard online. And I really want this to work out too.

Now we started the game, and everyone else is acquainted and very active, in and out of character, but only one of the player characters agreed to have a positive relationship with mine. Between the disdain in-character, feeling of discomfort and tension towards the person who hurt me, and not feeling like I can confide in my friend, just being there feels incredibly painful and exhausting.

I am writing here right now because I needed a few hours to calm down enough to read what's been written since I came home from work and took a necessary nap, and everyone else wrote a whole lot of messages since and it's incredibly overwhelming. My friend asked me for my character's input, as their guide through the wilderness, but I can't even read through the pages of text to get context without crying.

I don't know what to do, or how to calm down. I can't keep waiting because then people will complain that I'm holding them back. I wish socialising wasn't this hard, and I could sometimes just not care about other people's opinions and feelings the way others can.

TL;DR.

My best friend invited me to a text-based D&D game with her other close friends, but after one of them really hurt my feelings and easily moved on, I haven't been able to. I'm trying, but even being there normally feels painful and I want to procrastinate. But I can't, because I don't want to lose my friend and stalling just ends up with me being further behind and feeling awful.",How can I manage my overwhelming feelings in a social group where I feel like an outcast and am struggling to keep up?,"The individual in the Reddit post is experiencing intense social anxiety and has strong indicators of being on the autism spectrum, though they are undiagnosed.

For those who don’t know, in the Hispanic community when a girl has her sweet 15 they usually have a mass to get blessed on their day.

So in the video the birthday girl getting blessed realizes that no one goes up to her to shake her hand so she went to everyone else instead. That was it, that was the whole video.

I left a comment saying something along the lines of, “am the only one who wouldn’t have cared? I probably would just wait till the moment was over 😅” I also mentioned that I never had a quince but I was raised catholic (to let them know that I know what the video means).

And someone replied saying, then the video is not for me and to keep my thoughts to myself. Not everything needs to be shared. 

I replied asking why, I was only stating my opinions of what I would say and I never said anything negative to the girl in the video. Simply that I probably wouldn’t have if I were in that situation. I kept trying to defend myself because I truly meant no harm, I simply stated that I probably would have stayed put until everyone was done shaking hands. 

They posted this last thing “everyone has their opinions but not everything is meant to be shared, the person who posted this video was obviously trying to express how she felt on HER day so your comment was inconsiderate”

I truly don’t understand how I was being inconsiderate! I never meant any harm to the girl or any negativity. All I said was what I would’ve done if I had been in that situation. Was I wrong? 

Edit: she replied back saying that she understood that I meant no harm with my first comment but others could’ve,  that’s why she replied. I think she realizes that I truly meant no harm but doesn’t want to admit that she shouldn’t have replied to me. No one else took offense to my comment.

1j4iotl,Is confidence an unattainable goal for me?,"I always feel behind compared to my peers in terms of life experience. I was excluded a lot and an easy target a child in school (I was quiet and sensitive) and it’s shaped me badly as an adult. I have little self-confidence and a fear of upsetting people. I avoid saying “no” to people to avoid confrontation because it scares me so much, like heart racing, face burning, eyes tearing up. I can easily pick up if someone is displeased and for some reason it triggers these physical sensations and I automatically find myself scrambling to appease before I get yelled at. This is why I didn’t last in customer service jobs. If I feel like a confrontation is brewing, it makes my stomach churn. Again, I don’t know where this comes from as I didn’t grow up in a yelling/abusive environment. My parents are very supportive people. My mother is also a people pleaser (she suffered an abusive childhood) and I think growing up I adopted some of her habits.

I hate myself for being this way. At 30, I should have matured out of this. I want to be self-assured and I tell myself constantly “right, today will be the day where I become more assertive/confident/say no to people”. But the anxiety and self consciousness is always too strong. I just feel intimidated by people.

1j4cvlu,i constantly feel exposed,"i (20F) finished school a few years ago and i’ve been accepted into university. i struggled a lot at school with my mental health, and always felt like everyone just tolerated me, so i was excited to leave and ‘reinvent’ myself almost, by moving to a city where no one knew me and i could have a fresh start. 

my mental health struggles started when i was SA’d at 16, and then got into a relationship with a really toxic guy when i was 17 after i moved schools. he would constantly compare me (physically) to other girls, and just kept lying to me and gaslighting me, and assume i was too stupid to realise what he was doing (he would also make not-so-nice comments about me to his friends). i really did trust him at one point because i did consider him my best friend too, so i told him about the time i was SA’d, looking back i really regret it, because he’s told other people things i’ve told him in confidence before.

it took about 5 times for me to decide to cut things off in the end (i tried to give him lots of chances) but it was very messy. when i did end things, i noticed that a lot of our mutual friends were blocking/unfollowing me. others who i had a good relationship with at school would stare at me and not reciprocate any smile i offered, i would just get a blank cold stare as they walked past me.

when i thought about all of this, i came to the conclusion that he must’ve told people my SA secret, but he always tried to villainise me to literally everyone when i was in the relationship, so sometimes i make myself believe he’s spun things (since the alternative is that everyone just hates me) (for reference, i live in a very conservative and religious community)

this all started two years ago. i’ve been feeling exposed to the world for 2 years, and now feel as though even strangers know my deepest darkest secrets if they look at me for longer than a second. sometimes i wish i was invisible or could wear a veil so i could exist among people without feeling judged. 

i’ve now been chatting on social media with others who have been accepted onto the same course as me so we can get to know each other before the course begins, and i try to find some peace in the fact that these people are strangers and don’t know me or my story, but i often find any effort i make to participate in a conversation is ignored. there’s no way these people could know my problems so am i just unlikable?",Am I just unlikable?,"The individual is a 20-year-old female who finished school a few years ago and has been accepted into university.

1j4c0ld,Limited social skills and interacting with others,"So all my life I’ve been sort of lacking in the social skills department. Academic and other artistic skills have been very natural on to me the other hand.

My guess is I’m on the spectrum. I’ve never received an actual diagnosis although I’ve been to many health care professionals. I was told as an adult it’s hard to diagnose someone with autism and it’s a lengthy process so I never really cared to get more into it. 

I read somewhere a quote by the singer Sia who allegedly is on the spectrum. She said that every time she had to go out it’s like she  has to put a human suit on. As soon as I read that I felt I relate 100%.

I’ve been given different types of medications to deal with social anxiety but nothing worked in the long term. On the contrary they made my overthinking way worse. The only thing that actually helped in the past was alcohol and marijuna. I stopped using them long time ago though because I don’t like relying on substances to function socially.

I’ve found different types of approaches on certain sites online on how to deal with these shortcomings in a more natural way. Like when you talk to someone in person you focus on a specific part of their face. I honestly find that nerve racking. Like when I have to talk to someone I have to focus on a part of their face and at the same time act cool and try to keep having a conversation. Focusing that hard is just torturous, I just want that conversation to be over asap and leave. Anxiety is taking the best of me.

Also I’ve realized I can only hang out with one person at a time. Group hang outs are unbearable for me. If I have to be around people for a long period of time then I’d be drained for a very long time before I recoup and find my center again.

The thing is I enjoy being alone but I also like being with people when I feel like it. I just wish those interactions be easier to handle.

1j4a104,"Is it wrong to feel hurt/humiliated when your ""friends"" tease you? (19F)","19f and 157cm 

lately I've been almost bawling my eyes out everytime I felt mocked by a group of people.

first : some ""friends"" well more like my classmates laughed at me super in front of others ppl just because I said something, they were all against me and when I went to talk to someone else they just laughed super loud at my reaction I was holding back tears for the next hour and it destroyed my mood for the entire evening. 

second : my family, like, literally just my parents and older brother, sometimes I feel like they really want to make fun of me and put me down but ""they're just joking"" it's especially my mom who love to side with my brother to make fun of me. It always makes me feel either mad or humiliated.

third and last, happened today : a group of friends that is really fun and kind but they just always tease me for being short (and another friend, they like to compare our heights for fun and just laugh about it) and today they wouldn't stop joking and laughing about it, but not in a superrr mean way, just teasing a lot, it wasn't even funny and tbh it's tiring cause I heard this my whole life and they always bring it up, when I leaved I felt like crying.

I know the easy answer would be ""tell them you don't like that"" I don't think they would stop, it's not even that deep, I just don't understand with does it feel like and humiliation and lately it makes me super sad...ngl I'm on my period rn maybe it's why it makes me more emotional but even without that I just don't know how to react during those situations I can't fake laughing...

He's one of those that makes countless ""ironic"" jokes every time we meet. I'm ok with that, but every time I answer or make an ""ironic joke"" back, he gets offended and often ends the hangout or shuts off for the rest of the day.

I've tried talking to him about it, and he burst out crying. He said he's really sorry and he'll try to be better, it wasn't much of a conversation, but seeing how upset he was I believed he realised his behaviour and was going to stop.

I used to be a very shy and extremely insecure person about the way I talk, the way I think, and the way I do things, even though I'm very normal af. In social settings, passive listening became my defense mechanism.  
  
I made friends, but they were only with me because I was a good ""listener"". I knew every detail about my friends, but they knew nothing about me.

I was doing this with new friends as well.   
  
Maybe not intentionally, but most people love talking about themselves. If you just listen, they will enjoy your company until you start talking about yourself.

Slowly, I started relating to whatever story they were telling to my own life and then telling something about my life, or what I did today, or what funny thing happened to me, and most of the time I would get no reaction, nothing at all, so I stopped.

It made people uncomfortable to see me talking about myself; it became awkward because I was just a listener, or I was probably doing it wrong because I was out of practice.

I brought no value to the table because I never spoke my original ideas, thoughts, or opinions.  
  
People just respected me enough, I had no close friends; I was just the validator. I just couldn't disagree with someone and couldn't imagine someone disagreeing with me; I had no argument power.

I decided to change this after covid, reading books, listening to experts, trying to talk about myself with new people, changing my personality to be a talker instead of listener, found a balance between them, taking one step at a time and I've improved a lot, even my old friends have noticed the change and they feel it, they don't say it though.  
  
When I look back, I see a pattern of what I was doing:

I was so into myself, self-analyzing my every move, even the pauses between my breaths, rehearsing every move in my head before taking action, trying not to be stupid.  
  
This conditioning didn't just happen; I was bullied. It was normal bullying; everyone goes through this in high school and college, but not everyone chooses self-sabotaging behaviour as a defense mechanism.

I just wanted to share this story with people here, I know lots of people go through this, and guys, you have to talk about your stuff, even when they don't give a reaction, occupy a space, highlight your presence, stand for something, and pls pls stop living inside your head, all this will happen slowly, one step at a time, just know this, if something bad happens don't give up into your defense mechanism, keep trying, keep trying plss",How can I improve my ability to share my thoughts and experiences in social settings without feeling awkward or self-sabotaging?,"The individual in the Reddit post describes a background characterized by shyness and insecurity, particularly regarding their communication skills and interpersonal interactions.

1j47r0i,Struggling to Express Myself in Conversations,"Hey!

I've (25M) had this issue my whole life. I struggle to recall the right words in conversations, even though I have no problems with pronunciation or understanding. I can read something aloud perfectly and if I prepare what to say in advance, like for a presentation, I can communicate it really well. I suspect that because of this, one seems to notice anything wrong, they just assume I'm quiet or boring.

But in reality, I want to contribute more, engage better with people, and express the ideas I know I have. This is incredibly frustrating. It feels like there's a barrier between my thoughts and my ability to speak. And I believe I have a lot of meaningful things to share with the people around me.

It's particularly bad when I have to improvise, and come up with something on the spot, even if its about a fictional topic. I played a game with some friends in which random slides were shown, and you had to make up things to present in front of the others. This kind of thing is my literal nightmare and I can't seem to make anyone understand how difficult it is for me, so I am often pressured into it.

I have tried to practice by journaling and even having conversations with myself or ChatGPT. But I really struggle to find consistency with this. And it's so difficult to recall the words and find the right things to say.

1j46ghg,How to make my roommate respect my boundaries?,"Roommate + coworker at the same time being nosy and bossy

Hello reddit,

For the context: we 3 girls moved in to the work housing and started working at the same day.

I noticed that this one girl (Ill call her A) was kinda weird to me since day 1:

I was chilling on that day alone in my room cuz I was kinda tired and just was prepping for sleep and she with girl (lets call her B - she is chill) was talking in the loving room. A knocked on my door and opened it herself (small red flag - not respecting privacy if I dont lock myself up) to ask me to go talk to them. I did as I was new and felt the pressure to greet them. As I walked into the living room she instantly started assuming personal details about me in weird ways like:
“ you must be an only child, right? Because you are more quiet” “you look young, probably no stress in your life as a single child, right??”. It was so weird.
I didnt tell her much just looked at her like “wtf” and she even pointed out my facial expressions. Then she proceeded to “brag” how she finished some uni for communication sciences and that she is always interested in people. I ignorned her red flags as i didnt want tension since day 1 and we kinda all 3 talked about hobbies we do. 


For the context: I see her at work and at home everyday.

So you all see im a private person - maybe I reveal some details but thats all. I didnt talk to them much after 2 days as I was just doing my things and getting into my routine. But when A noticed my quietness and busy life she started getting more nosy. She was knocking on my door randomly to say “news” about work. Then she tried to “love bomb” me with compliments about how good I work and how my dressing up always looks nice. I would get frequent compliments from her randomly.

When I didnt pay attention to them she started micromanaging me and everytime I did a small “slipup” she would get right next to me to tell me that its wrong. I was ignoring her for a whole time until
today. I told her “hey why are you so interested in me all the time huh?” Then she got a bit red and ina bitchy tone said weird stuff like “oh I dont know why… I see nothing interesting and then proceeded to mumble something about me being weird but I barely could hear her and continued with ignoring her. 

She stopped for 2 hours - gossiped something to another girl and then again is acting like my “friend” now? 

I dont understand these people at all who mix the dynamic of friends, roommates and coworkers into a one big mess. How cant they understand that we live here professionally and work PROFESSIONALLY and we are not family members to be like this… 

How can I deal with her? I dont see a way to communicate with her as she doesnt seem to be mature tbh. Even if I try to mirror her and talk to her with her level of words she acts rather immature and gets angry about it not being her way.

Also the girl B lives with her in one room and kinda licked A’s ass to become “friends” with her. While I didnt as its not my thing to be friends here. Is it me being wrong and weird or her?

After I pointed that out, he got noticeably uncomfortable and soon after brought up the fact that I had failed a class before in a conversation, then chose to sit elsewhere.

1j42b2n,Something is Severely Wrong with Me,"I've been suffering with this issue of not getting along with a single person I meet. I think I have a fear of people in general, but that's not how it used to be. I'd always been a huge introvert, super competitive and somewhat insecure about my English skills, it was third language. the first time I made friends with someone, i felt like I'd made the bond of a lifetime. Even though we had our differences, I wanted it to work out so that we'd end up in the same college, share a dorm, visit each other, etc. 

Regardless of my hopes, none of this happened. We were so different that our friendship was detrimental. I think we both made each other feel insignificant. Until i met her, my biggest insecurity had always been growing up poor, but she made me feel ugly and unlikeable. I was ""egotistical"" and ""over competitive"". It didn't feel fair at all cuz I felt like she had all the opportunities in the world and was criticizing me for trying my best. I don't think I'm ugly at all and I had never valued romantic relationships but her sheer lack of belief that anyone would find me attractive made me very insecure.   
She on the other hand struggles with accepting people as they are. i think being with me exemplified that trait in her. She loves to take care of people and get easily offended when they try to seek their own freedom or express themselves. She has a heart of glass and defends anyone the same way she wants for herself. I was guilty to have her in my life because my lack of sensitivity to things meant that she'd be defending me more often than I would ever realize.

We parted without much of a conclusion. She was angel and I'm realizing as I'm writing right now. she did so much more for me than I had ever done for her. I shouldn't have disappeared unannounced but there was no other way that friendship would've worked. we never communicated, just had a mutual agreement that we liked the other person enough to give up a little part of ourselves. i miss how she made me feel, but while i was with her, i missed who i used to be. I've been depressed and defensive over the last few years after I lost my old self and no longer had her affection to keep me up either, but I'm not bitter anymore. I accept the fact that I really loved someone who understood nothing about me and she really cared for someone without expecting anything back.

My current situation is that I'm at a complete loss and find keep finding myself in situations where people are putting too much faith into me. I've been too unwell to take care of myself and have more people in my life that I have ever had before.

1j3zl16,How to connect with my friends and be a better friend to them?,"So recently I've reconnected with a friend after I left the group we were both in months ago and I have not been doing well. While she is still friends with the group, she treats me like my own person and so far she's been the first to invite me to things, and sends me videos, and she also texted me to share her good news. I haven't been very responsive to her because I don't know how to be a good friend in the same way. It's been a long time that I had experienced a good friendship as I had been going through a lot in the past few years, but I really appreciate her efforts and just the person she is. I would like to pour back into her cup and be a friend to her the way she needs.

I can really see that she is putting in effort to reach out and develop a friendship. I appreciate it so much that she shared her good news with me but I don't know how to go deeper and actually show and communicate that I am happy for her, so I send her a rather short text just congratulating her and asking some basic questions on her good news. We are planning to go for drinks and I still have a present for her from her birthday which I am excited to give. She took us all out for dinner and even paid for it.

I have been holding back from approaching her quite a lot because I am just so unsure how to be her friend and I am scared she realizes I am boring or am incapable of being her friend. I'd love to try and also show up for her not only in the way I am used to but also the way she needs without overstepping.

Some things about her: She has pets, loves dancing, just got a new job, got out of a relationship recently, very sweet and cheerful/supportive person, loves fashion and makeup.

About our friendship: we have only hung out alone 1 time outside of the old group and this was recently. We barely text as I don't know what to say and I am afraid what if we hung out and then we have nothing to talk about? we have things in common but I don't know how to connect with her cause i'm scared it's gonna be awkward and she won't be excited to hang out with me anymore.

1j3zskj,"Friend doesn't reply, but is able to send pictures of her child.","So I (F, age early 30s) get tired of this situation with one of my friends (F, age mid-20s). Sometimes I feel like I should just give up this friendship (or that she did) but then she pops up for a message and leaves me unread for days again.

The short explanation: she communicates a lot by sending me Snapchats (not in a conversation, she just sends me things) but doesn't read/answer WhatsApp texts actively (she has in the past) and doesn't really check in/take initiative to talk or plan things meanwhile anymore (she did this in the past too). Things have changed since she had a new relationship and a child, I understand and respect that, but it feels like she reaches out on Snapchat to 'send' instead of 'reaching out/checking in'

Full story; We have been friends for 3 years now. We used to text (almost) daily in the beginning and hung out more because we lived in the same city. I think I already noticed a chance in her texting habit during spring/summer 2023, when her colleague became her new boyfriend. She became pregnant of him that summer (she told me by text) and  and we texted less often or she would miss my messages when I reached out and we did hang out less often. She always says that I should just message again if she forgot to reply. She once told me  she had busy weeks because they had bought a house in a different village. She hadn't told me anything about seeing the house or bidding on a house. We did see each other a few times and she moved early 2024

Her baby was born in April '24. Of course, this changed her life and I respect and understand that. I've been to their house a few weeks after birth, traveling 1,5 hour and bringing dinner. Since then we have been seeing each other a few other times to have dinner,  mostly on my initiative. She did check in on her initiative, but a simple short conversation could spread over a week because it took her some time to reply or I had to remind her, but meanwhile she did send me Snapchats. She is pregnant again and expects her second baby in April'25. She told my via text again. Last time we saw each other was November '24. The last texting  or checking in initiative from her side was a Happy new year text on January 1. Her birthday was in last January and we agreed upon  having lunch or dinner to catch up, before her due date. I reminded her several times and asked her what she wanted. I told her: just think about it and let me know when and where. One month ago I reminded her again, she said she didn't know where to eat. After this I once texted her about something else, because I didn't want to push and understood she had a lot on her mind. She also had to have iron IV in the hospital: she sent a Snapchat pic of the hospital entrance (guided by a text about appointments so I don't think it was a radical emergency) and one of her IV) and I messaged her that I hoped that she would feel better. She also sent me pictures of the baby rooms. But she didn't come back to the food date, neither did she check in on me. She sent things on her Instagram story or replied to mine, but still she didn't check in about it. Again, I understood and didn't talk to her either.

Last Thursday  I checked in if she still wanted to eat and catch up. She replied last Saturday. She still wanted it and asked me where we wanted to go. She said things have been hectic lately (which I fully understand) and said she is on maternity leave now, so she has time to recover. I told her it was OK and I gave a few options. It's Wednesday now. She hasn't replied yet. Meanwhile, I've sent her Snapchats which she saw but didn't reply to. She has seen my Instagram stories (of me having dinner in a restaurant where I went with her too). But still no reply. I thought: maybe she wants to let things fade, and I have thought this multiple times before. But today she sent me Snapchats of her child again, so it still feels like she wants to stay connected. But it also feels like she is sending instead of checking in. I understand her life being pregnant while already having a child is tough. But I feel tired of being the one who has to remind her constantly. I tried planning this dinner for over a month now without any result, I am done taking initiative. It's not that 'we must go out for dinner',  I definitely don't want to push it and if it wouldn't happen it's okay. I am actually afraid that I get so annoyed that I hardly feel like going out to eat anymore in the end lol. And I know, I should be patient and I respect and understand this situation. But I have asked her multiple times if she wanted it before or after her due date, if it was still okay.

1j3yowi,How to reconnect with friends,"I’ve been really close friends with two people since middle school, but during junior year I got caught up in school and EC’s focusing on building my app for colleges. I didn’t spend much time with them outside of school + I don’t really text people in general aside from replying to instagram stories & notes, but I didn’t realize how much I was ruining my relationship with them. During that time, they became close with another girl who I don’t know very well. I’m not great at making friends from friends but I’ve been doing my best to become closer to her in my senior year this year.

They also note that they struggle to make friends from existing friendships. In their senior year, they are attempting to become closer to this new girl, but they feel disconnected from their original two friends due to differing interests, particularly around reading and social activities.

1j3y7q2,How do i deal w being left out in friend groups?,"my freshman year in university is about to come to an end and it has probably been the worst year for me socially. this is like the second friend group i'm a part of that has repeatedly left me out a number of times. we used to be a lot closer but now it's very different.

i'm never called to join them when they go for events anymore and i'm never the one they hang out with. like it's literally so frustrating to me because we were all SO CLOSE and there was some drama in between but after a long confrontation and apologies from both ends, and promises that that would be put in the past, i feel like now there's an even bigger barrier between me and them. i'm honestly so frustrated because i used to be left out on purpose numerous times in high school and was so looking forward to begin university so i could finally find my people- but i've failed myself.

it's a really awkward situation because whenever i'm with them, their body language towards me versus the others is completely different. i wont be acknowledged in the group, i wont be spoken to, and if i speak, it's embarrassing enough because no one would even both responding to me, so now i just keep quiet. the 2 other people that i was the closest to in the group now hang out together and dont even bother to call me (i saw them buy dinner together and realised that if this were to happen a few months ago, i'd have been a part of the plan).

i j dont know what to do. ive even spoken to my friends multiple times about the fact that i feel theyre acting weirder than usual around and with me, but they always assure me that they love me and will never intentionally make me feel left out. theyve also stated that most of the time they meet is coincidentally and unplanned. but im starting to not believe this because the way that they behave consistently says otherwise and idk how it's possible for everyone except me to be at the same place at the same time everyday with the same bunch of people. ive been told to talk to more people, but the more people i talk to, the more i feel like an antisocial freak who cant form yet alone maintain relationships for shit. i j hate myself for this...","What should I do if I feel consistently left out by my friends, despite expressing my feelings to them?","The individual is currently a freshman in university and has faced significant social challenges throughout the year.

There is an implication that their family situation or upbringing may have influenced their perception of social dynamics, as they relay experiences of being treated in a condescending manner by peers, which may have shaped their current reluctance to ask for help or engage with others. They mention that even friends from their past exhibited this behavior, contributing to their feelings of isolation and making them question their own experiences and reactions.

Age 39, midlife crisis ... 'what the fuck do I do to fix myself?' google search, buy books, become my own psychologist, try doing my own speech and language therapy ...

Two months of that, the screaming turns into perfect, faultless endless uncontrollable assertive blabbering.

I go outside, to disability centers and art studios and such. Then after a while to social things from meetup.

Endless praise and compliments for 'Omg how well do you speak? You are so intelligent, I don't have anything I want to say, I just want to hear you talk'.

One employer thinks I'm better than Jesus. The other when I met her is staring at me gobsmacked after presenting myself - 'Why would you even need speech therapy? You already talk perfectly?'.

Anything I read, any words I come across, instantly learned. Faultless linguistic processing and thoughtless impulsive verbal perfection in any situation. 

Inside I am cold and dead. Nothing and no ones satisfies me. I see everyone else as a pawn, most are stupid. I want nothing to do with this world or its people. But apparently going outside is better than staying inside.

He speaks very aggressively with me from the moment we met, but not with others in the group. I'm the only one who looks the way I do. I always talk respectfully with him, treat him kindly and listen as I do with everyone else and answer his many questions he asks me like ""What brings you here!!!?"" ""You're the new guy! Why are you in this group?!!!""

Some of the other things he'll do is ask me aggressively how I'm doing. He'll go ""So are you going to tell me how you're doing or are you just wasting my time?!"" And if I ask what he means or politely tell him that's rude he'll just square up, stare right at me and repeat the question until I answer it, keep staring at me menacingly until I break eye contact then walk by almost bumping into me, especially when no one's looking. He often refers to me as ""kiddo"" and goes ""the boy is not yet a man"" if no obe's in ear shot.

1j4ljrc,Why am I so lonely? What can I do?,"I feel very lonely and always have as far as I remember (start of primary school). I was not completely alone, but only ever had one or two good friends around. I am now 24 and I don't have any social circle, I have one childhood friend that I see once a year at most. I also never had a boyfriend or even dated. It actually feels terrible to write this down.

I've gone through most of my life in a kind of lethargy where I didn't think about my social struggles, but it always hit me from time to time, realising how lonely I was.

I think I've progressed over the years, tiny steps over decades, going from a completely silent child, to answering when talked to, to even approaching people.

I find it hard to explain exactly what I struggle with. I am shy and introverted, but not to a point that it's crippling. I have a normal functioning life and can do all daily tasks that involve being around people. I've gone through school and uni, also worked and had quite good experiences from a professional point of view. Generally, I don't have big problems with interactions that are functional and practical. I can give a presentation in class, I'll be stressed just before and am not a great public speaker, but it doesn't worry me. I can ask strangers in the street for information. However I struggle with personal and emotional interactions. Naturally, I keep to myself, I'm silent. I find it hard to have a casual conversation. I have to push myself and I end up overthinking, which doesn't help with having a nice natural conversation.

Also, I don't make any negative projection about social events or ruminate on them after they happened, or at least not consciously. I can bring myself to social gatherings - I can physically bring myself but that's almost as much as I can do. I then am very silent in most situations, and again I don't find myself ruminating - thinking about what others think of me, or feeling unappreciated - as some psychologists have asked. The one thing I may overthink about is, what do I say ? How do I keep the conversation going ? Because if I don't, I don't talk.

Every casual social interaction is work. I have to push myself and think about it. I don't have the drive or desire or motivation to do it. I do it because I think I have to, because I can see that being so lonely makes me feel miserable, because I imagine that having friends must be nice. I realise that I rarely enjoy those interactions.

I've been feeling down lately. I've started my master in a new uni, and with a new start came a desire to change things, as it has at several points in my life. But as I'm wanting and working to change, I end up constantly thinking about this struggle. I'm deeper and deeper into rumination, more than I've ever been, and I'm starting to regret the sweet lethargy I lived in accepting my loneliness. I'm constantly asking, Why am I so lonely? What is wrong with me? Why is it so hard? How many years of social skills development do I have to catch up on? Will things ever be different when they've been like this my whole life? Can I be someone else than who I am? Why does it hurt so much? Why is it so easy for others?

I feel locked in and unable to connect with people. I would like to have friends, but I think mostly I would like to want to make friends.

I've been to therapy several times, but as I struggle to talk about myself and my emotions it's not really led anywhere. I've been on antidepressants for 3 years and it's relieved me but not helped actually change anything about what makes me suffer. I've also tried theater workshops and gone to volunteer workcamps among others, maybe not enough.

In my recent attempts to 'change things', I've made continuous efforts to go towards people and to social events. I came to integrate some things, like: change does not happen in your head but in your actions so try to do a little thing everyday, or you can talk about anything, the topic doesn't actually matter. Yet it is still so hard, it all feels like work, a lot of effort with little reward or enjoyment. Actually, I think I've made a friend, the first in a long time (hurray!).

1j4iqkn,Took a HUGE Step Today,"Hey everyone,

I feel this huge need to share my experience from today. This is my first ever post on Reddit, so please be kind.

A little background: I've struggled with social anxiety since I was a teenager, but I was diagnosed a few years ago. Two years ago, I completed a six-month outpatient therapy program. After that, I was able to leave the house and manage my anxiety around neighbors. However, many social situations remained a challenge, and coping with them was often a real struggle. I've also had a major problem with phone calls throughout my life (my narcissistic father used to harass me by calling and verbally abusing me).

Now, for today's situation:

My wife was at a clinic today, and she told me what happened during her doctor's appointment. It really upset me, and I felt like we weren't being treated fairly. I won't go into all the details, but I think many of you would agree with us. And you know what I did? I called that clinic and told them I didn't agree with how we were being treated. My voice was shaking, I was having trouble breathing, but... I did it! I'm 32 years old, and this is the first time in my life I've ever called to make a complaint. Once the initial emotions subsided, I felt like I'd landed on the moon. It's a giant leap for me.

It ended with me writing an additional email to the clinic's manager with my complaint. Now I'm scared that when I wake up tomorrow, my courage and energy will have faded, and I'll be too afraid to read their reply, but I don't want to think about that right now.

Thanks if you took the time to read this.

1j4hjjc,How do you enjoy your time in overwhelming social settings?,"I’m currently a senior in high school and it’s senior night and my social anxiety is hindering me from enjoying my time.

A little context: My social anxiety got really bad in the past year to the point I have really bad panic attacks, I had to switch to a small school bc the amount of ppl at my old school made me not want to go (I barely go to my small school bc I’m still scared of the amount of people) I don’t like going outside in fear of someone looking at me or talking to me, I have no friends, and try to avoid any and all social interactions at all costs which is ruining my life.

I decided to come to senior night bc it seemed fun and bc I missed out on a lot of school activities bc of my anxiety and depression; when I got here I saw the amount of ppl and wanted to instantly run out but forced myself to stay and have a good time…. Bad idea. I got in line and the thought of ppl looking at me made me want to cry, until a girl DID look at me and I ran. 

There’s food and I was going to get food until I realized ppl would be serving us and I’d have to talk to them to tell them what I wanted, and instead of getting food bc I was hungry I decided to let my anxiety win and I ran to the furthest seat away from ppl that I could find. It’s only been 20 mins and there’s  2 hours left, my mom told me to enjoy myself  but the thought of ppl surrounding me is making me have a panic attack. There’s no one who can pick me up so I’m stuck here looking at kids my age have the time of their life with friends I wish I had.

1j4ajem,How do you guys deal with embarrassment?,"I have some social anxiety, but I think it's gotten much better throughout the years. However, the one thing I continue to deal with is stressing out over embarrassing situations, to the point that it consumes the thoughts for the entire day and I start hating myself for it. 

For example, today, I went to a group fitness class at this recreation centre that I work at. I got to the facility late and couldn't remember where this exact fitness class was being held. Therefore, I went into the wrong class as soon as it was beginning, and then asked one of the participants which class this was. They told me the name of the class, for which I realized I walked into the wrong one. No worries - so I went back to the desk at the front and asked my coworker where this class was. They redirected me to the right class and I went there. 

When I got to the class, it seemed full and everyone was already sitting down on a mat. I stood there in silence and looked around, for which the instructor (who was in the back of the room) told me that there was space at the front of the room. I saw an empty mat at the front, grabbed it, and moved it over to the side. A participant who was there then yells out ""that mat is actually for the instructor."" So, I was like ""Oh..."" Then, I looked around for empty mats and asked the entire class ""where do I get a mat then?"" The entire class then told me that it was in the back. So, I went to go get a mat and this was where a participant came and got me equipment as he could tell that I was lost and this was my first time joining. Therefore, I got my mat and equipment, and then placed it down. 

As I was walking out after the class, the lid on my water bottle wasn't closed properly. So, my entire water bottle fell down and I spilled water in the hallway. I quickly grabbed it, and then went downstairs to tell housekeeping about this, for which they did. 

Deep down inside, I know it's not a big deal and everyone deals with awkward situations from time to time that everyone will forget about. However, now I'm stressing over this situation, especially since I work there and several of the participants recognized me. I hate being put on the spot and not knowing what I'm doing in any situation. I know I won't think of this in a week, but now I don't ever want to join that class again. How do you deal with this?

1j48s1r,"What's a ""Negative Narcissist""? I Think This May be Me","It’s what I call it and is a plague on the world today. I’ve been one myself.

In my experience people who feel this way at some point usually found some disdain for narcissists. Maybe your parent was one. Maybe your classmate was self absorbed because they got all the attention. It could be from a multitude of things.

Basically at some point what you have done is reversed narcissism in order to combat it.

You feel like other people can find love and relationships but you can’t. There is something so wrong with you that nobody should ever be able to like you. **You’re somehow the worst of the worst**.

See it’s funny because it still ends up being narcissism. The only difference being instead of having a delusion that you’re greater than everybody else, you instead have the delusion you’re **worse** than everybody else.

Take it from someone who felt the same way for a long time and healed past it. You’re worth it. No matter what you feel is wrong with you - there is someone out there for you. If you have people interested in you now it’s not because something is wrong with you. It’s simply because they like you.

So to think someone liking you means something is inherently wrong with them - is an asinine assumption. They just like you.

I believe this is my #1 issue affecting me. It's why I have a long trail of ""destruction"" of not following up with people who actually liked me. I remember several 'love at first sights"" (please no stupid science talk about brain chemicals or lust, please shut up) but I remember always thinking ""Awww how cute, you like me just by the sight of me...wait til you really get to know me, then you'll be gone and say to yourself 'what was I thinking?'

These were opportunities where I could've actually gotten a life. But I obviously didn't.

I'll never see her again...it's like 5 years since it happened. Now what is she doing? I feel like we were meant for each other. How on Earth can she find someone else? People would kill to have this female attention.

I never understood what people saw in me? And if they did, I was always like ""What is wrong with you""?

Can anybody relate?",How can I overcome feeling like I'm unworthy of love and relationships?,"The individual in the Reddit post expresses feelings of deep insecurity and self-doubt, particularly concerning their worthiness of love and relationships. They imply a history of negative experiences related to narcissism, suggesting that they may have dealt with a parent or peers who exhibited narcissistic traits. This background has contributed to their belief that they are fundamentally unworthy of affection and that anyone who expresses interest in them is misjudging the situation.

The person reflects on missed opportunities in their romantic life, noting a pattern of not following up with individuals who liked them, which they attribute to their self-perception.

The thing is everytime when I put some parfume that I know that smells amazing or am just feeling confident in wearing it, when I exist my home and start to go to school I just start to be very self-conscious and the parfume just starts to smell disgusting ( thats what I start and think whenever this happens ). Like for example, a year ago I wear parfume at school after not wearing any for most of my middle schoo ( the only smell that I had was the conditioner(?) that my clothes were wash with and that has no smell or just a fresh and flowery one ) and at first I felt very confident in my parfume and that it smelled amazing. When I got to school I still felt very good about myself, but the moment when my friend started and talking about how the class smells like a old house or something. I just felt my whole confident disappear and felt tears forming in my eyes ( I thought and still think that she probably spoke about my parfume ) and for the whole day I just felt miserable. I didn't even take my jacket off, to not make my parfume noticable. I don't know if it's anxiety or something because most of times I have a very big ego and a normal type of confidence ( I think ) and I don't why I feel this way every time when I wear parfume.

1j42p0x,Say something you love about yourself everyday.,"Nothing changes if nothing changes. At the end of the day, social anxiety is a self esteem problem. Knowing who are and sticking to that is so much more powerful than exposure therapy or self medicating(things like alcohol). Those things aren't sustainable, but having confidence in yourself is. But it's also not enough to just say what you love about yourself, you have to reaffirm those beliefs with what happens in real life. Confirmation bias, you know? For example, if you think that you're dumb when it comes to chemistry, than you're naturally not gonna put your best foot forward because what's the point? And then when you don't study, you'll fail your tests and then you actually will be dumb at chemistry. Failing your tests confirms to your subconscious mind that initial belief that you're dumb when it comes to chemistry, and the cycle goes on. And it doesn't even matter if you pass the next test because your brain is now conditioned to think you're dumb, so anything that goes against that belief is kind of treated like background noise. But vice versa, in regard to self esteem, if you keep believing you're funny and have a good personality, your subconscious is gonna be looking for real life events to reaffirm that belief. So things like an awkward conversation or terrible presentation are kind of treated like background noise because they don't help confirm the narrative. So everyday, find something you love about yourself and look to confirm that. This will help build your self esteem and in a few months, things WILL change. Trust me.",How can I build my self-esteem and change negative thought patterns about myself?,"The individual appears to be dealing with social anxiety and self-esteem issues.

1j3yx51,How do you deal with looking young for your age and condescending people??,"
Every time someone brings up my appearance and how “young” I look, I always get set back and I’m not sure how to deal with it. I know a lot of people use it as a compliment, but I feel like I don’t get taken serious. I’ve actually been doing really well with my SA, but this recent interaction set me back. 

So to begin, one of my mom’s coworker came up to me to introduce himself. This was an older man maybe 60-70, Im 29F. He kept looking me up and down so I felt uncomfortable from the beginning. He asked me what grade I was in, which I’m not sure if he was trying to be friendly or what but his tone said otherwise. My mind went blank, I was sort of taken aback all I said was “I’m not in school”. My mom ended up chiming in with my age and he said “I know, but she looks nowhere CLOSE to 29”. He then asked me about college and what my major was. At this point my anxiety was going crazy so I accidentally told him the wrong major. He made a joke about it and instead of correcting him I just awkwardly agreed. The joke was also borderline patronizing, but I just wanted the conversation to be over. I regret not correcting him. 

In the end he kept saying “it was nice to meet you” really slowly. The whole interaction felt super weird and condescending.

The thing is whenever someone brings up how young I look, I revert back to that awkward teen I used to be with severe SA. Not only that, but I feel like they see me as inferior and talk down to me. I’ve tried everything to look “older” and every time I finally think I look at least in my 20’s I get interactions like this. 

Also want to add, ive spent years working on my confidence and it’s definitely much better now than it’s ever been, but this specific problem always knocks me down. At this point I feel like only time would help, but any advice would be appreciated!","How can I deal with people who comment on how young I look, as it affects my confidence and makes me feel serious anxiety?","The individual in the post is a 29-year-old woman who has struggled with severe social anxiety (SA) in the past.

I admire any person who, despite being ""weird"", shows themselves as they are, is not ashamed of being themselves, has no complexes, sees life in a simple way, doesn't constantly think about pleasing others, they simply have something that I've never experienced and that is why I admire them with all my soul. 

I wish to be like them, even if just for a moment, to experience what it feels like to be like that, to show myself as I am without feeling like a monster, to start conversations without feeling like a nuisance to others, to be rejected without feeling like my life is going to end and to prove to myself what I am capable of...
 
I wanna prove to myself that I was completely wrong, prove to myself that I can be funny and interesting to some people, prove to myself that I can be truly loved by someone, prove to myself that I can accept criticism and bad experiences and go on with my life like nothing happened, prove to myself that, at least for a second, I am a person worth getting to know...

1j3x8fa,How do you navigate confusing friendships?,"Throughout this post I replace details and names with substitutes, but the overall idea is entirely the same.

Within the last few (6-7) months I met a group of people by playing online D&D whom I very much enjoy my time with, both inside our games and outside when we're hanging out in calls. Everyone is very openly positive, which is something I think really helped me, as I've been somewhat rude and over reliant on banter for a long time in my limited past friendships. So throughout the time we've met, I've tried quite a bit harder to be open to their kindness, and to reciprocate as well as possible. To be completely clear, I am not forcing myself to do so, but I am actively trying to be more direct with compliments for example, rather than hiding it behind a joke. (which is really damn hard to do, but we do our best out here)

One of the members I started talking a bit more with 1-on-1, sharing hobbies like art/music etc. They were even open enough to discuss how they handle mental health problems, and problems they have themself. One that is specifically and important for this post is that they (paraphrasing) **""tend to interact less when they're feeling down""** which is no problem to me! My issues is that they also said not long after that (paraphrasing again) **""struggle to start a conversation or invite others, which sometimes leads to people thinking they aren't interested in being friends even though they like talking""**, which again, entirely fair and I'm glad to know its nothing against me. Basically said, I am willing to try and put myself in discomfort to start a conversation if they don't want to initiate.

Now, where I get especially confused is our D&D sessions, during and after they interact completely naturally with everyone. Yet sometimes for several weeks they'll ghost my messages? I also understand this way of thinking may make me come across as 'needy', but I really am more confused on if they would rather have me wait for them to respond, or for me to seek out conversation first? I want to emphasize that I do just like having conversations, cause we share hobbies, though I'm not sure how to navigate this without looking like I'm scrounging for their attention.

Lastly I should note that I asked them before if I was **""sending too many messages or being overwhelming""** and got an answer along the lines of **""the pace is fine, lots of things are stressful but it's a coping mechanism.""**

I also do interact with other group members privately as well, in which I believe conversation is pretty natural between us. I want to know if there's a way to do the same for this friend without stressing them out by asking again...",How can I navigate my friendship with someone who occasionally ghosts my messages while still wanting to have conversations with them?,"The individual in the Reddit post has engaged in online D&D gaming for about 6-7 months, which has led to forming a group of friends.

1j3wr16,"""just step out of your comfort zone"" will not work for you","I just wanna let it out. I have social anxiety and find it difficult to communicate with people IRL. Most of my friends are my internet friends and sometimes when people figure this out, they would say like ""bro, you should just exit your comfort zone. Go and touch grass, it's not that hard"". In fact I actually used to believe in it and sometimes I'd visit public events just to try seeking friend or at least having a genuine conversation. Eventually it ended up being me, approaching people, saying hi and not only not knowing what to say next, but feeling embarrassed as hell. More over, I can't say that those people were bad, they actually seemed nice and kind and some of them even tried keeping the convo and I did my best to be funny and nice, but as I've already said, it ended up being me, not knowing what to say. As I was leaving the events, I just felt miserable, I didn't feel like I've learnt something new AT ALL and it only made things even worse.

The truth is that people who give you this advice are usually looking at you from their point of view. Different people grow up in different environments. Some of them live in a nice family, have numerous siblings, lucky to find friends at early age, consequently they have been developing their social skills for their ENTIRE LIFE. From that POV giving such advice is just disrespectful. I'm myself good at math and I play electric guitar pretty well, but if I saw someone struggling with a task, I'd never say to them ""bruhh it's so easy, just use this theorem and you're done"" or ""bro just move your fingers this way and try playing faster and faster, you're just seeking attention rn💀💀"". Social skills are SKILLS in the first place and not only they require lots of practice but they also require very specific knowledge -- how to act in different kinds of situations, how to be funny and etc. People I had mentioned above already have this knowledge. If you heard someone whose native language is Cantonese or Arabic saying that ""bruuuh those language are easy"", you'd definitely just call them fools, but why isn't it the same with those whose native language is social skills?🤔",How can I improve my social skills despite having social anxiety?,"The individual expressing their feelings in the Reddit post has social anxiety, which significantly impacts their ability to communicate with people in real life.

1j3uzxs,I'm Just Not a Likable Person,"Not really sure where to start, but essentially, the title sums it up. I don't really have any redeemable qualities. 

People tend to think I am a narcissist (maybe I am, this whole issue is all about me when I'm sure others experience worse daily) because I often speak with relatively formal language when I'm around strangers. Nobody wants to be around me because I'm a depressing loser. Even if someone wanted to speak to me, I would be too much of a coward to do anything more than nod and maybe mutter out a two-word response. I have no skills- I want to be a writer, but I'm unable to organize my thoughts enough to put them on a page, I want to code and learn game development, but I don't have the energy to work on it and I only barely have necessary resources, which might conk out at any moment.  
I'm not interesting- I've done nothing in my fetid little life anyone else hasn't. I'm not smart- I'm failing most of my classes. (I'm 17).  
I'm lazy and disgusting and boring, and I'm so stupid and cowardly I can't even go to the store on my own.  
I'm not interested in anything people of my generation are, even if I try to make myself- I can't talk to my peers. Just the thought of being looked at by someone at school gives me panic attacks when I'm staring at the door, ready to start walking.  
I'm not attractive either.

I have one friend, and even she is only friends with me because we were when we were little- when I wasn't so fucked up, and she's moving to a different fucking country the moment she turns 18.

I know, it's not anyone's fault but mine. I just need to try harder. But I don't know what the hell I'm meant to do. I've taken antidepressants (Sertraline/Zoloft). It did nothing, but I kept taking them anyway, still nothing, then my mother just stopped taking me to the Psychiatrist for some reason, I didn't say anything because I didn't want to hurt her feelings, and it's been too long anyway. I've tried exercise, it does nothing but make my body sore and give me more time to think about terrible shit. I've tried talking to people through the fear, they just look at me like I'm a creep or an idiot. I've tried meditation, it just pisses me off because I can't think of anything other than the feeling of things on my skin- makes me sick. I try to be as nice to others as I can. Sometimes it makes me feel good in the moment, but soon I always realize I'm only doing it for myself anyway.  
  
I don't want to burden my family or my friend or teachers or anyone else with this. I'm already enough of a burden just by being around.

I just don't understand. Everyone else I've ever met, even people who have done horrible things to people I care about, have something good about them. Not me.

Whatever I try, however hard I try, I'm still a bad person. Whatever I do, I'm always lonely.

1j3u35q,Highly Sensitive - Can't Find a Job,"I tried my luck at a call center that was work from home because I felt like, being in the comfort of my own home, I could deal with the pressure of the call center. Once my training finished I quickly realized I could not handle it. I was having panic attacks every day, sick to my stomach dreading every shift, and crying during phone calls. I had to quit and have been unemployed for almost 2 months now. Applying for jobs but haven't gotten an acceptance yet.  
  
I am at my whits end here. I don't know what to do. I am a very sensitive person, any time someone raises their tone at me or just gets upset about something in general I can't handle it and it usually ends with me crying. This economy is so brutal and I know I really need a job but I feel like I can't do anything right. I don't feel like I'm good at anything, I can't handle any sort of pressure and I'm a sensitive crybaby. 

I have my high school diploma and an associates degree in an applied science. My associates degree was for Paralegal Technology which ended up being a waste because my first and only job as a paralegal, I learned quickly that lawyers were generally rude and did not have any patience with me.

I feel so dumb because it feels like the more pressure I'm under, the less I use my brain. My drivers ed instructor told me I was 'scared stupid' and I would say that's a pretty accurate description of me.  
  
I have worked with a therapist for almost 6 years now and I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I do take an SSRI. I think it has helped, but I'm still a very emotional person.

Their relationship lasted about five months, during which their girlfriend cheated on them multiple times and eventually ended the relationship due to the individual’s perceived lack of self-worth.

Currently, the individual is in their mid-20s and has a job where they have developed an interest in a female coworker, but they struggle to initiate conversations with her due to fear of negative reactions. They have only exchanged brief talks with her a few times over several months and feel a significant lack of self-esteem, comparing their social and romantic development to that of a middle schooler. They express feelings of hopelessness regarding their ability to form meaningful connections with potential partners.

1j3kzvm,"Title: What’s a good way to call out mildly rude, condescending people?","I’ve noticed that some people (the office manager at the doctor's office, the admin at public school, restaurants...) have this way of being just *subtly* rude—enough to make you uncomfortable but not enough to outright confront. They’ll say things like:

* *""I told you so.""*
* *""You don’t understand what I’m saying.""*
* *""I don’t have to teach you how to do \[whatever\].""*
* *""You didn’t tell me it’s for here.""* (when they actually forgot to ask)

It’s not full-blown aggression, but it’s dismissive, condescending, and just annoying. I don’t necessarily want to start an argument, but I’d love to have a few simple, short responses that call out their behavior and express dissatisfaction without escalating things. Being a lifelong social anxious person, this has been really hard for me.

A couple of tactics I came across that seem to make a lot of sense but haven't mustered the courage to try:

* **Act confused:** *""Excuse me, I didn’t quite catch that—can you repeat?""* Sometimes, this makes them realize their tone was off.
* **Mirror them:** Just repeat back exactly what they said. *""Oh, I don’t understand what you’re saying?""* This can make them rethink their approach.

1j3iirw,How did you get over social anxiety/overthinking social situations WITHOUT alcohol?,"24M. Do any of you notice their social anxiety completely disappear if they have 1-2 drinks of alcohol (getting buzzed, not drunk)?

For example if i am at a restaurant, club or bar setting and I have 1-2 drinks - I can approach a girl without any hesitance, I know what to say exactly without thinking about it and usually my success is pretty high with girls in this case.

However lets say If i don't have these 1-2 drinks and I am in the same setting or at the gym - I would overthink what to say, how she will react to it etc. and usually never make the approach due to my racing mind. Which is obviously not what I should be doing, since I am a good looking guy and when i am in that ""buzzed state"" and I actually take action it's usually a success.  
  
I don't want to rely on alcohol at all for social situations - I still wouldn't mind have a drink here and there, but I want to have this same confidence and state of fearlessness without it. Any solid advice?  

My close friend told me that essentially alcohol numbs your fears and that's why it works so well, however that I should not rely on it.   
  
What he also told me and I think this is a very good point is that If in that moment that I see a cute girl at the gym for example and I FEEL the anxiety - regardless of it to make the approach and that once I do it, conquering this fear will essentially get rid of this anxious state.",How can I build confidence in social situations without relying on alcohol?,"The individual is a 24-year-old male who experiences social anxiety, particularly in environments like restaurants, clubs, bars, and the gym.
