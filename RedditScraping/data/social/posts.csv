2025-02-27 22:22:00,1izs8zi,I don’t really want to socialize,"I guess I could use some advice on this.

I’m somewhat interested in talking and meeting with new, like minded people, but there’s some people I find somewhat annoying or I just don’t click with so I usually keep to myself. I have a pretty good circle of friends and I do wish to get closer to them, but sometimes I yearn to meet cool people I see on the streets, but I feel at peace not going out of my way to talk to strangers and strengthening the relationships I have.

I don’t really mind people coming up to me to strike a conversation, but again, I’m not that interested to go up to people like that.

Anyone else feel like this? If you’ve got a good circle of friends around you, do you feel the need to keep socializing and make even more friends and connections?",Do you feel the need to keep socializing and make more friends and connections if you already have a good circle of friends?,"The individual expresses a desire to talk and meet new people but often feels more comfortable keeping to themselves. They mention having a pretty good circle of friends and a wish to get closer to them, indicating a stable social foundation.

Despite this, they express a lack of interest in initiating conversations with strangers. Overall, their background suggests a balance between maintaining existing friendships and a cautious approach to expanding their social network.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1izs8zi/i_dont_really_want_to_socialize/,socialskills
2025-02-27 22:20:05,1izs7fr,"My friend/roommate constantly tries to socialise with my friends, but his input is really awkward and out of place.","I don't really know if there's a word or a name for this, but I have a friend who can't seem to take a hint and awkwardly butts into a lot of social situations with jokes or remarks that are out of context. (This happens for both online friends I'm speaking to, or friends I have over.)

He's the nicest guy in the world but his interests are niche and the things he remark on are always oddly specific and irrelevant? I can handle it when I'm on my own, but it feels like his social skills in group settings (even if the group is just three of us) are just non-existent. 

For the purposes of the examples, I'll call him friend B. 

Friend A and I are watching a show or a movie. We're chatting over some of it, unless we're super invested, especially if we're trying to figure out the mystery or the gimmick or the plot. ""X character did this in the second episode,"" ""but Y character did that in the sixth!"" And if he's come in to sit around with us, Friend B'll just say ""Wow that guy has a really small head."" or ""Hah, look at the name of that shop in the background.""

This same vibe gets translated over to Friend B butting in on conversations, inside jokes. It's absolutely fine if he's included from the start, but it's the sort of 'desperate intrusion' and the 'awkward focus' that gets me. And always on details that just aren't something anyone (I hate to say it) normal would focus on. Mind you, it's fine to notice small details and stuff.  

I am incredibly straightforward with him; ""Read the room dude. We're talking about XYZ."" ""That's not relevant to what we're discussing."" Sometimes it's as straightforward as him not needing to be in on the conversation at all (I like to keep some friends separate, and that separation is required because sometimes my friends and I have specific vibes. Either more professional, more carefree, and sometimes even more offensive or dark humour being the norm.)

But I feel bad rebutting his attempts at being included. I don't want to brush them off, because it makes my other friends feel somewhat awkward too. And to be honest, I just feel like if I don't say anything, he'll never improve? 

**Even if his opinions are valid, there's a time and a place for him to insert himself, and add his puzzle-piece-from-another-box in.** 

  
I have suspected he might be tremendously but unknowingly autistic, but I don't know how to deal with it, and right now the only way seems to be open-handed reprimand (which I fear he may not even be understanding, on a fundamental level). 

  
What can I do to make him understand that he needs to... I guess think about the relevance of what he's saying before saying it? Or knowing when to **butt** out? Without making him feel too **left** out.",How can I help my friend understand when to stay out of conversations and to consider the relevance of his remarks without making him feel excluded?,"The Reddit post does not provide specific background information about the individual in crisis, such as their education, family situation, or work history.

2025-02-27 22:02:07,1izrsfz,How to socialize,"Ok I have a genuine problem since I'm studying law and want to become an attorney one day. I need my social skills to be on a decent level. Problem is most of my life I spent being isolated in my own room from other people. I have social anxiety and I might be on the autism spectrum. Whenever I talk to someone I feel like the atmosphere is always tense and aside from small talk I don't have real friends. I have 0 information about other people, no idea what they like, what they do etc. In my first year of college I tried to form as many friendships as I could, but I don't think it worked, because now in second year I feel like no one wants to talk to me. I take pretty good care of myself, decent physique, take care of hygiene, at least average in terms of looks (I used to model lol). I also have some hobbies that I can talk about, but I share stuff about myself after knowing people for some time. 

My question is how can I improve my social skills, have other people trust me, want to talk to me and form real bonds with people? How can I improve my social skills? (there is literally NOTHING on the internet I found helpfull, always some cliché, out of touch with reality answers). Is there a professional I can consult that could help me with it? Maybe a book or a channel that is actually useful? How can I practice and find out what's the actual problem?

2025-02-27 21:20:21,1izqtll,Do my friends hate me?,"I started uni this year, but pre university group chats where made on several platforms for students who were going to start at uni the next academic year, and from these group chats I made my own friend group - so by uni I had known these people online for like half a year - now when university started everything was amazing. We all met and hung out and we all vibes with each other as well as we did online - then drama started- and collectively as a group a few of us unfriended another friend as she had just been making inappropriate comments to people and for myself personally- I messaged her privately to speak about my issues and told her in a group setting or just in general I’d be civil and nice with her but I just couldn’t see our own friendship continuing the way things had been. 

Now I’m just thinking like maybe this is my karma for that? I don’t even know, but exactly how everyone ended up treating her - not being mean but kind of just ignoring her or engaging less with her. I don’t know, I feel bad for how she was treated which is why I privately messaged her my feelings and got it out the way cause I’d rather not be two faced either someone. But am I over thinking things? I just feel so unstable in this friendship- they all text each other regularly, I think they even have their own little group chat - they’re all around each others dorm rooms together.

2025-02-27 21:12:44,1izqn7l,How do you handle resentment with a close friend?,"I’ve been friends with someone for about a year and a half. They were the first person I met when I came to a new city and are currently one of my closest friends. We have shared identities and enjoy some of the same activities, Sometimes we have a shared sense of humor, and we are in the same communities. And usually we are each others go-to when something bad happens and we need to talk about it with someone. There are some aspects of the friendship that do not sit well with me:
- Communication is incredibly difficult.
we really suck at assuming what the other person means by what they say. It’s super common that we get into a disagreement because they assume I mean something different than what I say and vice versa. The difference in how we handle it is that I find myself defaulting to their version of reality and assuming positive intent even though I may be hurt or confused.
- they are sometimes blatantly mean with certain comments that they make. I sometimes wonder if I am talking to a teenager. 
- I don’t feel like I have permission to be imperfect in the friendship. I feel like I can’t forget things, say something that’s inaccurate, or cancel plans when I need to without them responding in a way that’s condescending or rude. 
- Attempts to stay connected during conflict fall short often because I feel that this person does not understand “context” the way that I do. Like fights over something small always turn into something big even though the root of a miscommunication may be really simple. They get very particular about details. 
- During conflict, I feel that I am often the one trying to ask questions, keep the conversation on track with the big picture, and remaining calm. This is becoming incredibly tiresome and I am very resentful. They admit to me that they are not used to healthy conflict, and that they are sorry that I have to keep us on track, but I am simply at my wits end and fear I may start responding in ways that are cold or unfair.
- our values are different, which is okay, but oftentimes I wonder if they are too different. We are okay at remaining respectful even though we disagree, but it makes me sad to think that I am friends with someone who doesn’t share positive aspects of how I view life and over time I find their negative outlook has somewhat rubbed off on me

I’m torn between whether or not I should remain friends with this person or go our separate ways. I want to preserve the connection, but the biggest thing keeping me from it is that Ive simply come to stop liking this person and how they make me feel outside of helping each other through crisis. Another aspect is being in the same communities and likely seeing each other around a lot. Based on what I’ve described, I probably come across as a people pleaser (I am) and I’ve gotten better at addressing that internally, yet I am still not sure if I should still interact with this person. Any advice or input would be appreciated. ","Should I remain friends with someone whose communication style and outlook on life make me feel bad, or is it better to go our separate ways?","The individual in the Reddit post has been living in a new city for about a year and a half and has formed a close friendship with someone who was their first connection upon arrival.

2025-02-27 18:43:36,1izn3m1,How to react to somebody talking about disturbingly traumatic things?,"Like, when a friend randomly opens up to you about shit and it's horrifying, and you're just lost for words that's how horrific it is. And she was speaking very fast telling me about all the unrelated traumatic things that have happened in her life, jumping from one thing to another so calmly that it was honestly chilling.

The only thing really I can say is 'I'm so sorry' and 'that's so awful', 'you shouldn't have had to go through that' but it all sounds so meaningless. Or 'is there anything I can do to help?' but that also feels automatic and meaningless. Also I don't think said person likes being told 'I'm sorry'. She's the kind of person who doesn't like pity and tries to be all tough, would say 'er, no' if you said 'do you want a hug?' and struggles showing vulnerability. So when she occassionally does, and I don't know what to do, it makes me feel like a terrible friend.

What do I say and how do I react? It gets so awkward, and like, I don't want it to be awkward I'm just so utterly lost for words because it's like nothing I can say could actually help.

We live in an apartment complex and he's right across the hall. Thank you, Satan. His sister is the building manager and has evicted people who have told this guy off or made him feel some type of way.

He's a nice enough guy, but Jesus Christ, he needs a therapist or hobby or something. Yesterday my hubby and I were lugging trash to the dumpster, and unfortunately he came out to take out trash as well. Through out him babbling, I said ""I'm gonna go, I'm really not feeling well."" I've been sick for a couple days. He will just start another topic and keep going. I ended up getting faint and ALMOST passing out, not completely unconscious, but I did kind of crumble to the ground and my hubby ofc held onto me and helped me. I was out of it and couldn't really hear for a moment... but when I came all the way back again... this guy was STILL FUCKING TALKING about the difference in printing presses at his work, and how he tells of management etc!!! My hubby again said we have to go, my girl just almost passed out and she's got heart issues... our neighbor goes, ""oh man, yeah, I have hernia issues, I needed surgery last year and they didn't get it all so they had to go back in and I'm going to miss some work next month...."" ANOTHER full tilt conversation.... or not really conversation... he just talks AT us. I literally won't leave the apartment some days bc I don't have the time or patience to have him literally come out of his apartment and STAND IN FRONT of the exit, and literally trap me into a ""conversation."" 

So I texted the manager this morning, his sister, and said hey I hope he doesn't think we were rude, but we really had to go... and she said she can't have tenants who are going to be nasty to one another and ""ruin the peaceful environment."" 

What the fuck do we do here?!

This is not a once off. Example, last week my hubby was bringing in groceries and the package of water bottles broke... in the hallway. Neighbor comes out, while hubby is struggling with bags and water bottles flying all over, to talk about his new dvds and dj equipment (**you** picture him).

2025-02-27 11:05:57,1izda44,"Great at one on one, horrible at group settings","I believe I have come a long way with my social anxiety. I went from preferring to stay home alone due to anxiety, to wanting to be out several times per week. I’ve got much better at social communication and being around others. My strongest accomplishment is being great at socialising one on one. Every time somebody hangs out when it’s just me, they always tell me they have a great time. This goes for both friendships and dates.

My issue now is that I suck a lot when there’s more people involved. Suddenly I feel unheard, judged, or pushed away. Which I now know are thoughts that are not always true, although sometimes they are. 

It’s a vicious cycle where I turn myself away in moments where I feel rejected or unheard, and in return, the rest of the groups sees me as uninterested or boring. 

The issue is that even when I try to act more interested, it still doesn’t work and I still get pushed aside in conversations. 

I’ve been really close with this girl now that’s in my class. She’s very direct and also sees that I change drastically once I am in group settings in contrast to when I hang out with only her. Almost like I’m a different person. 

Due to the fear of rejection though, the anxiety gets extremely bad when I have group activities with the entire year of my study. I also recently joined a student association in order to expand my social circles, and I help with the organisation of events. But even within that team I’m constantly worried they’ll see me as boring, which in turn actually makes me more quiet.

Another thing is that you aren't the only one analyzing the world; the world is also analyzing you.

These are the big kids"" (so I've been helping a 5th grade class vs her K/1 class). And her response was ""oh, we do serious work too...""

I felt really bad as it was not my intention to make her feel like her K/1st grade class work she is teaching isn't serious work. For me book reports just feel intense...

I moved to a small town and am a barista. I enjoy my job, I like connecting with customers, remembering the regulars and their orders, encouraging someone starting their day, or handing a sweet treat to someone trying to cheer up. 

My work “persona” is very bubbly, cheerful, smiling, etc., but I personally am quite reserved and want my private life separate from my work life. The issue is that, because of moving to such a small town, there’s the town gossip and all the “social” Facebook groups. More than once have I had to help a customer adjust their attitude or put them in check for being rude or disrespectful, just to find out they’re in the city or county government, or some local business hotshot. 

I’ve noticed when I wear a bold accessory, it directs a conversation in a more superficial / surface level conversation that isn’t invasive. I get people asking if I have kids / why no kids, them not knowing that I’m struggling with infertility. Them thinking they know me and trying to connect with me at the store, post office, around town. 

What are some other ways I can sort of inconspicuously “hide” my identity without it being obvious? What topics of small talk or questions can I keep on hand to change the direction of a conversation?

- I already wear glasses 
- No visible tattoos 
- Have to wear apron as part of dress code

I was hoping this could be an opportunity for making friends. I have been feeling lonely for quite some time. I lost a lot of my friends when I was recovering from mental illness and an ED a few years ago and since then my social life has been so dry. I feel like I have lost my ability to socialize and my personality around new people. But I might be making it worse than it is. 


There is a group of girls on this trip whose company i really enjoy and at the start of trip I was feeling super hopeful. But now it’s like the other girls a much closer with each than I am with them. I am really trying to make conversation with them and just be with them but it’s so difficult. I feel like they just find me an annoying burden. 
I don’t know what to do. I’m feeling hopeless. I feel like if I can’t make friends on this trip, I never will. 
I think I’m overthinking and it’s also only day 5 of 29 of this trip so it’s stupid to lose hope already. 
This was mostly just a rant. I needed it to get it of my chest. If you read this far, thank you and any tips, advice or reassurance is very welcome. Thank you <3",How can I improve my social skills and make friends while on this trip?,"The individual is currently on a group trip in Ecuador, seeking opportunities to make friends after experiencing loneliness for a significant period.

2025-02-26 23:04:08,1iz11ju,How to befriend women?,"I'm a teenage boy. At school, I don't really have proper friends. The lads I end up with (due to no real alternative) are a bunch of twats. As are most other guys my age. I have friends outside of school who I've known for a decade, and while I get on with them fairly well, I don't think we'd become friends if we met today. I feel like most teenage guys are very immature. Sorry if I sound like a judgemental prick.

There's this friend group of girls in my year, and they look really nice. We have similar interests and everything, and they have actually interesting conversations. I just wish I could hang out with them.

The thing is, we've been in the same school for three years so they've probably already pegged me down as just another one of the annoying lads I hang out with. It's not like first year where everyone is making friends. Maybe it's too late. Also, I'm really really scared of coming across as creepy. I'm autistic, and I think maybe my body language can be kind of off, judging by how people react to me. I could be wrong. I've gotten better at managing it though. I can actually do conversations and stuff, I'm pretty normal. And I maintain basic hygiene.

2025-02-26 21:34:13,1iyyygu,Anger Understood,"Anger is always a result of hidden, suppressed or unknown feelings and emotions. Anger is not in of itself a negative behavior but a product. It is believed that anger is a result of not getting one’s desire in that moment. The truth is the display of anger is the individual feeling invisible in that moment. Instead of expressing their feelings or emotions they display anger. Anger can become a habitual behavior though, without any awareness as to why.  Some of us are brought up in an angry environment and angry is the only way to be.

Beneath anger one will always find unexpressed emotion or feelings. These feelings and emotions can be suppressed because they are not allowed to be expressed or because the individual is not aware of them.

One who feels unsafe in their environment will suppress their feelings and emotions. One who grows up in an environment that is unsafe or taught the emotions and feelings are to be kept to oneself and not allowed to be expressed, will suppress their emotions. Anger untreated turns to rage, an exaggerated expression of anger. The more a person feels muted or invisible the more anger will be displayed.

A sibling of anger is depression, the source of depression is the same with the absence of hope. Hopelessness is the source of all depression. Hopelessness is defeated anger. The angry person essentially finally gives up, causing one to become hopeless then depressed.

The solution is to get help learning how to express yourself, once you begin to really express your feelings and emotions all your anger and depression will subsist. Expressing yourself will allow you feel at ease and bring you closer to whomever is usually receiving your anger. That recipient will also start to feel safe with you when they do not see anger coming from you.",How can I learn to express my feelings and emotions better to manage my anger and depression?,"The Reddit post does not provide specific background information regarding education, family situation, work history, or other personal factors about the individual in crisis.

2025-02-26 21:28:32,1iyytkw,Frustrated with Superficiality as the Norm for Friendship,"I’ve been struggling with how I connect with others for a while now.

  
For me, relationships are about emotional depth, vulnerability, and genuine connection. I can’t stand the surface-level exchanges that so many people seem content with. Every interaction that stays surface-level leaves me feeling like I’ve wasted my time. I don’t get anything out of it at all. I don’t understand why people continue to engage in what I see as meaningless conversations when there’s so much more substance to uncover about one another’s lives.

  
I want to dive deep—to know someone’s story, their pain, their joy, their experiences. But every time I try to get to that point, it feels like “small talk” isn’t just the social norm; it’s an obligation. It feels frustrating and empty, especially since in most friendships I’ve tried to make, the conversations stay surface-level for weeks, months, or even over a year.

  
I don’t get joy from the casual, low-stakes friendships that so many people seem to thrive on. I feel like they’re constantly skating on the surface, never actually risking anything or showing any emotional vulnerability. I want to build relationships where trust is built by showing up, by risking something meaningful—not by talking about the weather or some other low-stakes topic. For me, emotional intimacy has never been something that comes later in a friendship—it’s the core of the friendship, the part that makes having friends meaningful.  
I’m willing to be vulnerable and open from the start of a friendship, and I expect that same attitude in return if I’m going to continue building the relationship. But it feels like most people are content to stay in a place where nothing truly meaningful is ever shared. And as I watch people connect in these small, easy ways, it’s hard not to feel left out despite not understanding what they get out of those interactions. Even with coworkers and friend groups I share similar interests with, it’s obvious that they’ve created stronger bonds with each other that I haven’t been able to form.

  
This disconnect is exhausting. Every day, it becomes clearer to me that very few people are interested in moving past small talk or testing the waters to reach something deeper. It feels like I’m alone in my desire for something more profound. It’s not that I think small talk is inherently bad—it’s just not enough for me. It’s never satisfied me or brought me joy. I’m not satisfied with being a casual acquaintance, or a coworker you talk about ""last night’s game"" with.

  
I want the kind of relationships where trust is built through vulnerability—where we both risk the discomfort of truly knowing one another, accepting the risks of being judged or rejected. When putting myself out there or trying to forge a path toward something more intimate isn’t reciprocated, I feel like I’m not actually building any kind of relationship at all. For me, skipping to the ""deep end"" isn’t just about avoiding small talk—it’s about getting to the heart of who someone is, and saving everyone time and energy. Why waste time talking about things that don’t matter when we could be using that time to create a real, lasting connection, or at least definitively know someone well enough to understand whether we’re compatible?

  
I know I’m probably in the minority here, but it’s difficult to continue pretending I’m okay with the shallow, casual approach that dominates so much of social life. I want depth, and I’m starting to feel like I’m fighting an impossible battle trying to find it. It’s incredibly frustrating to feel so far removed from the connections I desperately want.

**I'm not looking for advice; I'm hoping to hear others' thoughts on how they approach being deeper friends with others or at the very least I hope that these words can help someone else who feels like me know they're not alone.** ",How can I find deeper connections with others who are also seeking emotional intimacy in friendships?,"The individual in the Reddit post expresses a deep desire for emotional depth and genuine connection in their relationships.

Recently I’ve been making more effort to meet new people. I tend to gravitate towards less… conventional groups and have had an uptick in people saying to me “I have autism/ADHD/BPD/another disorder but people say they can’t tell”. I never know what to say to this because I have always been able to very much tell shortly after meeting them. Like usually within hours it goes from “something is different about this person to oh they have X or Y, okay”.

It’s only happened a handful of times but I’ve been able to tell that I disconcerted some people with my general answer of “thank you for sharing that with me” and then going back to what we were talking about that triggered their statement or “oh yeah I have that too” for ADHD. Would it be best to just say that I never would have guessed? I’m just worried I won’t say it convincingly and then it’ll be a lie AND I’ll have irritated them. What other things can I say? I don’t want to say anything that presumes they feel positively or negatively about having X.","When someone tells me they have a mental disorder, how should I respond without making them feel uncomfortable or misunderstood?","The individual has been making an effort to meet new people and tends to gravitate towards unconventional groups.

I feel like I’m always the “not better one” compared to others.","I feel like I have a really good eye for seeing people at first impression. I mostly look at the way they talk, their manners, and how they dress neatly or otherwise to make friends. But I find it really hard to make a long connection with good people. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m “not funny enough,” which sounds ridiculous, but I do feel like that when interacting with them. I often let the conversation go silent and can’t keep up with trends. I guess I’m often more of a listener than the one talking too… My friends often say I’m boring.

I found myself trying really hard to explore hobbies like art, watching Netflix shows, some Korean singers, K-pop, food, etc., and I found my hobbies to be very diverse. I often try to talk about hobbies to make conversations interesting too. But even then, sometimes my mind just stops, and I find myself unable to say anything else. Even when I try to break the silence by saying, “Oh, it’s nice to just chill like this without talking haha,” to make it less awkward. But after making friends for some time, I’ve been told three times now that I’m kind of “just like others” at some point in the conversation…

At first, I thought, oh, we just didn’t click, and maybe new friends would fit me better.

2025-02-26 13:00:01,1iymy56,New job might be overstepping my boundaries,"I just started a new part time position.for context i have a full time job with a schedule that would allow for a part time thing. I love my main job, i work with disabled people and it's perfect in every way except the pay is super shit. So i finally found a position as a barista in a coffee stand. So far the work is chill and i enjoy it. But the barista job only has a 4 person team including me. And in every step of the hiring process i made it very clear that i need to know my shifts ahead and that i can't take on more than 3 weekly. The other people working there are full time employees. That scares me because technically they have the same contract as me. I don't have the capacity to work as much as them, i don't want to compromise my main job. 

Yesterday the boss from the barista job said she might ask me to come in today because she's sick. I assumed if she needed it she would have told me yesterday. She didn't say anything yesterday so i already said yes to a non essential thing with my main job. About an hour ago she called me to ask if i could take the afternoon shift instead of her. I said yes, because it didn't really matter if i came in today at my main job. I am really worried that unless i establish that this cannot be happening and that my priority is my main job, they will keep pushing my boundaries. I don't want to lose the part time position, it's really hard to find any kind of work in my area and i cannot properly support myself with my current pay.

2025-02-27 11:05:25,1izd9tx,"Great at one on one, horrible at group settings","I believe I have come a long way with my social anxiety. I went from preferring to stay home alone due to anxiety, to wanting to be out several times per week. I’ve got much better at social communication and being around others. My strongest accomplishment is being great at socialising one on one. Every time somebody hangs out when it’s just me, they always tell me they have a great time. This goes for both friendships and dates.

My issue now is that I suck a lot when there’s more people involved. Suddenly I feel unheard, judged, or pushed away. Which I now know are thoughts that are not always true, although sometimes they are. 

It’s a vicious cycle where I turn myself away in moments where I feel rejected or unheard, and in return, the rest of the groups sees me as uninterested or boring. 

The issue is that even when I try to act more interested, it still doesn’t work and I still get pushed aside in conversations. 

I’ve been really close with this girl now that’s in my class. She’s very direct and also sees that I change drastically once I am in group settings in contrast to when I hang out with only her. Almost like I’m a different person. 

Due to the fear of rejection though, the anxiety gets extremely bad when I have group activities with the entire year of my study. I also recently joined a student association in order to expand my social circles, and I help with the organisation of events. But even within that team I’m constantly worried they’ll see me as boring, which in turn actually makes me more quiet. 

How could I overcome this? ",How could I overcome my anxiety in group settings?,"The individual has made significant progress in managing their social anxiety, transitioning from a preference for isolation to desiring social interactions several times a week. They have demonstrated improvement in social communication, particularly excelling in one-on-one socializing, where they receive positive feedback from friends and dates.

The person is currently experiencing heightened anxiety around group activities, particularly with their entire study cohort, and has recently joined a student association to broaden their social networks while also helping organize events. Despite these efforts, they remain anxious about being seen as boring by their peers, contributing to their tendency to become quiet in group contexts.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1izd9tx/great_at_one_on_one_horrible_at_group_settings/,socialanxiety

2025-02-27 12:40:22,1izet4n,Social Anxiety and Hospitalization,"Last week was really rough for me. I was already very depressed, and after a fight with my partner, where he said some things that hit deep, reinforcing my negative thoughts, I nearly took my own life. I was on medication for PTSD, but in an attempt to regain control, I ended up taking a dangerous amount. When my partner got back from shopping, he found me drunk on top of all the medication and noticed something was seriously wrong. He called 112, and I was taken to the hospital.

Even though I was under benzodiazepines, I still felt immense shame. They put me on a stretcher, even though I could walk, and then wheeled me around on a bed cart while they detoxed me and checked if I was dying. I've been ashamed of that kind of attention while I liked the care they provided to me. It only got worse when my partner spoke to my doctor and told her something even more humiliating: that I needed diapers for the night. Later, when the doctor entered my room at night and offered one to me, I felt ashamed, but at the same time, I knew it was necessary to prevent an even bigger and shameful mistake.

The next morning, I had no idea what to do with it or how to discreetly get rid of it. I’ve never used them in public, and this was one of my biggest secrets. A random doctor told me to take a shower, but he didn’t realize I was still wearing a diaper under. Public spaces like toilets and showers have always been a source of deep shame for me. On top of that, my clothes had been taken and replaced with hospital ones. Thankfully, I had a bit of privacy in the restroom to figure things out.

Then my doctor recommended me to go a mental hospital. After they confirmed I was stable (detoxed) enough to leave, an another ambulance arrived, and again, they put me on a stretcher, even though I could walk. When I arrived at the mental hospital, they placed me in a single room with my own toilet and shower, which was probably a relief. But they checked on me every 30 minutes whether am I doing something suicidal or wrong, so I couldn’t actually use them without fear of interruption and fear to be checked in such vulnerable state being sitting on a toilet or taking a shower. Eating was another problem for me, I had to leave my room in order to get food, but my social anxiety completely froze me and I never been able to escape it. I ended up starving for two days until they realized that I physically couldn’t step out to eat. Only then did they start bringing meals to my room.

Eventually, things became more comfortable for me because they understood and accepted my social anxiety, but I still felt an overwhelming urge to escape. Even though I wasn’t locked in, my social anxiety made it feel like I was jailed. The hospital reminded me too much of prison, and that feeling alone made everything worse.",How can I cope with overwhelming feelings of shame and social anxiety while in a hospital setting?,"The individual in the Reddit post has a history of depression and PTSD, which has led them to require medication.

Their struggles with social anxiety have been profound, impacting their ability to engage in basic activities such as eating and using facilities in both the hospital and mental health settings.

2025-02-27 12:41:48,1izeu21,"My experience with reducing SA through, of all things, techno and house parties","Hello,  
I am 33 y old male, I had depression for around \~6 years, 19-25, got it fixed through therapy \*AND\* Feeling Good by David D. Burns (incredible incredible book).   
Because I had undiagnosed but really obvious ADHD and my parents forced me to university I was bad at university and in my IT related job later. I felt as the biggest failure even though I got an amazing amazing wife and had own apartment with her. I spent to much time in front of the PC and over the years I kinda lost my ability to socialize. I had my best friend and the friends of my wife and that is it. Lowest point was where it was difficult for me to look into the eyes of the other person.   
I had my best friend and another one (and my wife), they dragged me often with them so I wasn't isolated and havent lost all the skills. I felt often very lonely during socializing though, because I couldn't talk about stuff, because I was only gaming and I couldn't ask proper question to keep the conversation going.

SA is a b\*tch, I am writing this and hope that maybe I will help or motivate someone. Don't lose hope, there is a way out of this.

Currently I am at the bottom regarding my work life. I am restarting my carrier, I am choosing something else and that catapults me 10 years back. In this state my very good fried asked me to join a techno festival (3 days). Someone who, at that point, went 4 times in his life to a club, didn't listen to techno but to some edm (electro dance music), SA issues, going to a festival felt like walking on ice and hoping not to fall, what I am trying to say, it will end very bad for me emotionally. Why should I go there?  But I was desperate, staying at home felt like prison, video games lost their magic and I said yes.  
Before leaving I thought this is one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Incredible hate and anger.  
Of course he invited his other friends. Amazing, now there are people on the festival that will see a weirdo in me and his friends on top of that, who will learn through talking that I am weird.  
I wanted to leave my body through my skin when my friend went away and we were 3 ppl and just couldn't jump start the conversation for 10 min. I told them a lie (toilet) and left. 

Techno ppl at the festival and in Berliner clubs are very, very kind and nice ppl. So the festival wasn't a bad place to be anymore for me. But still, always thought about saying something wrong while being in my group, I didn'T talked to much, was afraid of having something in my nose etc. 

Soon I was very happy, lucky, because I liked the music, because there are many sub genres and there is music for most of the ppl in techno. I want to mention that techno's charm is not shared through speakers at home, maybe not even in the club, because to crowded and it takes time to get adjusted to so many ppl in a small space.  
The experience is completely from another planet on a festival during a warm summer day.  

After the festival I felt in love with the music. I always said yes when I got invited to parties, I always hated myself and the world when I was going to the event (leaving home) and the first 30 min to an hour at the event. But always after this time I started to feel normal and somehow started to talk with others and they seem not be disgust by my presence. I mean, I got invited over and over, I must be at least a normal person.

Now my best friend is not more in my city and I am going alone to those parties and house parties and I am really, really looking forward to meet this wonderful ppl and learn new stuff about their lives. I have even started to talk them on the phone (chat directly, not a group chat).  
  
One more thing I need to mention: The ppl on techno events are very nice, so I forced myself to talk to small group of ppl (2 to 3) and work on my SA. I hated myself extremely, 1000 negative thoughts, extrem embracement but I forced myself. Sometimes the conversation was over very fast, because u feel that there is no connection but 90% of the cases we talked about the music, about the setting, about people we are with. I feel small emission of adrenaline when I am about to talk to the first group of ppl but it improved so much, I feel like a normal human being.  
In case you are interested what I say: ""Hey guys, do you mind if I join your conversation?"" I never got a ""no"" as a replay. Then I ask what they are talking about, followed about question which DJ they like etc. If I feel there are no interest in talking to me, like they not asking question to me, I just say ""Thank you for having me, I will go around and look for my friends  now.""  
And I am not a good looking person. I have glasses, a little bit baldness and I am not able to dress well. But this is not a typical crowd of ppl in the middle of the city, in a disco or shisha bar, they are not superficial people. They also have a very good sense of ppl not feeling well. It is amazing. I love to observe ppl and I saw if someone was looking to tiried, ppl would talk to them and ask if everything is okay and offer water. Very lowly community. 

Today, after 6 months of socialising regularly with new friends and strangers, I have 5% SA left BUT  
I think it is just ""trained behavior"" and I also apply cognitive technics like acknowledging the negative thoughts and repeating my mantra that is just simply the left overs of SA.

SA is stealing our very limited \*quality\* life time. I would have started to go to such festivals and parties maybe 5 years ago. Imagine how much quality fun time I missed, how many interesting ppl I have not meet?  
F\*ing SA man... Because of depression and SA I have lost 10 years...  
  
So, brothers and sisters in mental condition...  
\*FIGHT  
\*THIS  
\*S\*\*T  
We are like apes, we live in groups. Babies die after few months if they don't feel attachment to another being and only geet feed and cleaned after.   
Go find your apes.

The conclusion for me is:  
\-exposure therapy works  
\-exposure therapy is a lot less painful if you have a good setting (I am a geek, a comic book or PC store would be a good place as well)  
\-my brain gets tired OR depleted of stress hormones and of bad thoughts, after grinding through exposure and after a time it is easy for me just to talk  
\-videos about ""how keep conversation going"" helped me  
\-block negative thoughts! replace them though empowering one!

At the end big plot twist: You know that there is stuff that is taken at such events... Yes they helped me a lot. Especially one that I took alone, which hippies are famous for. To say that all of them are bad is wrong. Where is the difference to meds? We get from a guy which we also give money too? There are maybe 2 that are absolut harmless (quality, risk of addiction) and could incredible help with SA.  
So I want to say that my success story was possible thought enhancement substances BUT it would have work through grinding I am sure, because my side project is a board game group, and they invite me always to join.  

  
BONUS STORY as a gift to you, because you read all of this.  
2 years before all above: I knew I have SA. Because the book about depression helped me I knew SA will go away, I just have to do something! I wasn't going to parties so where should I get exposed? I have choose: To strangers on the street, which is probably a league for highest level extroverts. It was a bad idea  
\*BUT\* The idea involved to the following: I will ask ppl around the super market close to my apartment. I will say that I know no one here and that is a very good reason for a conversation. It took a long while till I saw someone: A guy in gaming tattoos, long hair with a lego set.  
I play video games, I listen to metal and I always wanted lego as a kid. If I don't talk to him, I will not forgive me, and will I not try exposure myself to others. I have told him: ""Do you live here near by?"" (of course yes, he is in this supermarket). ""I don't know anybody here, wanna have a beer after work?"". My hands were shaking after we said goodbye to each other.   
Long story short, we are very good friends now, his wife is an amazing person, my wife like both of them and I can't imagine my life without them. Also i have the key to their apartment. And they know that I have the key, they gave it to me, ""just in case"".

2025-02-27 09:27:16,1izbwb1,Difference between social anxiety and social anxiety disorder,"I've had social anxiety since last year. I think it started because I started going outside less and just playing video games in the house. I've never had social anxiety before. The first symptoms started when school started—I was somewhat introverted and awkward, and it was hard for me to approach new people and make friends. So I didn't try that much. What made it worse was that there was a kind of ""bully"" in my class—he crossed my personal boundaries and slapped me on the back, tried to take off my pants when I wasn't looking, and overall made me very uncomfortable. I didn't like it. I started fantasizing about standing up to him. 
Then, my anxiety started getting worse. I avoided my female classmates, and I worried around them. Whenever I did have to talk to them, whenever it was for school or just them being friendly, I stuttered and wondered if I said the wrong thing, but I never dwelled on it too much.
The days rolled in, my anxiety getting worse. I couldn't walk without me feeling like all eyes were on me. Whenever I looked at someone, I believed maybe they thought I was a weirdo for that. There's a girl in my batch who I don't know well. I don't know why, but she suddenly stared to watch her back around me. Whenever I was walking behind her, she constantly checked behind as though to make sure I wasn't following or staring at her. I believed she thought I was a pervert. I became even more socially anxious.
It continued like this until December, when, for Christmas break, I went on a trip to Japan. I had been learning Japanese for a few years before that, and now it was my time to test it with the locals. I had a lot of fun there, I even asked a stranger to take a picture of me to practice my Japanese. I think that's when the ""switch"" happened.
I returned to school in January somehow feeling more... confident? I was still anxious, but I was able to control it, and sometimes I felt normal. Even though the anxiety crept in soon after, I was able to hold semi -normal conversations with girl, which was something I hadn’t been able to do for a long time. I still felt nervous, and sometimes my voice would shake or my mind would go blank, but I wasn’t avoiding them anymore. I started making small talk — nothing big, just simple questions or comments — but it felt like progress.
Then February came, and things really started to change. I had moments where I felt like my old self again, like the anxiety wasn’t running the show. There was that one day in Valentine's when I felt on top of the world — no fear, no awkwardness. I stood tall, felt totally at ease, and even danced at the school concert without caring if I embarrassed myself. I should clarify that I'm a huge music fan, so maybe it was the effect of the music, but itt was the first time in over a year that I felt completely free.
There were still setbacks, of course. Mornings were tough — the anxiety always seemed worse when I first got to school. Walking through crowded hallways still made me feel like everyone’s eyes were on me, and sometimes I fumbled when I tried to greet people. But I noticed a pattern: when I had a good interaction, like making my classmates laugh or talking with my female friends, my confidence would spike. I’d feel relaxed, funny, and even a little bold.
One of the biggest breakthroughs happened during club time when I was grouped with a couple of girls and another guy. I didn’t overthink, I just said whatever was on my mind. I cracked jokes, and to my surprise, they laughed. A lot. Even the things I thought were bad or awkward somehow landed well. For the first time, I realized I didn’t always have to censor myself.
I'm still socially anxious, but not as much. I'm definitely improving, and maybe by June this year, I'll be cured completely. I'm working out and exercising, so that could also give a huge boost to my self confidence.
Now, that's a success story, but it's so different from what I've read on this sub that I'm wondering if I have true social anxiety or not. Everybody on this sub seems to have anxiety due to the smallest possible things, things even I would brush off.

2025-02-27 00:13:22,1iz2jcs,Anxiety and ptsd from previous bullying,"Im currently on a study abroad semester (university), im also just now trying to quit opiates (painkillers and kratom), and im afraid my high school experience is happening all over again.

During high school i had a traumatic home life and occasionally did drugs but mostly just was on antidepressants and low dose alprazolam. I didnt have any friends etc i was anxious all the time, especially when i was starting to get bullied for “being a drug addict”, to the point where i started skipping school and actually became a drug addict:’), i used at home alone.

So since these painkillers that im tryna quit have horrible withdrawals (im getting used to them over the years, i tried to quit before), i took 3 drops of cbd oil before my class. It may have been too much because i felt that my head was heavier, i think it may have been noticeable. 

Some spanish/catalan guys (studying in spain) behind me were constantly laughing and talking, all i could make out was “joder” (its like fucking hell in english), they were speaking catalan which i dont speak. Also I think the guy behind me intentionally touched my foot with his foot whenever i tried to move mine. 

THEN: an empty redbull bottle gets thrown right next to me. I really hope this didn’t have anything to do with me but I can’t help but think that they must have noticed that im “off” and they were trying to hurt me like in my previous school.

I was so anxious during class that i didnt even dare to look up at the board, this whole class environment i think gave me ptsd:(

Im finally trying to quit substances (except cbd) for real, i have 4 days clean but this is making me wanna relapse. Im 22 and cant even function in a classroom:/ 

I ended up ditching class during the break period, which is bad bc i have to complete all my classes, if i dont i’d have to pay back my scholarship grant that i got for this semester. But im so afraid to go back there:/

2025-02-27 01:53:41,1iz4lf1,I wanna give up,"Hey this is my first post on Reddit in general. I just wanna get some emotional support since I'm just some invisible NPC to everybody else(and I'm not playing victim I'm already fully aware that this is all my fault). To get into it I'm just extremely fed up with my life and how I am. I look at old videos of me as a kid and there was like a certain point in my life where I cared what people thought( like everybody else) but there was no way in hell it was this bad. My family fucked me up so badly that I don't think ill ever recover. To give a little backstory(I'll make it brief don't trip) my mom and dad basically left me cause my dad went to jail when I was 8 and my mom went off to chase dick and pump out more kids while I live with my grandma. She raised the other kids but not me and I only spent the night every once in a while(if not every 6 months it was every year or sometimes more). I say this to say it isn't hard to see why I have anxiety cause my mom and the rest of my family basically yelled and did crazy shit to me my whole life and I grew up around rape and domestic violence. Now in present time( after spending like 6 years in a dark house doing HW due to homeschool, I call this the dark room arc) I wanted to escape that family and try to get friends and have some actual memories other than HW and misery I went to college. And for starters, I'd like to say I'm not complete miserable here like at home but I just feel like a straight bitch. I watch guys get all this attention and girls get treated like the life of every situation while I just blend in the back like some fuckin NPC and its all cause I can't speak up and talk to girls or even ask guys for their Insta to make friends. I have friends( my roommate and his friends) but my roommates basically my only friend since his crew just treats me like a tag along and barely talks to me unless I force a convo with them and even when I do they respond with low effort responses and then go back to talking to my roommate. Hell they don't even invite me and just invite him and he has to say “you can come if u want too ill be back later” and he says this every time without fail. Even girls ignore me and my roommate gets invited to events etc without even having to approach anybody. But anyways Imma just wrap the vent up and conclude by saying, how tf do I get rid of this shit? I look up stuff online and everybody acts like I'll have it forever I'll just have to manage it. Like Imma be 100% with u I refuse to live with this, it makes me sick just thinking that my life is so controlled by others opinions and values, especially those who wouldn't even bat an eye if I died tmr.

2025-02-27 01:04:14,1iz3lmw,Feeling Completely Hopeless,"This is more of a rant than anything. 

For as long as I can remember, I’ve (24M) always had quite bad social anxiety. 

I haven’t had any true irl friends since middle school, and honestly, it didn’t get any better in college. In fact, I quit every club shortly after I joined because I never felt welcomed. I really only have acquaintances at best. My only true friends are a handful online, who I feel might turn on me if they met me in real life. 

One moment from that time that sticks out to me to this day is when someone straight-up called me boring. Can’t even really fight them on that. 

I got out of a three year relationship a little over a year ago, and that’s only made me retreat deeper into my shell. My first and only one. It seems that anyone who gets close to me abandons me at some point, and I thought she was the exception. Seems like that was total fluke at the end of the day. 

I’ve been looking into what I can do to try to make new friends, but I unfortunately live in a small town with genuinely nothing going on. Everyone who can leaves this godforsaken place. I have checked resources like Meetup, and there’s literally zero results. 

I feel like I do very basic things right. I stay hygienic, take care of my appearance, and I go to the gym often. I am never rude or disrespectful to others. I am fairly well-off. It’s not like I don’t have any interests or hobbies either. I just don’t know a single soul who would be into them or who has the patience to deal with my socially inept ass. 

I’d say I’m fairly average in most regards except for the fact that I can’t fucking talk to people. No one ever approaches me either. I feel destined to lead a mediocre and lonely existence. It has eaten away at my confidence so much that I almost can barely stand to go out in public anymore.

Well, the reason I’m asking this is because of a situation that happened today. So, I’m currently in another country (France), which may help since no one knows me and I get to use English instead of my native tongue. I was on the metro, which we don’t have in my country, so I have no idea what the social rules around it are. I noticed someone that had like the most stunning vibe, idk how to describe it. I really liked their rings and told my sister so. I was debating saying something about it for the whole ride and like my heart was racing, but at the end of the ride when we were about to get off I had a sudden realization thing like “I’m never gonna see them again, might as well do it,”. So yeah, my hearts racing and my palm are sweaty (moms spaghetti), but I say “I like your rings” and they take off their headphones, which I didn’t notice them wearing before and ask something that I assume was something along the lines of “what did you say?” In French, so I repeat myself. They say thank you (I think? I don’t remember, I was stressing too hard) and then I have to get off. I felt really proud of myself for complimenting someone on something I noticed, that’s a big ass step for me, but now my overthinking is setting in. My mom always says people almost always enjoy compliments and it’s not weird to give them, but like, should I not have even talked to someone on the metro? Should I have said something earlier, because like the doors were already opening? Was it really shitty to talk to them while they had headphones on? Should I have even said anything? I feel like “excuse me, do you speak English? Oh sorry, I didn’t notice you were wearing headphones. I really like your rings,” would have been better.

I've tried a few medications like Lexapro and Mirtazapine which didn't have much good results.

That makes maintaining jobs difficult for me. I usually start off being generally able to cope but over a week I gradually start to get more and more exhausted until it becomes unhealthy to continue.

Any suggestions that may help would be welcome.",What suggestions do you have for managing anxiety attacks and coping with exhaustion?,"The individual struggles with social anxiety, but they are not completely incapacitated by it, as they can go out to buy food and occasionally spend time with a friend.

2025-02-26 18:54:44,1iyv3z6,my anxiety lol,"I’m a 15-year-old guy from India, an only child. My dad’s family and we used to live together, but after some conflict between my mom and them (my dad wasn’t involved since he was working abroad), we decided to move out. We’re still in contact like a normal family, but we live separately. my parents love me and support me but sometimes things dont go as planned

Back in 3rd grade, I was a shy kid who found it hard to interact with others, even though my parents kept pushing me to. I had a lot of interests—sketching, skating, cricket, and more. By 5th grade, I had a lot of friends, but sometimes, for no reason, I’d stop talking to them. Academically, I was really good—scoring 98% was like a cup of tea for me.

Then COVID happened, and everything went downhill. My studies started falling off, my hobbies faded, and even though I was in a cricket academy, I lost interest. Some of my closest friends moved to different states, and by the time schools reopened in 8th grade, I was excited to make new friends and take part in competitions. But that excitement didn’t last long. I looked way younger than my age—like a 5th grader—and people made fun of me for it. No one wanted to talk to me, and within two months, everyone had already formed their own friend groups. They’d go out, have fun, and live their best teenage lives while I just lay in bed watching their stories, wondering why I wasn’t part of it.

My mom constantly questioned why I never went out with friends. There was this one time a classmate threw a party and invited everyone except me—even though I used to check on him and talk to him frequently. When I asked him why, he just left me on seen. After the party, some boys mocked me for not getting invited. Even in games period, when I tried to join them, they’d purposely kick me out.

I applied for several competitions—swimming, cricket, and more—but my name was always cut off for some reason. Once, I got selected for an interschool swimming competition, but because of a family event, I had to give up my spot. There were many times I got cut off just because some kids had connections with teachers. In 9th grade, my academics hit rock bottom, and my dad got really upset, so he removed me from my cricket academy. One time, I got selected for a chess competition and gave my best, but a teacher said it would affect my academics and cut my name without even asking me—replacing me with someone she knew. It felt like every time I tried to be part of something, something bad always happened. That’s when I quit sports altogether.

From my family’s perspective, I’m a loser—someone whose grades are dropping, has no hobbies, and only 2–3 friends. I’m in 10th grade now, and my board exams are going on (lol). This year has been way better than 8th and 9th combined, but still, while others are driving cars, getting into relationships, smoking, and living their teenage years, I’ve just been sitting in my room trying to improve my academics. It has improved, not by much, but yeah.

I have 5–6 cousins, and two of them live with me. Both have big friend circles, play sports, and I’m constantly compared to them—like, “Why aren’t you like them?” One of them smokes, drives recklessly, and does other stuff, yet he’s still praised because he gets kinda a good marks than me , while I never even got a chance to do anything like that. I’ve struggled with anxiety and loneliness, but I never expressed it to anyone—not even my parents. I never felt like venting it all out.

Now, my parents are forcing me to go to a boarding school, which I really don’t want to. I want to enjoy life, explore more opportunities, and focus on coding since I actually like it and want to build a future in it. All in all, I feel like a loser who can’t do anything besides cry like a b\*\*\*h. No matter how much effort I put in, something always goes wrong. Let’s see what happens this year. Also, this is my first time writing a Reddit post, so if there are any mistakes, just ignore them. :>

Just one more thing, as a teenager i know i have to improve a lot and some of the things i have written is pointless but i just wanted to express it and i know ki it is not a big deal but i feel really lonely sometimes so yea :>> byee",How can I cope with feelings of loneliness and anxiety while trying to improve my academic performance and figure out my interests?,"The individual is a 15-year-old boy from India and is an only child.

2025-02-26 14:14:59,1iyogr0,Calling Government Agencies With Social Anxiety Is Overly Unpleasant,"It's already bad enough to have to make a phone call, but then even worse to make one to a government agency because they're always so rude and inconsiderate and don't give care about what you're dealing with. 

So, I just completed a pre-apprenticeship program which is supposed to 1) Offer me interim employment 2) get me into a union. Neither of those things have happened. So, I am unemployed. I also am facing eviction which is why I did this program because they said they would help me find a job and then eventually place me in a union. 

In any case, after speaking with someone at my program, they told me I should apply for Public Assistance so that I can qualify for a housing voucher. I already have food stamps and Medicaid, I would just need to apply for Cash Assistance and make it a full case. 

So, I called them today to ask if I can apply for the Cash Assistance. And this man was as rude as rude gets. Telling me ""Oh so you think you're just going to not work, not pay rent, and then call us asking for money."" Which is so far from the truth because the only reason I'm not working is because my program isn't keeping up their end of the bargain and I'm going back and forth with them trying to get placed at a job. Meanwhile, I also applied for a few other similar programs and I fill out job applications daily. I'm being evicted and the apartment I'm in is uninhabitable anyways, so I wanted to get the housing voucher so I can just get the hell out of this apartment, then get my job, then pay rent elsewhere. 

They're also supposed to help you find work if you don't have it and instead of offering that, he just said ""no you're not eligible and I'm hanging up now."" 

This is the worst thing about being poor/no-income is that nobody sees the effort you're putting into trying to make your life better all they see is that you're asking them for free things. And with social anxiety, it's hard for me to reach out and ask for help, and of course when people talk to me like that, it makes it even harder.",How can I handle making phone calls to government agencies when I'm facing rudeness and lack of support?,"The individual who wrote the Reddit post recently completed a pre-apprenticeship program aimed at offering interim employment and facilitating entry into a union, but has not achieved either outcome. As a result, they are currently unemployed and facing eviction, which was a motivating factor for enrolling in the program, as they were promised assistance in job placement and securing a union position.

In addition to seeking help from the pre-apprenticeship program, they are already receiving food stamps and Medicaid. They were advised to apply for Cash Assistance to qualify for a housing voucher, which could help them with their current housing crisis. The individual has been actively searching for work, applying to other programs, and filling out job applications daily, but feels that their efforts are overlooked and misunderstood by others, particularly when seeking assistance.

Additionally, the individual mentions experiencing social anxiety, which complicates their ability to ask for help and navigate bureaucratic interactions.

I have had zero friends for 4 years and to make it even more pathetic, i have no one online either. My entire family thinks i hate them because i avoid every message and call. It’s like every normal daily occurrence that other people have is 100x more gut wrenching for me. I didn’t finish high school either because of the bullying and I’m not risking going to another school when i know they’ll just do the same . I probably have the education of a 10 year old. Every single day i sit on my bed doomscrolling because hobbies are too energy draining even ones i enjoy all suck. 

Although, it’s not like im going to die because if I’ve been this way for so long then i would’ve done it already.

Sometimes I cant think of anything to say that wont make me look stupid, or when I have something to say, people dont stop talking so I cant get a good timing to chime in, and by the time there is silence, the topic changes and I am too late to tell my thoughts

And we have this thing where you rate your teammates' performance twice in this course, and your individual mark will be your group's grade x your avg score by your team. We are halfway through and we had one of those lately. And one of my teammates gave me 5/10. I just hate that I am being punished for something that is so natural to others but I am so behind despite trying my hardest. And like most of our discussions were not even related to the stuff that we were being graded on, we didnt even struggle in our project because it was a very trivial one in the first half

2025-02-26 11:30:47,1iylfmh,"""FAILED SOCIAL INTERACTION"" OR... SOMETHING ELSE? BE AWARE OF THE PREDATORS OUT THERE","I keep reading of people being threatened by the bosses, laughed at and marginalised by peers, isolated... I have been there too, that made me self-loath myself, beat myself over and over...

Here is the truth, there are PREDATORS out there,viscious dangerous and cruel, the most common are:

\- Sociopath - someone so deeply anxious and insecure that they will DO ANYTHING to shift those feelings away, yeah... they just love to hurt feelings of others and manipulate them to avoid feeling vulnerable, exposed

\- Narcissist - someone that has such void in them, the deep seated feelings of ""NOT BEING GOOD ENOUGH"" that has to show at every turn that they are ""good enough"" by getting ""narcisstic supply"" - they get it through praise or... demeaning others

\- Psychopath - someone that LACKS EMPATHY completely, they only see the goal whatever that may be, hurting feelings of others  to such person is just a means to an end

  
I will provide some examples through dialogue and scenarios:

\- Jillian : ""Oh hi, Judith, ohhh I see you got an A+ plus! Wow you are sooooo smartttt, surely you are going with us to the club after, school, right? Like you ever would...right girls? hahaha""

\- Jillian is a popular and rich girl, her backhanded ""compliment"" is aimed at eroding Judith's self-worth, making her see that A+ being nothing compared to going to the club like Jillian does, Judith never went to the club and will probably beat herself over that she is a social recluse, an unattractive ""nerd"" compared to Jillian - that insecurity feeds Jillian with her narcisstic supply - demeaning others.

\- Judith shoud focus on WHY she got that A+, she wants that scholarship, clubbing may or may not come, it's less important. 



\- Jack: ""Look at Johnny, what a recluse? You are not a recluse like him, are you Gary? I was just joking Johnny.""

\- Jack is a sociopath, he manipulates Gary to being his lackey feeding off his anxiety ""of being a recluse"" of being excluded from the group, Jack cements his position that way, he also not-so-subtly paints the target on Johnny's back - whenever they see he is a recluse he will get preyed upon. He swiftly kills two birds with one stone that way.

\- Johnny should quit that toxic group of ""friends"".

  


\- Steve: ""Joe you are not meeting the quota's, if you keep this up I will be forced to show you the door, do you understand that? I know you have family to feed but these are the rules.""

\- Steve and Joe are childhood friends, although according to Steve, Joe was a source of fleeting entertainment for him, he has a career to uphold, besides he can always meet another ""Joe"", to him it's nothing personal business as usual one name in the Excel sheet will replace the other, not meeting quotas equals fired, plain and simple. Steve is a psychopath.

\- Joe should be aware that it's not him, he did all he could to meet that quota.  


It's NOT ALWAYS YOU, don't beat yourself over and over, there are PREDATORS out there, it's just the way things are. Learn about them,learn about how to deal with them, show them a middle finger of DEFIANCE and that way you ... will regain some of your SELF-WORTH.

Usually, I don’t mind meeting new people if I’m prepared like when attending social events or starting a new class. But I hate when people invite someone I don’t know to a gathering. I genuinely don’t understand what happens to me.

Let me tell you the story. This has happened to me twice. Both times, I was supposed to go to the beach with relatives and friends, and just a few hours before the gathering, I accidentally found out that 2–3 people I had never met were also coming.

That’s when my brain starts spiraling—exaggerating the anxiety of meeting these new people, having to talk to them, and being trapped in that situation for hours (since the beach is far from where I live, and I don’t drive). The more I think about it, the sicker I feel. And then, I actually start exaggerating my sickness so people will excuse me from going (which worked both times).

But once they leave, I just break down and cry for two hours because of how awful I feel for doing this. I’m so done with it. I really want to stop",How can I stop feeling anxious about meeting new people at gatherings?,"The individual is likely facing social anxiety, particularly when it comes to meeting new people in unexpected situations.
