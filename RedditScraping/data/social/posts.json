        "original": "TLDR; Had two times where people didn\u2019t look at me while talking within 2 days, it might be because height, scar, acne, or chinkiness Either way these interactions are killing my confidence.\n\nI\u2019m pretty tall for an Asian guy. I\u2019m 18 years old and 6\u20192\u201d. I also have pretty chinky face that has a little bit smaller eyes than most Asians. I understand that it can be a little intimidating for people to look at me because of these features. \n\nBut never I\u2019m my life there wasn\u2019t a situation where someone was completely not looking at me while talking and it\u2019s such a confidence destroyer. Looking down and to the side is fine, but these people I\u2019m talking to turn their body completely 30 degrees away from!? I find that a little ridiculous and depressing. \n\nThe first time it happened was at an in-n-out when it was my turn to order. As I was approaching the cash register, the first thing I notice is for the first time ever she\u2019s looking away from me when taking my order and she was about 5 foot. I naturally came to the conclusion that she had some kind of physical disability, or my height intimidated her, so I shrugged it off and continued about my boring life. \n\nNow when the second time it happened, I finally came to the conclusion that something could be wrong about me. This time I was at a movie theatre with my friends about to watch the new Spider-Man movie (I love the soundtrack and animation). So I walk in expecting to wait in line for the guy to take my ticket and just have a good time. My friend goes first and he takes his ticket with nothing unusual about the guy. \n\nThen it\u2019s my turn... this guy then proceeds to nonchalantly face 30 degrees away from me?! That\u2019s when I noticed he\u2019s treating me differently. He tries to take my ticket, but was blindly trying to take it since he was clearly not looking at me, and was a little bit taller than me. He stuck his hand out and for a good few seconds I stood there confused at what was happening as I was handing him my ticket. After that it was harder to shrug it off and had to continue my life with a little bit of confidence chipped.\n\nA few things I may consider is I started getting pretty bad acne so I have a few red acne scars surrounding the sides of my cheeks. I also recently got a small reddish scar under my left eyelid from a volleyball that I think looks sick, but could be intimidating. Finally I considered it could be my chinky appearance and tall height. \n\nI might be overthinking this one IDK. But it\u2019s bothering me a lot and I don\u2019t want to continue life with people looking away from me. Any tips on what I can do to stop this from happening?\n\n\n\n\n",

        "original": "tldr: slow in conversation, can't catch onto the things people say. also slow in the workplace, lack common sense to do simple tasks, really want to improve on both of those so people stop getting frustrated with me\n\nHey everyone, for as long as I can remember, I've always heard people call me \"slow\". I usually hear this when I have a conversation with someone, when they ask me a question. I wouldn't really catch on to what they were asking, and am unable to answer their question until they rephrase it, if I'm lucky enough to get to that point. In a group setting, other people in the group would intervene, and say \"don't worry, he's a little slow\" after I'd ask to repeat the question, or if I say that I didn't really understand what they were asking me. From the numerous interactions that I've had with people, my girlfriend is pretty much the only one that doesn't dismiss me and what I say just because I'm a little slow, but there are times that she gets a little frustrated as well. \n\nI really want to improve and find a way to catch onto things quicker because I don't want her to be unnecessarily frustrated just because I'm not able to catch onto what she is saying, and I also want to be better for my job in school, as a lot of it relies on relaying information from one person to another. \n\nI also want to improve in other areas, as I've heard people use the word \"slow\" to describe me in other contexts as well. At the various jobs that I've worked, I've always had someone on me telling me that I was too slow while I was doing my various tasks. Whenever I'd work one-on-one with someone, they would always tell me that I was too slow, and lacked common sense by overcomplicating extremely simple things like stacking/rearranging furniture, running cable, organizing luggage, and many more. I don't know how to describe it, but the best way that I could is that I would start on that certain task, and a few minutes in, someone would just be glaring at me, and angrily ask \"what are you doing??\" which is followed by them undoing what I've done, doing it in a much more efficient way, and at a much faster rate. I don't know if any of you had that kind of experience, where you were working with someone that you thought was \"slow\", but I apologize for being one of the slow guys. I just want to improve and not be as slow so people won't get frustrated with me anymore. \n\nIs there anything I can do to help catch on quicker, or to improve my common sense? Any kind of advice is appreciated. I don't do any drugs, or drink alcohol, and lead a somewhat healthy lifestyle (lifting weights and running 5 days a week, healthy diet), if any of that information helps",

I have a few rules (no drugs, nothing that puts my life in danger, nothing that\u2019s directly harms another person/animal). \n\nI have lurked on this page for a while now and I wanted to share how my life has changed/improved since I started this process two weeks back. I never thought I\u2019d be where I am right now, and I feel as though my experience might be eye opening and beneficial to a lot of people on this subreddit. \n\nI\u2019m currently sitting in my car, exhausted but smiling because I just absolutely killed a job interview with a very reputable Real Estate brokerage. Tonight I have plans to rent a hotel room with my childhood crush, and I has the best New Years of my life two days ago. \n\nThis is all because I changed my response from \u201cmaybe\u201d to \u201cyes\u201d. \n\nI was invited out two weeks ago by a friend I don\u2019t know too well, I was tired and felt like staying in, however I had promised myself earlier that day I would give the yes theory a try, and it was the perfect moment to start. I said yes and went to a small house party, I drank and hung out with a group I didn\u2019t know too well, it was fun and I was added to their group chat the next day. \n\nThey decided to rally again that night and so I said \u201cyes\u201d and went along, I was exhausted but I pulled myself together and threw all excuses out of the window. \n\nThis party was larger, and I began to talk to more people as the night progressed. I met some really good guys, and ended up sleeping with a girl I had liked for a really long time. \n\nI woke up the next morning exhausted, but I was asked to go skiing by another friend. I said \u201cyes\u201d, chugged a cup of water and pulled my shit together. It was a rough day, especially because I had work later that night. \n\nThis type of lifestyle continued for me, fast forward a week and I\u2019m heading to a New Years party with this new group of friends who so far are much more career driven, funny, intelligent and overall well rounded people then my other group. I\u2019m smiling because all the anxiety I use to feel is gone, I\u2019m leaned back in my car, with a gorgeous girl next to me bumping meek mills new album and loving life. \n\n(You may be wondering where the job interview came from) \n\nA few weeks back I was contacted by this brokerage because I had passed my real estate exam first go (typically this takes multiple tries, I\u2019m not smart I just studied hard). I wasn\u2019t going to go because I spend most of my year in Canada for university, and saw no opportunity for me, and also figured they wouldn\u2019t want me. \n\nHowever I decided to call them back, I walked in with a \u201cfuck it I\u2019m doing this because why not\u201d mentality, and they offered me a job knowing I could not work most of the year. \n\nI feel so incredibly good right now. My life is taking off in ways I couldn\u2019t have expected, and I wanted to share this because I feel as though it could help a lot of people. \n\nThe thing I realized about saying \u201cyes\u201d is that it\u2019s not about the action of going, or the people you meet. Saying \u201cyes\u201d allows you to be free. You stop caring what others think because it\u2019s not your fault if something doesn\u2019t work out, you were just saying yes. This mentality allows you to live in the moment, and the moment, at least from my experience is the best place to live.\n\nYou have one life and I for one believe whole heartedly that it should be lived to its fullest potential. \n\nI urge each and every one of you to try this way of life for a week. If you hate it, don\u2019t keep doing it, but there\u2019s a good chance your life will improve. \n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about taking my advice, stop thinking and say \u201cyes\u201d already. \n\nBest of luck!",

I've known him for a couple of years through an ex-partner and in the past he has helped me with my studies a lot for which I'm thankful for (my studies are a bit connected to his Profession).However, ever since I was a child, I've had problems interacting with people who are older than me by +10 years. I have no problem with people around my age or younger than me but as soon as I am surrounded by people who are around the same age as my parents I freeze and just want to dig a hole and hide in it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u0014I don't know what to do about it other then smiling and nodding to whatever they say like a robot. I often hide behind my partner or friends and if neither of them are present I just try to avoid interacting with people as much as possible by hiding or doing stuff on my phone..\n\nMy friends seem to be doing fine around people who are older than us but to me it's agony.. I have tried several times acting 'normal' around people but I always get anxious and mess up. I have scared many adults away with my odd sense of humour or 'naive' views of the world. I understand it's partially a generational thing and I should just deal with them like I do with people my own age but I can't.\n\nI don't know what to talk about, I don't know what seems funny to the general public and I don't know how to behave. I lack knowledge in many general subjects and can only lead discussions that cover odd topics that count as childish or vulgar amongst my elder acquaintances\u2026.\n\nI desperately wish to change this!\n\nAny kind of advice is welcome!!!\n\nP.S.

I spend every year trying to form good friendships (because god knows i suck at it and i've always been a lonely girl growing up) but no matter how much i try it seems like no one ever notices me. \n\nThe truth is, i have friends. I guess. We hang out and have fun, some from college others from highschool, but on my birthday... No one remembered, just three people (two of them my internet friends) Hell, I even shared one instagram story where this one random girl wished me a happy birthday, in some pathetic way of saying \"it's my birthday!!! Hello!!! Someone?\" And they saw it.

No one ever does anything for me. And no, i don't do things in order to get something back, but god i just want someone to tell me that they care. It's so draining to feel so lonely all the time, to feel like i have to always reach out, always try and make them remember i'm there. \n\n*TL; DR:* I'm so tired of feeling lonely.

But everything changed last year. I knew I had to get out of my little shell so I started talking to new people. \n\nIt was quite a struggle. I faced a lot of rejections, loneliness and there were times when I felt like a complete failure. Some people did talk to me whereas others totally ignored me. But during all this I had a friend who stood by me no matter what. He listened to my rantings, gave me general advice, introduced me to some of his friends and so on. It's a blessing to have someone who listens so patiently to you and tries to help in any possible way. Now I've become much better at socialising. There's still so much to improve but I have changed so much from my previous self. I have gained lots of friends and my self confidence has boosted. All this in just one year.\n\nThe takeaway from this is no matter how shy and introverted you are, try to get atleast one good friend (preferably an extrovert) who is happy to listen and to help you in socialising. Trust this person completely and he/she will fix all your social problems. It sounds difficult but it is not impossible. Good luck !!",

        "original": "I'm 24, I'm still a virgin, and I never had a girlfriend. \n\nBack when I was 13, my interest in girls and relationships rose. Had a few crushes back then, and I actually had some self-confidence and would actually get a bit flirtatious with them. And I actually didn't mind telling my friends who are the girls I like best. However, soon after that, I noticed a change in their attitude to me: They grew cold, they stopped talking to me, stopped greeting me in the streets, and would move away with their friends  when they noticed I was around. Initially I felt sad and awkward over this, but eventually I got over it. The conclusion I got from all this, though, was that I can't let my friends - or anyone else - tell a girl I like her. That was something I had to do by myself.\nEventually, as I enrolled in high school, my attention slowly turned to a classmate of mine. She was the smartest girl in the class, and slowly I also realized how beautiful she was. Above that, we also seemed to have some common interests and views. And soon, I had a huge crush on her.\nHowever, I didn't know how to tell her this, so I kept hanging around her, waiting for the right moment. As both of us qualified for a school competition, I would get to spend a big part of that day together with her. And so I decided: that would be my D-Day.\n\nThen, however, one day her closest friends started acting weird around me. Eventually, a guy from the class (a mutual close friend at the time) approached me and told me pretty much everyone in the class realized I had a crush on her, that she was really annoyed with my behaviour, and that she would appreciate if I would be less present around her. \nI felt devastated about that, but soon the situation started to get even worse. I struggled to keep myself away from her as much as possible, yet I couldn't keep my eyes off her, still hoping I could somehow change her mind. The school competition we took part in ended up being a really awkward experience, and I didn't do anything about the whole situation.\n\nEventually, her friends started shouting at me, telling me I'm a creepy psychopath and getting really protective over her. And it also had effect on the others: I became the laughing stock of the class, and after a while, when I wanted to join my classmates I usually hung out with after school, they told me \"Ehh, don't be angry about this, but we would prefer you not coming with us right now...\"\nEventually I managed to somehow repair my relationships with the class, yet I couldn't quite get her out of my head and had several awkward situations during the rest of my high school years.   \nI still had some hopes during my early university years, but in the end, as I didn't see her anymore, I managed to get over it.\nAnd now, for the last three years, I have been trying to finally find a girlfriend. Or, well, at least to make myself look for one.\n\nThe thing is, I meet so many attractive women every day, but I just don't know how to approach them. Some are classmates I've known for a few years now, yet can't help but feel awkward about suddenly trying to get romantic with one of them (especially in case of those I haven't seen for a while now due to dropping out and similar stuff). Then there are also girls I don't know personally, but see every day - however, with those I just can't help but feel I would come off as superficial, shallow and only interested in sex (as I would obviously approach them due to their looks).\nAnd even when I get the opportunity to talk to a girl I like, I always hear my brain telling me \"Be careful, she might realize you like her, and then you might end in an awkward situation! Hey, you've been talking for a while to her now, go away or you will come off as creepy and needy and annoy her.\" \n\nNow, I know the usual response \"Don't be afraid of rejection, the worst thing that can happen is her saying \"no\"\". Yet, my own experience was far, far worse. I got humiliated, I lost my friends, and I felt everyone would just prefer me to go away. How can I set myself free from all those negative thoughts?",

I went to special school for people with same needs and problems, and stays there for about 6 years.\n\n\nOver the years I developed social skills and became a different person. From being scared from my own shadow, I became one of the most popular people I knew, both with friends and girls. \n\n\nAfter living the place, I served the Israeli army for a year, and left my parents house to an apt with rommates at the south of country,  payd almost fully by the state because of my needs as an handicap. \n\n\nWithout going too much into details, my last few months living there I felt into a big depression,  something that can happen for me as I have chronic depression and it's hard to maintain it when it realy goes wild... I started to smoke weed more and more, i even dropped the cigarette and started smoking weed full time.  One day, a new rommate came, and he told the state worker that I'm a drug addict. Long story short, they sent me home and canceled my state handicap privileges. \n\n(I live in a state witch smoking weed is very illegal in... they also cancle the handicap privileges if they catch you drinking a beer).\n\nSo. To the point. It's been about 2 years since I went back to my parents, and my social life became less and less...\nPeople lost touch one after the other, and I have very few friends left.\n\n\nBut here's the kicker... when I ask myself how it came to this... I mostly come to think it's because I didnt have any routine like school to meet people. But today my firm took the worker to the movies as a treat. I came and said hello to some people, but that's about all. I watch almost all of them are having some sort of small talk between each,  but I couldn't find a way to just naturally talk with anyone... I felt like if someone watched from the side, I would be the only weirdo to drink coffee alone and occasionally look at my phone....\n\nLike if someone ask someone else what they think of me, they wont even remember who I am....\n\n\nMaybe me being a long for so long wasn't just because of not having a place to meet people,  but because i subcutaneously pushing everyone away?\n\nCould it be that Me being lonely for so long, made my social skills much worse than before?\n\n\nWhat would be the right way for me to act so ill learn again to attract people around me and just feel natural around them?\n\nSorry for the long post and bad English.

That kinda screwed my feelings. Now I get recognized as cute and that seems to be a good sign because I now also get told by some people that I\u2018m a handsome guy.\n\nI had two dates in my life.

But I just thought she wouldn\u2018t be the right one for me. \n\nNow I met someone. On a birthday party. I actually know her a little bit longer (because we were in the same school as kids) and then I was talking with her a bit. Then I met her at a hardcore concert while I was a little drunk. She looked at me in ways that wanted to tell me that she\u2018d like to go in bed with me. (I\u2018m sure about that, all of my friends that saw us told me that) and for the whole night she didn\u2018t get off my ass. But I just didn\u2018t get it.\n\nThen on new year\u2018s eve we met at a party in an old school that\u2018s used in our city to let bands have their practices. (I play in a band) and I told after her a bit of that I\u2018m gonna show her our room that we got some weeks ago. We sat there for 5 hours talking, after that we slept (we didn\u2018t have sex, we literally just slept there) and then we went home.\n\nNow I\u2018m going into the cinema with her on thursday. In Mary Poppins (I didn\u2018t choose the movie, don\u2018t blame me). I just don\u2018t know.. how should I behave?

One dilemma is that my crush is going and I'm already a unconfident and awkward person but it's even more when I'm around him. It's embarrassing because I can't even speak and I'm shy and quiet.\n\nThe other people on the trip are confident and sociable but I'm not and I feel inferior to all of them. I don't have friends and they are not my friends. People tend to not like me and avoid me because they probably feel uncomfortable around me because I don't really know what to say and I'm quiet. What makes this worse is that we must be in groups of atleast 3 when going places or doing anything. I feel that they probably have contacted eachother and made plans :'(\n\nI have to share a room with a girl who doesn't like me and things are awkward between us and we don't talk to eachother.\n\nAnother thing is that most people don't know that I'll be there and they've seen me in university as a quiet, loner and shy person who never speaks and wears the same clothes everyday. They'll be thinking \"wth is she doing here?\" . They'll be surprised.\n\nI just don't want to care what people think about me because I've done this all my life and I'm 20 now.

        "original": "Personal Details:\n\n22 M, short, Hispanic (no accent), average build (no dad bod), self rated a 4, well groomed, never smell bad, fingernails are normal, in college, decent haircut, clean shaved (I cant grow a beard well), medium high pitched voice, dressed well (trust me, I dont wear khaki cargo shorts with white socks and DC shoes) Any more details can be provided if asked for and relevant.\n\nBackground:\n\nI have always focused on myself (not obsessively, just always looking out for myself and looking what is best for me at the time). I have focused on schoolwork while growing up and did not socialize much growing up, I maintained average of 3-4 real friends (whatever \"real\" means). I do well in school and focused on what actually interests me rather than trying to fit in. I know how to lie convincingly and would like as much insight into how I can turn more normal. I dont want to believe what I will portray, I want to just fit in. Im not doing it to be a follower, Im doing it to use the knowledge to better myself and my interactions with everyone I meet.\n\nQuestion:\n\nI want as much advice on how to be normal. I have outlined some possible topics to dive into. For clarity, I have provided my personal opinions on these topics so that you all can understand my situation better.\n\nTopics I would like to know what normal people like:\n\nConversation - I personally like to talk about things that interest me but as you will see, few people will be able to share my interests within my age group. NOTE: Tell me all the BS that people talk about including small talk and other stuff).\n\nRelationships - I have never had one. I dont know where to start here. Im not an idiot though, I know what to avoid but I dont know how to lead anything anywhere .\n\nMusic - I like classical music and heavy metal. What do most people like?\n\nMovies - I like the classics, like Bladerunner, Metropolis, 2001 (Im not meme ing, I actually really enjoyed the film) and 12 angry men. Some people haven't even heard of these so what do people watch?\n\nHobbies - Im a jack of all trades but master of none. I play pool and snooker. I used to gamble a lot so Im an avid card player. I fish and hunt, but Im not a redneck or hillbilly. I used to compete in marksmanship tournaments. I know the rules of most popular sports but am not good at them.\nNOTE: please let me know what is considered normal sports consumption like what to know, where to go look etc.\n\nDrinking - This is interesting because I enjoy sitting down and drinking a nice bourbon, scotch or rye neat or I occasionally make myself a drink like an old fashioned, gin and tonic, mai tai, dry martini, kangaroo kickers, vieux carre, etc. Ive never really like to binge drink but If I have to I will. Please recommend some liquor that can be taken to parties that people enjoy.\n\nConversation topics: I talk about school to start and since most people know me from school they usually go straight to that, and I cant deviate since my interests dont align with theirs.\n\nFood: I have taken on classic french cuisine, and other country cuisine like italian and peruvan etc. What do normal people eat, like burgers or something fast I guess.\n\nGym: I work out but not too much so Im just mildly tone w/ medium build. I cant really talk about the gym because people will one up me on this. Im alright with getting one upped as long as it furthers positive social interactions.\n\nVehicle use: I dont drive. I know, shocking. I bus to uni. What do normal people drive, when do they get their drivers licence etc.\n\nClubs: I have never been to one, since I have never really seen the need to go. Now I will go but I dont know how to behave etc in that environment. What to expect, what is expected of me, level of drunk I need to be etc.\n\nPolitics - I'm neither for nor against Trump, or Trudeau (for Canada). I dont think this will come up but what do most people agree is the most PC thing to say? I dont want to stir trouble If I need to remove this, dont worry I will.\n\nPhilosophy - I believe we are all machines that are all destined to do what we believe is free will but in reality its just how we have been hardwired to behave etc. (me asking this question is also a result of this programming, for lack of a better word). I dont really think people are deep enough in casual conversation to bring this up.\n\nReligion - I will avoid talking about this with anyone. No advice needed.\n\nPets - I have a lhasa apso. Its weird to talk about (most people have not heard of this dog)\n\nEveryday habits - I like to eat cheerios and milk in the morning and then get to uni, do work, talk to people, eat, study, work out, shower, snack, study, sleep repeat. Weekends are just study. I dont go to starbucks because I believe that its just social signaling, but if I have to I will start to frequent.\n\nComputer - I have an IBM thinkpad. I dont like Macs because I think theyre social signaling and not very useful when compared to what an avid PC user can do with their PC.\n\nDrug use - I dont like marijuana but if the occasion calls for it I need to make adjustments. No other drugs will be used. \n\nPersonal goals: I want to strive for perfection (I know its not obtainable but striving for it will lead to the best possible version of myself even if it comes at the cost of my sanity). I want to have a real thing to do every day, I want a real love, I want everything. I am full of pride and must uphold my family's pride and be an example to those around me. I live by my code of Honor and nothing gets in the way (adjusting temporarily for this normalcy is part of upholding my familys honor and pride).\n\nThere is probably more and if you guys find anything please let me know. Dont take any of my personal opinions to heart and all I am looking for is for peoples advice on what is considered normal for these topics. I will not turn down any legitimate advice.",

I've worked there for over a year and a half now and still haven't made friends with my 15+ coworkers, all who are around my age. In my year and half I've moved from \"basic\" supervision to specialized positions such as child support enforcement.\n\nI had my first mental breakdown after a coworker's wedding. None of my coworkers talked to me or my wife that night. I tried to talk to them, but it was more of a \"hey...bye\" conversation. They got drunk and joked with each other. We left early. I kept wondering what I even did to make them not talk to me.\n\nA few weeks later, I broke down again at work and left early. I took FMLA time to see a therapist and walk away from work. I was put on Celexa and made a lot of improvements.\n\nI came back to work a little over a month later. I took a different position, which is lower on the totem pole of work. Around this same time, we had a new girl start. She's 22.\n\nThe first few weeks were good. I showed her around and helped her out. She came to me and talked about her life problems and we joked around at times. It was so nice to actually have a friend at work.\n\nThen another coworker had a wedding.\n\nOnce again, no one really talked with us. They had assigned seating and I was the only one our age who was sat with our administrators who are in their 50's. The new girl suddenly became friends with everyone that night despite them not talking to her before.\n\nNow my coworkers will come up and talk with the new girl all day long. They'll laugh and flirt with her and then not even say hi to me. I get it-she's young and cute and newly single, but these guys are married and about to turn 30. The new girl is my partner so while they talk all day I'll end up having to do work for our unit. I've expressed my concerns to our supervisor but they went nowhere.\n\nOne Friday afternoon, every single coworker left for lunch together. They even went out of their way to find the new girl to ask her to go with them. Not a single one of them asked me to go.\n\nI've asked them why that happened and everyone says \"sorry you feel like that\" or \"that wasn't my intentions to not include you.\"\n\nThursday, I broke down again. The anniversary of my mom's death is this weekend so that didn't help my feelings. One coworker came in to ask how I was doing and I told him everything of how I feel. He said he wants to be my friend and he'll make more of an effort to talk to me, but I've heard that before.\n\nI took Friday off work. Today the new girl posted one of those meme videos (Lad Bible) on Facebook and tagged everyone in it and wrote about something about when they recently hung out.\n\nI'm nervous of how things will go again next week. I don't want pity friends, just genuine friends to help get through an already stressful job. I do have positive things to live for, but this situation is overwhelming me. I just want to be accepted and never can. This struggle for acceptance is becoming too much for me.\n\nCrossposted from [r/SuicideWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/58vlxi/ostracized_by_coworkers_to_the_point_of_a/) because I'm curious to see what advice would be given.

        "original": "Hey everyone. I think this is the right sub to ask this, but if not please direct me elsewhere.\n\nI'm 21 male and a junior at college. I almost have no social life at all. I'm a transfer student and have spent one semester in this town. I had friendships at my last school, but they formed naturally through classes and I didn't put nearly effort into starting them.\n\nAt this new university I was in a dark place. I haven't kept up with old friends expect one or two. I've been addicted to porn and league of legends forever. It was so easy to tell myself I didn't need friends and was happy being a loner. It was true at the time, I was somewhat happy being a loner and just going to classes, playing guitar in my room, working out, and playing league the rest of my time.\n\nOver thanksgiving I had sort of a wakeup call, and realized I fucking hated the direction my life was headed. My grades were starting to suffer, I had no support network, and I was completely alone outside of a few acquaintances from group projects. I quit both league and fapping cold turkey, and I haven't done either since December first. With all my new free time I pretty much lived in the library studying all day to salvage my grades. I ended the semester with 4 As and a B.\n\nThrough winter break I've realized how far behind I am in so many aspects of my life. I feel like I've been wasting so much time, and I've been working crazy overtime to catch myself up. I studied the material from my classes nearly every day, teaching myself everything I didn't learn. I've been exercising more and I'm getting into shape. I interviewed today for an internship in my field and was accepted (even though I have one semester of experience). So my life is headed in the right direction, except I have literally no social life.\n\nI met a girl I really like in December and we started dating. I didn't see her over break but we went out again tonight and it went really well. Aside from her I have no real friends in this city. I understand how unhealthy it is to have her as my only social and emotional connection, and I need to kickstart my social life as quickly as possible. \n\nI'm a natural introvert. I have several hobbies, but all of them are independent: Playing electric guitar (heavy metal), hiking, running, reading, listening to music, studying, video games (not anymore). I have no social media aside from LinkedIn. I have never used snapchat or anything similar. I always just text or call normally. I'm not in the habit of taking selfies and it feels so awkward to consider posting images of what I'm doing online. I'm 21, but I've never had alcohol. I'm going to make myself try it this weekend, but I'm not sure what to expect. I know if I can get used to enjoying it then it'll open up new venues and options for me. \n\nMy roommate and I get alone well but he always hangs out with a large group of anime girls who really aren't my type. There are a group a students I studied with a bit in December (including the girl I'm dating), and it's likely we'll get together at some point again. But I know I need to have friends outside of her social circle as well. I'm not a naturally clingy guy, but I worry I will start to come across that way if I'm only ever at stuff she's at.\n\nI feel like I have decent social skills, I'm usually able to carry on conversations and I don't get anxiety often. But I have no clue how to get started. Thank you so much if you read all of this, I'll really appreciate any advice!",

I always have been kinda bad at social interactions and avoided it for as long as I can remember, but after i turned 15 I really felt the awkwardness and social anxiety.\u00a0\n\nOften not knowing what to say and being bad at small convo really makes interactions awkward so i try to avoid it. I mean if someone asks a specific question, i can answer without problem. But the general interaction is where i really suck. For\u00a0example, i go to my class 30mins earlier when no one has yet arrived because i feel difficult to adjust to the class if it's half filled or there are many people so i am the first one to reach so that i can adjust to people. But as i am the first one in, people coming after me ofc greet me by saying \"hello\" or \"hi\" or \"hey\". My class has almost 1:5 ratio of boys to girls. And when the girls do greet me i find it difficult to properly greet them without feeling awkward. And after saying hello back people usually follow up with a question like \" how are you\"( In different informal ways ofc) and because I get caught off guard.... I just end up saying \"fine\" when generally you are supposed to ask them back. Like \"yeh fine, how about you\". But during the situation i feel so anxious that i forget to ask anything back and i guess people might find it rude right? Hope you get what i mean.\u00a0\n\nAnd the thing is i have a naturally heavy voice... When speaking loudly it may sound rude so unconsciously i started speaking at a lower volume without realising. Often which leads to the other person asking me to repeat what i said. Internally i think i am audible but i am not for public. I have a good sense of humor but i avoid making jokes for this reason just to avoid awkward repeats.\n\nAnd this is just the greeting part. I am really good at maths and other general aptitude based subjects. Like i am actually better than my peers because i practice at home as well so my peers sometimes ask me questions regarding certain maths or other problem....\n\nAnd as i said if someone asks me a specific question i can answer it so it's no problem trying to explain the maths problems but often when explaining something, the other person looks at you and i feel anxious if someone is looking at me,\u00a0 so i avoid eye contact which also makes me\u00a0nervous and now i start speaking super fast.... And then i internally realise i am speaking so fast and i slow my speech but now as i am consciously slowing down, it goes to some awkwardly lower speed. This happens quite often, when i talk about something i know, i end up talking super fast without realising and then super slow when i realise about it.\n\nAs i said i have a hard time making small convo therefore it's often difficult to get in between a going on conversation too.... Like presenting ideas during\u00a0discussion etc etc which is indeed important during group work.\n\nOften i end up stuttering. For example if someone asks me about certain something.... Mentally ofc i can answer it..... But i think what to say too fast that i am unable to turn it into appropriate speech... Means i end up thinking what to say faster than i say.... Which ends up me stuttering, and when i realise i am stuttering and people have eyes on me, i end up forgetting a lot of what i was supposed to say.\n\nI do find people annoying and difficult to deal with, but i can't just stay like this, i need to learn how to interact properly. Where i live, not wanting to talk with people and not\u00a0going out all the times for guys is considered girlish( i know its sexist but that's how it is).\u00a0\n\nI can't let my anxiety get better of me so i need to be at least acceptable at social interaction.

They handed the group to another person who's basically killed it. \n\nIt was a nerd/geek/board games meetup and it was pretty hard to make friends there but the board games were good icebreakers and they did the events in a place that didn't sell alcohol, which I cannot consume for health reasons. \n\nI wasn't particularly into the games, but it was the only SOBER activity a t-total, mid 20's, straight white dude like me could attend based in my city. There were two other groups with the same theme, but they had a heavy drinking culture which I can't be a part of. One of the groups said it didn't bother them, but it was very clear that the aim was to get wrecked... There was also an underlying tone of peer pressure to drink and do drugs... Which isn't fun if you're stone cold sober guy like me. \n\nI've been forcing myself to go to these meetups despite not enjoying them because if I don't, I'm essentially alone when I'm not working. It's basically my only social stimulus these days. But yesterday *I just couldn't make myself walk though the door*. \n\nI realised that I don't have anything in common with these people. That they have totally different aims, in life and in this meetup. I realised that I'm not what they want in a friend and they aren't what I want in friends. It cuts me deep having to fend off the interrogations about why I don't drink.

It's been almost 7 years since I quit... I'm not new to it. \n\nThe worst part is that I know what people will say to me...  \n\n>\"Just go anyway\"\n\n>\"Drinking isn't bad for you\"\n\n>\"Nobody cares if you don't drink\"\n\nI've heard them all now.

I can get by really well with small talk but only for so long that the conversation eventually just dies.

I always see these girls just spinning up conversations from thin air and making them so interesting and fun to apart to a point I often find myself joining already started conversation and preferring being in group convos where I don't need to start something or carry the conversation. My brain literally becomes empty trying to think of things to further a conversation or make it interesting. I always think that I'm a boring person and that I'm gonna end up alone.

Whether it's starting a conversation, keeping it going, small talk, deep conversation, you name it. My mind goes blank very easily. This is especially a problem for me in 1-on-1 situations, since it pretty much always leads to long awkward silences when the conversation fizzles out. I love having light hearted banter and throwing jokes around, but my humor is very hit or miss and snowballs according to its results. Jokes that land and make people laugh give me a confidence boost which in turns allows to crack jokes much more easily, while others make me feel so incredibly awkward that I start overthinking every single word I say after that.\n\nAnd even in group situation, I often feel like I don't have anything interesting to add to the talk, and when I do add something people don't seem to care at all. This is caused in part by the fact that I live very far from college and downtown and don't have a car. The 2 hour bus commute makes going out to events and stuff very hard since I'm already having trouble with finding time to study after getting home at 8pm. Also, I don't have enough money to go out that often since college is pretty expensive.\n\nThe other issue I've been having is with this girl I really like. When we talk, she's (obviously) usually the one to initiate the conversation and loves sharing her interests with me all while asking me about mine. We often make very prolonged eye contact when talking, longer than I've even made with anybody, and I often notice her looking at me. I'm, of course, scared shitless to ask her out for a few reasons:\n\n**A.** I used to have another close girl friend which I asked out a few years ago. Instead of just rejecting me, she ended up straight up ghosting me and started avoiding me 24/7 even though we shared a lot of class, which destroyed me. Would rather not have that happen again.\n\n**B.** We're both part of the same group of friends and things could get awkward not only between us, but within the group.\n\n**C.** As someone who has been a shy introvert since I was a kid, and thus has literally zero experience in dating and relationships, I have no fucking clue how any of it works. Even if everything somehow works out and she says yes, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do next, especially since it's really hard to plan any kind of date with both her and me living very far away from activities and each other.\n\n**D.** I am very awkward when it comes to physical contact. It's not that I don't like it, but I just feel extremely weird when touching someone and I'm always scared of overstepping their boundaries. I often see guys just casually hugging girls they've never talked to before like it's nothing, while the most physical contact I've had with many of my friends is a fistbump. I know how it's an important part of socialising, but at this point I feel like it's too late and I would simply look weird to them if I suddenly tried to make more physical contact after being really awkward about it for such a long time.",

        "original": "I am probably the most average guy I know. And yet, I feel the loneliest  I think I've ever felt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've lived an average life in the United Kingdom; grew up with a supporting family, got decent grades in school and went to college, made great friends and kept in touch with those I felt closest to. From what I've been told I have a good personality - funny, cheerful, kind and very polite - and that I'm quite good looking, I'm average height and average weight (5\"9 and around 174 lbs/79kg).  I've always been the straight edge, never smoked or did any drugs and I only drink alcohol socially. I've now recently hit the age of 21, yet on this day, I think I'm at my lowest. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEver since leaving college, things slowly went downhill. I figured I'd be into Game Development Level 3 since I enjoyed video games so much, but it turned very quickly on the mid of the second year and I ended up dropping out.\n\nSince then I've had no idea what I've been wanting to do as a career choice, which didn't bother me so much at first because I'm always up for learning new things and discovering what I feel comfortable in doing.\n\nI got a job in a warehouse in 2018 for about 8 months, and I felt horrible there, I was alone most of the time sorting out computer parts, detaching them, cleaning them, assorting them etc. At one point I ended up breaking down in tears because of how much stress it was pushing on me, so in the end I quit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I've lived on since then, my closest friends that I've known for over a decade have gotten closer to one another after I introduced them, and I feel more on the sidelines now. I'm not angry that they're best friends, they have a lot in common and it's always positive. But I've noticed I'm becoming more and more bitter noticing that I have no one close with me.\n\nIn the last 6 months they both have gotten into relationships, one is working and the other is at university learning nuclear engineering. I love talking with them and their \"Significant Other\", I'm really happy for them. But I realised that I can not stand being around them when they're being romantic to one another. It doesn't disgust me, it just hurts. I feel a very deep and unwanted feeling in my chest every time, which I think is signalling that I'm either jealous or just simply bitter over what I could have. I rarely see my friends and when I do, they're too focused on themselves and kind of just mute what I feel, but I don't blame them because they can't do anything about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been in past relationships and I am still on good terms with them, we don't talk much but we left it on a positive end, which is more than I could ask for.\n\nI've now even ended up signing up for online dating to feel more comfortable and waste some time, but I don't think I'm the type of person for it. I don't mind the rejection, it just doesn't feel right looking for it, constantly swiping and flirting to girls just to get some sort of date. And plus I'm not one for hookups or sex, just isn't me.\n\nAs the days grew towards the end of 2018, my mind got worse, and I started to think more and more about suicide. I've always had deep thoughts but suicide became so much more frequent. I would plan in my head what I would do if I were to die, how I would plan my death note or how I'd end up doing it. Really horrible thoughts. \n\nI've overcome most of the suicidal thoughts - I know it's the wrong thing to do, and I'm too afraid of death to do it anyway - but there are most nights now where I cry under the music I play in my room so smother the noise. I'm always alone in the house (mother works most of the time, so I rarely see her). \n\nI've even ended up donating to a charity because I just wanted to socialise with the charity volunteer in the middle of town and get a hug... I know, it's petty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've never felt so alone in my life, I just want to be happy again, where I was more ambitious and prouder of myself for making small goals. I feel I needed to pour out my feelings somewhere online anonymously. Ended up making a second Reddit account because I'm just too embarrassed to use my internet persona for this kind of problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there anyone that can just talk to me? Give me some advice? I would just like to hear people's opinions and whether they can relate in any way, shape or form.\n\nIf you read through all of this then you honestly have my respect, my life is boring as hell and you took the time to just read what I had to say. <3\n\nIf I also seem stuck up with the way I described my life, I apologise.",

QQ\n\ndue to my minimal talking in my whole life pretty much, i kinda dont really know what to talk about, when people approach me e.e , i do take good care of my hair/skin/style and stuff like that, people seem to approach me often, and i try my best not to disappoint them for doing that, i try to be as extroverted as i can, in terms of nervousness, i think im almost fine, i dont get nervous or anxious or unconfident alot, but what does happen is, i dont know what to talk about!! i've always wondered, what do couples say to each other everyday? how do they keep finding new things to talk about? that has always sort of impressed me. \n\nso taking action, i decided to change my comfortable lifestyle ( since last week), i deleted all my video games, and decided to start improving the aspects of me that im terrible at, especially social skills, so i was wondering, where can i go from here? i need to improve my communication skills in general, not just with females, are there any useful books that may help in the matter? or articles or anything! and thanks a'lot for reading so far, and hope you have a wonderful day!\n\nExtra : i forgot to mention that, when im with my group of close friends, i suddenly become the most talking person of the group! you would never know that im an introvert, i think its mostly because my friends and i share common interests ( games ), so i could go and talk for hours and do fine, however, in college, its never really the case T\\_T\n\nTL:DR : suppose that someone just woke up from a deep coma, hes in his twenties now, and has terrible social skills, and is introverted ( so has limited interaction energy ), what are the best approaches for him to get better at his social skills? books articles? \n\nThanks in advance!",

In other cases, I end up staying in that friend group and they continue to mistreat me until I finally have enough and decide to leave and be alone until I find another friend group and so forth. . . .

She said something along the lines of, \"Well, you don't really know him.\" I wanted to make the argument that half of her friend group didn't know the kid, but I decided against it. \n\nAnother time, a girl (I thought she was my friend, I guess not) who I had known since 8th grade (I'm a Sophomore now) told me she didn't want to watch a rally with me (even though it was only 100-feet away). I had had a really rough week, so I had a rant and I told her I always do things for her and she never does anything in return and I never even ask her to do anything in return. All I wanted for 3 years of loyalty was her to watch a damn rally with me. Was that too much to ask? She just scoffed and said, \"Okay, bye.\" I felt like crying.

I pay close attention to the clothes I wear and I try to always look my best. I dont exercise on a regular basis, but I would consider myself to be healthy (6', 183 pounds) and I have been playing sports my whole life. I would consider myself an attractive guy (prob a \\~7.5 in my view) so I dont think appearence is the issue. I still sometimes go play pickup basketball and meet cool people there, but I feel extremely awkard and invasive if I ask to add somebody on social media. I have the fear that I will begin to stutter  (I used to stutter when I was younger, but I have for the most part gotten rid of that habit) or totally butcher what I wanted to say and embarress myself. I'm not trying to make it sound like it is impossible for me to talk to another human, its just I fear I will embarress myself and get laughed at (externally or internally) even though all I'm trying to do is build a relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though I grew up in a very tight-knit community and had a very general group of friends, I seemed to always be alone. I have never had a best friend growing up, or really even a close friend with the exception of 1 person, but even then it wasn't much. I grew up in the middle of nowhere (my gradution class had 22 kids in total), and was raised by my 2 Roman Catholic parents, and nobody else around unless it was the holidays. During highschool I never partied, and spent most of my nights getting stoned in my room, reading, or playing video games/music.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I went off to college at UVM, I thought I was going to finally turn my social life around and make friends that will create lasting memories. Although I do have 2 or 3 people I will occasionally see and talk to, I still have yet to make a \"friend\" that I can talk to and hang out with. I see everyone else posting photos of them and their friends, and creating memories with each other, while I just waste away in my dorm room wondering what I did wrong. I have yet to attend a \"party\" here at UVM, because I dont know where to find them or know somebody that would know. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy entire life I've felt this sense of lonliness, and haved failed when it comes to human relationships. I can't seem to get that 'connection' with other people and I can't progress past being just an 'acquaintance'. The few women who have gotten to know me have said \"you would be an amazing catch (for somebody else)\". I want to be perfectly clear though, this isn't a rant about the friend-zone. It's more of a rant about .. not having a solid and meaningful relationship (platonic, romantic, or otherwise) with another human being. I seem to also have trust issues, where I might purposovly avoid talking to a girl because I think she is attractive, and I fear she will cheat on me after I've put my trust in her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know that I'm not perfect and each day I try to work to improve myself. I read a lot and I love learning about things, so I always have things to talk about, but I honestly just don't know what my problem is. I feel like there is something wrong with me. Whenever there was partners in school, I was always the one who worked alone. Everybody seemed to have a best-friend or that one person they wanted to partner with except for me. I didn't see myself as the \"outsider\" or \"weird kid\", in fact many people liked me, but I guess I always always their third or fourth or fifth choice. I try to remain optimistic and I go out of my way to change this.. but I have had NO luck so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to go out and make friends, but I just dont know where to go or what to do. And even if I did have a friend or girlfriend to hangout with, I wouldnt even know what to do! When people say, \"do you want to hang out?\", what do you do around town besides go shopping? I feel most comfortable going over to other peoples dorms/locations, because I feel like I will fail to entertain if I bring somebody to my dorm (Although I do have a stereo and speakers, what are we going to do, just sit there and listen to music? I'm getting anxious just thinking about it, I'm afraid of being a letdown in front of people and them thinking I'm \"lame\") Since I've been dealing with this lonliness and overall sense of depression since I was 13, (lonliness ever since I could remember), I haven't really had anyone to ever vent to. Because of this I used apps to talk to strangers over the internet in order to fill that void. I love both fo my parents, but I dont feel comfortable enough to discuss some of these feelings and ideas. Neither of them are good listeners, and whenever I do say something they always hear it differently, leaving me with nobody to listen to me and understand what Im trying to say. . \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try to go out as often as possible, but it seems that I just have incredibly bad luck with actually meeting people who share my values and interests, or I dont know where to go to actually meet people.  I've only ever lived in rural VT and Burlington, so maybe a change of scenary will help, but I'm afraid I would see the same results. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\~ I also want to point out that I'm aware being overbearing turns people off from you, so I dont velieve the problem is me being too availible or wanting to always spend time with someone, although if somebody wanted to be around on a fairly daily basis I would be more than willing to maintain that relationship.

        "title": "7 Short, Fast-start Tips To Be More Confident, In a Better Mood And Stop Missing Out On Life",
        "original": "Dear friends, \n\nI'm not going to waste time on fluff so here you go and enjoy ;) :\n\n1. **When walking or even sitting, keep your head up** -- yes, you are perfectly able to see where you're going if you walk, trust me, I know from experience. You are not looking at the sky, you're just keeping your head straight. If you stumble, no biggie, just get your head up and move forward. Nobody laughs to badasses who are brave enough to get up and move forward with their head up (also happened to me a few times, nobody dared).\n\n2. **Start exercising** -- there is an app called Freeletics (definitely not affiliated with them). Check it out, the exercises are free and range from beginner to advanced. There is something for everyone. Also, when you wake up in the morning, you want to do 10 pushups in the first five minutes of waking up, if you're not able to do 10, do 5, just do something. It'll get your lymph moving through the body and you won't need coffee and you definitely won't be a freakin zombie until 10 am. \n\n3. **Get some high energy music when you wake up** -- try to stay off of Power Metal for that matter or old school hip hop -- hip hop is plain depressing if you listen to the lyrics and it gets into your subconscious, you don't want that. Try some high energy edm (almost no vocals), try some hardstyle, you know, the high energy stuff, my fav is Timmy Trumpet. \n\n4. **thought loops** -- this is absolute gold, but gold with a twist. This is a gold coin that comes in a glass case with official papers and you can charge this piece of gold 2x the market value of gold. This is how important this piece of information is. Now, before you say, I don't like this because this is stupid self-help fluff, let me stop you right there. If you're not going to follow my instructions, get the fuck outta here. I'm not interested in having you complain how I'm a scam/you've-heard-this-advice-already and-it-didn't-work, but you didn't take the time to do all the tasks, fuck you. And trust me, this particular tip does take time. It takes a serious amount of time and your mental space but it is so worthwhile of the effort that I just had to put it here. It is one of cornerstones of my personal confidence. Okay, let's get to the point. Make 5-10 statements about you, and while creating those statements, ask yourself what would a confident version of me look like? For instance, I've got this : \"I love the fact that I am a confident guy.\". And I don't do that 5 minutes in the morning in front of a mirror, that's actual self-help bullshit. I do that EVERY FUCKING MOMENT I GET. I do it when waiting for a bus/train/tram (in combination with high energy music, it's a killer), I do it when driving, I do it when meditating, I do it when eating, I do it when watching basketball highlights, virtually anytime when doing something that doesn't require my mental focus. And by doing that, I focus on how good I am and not on how things around me are bad.\n\n5. **What would James Bond/Tony Stark/Lucifer do?** -- those are actually my role models, but you want to find your own role model(s) who is highly confident, successful, well anything you want to become actually and then, when unsure of how to act in a certain situation, just ask yourself : \"What would XYZ do in this situation?\".\n\n6. **Ask yourself what's the worst thing that can happen and then go for it** -- pretty much self-explanatory. If you can accept and come to terms with the worst outcome scenario, you won't have this mystical cloud of depression and anxiety looming around you in a certain situation anymore. That being said, anything that happens in the upcoming situation you were afraid of is actually a win for you because you accepted the worst scenario, ergo, you won.\n\n7. **Cold showers** -- water on coldest and spray away, I usually do it after a normal shower, I just then put the water on coldest and rinse my whole body. If you can take this without being unaffected (no shivering, able to maintain normal breathing, not creating weird sounds that indicate you're cold, etc.) you're pretty much in great control of your emotions. But don't worry, nobody pulls it off on the first time, or the second, or the third for that matter. It takes a little practice...\n\nLeave me your comments, I want to know what you thought of this and upvote, but not because of my ego, but rather because I believe many Redditors here can benefit from this post.\n\nI wish you all the best in life, M.\n\nOh yea, and since Reddit asks me to specify my age and approximate location for some reason, I'm gonna say 19 and Croatia.

I made sure to make small talk and offered her my aux to play music, she has good taste so I thought we could jam out on the way over. Unfortunately, the restaurant I had in mind was closed. She ended up having to get to her next class as the drive was a bit longer than expected. I ended up dropping her off to her class and she awkwardly waved goodbye to me. :T Next day she told me, \"I don't think we''ll be anything more than classmate buddies\". Fair enough lol, at least she was honest. So I just chuckled and said, \"Harsh man, but I feel you\". \n\nPeople glance over me a lot and rather talk to anyone else but me. Maybe it's the way I dress? I'm not particularly girly. I dress in jeans, hoodies, and always have my hair in a neat bun.

I feel kinda lame asking this cause I had made a similar post in the past but that was back in a much darker time in my life and I was less mature than I am now.  Please feel free to be as brutally honest as possible because I would truly love to rid myself of this plight that I have been battling for a very long time. Brace yourself for the wall of text\n\nTo start allow me to introduce myself. I am a introvert male of twenty six. I am what you like to call a hybrid of interest. I am full on nerd, gamer, weeb, movie buff, attempting writer. I also am though someone who has and still has an interest in working out, tennis, archery, cooking, and adventure (aka trying out new and various things in life.) The point is I don't tend to fit into any stereotype (presumably)  as I am decent looking and are very friendly (sorry if this seems arrogant but its something I try my hardest to be) along with very generous and will go the extra mile for anyone. That being said If I am truly being honest I am not a shy person but I am a mental tired person. I no longer get nervous to meet or talk to people but I get in the mindset that things will usually be the same. Perhaps its a self fulling prophecy but I have also tried my hardest to be optimistic and ignore the defeatist attitude and still try again and again. I am referring to making and keeping friends at my jobs. Now don't get me wrong I can make an acquaintance pretty much any time or day but its the lasting friendship that I cannot seem to master. Unfortunately this tends to place me into two paths from prior experience. Path 1 is i will slowly sink into the friendly and reliable guy that no one ever really talks to or dose nothing with the \"team.\" Path 2 is I slowly sink into the awkward person at work that is not \"avoided\" but everyone seems to forget about despite my much repeated attempts of interactions and meetups. Ether way it sucks and I was truly hoping someone may have some wisdom or some knowledge that may save me from this toxic path I continue on. Now here is where i am at in my current stage. I have started this brand new tech job. Its the most paying job I have yet and comes with a lot of responsibility (this is a dread I am battling with despite my previous job doing around the same thing) I currently am still in the hazing process as in a few weeks I will be set loose to survive. Granted its tough but I am confident enough that in time I will adapt and learn everything that needs to be done. The biggest problem for though however is that I feel I am begging to spiral back into that pit of reclusion I experience with a lot of my job history. The coworkers of mine are from what I have noticed, kind, reliable, productive and generally a successful bunch. As awkward as it may be I would say they came out great. On my first day I met them all and talked for a bit and everything seemed to be going great. Even my fellow cubical neighbor seemed to have a lot of similar interest as well in my hobbies. This is now week 3 and I am ether fabricating problems but it seems like everyone here is not really wanting to know me or develop a friendship. I try to start conversations but they usual just go flat after a two minute session and almost never will any of them approach me as I will always have to approach them. They are apart of a bowling team that never invites me even though I have shown interest in. My neighbor is huge into MTG and I was promised to come next time he and his mates play but that has not been a thing despite my repeatable attempts of talking about it. (not nagging but more of \"hey did you figure out when your next session is?\") I repeatedly try to have causal conversation about their lives and interest but it all ends quickly. \n\nI overcouse understand that sometimes people dont want to connect and such but it really does make working very difficult when you feel like your the only shadow in a room full of people and I have come to Reddit to possibly see if anyone can lend a hand in the fresh time of my job before it is too late. I do understand the old saying \"if you smell shit all day then you probably stepped in it\" so I am certain I am somehow the problem but I could not truly understand what I am doing thats so off putting. My friends, girlfriend and parents claim that I am not socially awkward or anything like so I am at this point out of ideas. If anyone and I mean anyone have anything at all that could ease this stressful time it would be greatly appreciated. I'm not asking for sympathy or pity, I just want some plan or revelation about myself that can save a good opportunity for me. I hope all of you have a splendid day and thank you again for reading this. ",

I just can't get this stuff out of my head. \n\nI wouldn't say I'm ugly or attractive, more like in between, although being ridiculously skinny and tall (6' 3\" and 156 lbs) really affects my self confidence.  None of my jackets/coats/sweatshirts fit me well and I feel like I look like a dork wearing anything (although I am planning on working on this whether it be going to the gym or buying more expensive but well-fitting clothes).\n\nwow i typed a lot\n\nplz help",

        "original": "Sorry for all the text but I really need advice or some perspective. \n\nI'm a early 20's male and five years into college. My first year I was a part-time student in engineering. In high-school I was super active in all the clubs and activities so I never really felt the need to cultivate relationships. When I got to university I was just happy to be left alone to my own devices. It was actually a pretty good year but after that I realized how unhappy I was that I didn't make any friends but I was still incredibly anti-social, filled with anxiety and fear at meeting new people. I eventually made one friend in second year and he has been my friend ever since. We hang out every so often and text regularly but I haven't really made any other close friends like that. Maybe one other guy that I regularly study with but no one else.\n\nFor the past year, I've really been trying to actively make friends with the other guys in my program. There's been a couple guys that I have met and hung around with last semester and people I sit with in class (and sit by me without any prompting) but nobody all that close. Once class ends we'll walk with each other and chat for a little while until they say something like, \"alright, see you later\", and then they walk away. \n\nHowever, I'm a little rattled at my latest efforts.  Yesterday, there was this guy that I've known since second year but we have only been in school together every so often due to work terms. We've been in lab groups together and worked on class projects together and we seem to get each others humor. I arrived at school a little earlier yesterday and was feeling really confident so I texted him and asked where he was, thinking it would be a good opportunity to make a new friend. I met up with him before class and we sat and talked for a while. It seemed like we had a good conversation. He left to the bathroom while I went and took my seat in class. He later came in and sat next to me with one chair apart. After class ended we chatted for a little while we walked down the hall, I had some time to kill before my next class and asked him what he was up to and whether he would want to meet up after I grabbed something to eat and he kind of blew me off saying that he would text me and then never did. \n\nFor the past few days I've been really flying high on confidence and to be honest this little thing that shouldn't have bothered me that much really put me into a tailspin. It's hard to explain how good I felt up to this point. It really felt like my life had unlimited potential because of how well I was doing connecting with people. This is the first time anyone has really ever blown me off like that. How should I approach this, and how do I get my confidence back? I've spent half the day just depressed as all get out and can't seem to shake it. \n\nIt seems like it's impossible to make close friends at university. A lot of the people I've gotten to know seem to already have their cliche. They're happy to talk with me in class or every so often in the halls but everyone seems to have their little group put together now and aren't looking for anyone new to join. I have one more year left to go and am incredibly sad that I missed out. I feel more like a freshman than a senior because I really only started to get to know people. I've had a few invites to study. There was one invite I got from a guy that seemed really cool and was part of the \"cool\" cliche but I had to decline because I didn't bring my laptop that day and I didn't leave an open invitation for him to ask me again so he never did. \n\nI'm not going to say it's unfair because in the end it's my fault but damn, it really sucks that I missed out on potentially some of the funnest times of my life and now the opportunity is closing forever. I really feel quite sad. The last couple days really made me feel like I might be able to salvage the little time I have left and make some memories with these people but I'm just so discouraged.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "original": "Growing up with my older sister, our mother has always had a terrible temper. She wasn\u2019t an angry woman but rather would have a terrible temper and would snap at the smallest things. Her mood would completely change and that small something that triggered her would cause her to take it out on me since my sister usually wasn\u2019t home and eventually moved out for college. As I got older (middle school years) I noticed I would feel short tempered at times as I would catch myself yelling at my friends or mom.  During high school I had a girl friend for 10 months and towards the last few months I noticed we were arguing a lot more. Although we were both at fault for most fights, I can\u2019t deny that my temper definitely affected our relationship which eventually led to her breaking up with me. I don\u2019t consider myself an angry person at all as I\u2019m actually a very polite and respectful guy who can be shy at times. Rather than anger it\u2019s my temper that\u2019s causing me to snap sometimes and talk to people in a non respectful manner. Fast forward now and although I\u2019ve been aware of it for a while I never noticed the impact it had on my relationships. (Note that my mother rarely ever snaps anymore and is a lot nicer than she used to be). There have been multiple instances where my mom has bursted into tears because she claims that I make her feel as if I hate her or that I just don\u2019t want to talk/associate with her due to the way I talk to her whenever I\u2019m acting irrational. She gets sad because she feels as if I wish I belonged to a wealthier family. I hate myself after this happens as I love my mom but I can never seem to apologize or try to fix it. I just stay silent. My single mother has always worked very hard her whole life to support us anyway she can and to this day works her ass off for a low pay and usually chooses to spend it on whatever I need or sometimes for things I don\u2019t even need but just want. Being able to eventually pay back my mother and treat her like a queen has always been my biggest motivation to being successful in everything I did and currently working towards. That being said I still act up a lot and sometimes treat her like shit (I speak to her very tempered in about half of our conversations). I don\u2019t know why but my temper is a lot worse around my mother or people who I am closest to which is why I\u2019m concerned. I have nothing but love and respect for my mother and all my friends but I never realize how angry I can get at times until after the fact. Also not sure if this is relevant but there are several holes in my room as I can get really angry at video or life certain situations. I hate that I treat the people I most care about the worst out of all at times. The only solution I\u2019ve found to get triggered less is just to ignore whatever\u2019s happening and literally not saying a word. I hate this solution and just want to be respectful at all times before I ruin any other relationships. Thanks for taking your time to read this and any advice is gladly welcomed. Thanks guys. ",

I am also pretty attractive physically, and I'm not so bad at social interactions.\nInitially, people are usually impressed with me, girls like me when its the first time they see me, guys see me as a really cool person, etc.  Then as the days pass its like my social value drops from top to bottom in any type of group ofuation i am. This has been true in every single group or social place i have joined my entire life.\nNo one ever texts me first, or invites me somewhere. It always has ti be me. \nI have literally tried everything. I read three books on social skills and even that one about the \"48 laws of power\". I tried being nice to everyone; being selectively nice. I tried the \"being real\" thing for more than a year without trying to alter my natural behavior. Didn't work either. I know I suffer from anxiety, so I started taking this drug called Phenibut. It worked wonders and my anxiety disappeared, but still no friends. I took adderall for a while too, and it only made things worse. I have moved school twice. \nI spent a year in boarding school, and initially everyone wanted to be my friend. I tried being real nice that time, and at first it really worked, buut eventually even my friends started treating me like i was an annoying  awkward frog-looking weirdo. \nThis year I switched schools again. At first it was there too. Everyone thought I was really nice, really cool and confident. I was invited to an exclusive gathering and even became part of a group of friends for a week. This time I tried to have a mean outlook but to be nice to my friends. A short time later two guys wanted to beat the shit otta me, one of them actually did it too, a month or so later. Soon my old \"best friends\" were looking for ways to avoid me. Phenibut helps but it doesn't solve the root problem and I can't take it more than 3 times a week. \nI have gone deep into self improvement. I work out, meditate, have honor roll grades and go to any social events I can, where I often talk to a bunch of people. Yet all the people I say are my \"friends\" don't consider me part of their inner groups and they usually treat me like I'm some annoying thing to run away from, even when I am being actually funny or just nice, or friendly, and always talkative, or quiet. No matter what I do, I can't seem to make people like me. I even stopped trying completely for a year.

The problem is that I am too shy and anxious about going out with them. I've known them since high school and that was the time when they asked me out to parties etc. but I alway said no because I was very anxious at the time (nowadays it's getting significatly better) but it's gotten to the point where they stopped asking me out because I've never said yes once in those 4 years. I feel kinda left out hearing all the things they've done in the weekend and what they're going to do together next weekend. I'd like to try going out with them but I don't know how to \"ask\" if I could come with them to try going to a party or do something else. I also have problems to initiate something. I recently got a 30 euros gift card to go bowling a month ago and yesterday my parents asked me what I was going to do with it and suggested I could go with a friend but I just don't know how to start going out because I've been staying home my whole life. Anyway if anyone has any tips or experience it will be very appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: At the end of the title should be a question mark, sorry",

        "original": "Backstory- My brother is one of the stupidest people . His emotional intelligence is zero. He's pretentious. He's passive with a huge ego. He earns well and believes that he could and should get a beautiful girl to marry him in an arranged marriage coz he earns that much. He would never speak our parents in a loud voice or to anyone outside for that matter. To him, it's fighting. Inside he's an innocent soul who just doesn't understand things. To be precised, he's a man child. He would listen to every useless advice our parents have to say to him but won't look me in the eye. He's oblivious of the fact it is creating negativity. He can tell others it's my b'day but would not wish me at all. I wanted to follow him on instagram which has no posts but I did't send him the request thinking he would not follow me back which will just make me feel bad. Yes, he  follows all our cousins which i hardly care about. \n\nWhy? Apparently he thinks I have troubled our family. Yeah, coz i had been in depression for 2 years and at moments, I would get frustrated in myself and be really unstable. My brother would say things to my mom-dad like \"Keep raising him for life\" or \"Keep tolerating him\" (I have not been working since i passed college which was one and a half ago. I'm 24 now). His words would stab me like a dagger. I told my mother about this. She told me that it's not going to happen again. But I wanted to have a meaningful relationship so i decided to talk to him. He's been himself in some pretty bad times that spanned for few months(Even though he keeps saying he's alright now, he doesn't look like) So, i pointed that out so that he knows how it feels. But he likes to blame me or himself for that matter whenever there are bad times. He would say that it was one time and it was not 'intentional'. I was losing it but i wanted to know he thinks. He said that according to his 'opinion' , i'm an aggressive person for voicing out to hurtful comments, sometimes made by my father.  I said it was  his interpretation of things and I'm done talking to him. All that matters to him is the tone. He fails to understand the magnitude of those words.  He would say things like \"What if he said so? How can you raise your voice\". It's like he's doped. \"Am I nothing to you?? Can you not understand this negative behaviour?\"\n\nCurrent situation- I hate my brother. It is taking away my energy and focus. I do not want to hate him or anyone. I came up with a plan to be myself around him/ treat him like a brother and let him think what he wants. Then everytime, i see him it reminds me how bad he thinks about me being my brother. I have made conversations to him in the past but they didn't work and I don't want to feel bad myself again. So, at last i told myself that i don't owe him anything and am not paying attention to him. But I'm not able to get this hatred outside of myself for him. I feel like punching him every time i see him. I want my brother to express to him and to listen to him. I want us to be looking in the eye. I don't want to fake it. He seems stressed all the time himself. He needs love himself but i want it to be reciprocated and don't want him to look at me like a criminal at the least. What can I do? (There are no financial burdens in the family. I'm looking for job right now. To add context to my experience, he won't be able to understand even if he reads  everything.

        "original": "Hi! I am a college engineering student who has trouble making friends with people of the opposite sex and I was looking for input and advice. (I hope nothing I say is mistaken for arrogance or tooting my own horn! Just giving context)\n\nI am a single, above average looking girl who puts effort into her appearance. I wear minimal makeup and dress sophisticatedly unlike people in my classes who just wear sweats and dirty tees. Personality-wise I am outgoing and friendly with everyone. I am charismatic, cheeky, and am told that I am a great conversationalist/listener. I guess all of these qualities make me a dick magnet. \n\nI am the kind of person who genuinely cares what people have to say and enjoy people\u2019s company. When I talk to people, I give them my undivided attention or exhibit open body language (ie: body facing the other person), but I subconsciously do these things out of respect. I understand that all of these behaviors can give people the impression that I\u2019m interested in them romantically. I\u2019ve tried being more cold or acting disinterested, but i feel more disconnected and lonely with these shallow interactions, and like I\u2019m being a bitch quite honestly. It may also be true that some of these guys just aren\u2019t used to having girls talk to them and show interest in them in any way. \n\nThe cycle is usually making conversation with a classmate and being acquaintances or friends, them asking to study together in a group or for a project (but due to conflicting schedules not everyone can always make it), and then them either sending weird texts, asking me out, or asking to hook up. Somewhere down the line (very early on usually) I can tell that they like me though. I usually abandon that relationship because I know where it\u2019s going, or I let them know we are going out as friends when they ask me out. And then they get pissed at me or act weird afterwards, thus creating yet another awkward relationship with a classmate in my small major. (Relationship as in general relation, not romantic). I feel so isolated. \n\nIt\u2019s disappointing to think you\u2019re making a friend, when the other person\u2019s agenda is to keep holding on until they get an opportunity to fuck you. I try to act cordial, but I feel so lonely like I have no real friends. I\u2019ve always had a problem keeping \u201cboundaries\u201d with people of the opposite sex because I am an open person. And it doesn\u2019t help that in engineering, the majority of the class is male. How do I set the tone from the beginning? Is it possible to be friends with someone who is attracted to you, or is that a one sided friendship?\n\nEDIT: I even made a friend last semester who is gay, but told me he is somewhat attracted to me and I make him question himself/want to experiment..... I think I\u2019m destined to be friendless ",

        "original": "I'm sorry in advance that this is long. \n\nI'm currently a junior. I've been a pretty shy kid for some time now, starting in middle school before I moved. Back then things weren't spectacular, but they were alright: I had friends I could confide in, good grades and I wasn't too afraid of putting myself out there--verbally or socially. I had hope for the future. \n\nThe only major issue I had at the time was that I started to believe that it wasn't enough to just be me. Suddenly there was a heiarchy and adolescene and \"serious\" dating and this feeling of hyperself-awareness that hadn't been there in elementary. I remember constantly thinking that if I kept presenting myself in the way I did, no one would like or want to be around me. So I did everything I could to change. I had to be popular, wether I liked it or not. The way I talked, the types of clothes I wore, the way I wore my hair, the people I let around me soon reflected this change I just had to undergo. When I think about it now, it was like wearing a full set of nice clothes that looked cool but didn't (and would never) fit right.\n\nThings only got worse from then on. I pushed away my childhood bestfriend by making fun of her to her face to fit in with the popular crowd. I made racist jokes about my own race to fit in. I allowed people to use me. When I finally found out that all the popular kids didn't actually like me and I was just a walking joke to them, I realized was completely alone with this version of myself that I created and now hated.\n\nMy family's always struggled financially, but 2013 was a particulary difficult year. Our house forclosed, so we ended up packing all we could and drove across the country to squat at my aunt's apartment for a while. My dad chose to stay behind. We tried to keep positive; it was a new oppurtunity to grow and find ourselves. I still thought that I needed to change.\n\nLiving at my aunt's was not easy. We all had to sleep 2-3 people on blowup airmattresses. I was made to sleep on one with my niece and nephew, who would often cough and urinate on the bed. I got ringworm on my face the first two weeks there (which certainly helped my popularity at school), and most of us were continously sick. It also didn't help that my uncle was an abusive man. He would verbally berate us, turn my mom and relatives against me and my siblings and mercissley beat his children with multiple things and threaten to do the same to us. This continued for 3 years until my immeadiate family finally moved out and found our own place. We left with heavy hearts and our sense of trust broken.\n\nI was lucky enough to have some friends during my final years of middle school, and I met a ton of really nice and  supportive people along the way. But the hatred I had for myself and the issues I had trusting in people really took a toll on the relationships I had with others. I kept on thinking that people didn't really want to be around me, but that they were too polite to say it to my face. Everyone I met would comment on how vile and awkward I was as soon as I left the room, according to my logic. This thought process of mine continued into high school, where I had started to really distance myself away from people. I became really withdrawn, and speaking about anything at all went from being an  easy task to a feat I had to carefully plan out. I made a lot of shitty decisions when trying to become this person I wasn't ever going to be, and now a lot of the people I used to laugh and hang out with don't even want to look me in the face anymore. \n\nIt took me 7 years to realize that I should just be myself. I'm still learning and still pretty lonely, and I barely talk to anyone nowadays. I'm just trying to take care of myself more, but I just feel like I really let myself and the others who used to confide in me down. I'm terrified of meeting new people. Especially with college around the corner, I'm afraid I'll make all the same old mistakes over again and I'll be stuck like I am now. Some days, it's really hard doing anything-- getting out of bed, or that chair, or getting up to turn off the light. I feel so tired. Believing people who are geniunly nice has been increasingly difficult. I can't shake the feeling that I stink and am just downright repulsive. I just feel like a freak man and I've lost a lot of the hope I've had in myself for the future and I have no idea to get it back.\n\nI just wish I believed in myself more.",

But the truth is, I use work as a distraction from my loneliness. I use it as an excuse as to why I don\u2019t have friends, so hopefully people won\u2019t notice there\u2019s something wrong with me. \n\nToday my mom mentioned that her and my dad have talked about me not having any friends, and that I should switch roommates to meet new people. I said ok, and played it cool. But I was trying not to cry. Because I\u2019ve always been this way and I don\u2019t think I can change. And I feel like no one understands it and everyone knows there\u2019s something wrong with me. \n\nMy boyfriend is very different from me. He is extroverted and has a lot of friends. When we\u2019re out with his friends, he often asks if I\u2019m ok, even when I\u2019m happy and having a good time, because he doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m shy and quiet.

I say it\u2019s to save money, which is partially true, but the real reason is that I have no one to bring to a wedding. If we have a wedding, his friends and family will see that I have only immediate family there. They\u2019ll all know there\u2019s something wrong with me. But how am I supposed to explain to my boyfriend that I don\u2019t want a wedding because I\u2019m embarrassed to not have bridesmaids or friends there. \n\nAnyway, I guess I just needed to vent and I hope someone out there understands.

        "original": "TL;DR: Have been pretty sick healthwise for the last few months and feel pretty isolated. Will not fully recover for about 4 months and am living with my parents who work/stay at home so I don\u2019t get much alone time. Don\u2019t have the energy to see friends in person/get out of the house more than once a week because of my condition. Most friends have moved away and I should be at that point in my life when I apply to jobs, move out, and start a career but I\u2019m in a limbo phase because of my health. Any recommendations on how to stay in touch with people/have a social life? Caveats: Most of my friends don\u2019t like texting so I\u2019d either have to call them or see them in person. I feel like I don\u2019t have the emotional energy for phone conversations half the time. I think I find people boring a lot and I guess I\u2019m also a little depressed. Any advice?\n\n\nHi everyone, so I\u2019ve spent the last several months pretty sick. There was a period of two months where I couldn\u2019t breathe after I ate because of an autoimmune reaction I was having and didn\u2019t know yet, so I would spent countless hours on my couch basically just existing and barely saw my friends. After I stopped eating gluten on a whim, I could breathe again, but felt pretty weak still because of my immune response and was still going to several doctors every week to figure out what was wrong. I also found out I was positive for lyme so I had to start antibiotics for a month, which make me very sensitive to light so I basically haven\u2019t really been able to leave my house for several weeks (except for once a week for an appointment or a few hours at night when the sun has gone down). Basically- until I get treated with immunotherapy (which will last for three months), I probably won\u2019t be able to have my energy back and feel like a normal person. Not to mention the treatments will probably not make me feel so great. \n\nI am waning in and out of depression because of the isolation and loneliness I am experiencing. I have to rely on my parents for everything at age 23. I don\u2019t even feel well enough to drive right now, and it\u2019s a terrible feeling to be so reliant on someone when all my friends have basically moved out and started their careers. That\u2019s all I want to do. So my question is, what measures can I take to be social whilst not being able to get out much? I feel like often, I am a person that only has one close friend at a time (I\u2019ve always been this way), but it has led to an unhealthy codependence on said friends. After realizing this, I have decided to try to expand my horizons and reach out to more people. But I feel like my biggest roadblock is myself. Every time I consider reaching out to a new person (even someone I am close with like my sister and just calling her), I feel so tired and wonder what we will talk about. I never feel like I have the energy to have friends. I also feel the weight of having to sound okay on the phone, otherwise that friend will not want to talk to me (because I used to burden people for hours with my worries and complain without realizing it and lost some friends in the past). \n\nTo add another factor to the mix, both my parents basically never leave the house either because my dad works from home and my mom retired and is always home too. I feel like I often don\u2019t get the alone time that I need and am completely sapped of my energy the moment I wake up. I\u2019m also not out to my parents so there\u2019s that and maybe my life with my parents would be a little happier if I could just be myself, but I\u2019m never able to be and I\u2019m also an introvert and they\u2019re both extroverts so they don\u2019t understand how hard it is to be around so much stimulation all the time. \n\nAfter graduating college, I hung out with my high school friend group a lot, but they\u2019ve kind of dissolved because some friends moved away recently. It had made me feel bad in the past that they don\u2019t want to hang out with me individually, but not anymore. I feel like I\u2019ve had quite a few close friends growing up (in junior high/high school/college) but now, it seems like so many of those relationships have changed or faded away and I constantly struggle to understand how to maintain multiple friendships with people. i.e. how to care about more than one person at a time. It takes so much energy for me (probably because all my energy is taken up by my parents on a daily basis), that often I just prefer to be alone but end up feeling lonely. I\u2019m also very averse to change. I tend to latch onto people I\u2019ve known for a while and idealize them as friends, even if I\u2019ve maybe outgrown the friendship and it\u2019s really hard for me to just let life take its natural course (the path of change). Not sure why I do this, but it\u2019s really annoying. \n\nFinally, I don\u2019t feel like a typical person. I can\u2019t bond with people over certain things. Like I am not competitive at all so basically any sport to me is boring and I don\u2019t find much interest in games like super smash brothers or board games (though I do enjoy games that require logic). I also don\u2019t care much for bars anymore. I used to, but I\u2019ve realized that I crave a deep connection with people and all of the shallow small talk that ensues with \u201cbar friends\u201d never turns into anything deeper. And just standing there waiting to be picked up by people/watched, or people watching me is one of the most boring things on the planet. I\u2019m also a complete nerd and find most people boring. I tend to research things like crazy, but when it comes to people, I feel bored when I talk to them a lot of the time. It really saddens me because I feel like a freak. Like so many people tell me how fun I am and how they want to be my friend, but I often don\u2019t feel the same. If anyone can provide an insight into this, I would really appreciate it, because I\u2019m at a loss. Thanks ",

They started talking, so I just left to go to my next class.\n\nI'm really confused. I'm assuming this girl is his GF, but why did she seem like she had beef with me? I only talk to this guy in class, I don't know him very well (like I said, just met him a few weeks ago), I don't think I did anything to make it seem like I was interested in him so there's no reason for her to react that way?

At the beginning, it was not that bad, we were talking to each other and had some deep conversations, I thought we were getting closer. But I started to feel as if they were leaving me out of everything. They would leave the house together without telling me to get food or dessert or to go shopping and whole bunch of activities they would ONLY DO WITH EACH OTHER. \n\nI understand that they are close and they want to spend time together, that is fine. But when it gets to the point where they always 3 matching slippers, make and eat dinner together specifically when I am not there, celebrate each other's birthdays in their room WHILE I AM IN THE HOUSE, I've had it with these people. I am a person with feelings and I can't help but feel like shit. I just can't believe how inconsiderate these people are. \n\nIf they were downright bad people, I would call them out no problem. But they are just so fucking fake nice. They are LOVED by everyone as we share many friend circles. I don't want to talk to them because I know they will just gang up on me and I'm afraid it will just make it worse. At least we are civil now. If I speak up, they will definitely hate me instead of ignoring me and they TALK SOO MUCH. \n\nI got up the confidence to talk to one of them and she literally said that they were \"sorry\" for leaving me out but they want to spend time together since it is our last year in college and that they KNEW that they were leaving me out on purpose and that I shouldn't feel bad about it, that it wasn't personal. WTF? Is it just me or are these girls heartless? They know how I feel yet no remorse whatsoever, no change in behavior. \n\nThey have talked to a mutual friend about our situation and mentioned that they didn't have very good feelings about me. I JUST WISH THEY WOULD LET ME KNOW. They are soo nice to my face. If I made a mistake, I feel like I have a right to know and get a chance to apologize or change my behavior! They just say NOTHING. They just want me to be invisible. I am sick of feeling this way for reasons I don't know. At this point, this constant feeling of being left out is getting to me and this in addition to my regular amount of stress for school, I am reaching seriously depressive moods. \n\nI am not very good at confrontation and I have been trying to just power through it for the past semester but I am really hitting rock-bottom in confidence and esteem. I want to move out but the semester already started and I don't have time or anyone to help me move out to a new place (my family lives in another state). \n\nThank you for reading, I am not really sure what I am looking for, any thoughts are appreciated.

I already began making great changes including going to the gym, pursuing a personal dream which is to make money coding (which I love to do), I go out with my friends whenever I feel like a normal human being and im seeing myself change for the better.But goood am I awkward still, I feel confident but as soon as I step out of my house I begin to get jittery, micro calculating everymove, overthink where im looking or if im being awkward or not.

I just want to be able to be myself without giving so many fucks and I believe I could achieve that by challenging myself.. But what can I do?I want to try cold approaching women, baby steps tho. Start by asking directions and stepping up from there until I feel confident to start a friendly conversation and maybe get a number?\n\nI also attend university, and I made some guy friends there but I am sooo limited by my anxiety, I avoid groups of people because it makes my head spin and I simply become mute, challenging myself in other situations will make me more confortable to engage with new people there...\n\nMy question is, what do you people do?

Honestly I feel embarrassed and hurt.\n\nWhat I understood: 1) she has no actual interest in me\nWhat I'm not sure about: 1) does she know I am/was interested .. how should I proceed from now, if I see her or cross paths (honestly I want to ask why she didn't respond, which is a shameful question to ask, so I wouldnt ask)\n2) should I intentionally ignore her when she sees me at workplace in the future? \n3) Am I making any sense??.. have I done something wrong? Is my thinking about this situation and what I'm inferring all wrong?\n\nI hate that I asked her number. I hate that I messaged her yesterday. This is affecting my work as I am visibly sad that this happened.\n\nTl;Dr : a girl I'm crushing on at the workplace is troubling my mind. I reduced my contact with her. When she restarted contact, i began pursuing with zero response right at the bud. I need help seeing through this clearly and advice, on how to approach when I see her around in future (inevitable).",

        "original": "Can't help it.\n\nNearly 30 years old. Abusive and dysfunctional family, rampant with drug abuse and alcoholism. Largely sheltered, and coddled (my parents would let me play with and encouraged me to play with stuffed animal well past kindergarten while most pre-pubescent boys my age weren't even playing with action figures anymore). Obscure interests (art and fiction). Overweight from overeating to cope with the loneliness and abuse (which my parents did nothing to stop), and never the most attractive boy.\n\nThe sheltering and coddling resulted in my not gaining nearly enough shared experiences with other kid, shared experiences which would have been crucial to being able to relate to other kids, things that I could have done with them and talked about after the fact, things I could have bonded with them over. I believe this was the root cause of my severely stunted social skills, as not gaining these shared experiences with my peers in my early grades prevented me from having opportunities to practice my social skills and develop them.\n\nBeing possibly autistic (never diagnosed as only affluent children in my generation ever got diagnosed) and more introverted only compounded things.\n\nAs a result I have had a near Chronic inability to make and maintain friends, almost always it would end very shortly after they realize how bad i was at conversing and how I couldn't relate to them.\n\nOnly very rare instances, the most notable to me being, ironically, a girl who I was close friends with for 3 years (she approached me) and who even more amazingly wanted to date me but her parents wouldn't allow it (I suspect it was due to my race because she was allowed to date boys of her race and I never gave them any reason to believe I would be a bad choice for her, I wasn't any sort of troublemaker). My parents, to give you all an example of their severe sheltering of me, had a strict curfew for me to not be out any later than 9pm when I was 12. She had to move away in the third year of our friendship and wanted me to meet her at 10ish when they were leaving for good, but my parents wouldn't let me go out to see her. I never saw her again despite promising to come out and say goodbye to her.\n\nAfter school I gradually lost contact with all of my friends.\n\nWas nearly murdered by the perpetrator of my abuse, and was forced to flee my home and briefly became homeless (virtually none of my relatives would help me during this time), before eventually managing to find refuge in another city where I've been for the past several years, leaving any and all social contacts.\n\nSo I have zero dating experience despite being almost 30. My hair is falling out (has been since the afformentioned traumatic event), although shaving it low masks the balding.\n\nI have gynocomestia as a result of being overweight for far too long, despite having lost all of my fat years ago and slimmed down to a healthy weight. I've gone to a physician and they deemed that surgery is all that can fix it, but I will be left scarred for life if I do and it's expensive.\n\nFacially I think I'm fine, wearing nice clothing and being clean shaven and my hair low cut I think I look good and have been told such, but knowing what I look underneath the nice attire makes me fearful to ever lay down with a girl, fearful of being rejected for my disfigured state.\n\nI've managed to get my shit together despite everything and get a good paying job and earned loads of money, but still.....\n\nI've spent the past year focusing on improving myself socially, going out with my coworkers and trying to develop my social skills and try to undo the damage that was done to me. But I've come to the realization that I can't change who I am.\n\nI've tried approaching girls on the street day and night, and that proved to be a waste of time as well. I've learned in this city, nobody wants to be approached by rando strangers unless for a very good reason.\n\nI can't try bars, because nobody even goes there to hook up nowadays, just 99% men and like 1-2 girls who are the subject of the attention of all the guys there, or they're there with their boyfriend anyway.\n\nCan't try clubs, paying an entry fee just for a miniscule chance with a girl in an environment not suited for anything but physical game (which I have no chance with) is an investment I can't justify. So no.\n\nCan't use my hobbies, because they're all solitary, or things I would only do with someone I'm already friends with just as something to do for fun with friends not for the hobby itself.\n\nCan't try school, I'm done with school and not going back.\n\nCan't try online dating, using Okcupid led me to the conclusion that I'm not compatible with any of the women in the online dating scene in my city (there would always be SOMETHING that would be a deal breaker, be it something about me: they wanted a guy with dating experience, a guy with a good family life or social circle, a guy with a car, a guy who loves to go out drinking and partying regularily, etc. Or something about them: they smoked (I won't date a smoker as I've lived with smokers long enough to realize just how much I'd hate to be with one long-term), or they just weren't attractive to me). On tinder you get near blank profiles that give you nothing to even WORK with to start a conversation, and there's too much competition on there. Add to the fact that I'm not photogenic unless I shell out hundreds of dollars for professional quality photos, which is a stupid usage of my money, so no.\n\nCan't try work, i work in the food service industry and rarely work with an even faintly attractive girl in the kitchen (and if they do they either smoke, all the girls generally work FOH, who I don't have time to interact with nearly enough to develop relations with, and at my job they're all taken anyway. Even if I get another job (in the same industry doing the same thing) it would be the exact same situation. I've tried going out with my coworkers, but all they ever want to do is drink or do drugs, which I've come to the conclusion isn't for me.\n\nCan't even use alchohol as a way to connect with people because what I've learned is that being so inexperienced in either at my age actually bothers regular drinkers, as they don't like to chill with \"lightweights\", I.e. someone who is inexperienced. And due to my lifelong lack of (positive anyway) experiences centered around alchohol, I can't relate to regular drinkers as I've found the majority of their conversations centre around their past experiences getting \"fucked up\" which I can't relate to. So it's too fucking late for me to even get into DRINKING to bond with people. And unfortunately, nobody I ever meet wants to do anything but go out drinking. It's literally all anyone does, the only way to really make friends.\n\nRealistically I've decided I'm just fucked. I've chosen to stop letting my desire for a partner matter so much to me, to learn to be content with myself and simply focus on my passions, but deep down I know that in doing so I will guarantee that I'll be alone for the rest of my life because of just what my passions are. Sitting in my room writing and painting isn't exactly a good way to meet people, let alone girls. Even if my passions turn out to be successful, even if I become a super famous, super successful author and illustrator, I'll be alone. And any girl who shows interest in my I wouldn't even trust to not simply want me for my success.\n\nYeah, I've heard the line \"you find love when you stop looking for it\", but I'm being realistic here. Look at the facts, every possible avenue to meet girls or even people and make friends is unfeasible, either due to circumstances, or unchangeable aspects of who I am. There's literally nothing I can do.\n\nIt's like I was just straight fucked on every conceivable level and I never stood even the faintest chance. I've spent innumerable time being so angry over this, the unfairness of it all. How I spent my life trying to fight against the hell I was being subject to, to fit in, to make friends, to find a partner, but it never worked. Like all the people in my life who should have been there for me, who should have been helping me grow into the person I could've been, who i SHOULD'VE been, instead seemed to be doing everything in their power to ensure I'd be fucked. It's like my family wanted me to be utterly dependant on them, to have no life, to keep getting more and more obese, to continue to suffer.\n\nAnd yet....somehow I managed to get away from them, to become independant, to become relatively successful for myself, all INSPITE of them and what they did to me. But I'm still alone.\n\nWhat realistically can I do at this point? Or am I really just a victim of unfortunate circumstances that have left me fucked beyond any help? Should I continue with my plan to just give up, just focusing on passions and not worrying about finding someone, or is that going to only ensure my continued solitude and I need to keep trying? I don't want anymore phony pats on the shoulder telling me everything will be alright, that there's someone out there for me, I want to hear the brutally honest truth, the truth someone could only come to once they've looked at and properly assessed my situation, at my life leading up to this point. If the conclusion after reading all of this is that I am utterly fucked then so be it, but I just want honesty at this point.",

Once at school I only saw a few \u201cfriends\u201d who said happy birthday to me. After my test had finished I walked around the school for a short time trying to find where everyone was. I soon gave up after about 5 minutes so I walked to the bus stop. I started to contemplate why my phone had no new messages and what I was going to be doing to celebrate my birthday. My bus finally came and out of the corner of my eye I saw all my \u201cfriends\u201d walking towards the bus. Once they got on the bus all I got was a mere smile and hello. I asked them where they were going and they all looked at each other. Then one of them hesitantly said that they were going to hangout. My heart sank. I sat there waiting for someone to invite me or ask if I\u2019d like to come along but I got no response. They got off the bus and not a single person looked back or even said goodbye. \n\nFor the past few months I\u2019ve noticed that I never get invited out to do stuff anymore.

It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not socially awkward, weird or anything like that. I\u2019m athletic, I have a nice house and nice things, I\u2019m kind, loving and down to earth. In the past when we have hung out I\u2019ve always been the light of the party and I always make everything fun for everyone. I no longer feel like anyone cares about me. Today only a few people said happy birthday to me in person and a couple on Snapchat. \n\nTonight I\u2019ll light a single candle and blow it out in celebration of my birthday. My heart hurts.

I relentlessly compare myself to other people and I always seem to come up short in significant areas that everybody else excels at.\n\nFor one, every other guy my age looks way more masculine than me. I still have a baby face with practically no facial hair, and people think I\u2019m 17 even though I\u2019m 23. I also have bad posture, a weird hairline, acne scars, and beer belly that I\u2019m really trying hard to lose but can\u2019t for some reason. Every other guy my age or even a few years younger than me has full facial hair, cool trendy haircut and/or hairstyle, chiseled jawline, toned body, perfect matching clothing and good fashion style, etc. It\u2019s no wonder that I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend, every other guy looks like a legit movie star compared to me. I feel like I\u2019m just the ugliest dude everywhere I go. Not to mention that other guys have deep, booming, prominent voices, and I still sound like I'm 15.\n\nIt also sucks when I see people who have really strong bonds with each other. I\u2019ve always felt completely incapable of making friends and striking any form of commonality with anyone else. And when I see people who look so happy to see each other, I feel reminded of my own shortcomings with people. I\u2019ve never been someone who brightened anyone\u2019s day when they saw me, or someone that people wanted to have around them. People always act like they don\u2019t want me around and like I\u2019m just bothering them with my presence, so I can't help but compare myself when I observe someone going ecstatic upon recognizing someone they know in the street.\n\nAt my apartment I\u2019m always hearing parties going on and people are always having fun, whereas I've never even been to a single college party. I've just never been asked to go to one in the 5 years that I've been in college, and its not like I'm going to barge in on someone else\u2019s party all by myself with a bunch of people I don't know. I have an old friend that I've known since I was 12 who goes to my college, and he\u2019s always going to parties and having the time of his life. We see each other once in a while, and even though he loves to tell me about all the crazy shit he\u2019s doing all the time, he's never invited me to a party or even asked if I was interested in going to one. I guess I just seem too boring for that.\n\nEven just watching people interact makes me feel like a total failure. At my work, my coworkers all seem to bond really well with each other, but with me they\u2019re noticeably more stern and cold. My coworkers all seem to joke around with each other and have fun, but whenever I try to make a joke and lighten the mood, I just hear crickets in the background. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m really doing wrong because I feel like I try to make conversation and try to get to know them better, but I\u2019m always ignored and treated as just a soulless subservient employee. People never say hi to me, but my coworkers are always greeted with extreme enthusiasm whenever they walk in. Even my boss relays my instructions through other coworkers instead of just engaging me directly, even when I\u2019m standing right next to him.\n\nI just feel like I\u2019m just constantly reminded of how much of a loser I am when I observe how other people are living their lives.

When we were talking I noticed her smiling a lot and giving off a flirty vibe (I hope this is an actual thing and not me just being clueless) and she offered to give me her number to quote \"use her book or whatever.\" I took it and all's good, we continued to have some light conversation and I walked out of class feeling like a fucking G. \n\nI have no fucking clue what happens now. I strongly consider myself an introvert and even more important, I've never been in this position before. I asked my friend and he said don't text her at all and the next time you see her in person, ask her for coffee. This sounds fine in my head cause I honestly suck at texting. But now I'm thinking, I saw her yesterday (Thursday afternoon, I'm posting this Friday night). This is a Tues/Thurs class so it would be 5 days till I see her again, isn't that a while? \n\nAnother issue is that when you google what to do in this situation, most sites assume you picked up the number at a bar one night and she doesn't have your #. I texted her my name cause she asked me to so she has my # too so it's not like I can kick it off by saying \"Hey its x it was nice to meet you last night) or w/e. \n\nI feel like this post is a direct manifestation of my thoughts which means I'm clearly overthinking it lol.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think I'm a decent looking dude but I've always lacked the confidence to speak to women. Literally I've never asked a girl out before, that's how new this is to me.\n\nTL;DR: Me and girl in class exchanged #'s. I've never been in this situation before. Don't know what to do now.

        "original": "First of all. I'm sorry for the super lengthy post. I really wanted to share this once for all. I wanted an outsider perspective and understand things I might have overlooked. \n\n27 M living in the US for the last 3 years. I grew up in a religious and conservative family in a small town. I also have stuttering which limits my true self sometimes. People who don't know me well will call me a quiet person. People close to me know that I'm not. I haven't had the level of exposure other people had in their 20's. By that I didn't do anything adventurous, traveling, etc. I think it's mainly because I find comfort in home and family and partly because I was timid. I always see my inner me as 4-5 years younger. It feels like I'm just catching up with my friends who were 'man enough' 3 to 4 years ago. \n\nMy undergrad in a relatively bigger city helped me understand there's a new world out there. Again I could see my classmates being a 'macho'(strong word but to my eyes they were) with all the experience you could possibly have at that age and I was just some timid kid trying to learn life like a 5 yo. I knew this was a prob in me and I remember I tried to do my own ' fake it till you make it'. I was better than some people but I still wasn't the mature or the masculine guy.  I did have some brief relationship/interactions with girls which some people didn't have, but it didn't go too intimate or physical. To this date I'm not even sure what to call it. Finding a job was a huge struggle and I wasn't remotely interested in anything except finding a way to do something with my life for the next year and a half. \n\nStuttering made the job hunt even harder. I was a nerve wreck in interviews and I wasn't super bright to ace the interviews with my technical skills. A company just found me and that was my first real job. That job though with a shit pay helped me in a lot of ways - with my stuttering, meeting new people and just talking to them. Then I applied to Master's degree and with little cash I didn't have all the fun that other guys had/didn't experience the college life in the US life well enough. Forget girls, dating... I made zero American friends or from another country for that matter. I only had Indian friends. I wasted my college life again and that too in the US. I regret this a lot and it hurts to the point I cry thinking how useless I've been. Again the job hunt was hard but I found on at a good company and it's going good so far. This is the point where I said to myself I've had it enough and want to put myself out there. So I download dating apps and the first 6 months nothing happened, but then I cracked the dating apps code. I went to close to 6 first dates I think? I'm going better than my friends who find it really hard. Now I'd say I'm attractive and I do take care of myself in everything, but it's only outside. My room and apartment can be a mess sometimes. I'm not sure if it's an extension of my personality. So I do some cleaning stuffs (rarely and only after a brief self motivation) but it wouldn't stay with me. Gym is the only thing that's been consistent and I'm not seeing results that I wish to see. I'm making small talks here and there, going on a dates but nothing seem to happen. I struggle making American friends/ or establish somewhat a meaningful relationship with someone. No one ever seen to like me or want to stay with me. It looks like I repel people away when I actually want the opposite. I literally die for it. \n\nI've been a better person every year or two but I'm still not satisfied with myself. Stuttering still bothers me but not as much as it used to. \nI still find myself like a 22 yo and sometimes like a kid when I'm talking to someone who's authoritative, loud, confident. I want to redo everything in life again. I'm also seeing a therapist, but I don't know if I'm doing the therapy session right. \n\nEveryday I want to feel loved and be intimate with someone. As I typed this sentence I get all teary eyed. I stare at couples holding hands and feel sad. I'm actually open to date anyone outside of my ethnicity, but is it wrong to have a thing for Caucasian women in general? I'm just attracted and I don't know how to explain it. It's not a white skin attraction. I had a brief thing for Latinas I still do but it kind of fizzled out. I'll still be happy dating literally anyone. \n\nPeople do find me attractive but I kind of blow it up in the first date. I don't know what it is about me that turns them off. \n\nI'm happy to answer any questions. I might have said something downright absurd in this post. Please correct me. If I didn't articulate the post well then that's another problem I'm dealing with. Once again I'm sorry for such a lengthy post. I'm stuck in an airport people watching and looking at couples with their heads on each other's shoulders thinking why I don't have one. \n",

If you do not wish to, just skip to the last 2 paragraphs.\n\nGrowing up, I was a normal kid. Well at least till puberty started for everyone except me. I had delayed puberty which really affected my social skills and confidence. I just waited for years for it to start but it never did. So i was a short kid with a baby face which obviously resulted in me being verbally bullied and at some times physically bullied. I think bullying is a harsh word to describe it because it is mainly my friends who I know well(some are just assholes) who do this. This worsened my ability to socialize and also talk to girls because they probably thought I was a loser with no hope in life. Fast forward through those tough years, I finally start puberty in grade 11 and get some hope back. To cope with my inability to be confident, I made myself the center of all jokes and actually managed to fend of verbal bullying thanks to me making fun of myself. This was a big mistake. I began more insecure and uncomfortable with myself that I refused to make eye contact with girls. I managed to find myself a slightly extroverted group to assimilate myself in and thats where my crush for this girl began. \n\nIf you guys are still reading, I began doing stupid stuff whilst in this group such as messaging dumb things about this girl some cringey and some really weird. These messages can really fuck any chances I had with this girl and so I never tried approaching her. I get ridiculed for this all the time and I even denied liking her although I still did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LAZY TO READ THE CONTEXT JUST READ THE BELOW\n\nI really wanna get to know this girl and talk to her but my inability to socialize with girls, getting verbally bullied(midget, short) as well as the dumb blackmail my friends have against me has created a huge barrier for me to make a move on her. I cant stop thinking about her and its been nearly 2 years since then.

Recently I\u2019ve lost some weight and given more attention to my looks, as I\u2019ve always been overweight and dressed like a slob and wondered why girls wouldn\u2019t even blink an eye at me, so attention from girls is wayyy out of the norm from me. So i was one of the last people to enter the room and grab a seat, and i chose a table towards the back that no one else was at (cause I\u2019m shy). So this workshop is going on and everyone\u2019s doing their thing, and then i look towards the front of the room and this girl sitting at one of the table has her head on her hand, looking directly at me with a smirk, and WINKS. I thought this only happened in movies. I was immediately thrown off and just smiled at her and in the confusion and heat of the moment i attempted a wink which resulted in me just blinking really hard. Fuck me. She was very cute if I\u2019m being honest, but my dumbass was too afraid to look her in the eyes the rest of the class. I couldn\u2019t figure out what to do if she started throwing looks at me. So the class ends and i was going to try and get her name and number or something, but i pussied out and grabbed my shit and walked out of the door. Once i got out thought, i said \u201cyou know what, fuck it, I\u2019m waiting here for her to come out\u201d. So i did for about 15 min, and she never came out... fuck me. And i had to get going because i had work. I can\u2019t even think of a way to find her or get her name or anything. Hopefully we\u2019ll see each other on campus, and at that point I\u2019m not backing down. Had to tell someone lol, so there you go.\n\nEdit: Wow. This post got a lot more attention than i was expecting. Thank you for all the encouragement and kind words! I\u2019ll let you guys know if anything new happens.\n\n\n\n;   )",

I\u2019ve just barely been buzzed.\n\nIt\u2019s sorta weird to admit, but that means if I meet someone my age or have a friend thats done coke or talks about getting drunk a lot, yea, I think it\u2019s stupid, but a part of me feels a bit of reverse psychology, I feel inadequate, virginal, and inexperienced, and I hate feeling inexperienced...especially compared to people who I know are sorta dumb and naive. But I think that\u2019s the usual dichotomy in situations like this. \n\nBut that\u2019s also because I don\u2019t have a lot of friends, in the winter particularly I literally never go out, and I\u2019ve never been to a full on party in my life (All my good friends are always away at college, and I was stuck with community college because my grades tanked throughout much of HS due to depression over my mom\u2019s passing). I don\u2019t feel I really need to, because I don\u2019t like humans enough to constantly crowd myself with \u2018em, but I\u2019m friends with some frat guys who\u2019ve asked me to before, and they\u2019re always posting picture after picture to social media of themselves with like, 10 people around them all the time, gettin drunk. And my Instagram is barely used. I just never think people would actually find me that interesting, and I guess it\u2019s maybe because my life isn\u2019t as full, or fun? \n\nI can sip whisky. I like wine very occasionally with meals. Vodka with any type of mixer is okay...very occasionally. But I cannot imagine drinking so much alcohol with the goal of getting drunk. And it\u2019s gotten to the point that I just sort of get angry and sad at the amount of people my age who do. It\u2019s just another example of humanity\u2019s sort of disturbing tendency to find some (in my mind) masochistic pleasure in damaging something. The self, in this case. \n\nBut I drink a Moscow Mule and I can really only have one. It\u2019s fine, but I don\u2019t like the taste enough to keep drinking, and because I\u2019m so skinny, I feel every bit of alcohol. What\u2019s also weird is that I get quiet when I drink alcohol. If anything, I feel more insecure and observant, at least on my first drink. \n\nI just don\u2019t know how to feel about this. I look down on people who think getting drunk is fun, and I don\u2019t really understand the cultural obsession for being drunk in the middle of massive crowds of people. It just sounds so unappealing to me. Anyone else? Seriously, the more I see people obsess in some way over alcohol, especially as it relates to getting me to drink it, the more I wanna say \u201cfuck you and your stupid drunk ass\u201d and abstain from it completely.

I was a snob and I liked to hate on things other people liked and made a lot of enemies, which I took a sick pride in. The more people that hated me, the more I looked down on them. I realize now I really really really hated myself and when you add that to the fact that school was all I have ever been good at, I see why I was that way (but I still cringe and get really sad when I think about who I was back then). I was also one of those girls who swore she \"couldn't get along with other girls\" but really I was just jealous of everyone. I somehow made a small group of friends who saw through that person and still love me today, and since then I have reconciled with some of those I alienated.\n\nIn college I tried to be a better person and I did an okay job for a few semesters, but I was a music major and the environment really brought out my ugly, competitive side. I got a little better by my very last year but in the earlier years I said some horrible things to people, both to their face and behind their back. I was a bitch, honestly. I blamed it on people being jealous that I was the best in my studio, but really I was doing the same things I did in high-school, just in a different way.\n\nI have since taken some time off and have really been working on myself. I'm in therapy, and I know I should bring this up to her but I'm embarrassed and we have a lot of other things to work through that are weighing on me (I was groomed and sexually abused, and I really need to work through that with her, so this has taken a backseat). I'm trying to exercise and drink less alcohol, and work on my relationships with friends and family. One of the girls in high-school who I would have considered my arch enemy is now one of my BEST friends, funny enough. I am also the Maid of Honor in another friend's wedding and I'm trying to be the best damn MOH I can be. Solidifying my female friendships has been a huge priority for me, and it's been wonderful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSO! All that being said, I am starting law school in the fall. It's a small school and it's going to be three years of seeing the same people every single day. I really really really don't want to fuck this up, especially since law school is going to be even more competitive than music school and the stakes are so much higher. I want this to be my chance to be the person I really want to be, but I need help. Any recommendations for reading material, viewing material, listening material would be amazing and I would be really really grateful. \n\nThanks, Reddit. I appreciate it.

I've gone through many scenarios were I thought a girl in class was cute and just never did anything about it. But I've really been trying to improve for the last few months, so this was a milestone I wanted to share.\n\nI met a girl in one of my clubs at college last semester. She's rather quiet, so even though I'm a work in progress, I've been doing my best to be proactive. I introduced myself before a meeting once, and then had a short conversation with her at an end-of-semester event, at which point I figured out we were going to have a class together.\n\nSo last week was the first week of classes and I completely failed at talking to her in class. But I did run into her on the way back to my car one day and had a quick little \"How was your break?\" chat in the parking lot. That actually ended up helping me get the confidence to sit right next to her today and it went pretty well! I slipped up on some words but it didn't feel too awkward, and I think she was just glad to have someone to talk to. We also had a club meeting after class and I sat next to her, we walked out of the room chatting with each other and it felt very \"normal\" for once. Then of course I slipped up and said \"See you on Tuesday\" as we parted ways (meant to say Thursday lol), but whatever.\n\nFrom this point I am just going to take it class by class and try not to expect too much. For all I know she may have an SO or may not like my face (it's not a pretty sight, but I'm making the best of it). Regardless, it will definitely be nice to have someone to sit next to in class, and I am just really happy that I was able to prove something to myself - now I can think back on this if I ever have doubts about my capabilities",

        "original": "Hi all! Sorry if this ends up being long.\n\nI'm a female student from the USA studying abroad in London for the semester. I haven't had much luck with connecting with people in university thus far as I never found \"my group\" freshman year, so I've just had some friends from classes. What friends I've had, have ended up transferring schools. So I thought going abroad would be a good opportunity to meet some people and have fun.\n\nSo far, it's been the most nightmarish experience I've ever had. I live with many other people in my apartment, and I share a room with one girl. At first, things went okay, and I got along with people just fine. Unfortunately, however, I go to a very loud and party loving university, and these people really fall into that extroverted stereotype. I like going out and having fun, but I typically don't do it very often. As such, I couldn't really relate to anything the group talked about most of the time (drugs, frat parties, hook-ups, all things I just don't do out of personal preference). \n\nI'm not a shy person naturally. I try to interject when I can. However, I can feel myself being left out from the conversation, so I get scared and naturally become very quiet. Anxiety doesn't help with this. So to combat the problem, one night on our trip to Amsterdam I could feel myself being rejected so I started drinking to loosen myself up. A lot.\n\nWe went to Burger King and I ended up vomiting up my food. \n\nEver since, no one has known how to approach me. I'm conveniently not invited to things. If I say something, I'm ignored. I finally decided to confide in my roommate about the situation (who has done things with me one on one without seemingly an issue), particularly when it comes to the other two girls (the rest in my group are male). She essentially said that they might not know how to act around me since I'm so quiet and don't participate in conversation. Her words, \"they might be ghosting you, in a way\". \n\nExcept, I do. I say things. And I get ignored.\n\nSo I've taken to not saying anything because I'm so scared. I always get a mumbled reply or an awkward silence. I've never had this issue before, I can typically get along with people just fine. And I'm not friendless; I have three best friends that I've had for years that mean the world to me. \n\nWhy is this happening? I don't really understand what I'm doing wrong. Am I just being viewed as an emotionally fragile hot mess? If so, how do I .. not be viewed like that. I don't really know how to put myself out there and be a part of the group if I'm not getting anything in return.

I also try not to label myself or put myself on a higher platform because of my Service as already most people can't relate to you which I understand.\n\nWhen I was younger I used to have a good number of friends I used to hang out with and regularly contacted, but now (and I'm sure many can attest) of getting older, we all have gone our separate ways and haven't kept in touch.\n\nMy issue is that I've always been a shy, reserved person and I will admit kind of socially awkward but not because I mean to. I try my best to get out of my shell and initiate conversations and keep the conversations going which helps a lot rather than things cutting off short too soon. I used to joke to a superior of mine at work that I struggled in social conversations and he didn't believe me because we got along well.\n\nI'm also a Capricorn and am a slave to my self-critical habits and fear of being judged by others. I'm just naturally reserved unless I know a person well enough and we share similar interests. I haven't really had a close knit of friends in a long time. I tried making an effort when I was in the Service to form group get-togethers, but kept getting disappointed because of people not showing up or bringing their drama. I also have a pet peeve when in conversation I find that other people constantly talk about themselves and not ask me about how my life is doing, etc. I know this is a natural human behavior, but I feel no mutual connection when people do this.\n\nNow that I'm in college, I met these guys who are cool to talk to and hang out with (have done so once before outside of school) at a bar. But I can't seem to relate to these guys so naturally I dissociate myself from them. I despise going to clubs and bars because I feel the typical idea most men would have is to hook up with women or what have you (which is not a priority of mine). In these social anxiety moments, I feel claustrophobic and uneasy and want to remove myself from that situation. Today, during class break, the guys would talk amongst themselves and I would be left out. One of them tried to pull me into the conversation, but again, I don't know how to keep the conversation going naturally without being contrived.\n\nTL/DR; how does one cope with social anxiety? how does one integrate themselves with others naturally, especially among a group I already broke the ice with but not quite? essentially, i'm struggling with finding myself belonging anywhere in any social setting which has always been a challenge for me in my life which causes a lot of stress and depression.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and providing advice and feedback.",

        "original": "TL;DR: I find that I'm the happiest when I'm helping other people. But I'm an autistic introvert. I rarely get the opportunity, and, when I do, I shy away from it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, so first off, I am autistic. There is this idea that's been circulating for a long time that some people consider disabled people to be parasites. I disagree with this. There is strength in diversity, and a disability can lead to a perspective or ability that is beneficial if viewed from the correct angle and given proper leverage. So I have made it my goal in life to not be a parasite, and to leave every person/place/thing I interact with before off for having interacted with me. That is literally my personal motto. Google used to say \"Don't be evil,\" I say \"Don't be a parasite.\" I suppose that's how I ended up as an environmental engineer working for state government.\n\nI'm also religious, and when I was younger I had a dream that I died and went to heaven. We were in a coliseum, and God was calling us down one by one to review the gifts we had been blessed with and how we had used them. God then gave them their \"treasurer in heaven.\" Now I didn't receive much treasure, but that wasn't what got to me. People had gotten crowns for various things and were laying them at the feet of Jesus, but I couldn't as I hadn't earned a crown. God was also telling people \"well done, my good and faithful servant\" when handing them their treasure, but it hadn't been said to me. I devoted myself to living such a life so that I would hear those words from God when I die.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I've always been a softy for charitable giving. When I first went to college, I found myself unable to say no to the people raising money in the plaza, such that I was having trouble with my finances and my parents had to forbid me from giving away money that I was supposed to spend on school and living expenses. These days I have a strict budget, and while it's really hard to limit my giving to the budget, I manage to do so. The question then becomes how to help people in ways other than money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne time in college I was at a religious retreat. A girl (who I had a crush on at the time) was complaining that she wasn't feeling well and had slept through breakfast and was hungry. Now I had this big bag a fritos that I was saving for the car ride home, so I handed her the bag. Pretty soon the bag had been passed among the entire group and everyone was eating my fritos and I had none left for the ride home. But seeing her happy, and seeing everyone else in the group happy, made it totally worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother time, in grad school, I was able to volunteer at a weekend retreat for undergrads. I was basically just busing tables, nothing special. Because I had to show up for meal prep and be there for cleanup, I basically wasn't able to participate in the retreat itself. But instead of just doing my own thing, I sat in as I was able. I wasn't able to follow the message of the retreat, but I could tell that people got a lot out of it. At the end of the retreat I got to see the alter call, and a few people were converted, and the majority of the audience committed to improving themselves through whatever the message had been. I had played a part in that. At the same time a got a little thank you from the director with a couple of pieces of candy and a thank you letter. That letter contained the words \"May you hear the words of God; 'Well done my good and faithful servant.'\" The way I felt in that moment was indescribable. I had never felt like that before, and I have never felt like that since. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here then is the problem. I am an autistic introvert. I want to help people, I want to feel the way I felt when I gave away the fritos or helped at the retreat, but I can't figure out how. I see people post on other subs about how they're going through difficult times, and I want to say something helpful, but I can't some up with the words. I want to help my friends when the go through tough times, but I don't have any friends. A guy I know recently went to jail for lewd conduct with a minor, and his fiance dumped him for it. I wanted to be there for the fiance, but I wasn't, as I didn't know her and couldn't figure out what the right thing to do was. I want to volunteer at a wildlife sanctuary or a food kitchen or something, but I have a full time job and I don't know if I can make the time commitment. And I don't know if I can handle all the people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, there then is the catch-22. I want to help people, but I don't like meeting new people. ",

I\u2019m opinionated, smart, very blunt. I\u2019m also a college dropout because I couldn\u2019t afford it anymore after a couple years of chemical engineering. I\u2019ve never had help getting where I am save for my parents just after I had returned home and stayed a year. \n\nFriend wise, never had a best friend and nothing more than acquaintances that run their course and eventually disappear. Recent relationship wise, the last three ended. Two I had caught cheating, and the most recent just enjoyed talking to her many guy friends that I shouldn\u2019t be worried about and ended saying we\u2019d be better as friends and I shouldn\u2019t be dating anyone. As you can guess this surely did a number on me as I\u2019m now in a loop of overthought and doubt. I\u2019ve always treated women with respect, always consented for sex because I\u2019d rather not deal with a woman\u2019s day after regret where sometimes and in today\u2019s culture regret means rape. I\u2019ve spoiled and bought things and helped when needed. But it\u2019s never enough. I\u2019m on the verge of rather paying for companionship because at least it\u2019s goods and services, I can be picky about the girl, and don\u2019t have to worry about respect or being double crossed since it\u2019s like a utility bill. \n\nIn the times between those relationships I\u2019ve also considered suicide because why not? After college it was made apparent that if you cannot pay your way to better yourself, hard work is not rewarded as much as taken advantage of. Aside from work, I never had more than temporary friends, always here and gone. I have few people I have kept in touch with from childhood but don\u2019t see them almost ever. Not unless they want bud or some kind of investment in a business venture. So we have always alone, never depend on anyone for companionship, and I\u2019ve practically given up on dating. It never works and loyalty does not exist. \n\nSo where does this put me? Rather staying at home, saving my money, becoming greedy, and not wanting to even see a bar because I think it\u2019s a financial waste but everyone so Kong\u2019s to be out and distracted that it seems they\u2019d rather ignore the problems. \n\nMay be a short synopsis of my POV of myself and background of some past.

I have noticed that in almost every social situation I am subtly put down by other people. A recent example was when me and my lab partner were explaining to another student a concept during a lab. When we were done explaining what we did, the guy we were helping said \"Thanks guys\" and then proceeded to fist bump my partner but ignored me. This seems to happen almost daily now. Another example would be when I explain something to someone, I almost never get credit for it or people seem to doubt what I say even when I know its correct. It's almost like there as an inherent bias against me because of something I can't control. I don't consider myself socially clueless. I can tell when other people are uncomfortable and I go to great lengths to avoid making people uncomfortable. I have been told that I am \"emotionless\" which I don't get because most people I meet are don't make exaggerated facial expressions during conversation unless they are talking to people they know well. I admit that I don't take much initiative talking to people I don't know well, but I do this because I don't want to make other people uncomfortable with my presence, especially women who I mostly avoid. I do feel that there is an inherent bias that people can sense that my \"vibe\" is off or something. I didn't socialize much as a kid because for reasons I don't know, I was extremely sensitive and shy and didn't want to embarrass myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can someone be motivated to be social when you experience constant negative feedback?

I am as awkward as i was when i was obese and had horrible acne. I am really quiet and shut down, and can feel myself being awkward. I do have social anxiety but it has lessened since I began college but I am still bad at talking when sober. When im drunk enough, I am really social and flirtatious and look people in the eye and talk a lot with people. I feel as if because I am so quiet sober that people who i might talk to when im out or drinking are less likely to try and talk with me because I really dont say much. I struggle to look into people's eyes and whenever I walk I keep my head down and look at the ground. I want to be more confident and more sociable not just when I am drinking.

These are my actual opinions and feelings, feel free to criticize.\n\nI am a 17 year old heterosexual male. I have come to the conclusion that Relationships bring nothing but misery and frustration.\n\nBefore I go further I would like to say that I have not experienced \"love\", sex and thus never been in a relationship. I almost put a 'yet' at the end there but the truth is, I will try my hardest not to experience it.\n\nRelationships are like drugs, the similarities between drug abusers and people in \"love'\" are almost comical. They do it because they feel REALLY good, it helps them escape hardships, they never want the feeling to end. After a while though the high fades, and all that is left is misery.\nIt is instinctual to crave another human being, that doesn't make it any better though. We are burdened with these desires, its embedded in my  brain just like depression and I'm gonna have to deal with it til the end.\n\nAll the people I know in relationships tell me the same story, its a mistake, there are too many downsides to it to be worth it. With time they begin to grow tired of each other, to resent their partners. People like myself that are caught in the cross-fire get a first-hand experience of the true nature of a relationship. \n\nPeople will shrug this off as a little boy not knowing what he's talking about, I ask you to try and change my mind.\n\nI tried to write down what I wrote the first time but its not as well written.

        "original": "Honestly, this is my first post and the weirdest one I've ever made so far on an app. Basically, I (M - 15) had a crush (F - 15) since the first semester that I got into highschool. She was an okay person at first, decent-looking. She was shy at first (which to me was pretty darn cute) but as time goes, she and I started talking with eachother a little bit more and more through text messages. And that was how I got onto liking her personalities. I found out that she was an energetic and bubbly girl, she is too a very kind and charming girl who is very fond of having fun atleast those were my opinions of her back then, we've got on to some dates with a group of our friends which makes me know more about her characteristics, sooner or later, my feelings started to bloom more than I had expected.\n\nBut then, as the semester passes, we started not talking to eachother despite all of the opportunities we've got. I don't know why but I think it was actually due to my anxieties (you know, the feeling you get when you are near your crush) which probably was just a huge bother to me at that point. But that alone might have just cost me all of my chances to even get near her. I was upset at first because how much of a coward I was to make a move and how much of a waste it was because I could have actually had a girlfriend if it wasn't for my inability to overcome my fears. She later started to be colder towards me which hurt my feelings a lot more.\n\nLater on I was stuck on a loop. First being too overly-attached to those upset feelings that I mentioned. Then tried my best to remind myself that it wasn't worth being like that, whatever I do then won't matter since chances will never happen again. Until IT DID HAPPENED AGAIN, which brought me back to the start. Eventually, I saw myself trapped inside a prison of my own mind. Constantly telling myself negative things because I was too much of a p*ssy towards it.\n\nBut alas, I found an escape. Couple of weeks ago until now, I had some super supportive friends to always keep me from getting too close into those feelings. They actually helped me a lot. From discussing what and how I should avoid those kinds of emotions to actually telling me some really good advice about relationships.\n\nUntil recently, I overheard from one of the conversations that my crush had with some of my friends, that she js also having someone (M - 15) crushing her. He is bolder, braver and even confessed to her in one of the school's concerts. Which was to that event, I later found my crush might also is feeling the same thing with him.\n\nThe news hurt me at first, which almost lead me back to the start again. But I remembered what I have gone through and actually fought back. It was the moment when I actually felt like I've grown (not to be cheesy). That moment I just thought to myself :\"You had your fair share on that cold and lonely bench in that night of the concert, do you wish to be better or worse?\". Honestly, my inner self was just amazing at that point for keep pushing me forward and drag me out of that mess.\n\nAnd until the recent news of her confirmation of their relationship. I must be honest. I was gasping with shock and was actually so darn happy that I laughed out loud like hell. I don't know what was wrong with me. Maybe because of the fact that I am free of that same old prison? Maybe because I have grown out of it? Or maybe because I was genuinely happy for the couple? Because I'm stronger than who I was before? Or all of it? I don't know. But I am sure these positive feelings, for once, was a big breakthrough and certainly was the best ending I could ever wished to have. I'm still even giggling to it now lol. \n\nAnd to any of you out there who is going through the stuffs that I did. I just wanna say\nBE A MAN (OR A BRAVE WOMAN) TO GO OUT THERE AND CONFESS YOUR FEELINGS TO YOUR CRUSH. Don't be stupid like I was, I promise, it is just only a moment of bravery but it is THE moment that will determine your happiness for the near future. Be reminded that your crush is just another human, not a god, not a saint, he/she is just like you, so speak to him/her normally like you are speaking with yourself. Love is wonderful and you shouldn't be afraid of the wonderful things in life. And to all of you out there who got turned down by your crush, just remember that you are not alone, remember that there are technically billions of fishes out there in the sea. With luck and patience, you will eventually find someone who you will settle for, who will stick with you for a very long term or forever even. So just be out there and have a little faith, your destiny will come soon enough eventually and it will be the best moment you wish to cherish forever.\n\n(Honestly don't be like me, you'll feel like you just got cucked deeply)\n\nTL;DR : \nMy crush got a new boyfriend recently.\nI was pretty bummed out because of it.\nBut I think whoever got to date my crush was probably more happy to have her than I am sad to lose her. (The total happiness in the world increased)\nSo, whatever.\n\n\n\nEdit : I hope this inspired you guys to get out there. As for myself, I don't think I'm ready for that kind of rollercoaster ride ever again for another 2 or 3 months or so haha. Hope you guys find my story interesting and have a nice life, guys. \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\n\nEdit edit: Thought I might share this on here too. (If you ever seen that first post of mine)",

She was my friend's crush. I did nothing. Fast forward 1 year, she have a boyfriend. Fast forward another 1 year, I left school due to financial problems and most of my friends never chatted me, even the ones that did before. I only had single digit friends. SO I tried to make more friends again. While scrolling through Facebook (FOR REASONS I can't state here), I saw this girl's profile. I decided to just give her a message \"you look cute\". I gained courage from one of these posts about giving complements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was like \"wait whaa..\"\n\nAnd I was kinda nervous but I kept calm and just said \"just a complement\", started out as a weirdo, not good. :/\n\nMind you, I just got over my long time 4 year crush and was not looking for a new one but I had a minor (0.1%) crush on this girl. BUT I just wanted to be friends. She told me that it wasn't her real account and she added me from her main account and we continued to chat there. We just asked some questions (mostly me since I am still an idiot at talking), turns out both of us do graphics designs, programming and more. She did quite a lot of things and I was very impressed. It wasn't common for people our age to be doing this in MYANMAR. We exchanged tips and I gave a lot of complement.\n\nNight came and we said byes and she said \"see you tomorrow\". she have school since it's monday so i gotta say hi before 7:45 if i want to catch a reply.

        "original": "Hello,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've read a few posts on here, but thought I'd write out my situation, so that I might be able to get some advice and, also, possibly get it out of my head for a bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a 24 year old female who basically self-isolated from 18 up until a few months ago, when I got a job that is very people centered.  Dropped out of school twice due to my inability to not get extremely nervous around people.  When I was in school, I did the bare minimum in terms of socializing.  Rushed from class to class, rarely left my dorm room, never went to social functions. In the last year or so, I've realized that avoiding these situations has made doing small things, like going into the grocery store or getting gas, extremely difficult and life is now so much harder than it needs to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been at this job for a few months and it still terrifies me. By the end of the day my nerves are shot. I get so nervous that I sometimes can't even get a sentence out, I respond to people way too quickly and basically miss half of what they say, have trouble holding eye contact (even though I'm really trying), lose all common sense, become irrational (like walking a super long way to avoid a counter where there are two people chatting), put off doing things I really need to do because I don't want to walk up to an area where a lot of people are gathered.  I just hate/dread the nervousness, but I know that avoiding these situations makes these feelings worse, and, at this point, I would really just like to nip this in the butt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've tried CBT, meditation, done a ton of googling and \"research\" on social anxiety, anxiety after isolation, etc.  I've worked on self-esteem, self-confidence, I exercise everyday, eat \"healthy\" for the most part.  Meditation helped a little bit. I think CBT has been the most helpful (or at least my internet guided version of CBT). I usually just write out why I'm nervous which I think has a lot to do with this innate desire for human connection that I basically refused to give myself for 5 years and now Im afraid I'll never get it/or that they'll reject me. I, also, think I get nervous because I feel like I look nervous, and I don't want people to know I'm nervous/think of me as some social recluse/outcast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, I've thought about all of this a lot. It has basically run my life since maybe the middle of high school. Anything else I should be trying to speed up this process a little bit? Is it just going to take more time/practice? Or is this likely a permanent issue that I'm going to have to learn to live with?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help/advice/just letting me write this out!\n\n&#x200B;",

I used to suffer from horrible social anxiety, to the point that as a kid my parents let me drop out of school in 6th grade to homeschool because I could not function around all the new kids in middle school. Then, I had trouble holding down any real job for years until my mid twenties because of anxiety. The worst was at night, when I would get anxious about the next day and interrupt my sleep, which exacerabated everything and made me tired in the morning. Horrible cycle. My anxiety drove me into drug use at around age 16, which became a hard drug addiction around 19 and lasted until I was 27. Benzos were my favorite, but unfortunately you cannot learn on benzos and so no methods for handling my anxiety were ever found for many years besides drugs... Until I read a book by Eckhart Tolle. The power of now. It's spiritual in nature (not religious) so it may not be for everyone, but the basic thing the man writes about is Mindfulness.\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with mindfulness I'll break it down super simply: It's just watching your thoughts. What I came to learn is that by watching your thoughts more and more, you start to realize that they aren't \"you\". Once you practice for a while you get to the point where you can see anxiety coming and stop it before it gets super bad and your in a loop of anxious thoughts. It's not easy though! But it WORKS! I am now several years clean, and doing the best I ever have in life. Mostly because I can now manage my anxiety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let me be clear: I haven't gotten rid of my anxiety. I have just learned to manage it to a point that it doesn't interfere with my life now. Sure it can be annoying at times, but it doesn't build to unmanageable levels any more. So basically, I wanted to share my awesome success with mindfulness, and suggest the book The Power of Now, or any other ekchart tolle book (if you can handle the slightly \"spiritual\" nature of it)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are lots of tips and tricks for being mindful and putting practice into everyday life... I'm sure many of you already do this, but I wanted to put it out there to reach those who haven't found this practice yet. It is guaranteed to help if you put the work into it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositive vibes, and love..",

It's my first time driving myself 5 hours out, and I have to be there for a military meetup for an officer program I want to do. Figured I'd plan a trip around it to convince my parents.\n\n1st day would be driving, 2nd day would be me going to a military meetup in the morning, and then thereafter just spending the time in the city, go to a concert, and 3rd day would be driving back.\n\nWe rented a room, and were gonna buy the tickets until one of them (we'll call her A, 21 yrs old) gets a call from their specialist about a mandatory appointment that weekend. They are closer and their families know each other more, so when A fell out, the other (Z, 20 yrs old) was still excited to go but after their parents found out that the other was not going, Z's family pretty much pulled out too since I'm a guy.\n\nI'm trying to really read whether Z wants to go as well. I asked if there was anything I could do, and they said talk to their parent. So it SEEMS like they still want to go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo at this point I have two options when I call:\n\n1. Try and convince the parent for next weekend,  the birthday of Z, and ask the parent about making it a birthday surprise for Z. This was A's idea, but A also said she can't guarantee she won't have a follow up appointment that weekend and means I have to convince my parents. This also leaves me alone on my first road trip, which I'm okay with but I get a little anxious on doing things on my own for the first time. I can live through that though, but I'm not sure how my parents will take it.\n2. Try and convince the parent to go through with the original plan, and have just us 2 go together. I don't know how to do that and make them comfortable with it, though.\n\nThere's a lot of moving parts and any advice on how to socially approach this situation when calling her parent is a bit difficult. Which would be more effective? How could I be more effective in leveraging a conversation towards letting her go?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I really don't have any romantic interest in Z or A, but legitimately just want a friend to be there with me through it all.",

I stutter/stumble on my words sometimes. I'm not that good at talking to girls. My group of friends has dwindled down, though I'm still really good friends with people from college when I do run into them.\n\nAnd yet my career has skyrocketed.

I've gotten jobs where I didn't even have to come in for an interview, I was at home in my sweatpants and I got an offer for *more* than my previous company!

Growing up this way excluded me from participating in sports in school and significantly reduced my physical activity as a whole.

People often ask me why I\u2019m so quiet and I have no idea what to say to that and sometimes it brings me to tears (not in front of that person). I feel like I never left that awkward place from growing up. Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",

I want to enjoy certain things in life, but even things I like feel lonely without a social circle:  concerts - lonely; gym - lonely; travel - lonely; restaurants - lonely.  I even feel lonely at work, both professionally and socially. By that I mean, I do my job but I'm not valued by my peers.  Nobody asks me for advice or help and I generally feel like my existence on this rock is similar to me actually being an inanimate rock.\n\nI want more than this out of life, but I'm exhausted of trying to change and failing.

        "original": "So, 17/M, int\u2019l student who just started college for the first time in the US. I have some sort of issue where I can\u2019t manage to establish any proper friendships with others that I meet. It\u2019s kinda hard to explain\u2014whenever I have conversations with new people, I find it hard to maintain that friendship, in terms of finding new things to talk about. The thing is, I don\u2019t talk a lot in general, even to family and friends. And this problem really confronts me now that I\u2019m in college.\n\n\nIt\u2019s come to the phase where I\u2019m eating almost all my breakfasts, lunch and dinners on my own. Having dinner with just 1 other person is pretty tough for me\u2014because I\u2019m constantly so worried that we run out of things to say\u2014and when it does, it\u2019s slightly awkward; I have no idea how I\u2019ll manage when I will ever get a girlfriend in the future. So for now I try to sit with groups.  But even if I do have the chance to sit with others, I just don\u2019t have a lot to say or contribute. And that\u2019s what limits me from forming bonds with others. And ironically enough, when I\u2019m alone, I talk so much (to myself). It feels like my imagination is broken, in terms of thinking of things to talk about, if that makes sense. I am capable of having conversations, but the conversation often keeps going only since I ask lots of questions. They don\u2019t seem very interested in me either in terms of asking me questions. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. I think that the fact that I don\u2019t have a lot to talk about is what makes me uninteresting to many.\n\nIt\u2019s just so insanely complicated, all of this. Is it because of my aura, or something? That I just possess an energy or field that \u2018repels\u2019 others? That\u2019s literally almost what it feels like. I\u2019ve even evaluated how I can improve my non-verbal communication (posture and eye contact that kinda thing), as they say that constitutes 80% of the way you communicate. No luck so far.\n\nI thought this was just because of the community/types of people here (it\u2019s a Christian-oriented college) but then realized that this has actually been a trend throughout my whole life. Literally anyone I have talked to is uninterested in maintaining a friendship with me. It\u2019s been like this in high school too, if I had to host a birthday party as a senior at the HS I attended for 5 years, I\u2019d only be able to think of 4 actual good friends that might show up. \n\nI feel like I need to change this one way or another\u2014at this rate, I\u2019m not building any connections to expand my network. What\u2019s the point of college, other than academics, if you\u2019re not building new meaningful relationships with others? I want to experience the fun things college students do together, go to town and do fun things, hang out, etc. But here I am, laying in my dorm bed at 10:30 PM on a on a Friday night, hearing all the other people in my dorm hall come back with their friends and how they just came back from hanging out in the city all having good times. At this point, it\u2019s almost depressing and feel like this might go on for the rest of my life if I don\u2019t change anything.  Ugh \n\nThank you for reading this long post and any advice in any shape or form is appreciated",

I also follow politics, but I cant talk to people about it because it exhausts me fast.\n\nDue to these things I am unable to hold up a conversation if my life depended on it. I feel as if people aren't turned away about how intimidating I am, they will be when they find out I'm bi, if they aren't turned away by that, they will be by how boring I am, and if that doesn't turn them away, my openness about sexual conversations usually will make them uncomfortable.\n\nI've met few people who are okay with all these things, but of course they all have lives of their own, and not always available.

I really enjoyed that, like dinner or parties where I can socialise for a short period of time, I feel really happy doing that. I actually love it! \n\nBut when it comes to spend a whole day with someone, by the end of it, I feel like I don\u2019t like them. This happens all the time no matter who it is, family, friends or work colleagues but mostly happens with females, I seemed to be able to last longer with males. \n\nLittle background: My mum and Dad divorced when I was 3. I lived with my dad, live with mum on weekends. \n\nThe only two people I can spend time with all day many days 24/7 are my boyfriend of six years and my childhood friend. I have many childhood friends, but she is the only one I can spend days with. \n\nWith many male friends I can spend the day with quite comfortably and would last much longer. But eventually gets bored. \nCan\u2019t spend two days in a role with anyone. \n\nWhenever I have a whole day out with friends or whoever, I seem to get badly bored and want to be rid of them quickly. I found myself feeling tired and bored after a whole day with someone. It\u2019s very weird. \n\nSometimes, after spending time with certain people, when I\u2019m back home or back by myself, I think I don\u2019t like them and don\u2019t want to hang out with them again for a long time. \n\nI have recently started new job, during the handover period I had to spend 3 weeks with the person who was in my role. She is so lovely and very nice but after a few days, I started to not like her and thinking about how I don\u2019t want to see her. She is so helpful, I am the one with issue I know.\n\n This has always been the issue, since when I was little. I used to sneak out before lunch break in school to eat alone. But I will always join the others to play. I love playing with my friends or hanging out for few hours. Longer than that I get bored and then started not liking them again. \n\nAfter hanging out with someone for too long I started looking at all the negatives and often wanting to go home or if they were at my house, I would wanted them to leave. These people I have known for so long but can never stand to spend too long with them. \n\nEven my niece and nephew whom I adore. I can\u2019t do it. Can\u2019t be with them to long. \n\nForgot to mention, I used to love spending time with my Dad and older brother but they have both sadly passed away. So now only two people in the world I can hang out with, as mentioned above. \n\nI would love to be able to last longer. \n\nPlease share what you think and any suggestions.\n\nI appreciate your time. \n\nThank you \n\n",

        "original": "**TLDR:** Please help me with specific things to tell a girl I'm not interested in without seeming like a heartless bastard and lose our common friends.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nA question probably asked several times before, but I still want to ask in case someone feel like offering advice for my particular situation.\n\nI'm a recent arrival at university, and have gotten a group of friends here. I am older than most other freshmen here, as well as the people in my group of friends (I'm 23, they are 17 - 19). There is a girl (let's call her girl A) in the group that I've found quite obnoxious from the first day. We're both foreigners in our country of study, she's from the US and I'm from South Africa. I'm a very softspoken guy, I don't drink, don't party, and generally don't enjoy myself in large groups of people or situations where I have to raise my voice to be heard. This girl on the other hand is the opposite: always loud, screams in lieu of laughing, and often accuses me or other guys in the group of talking about her when we're not, or that things we're saying are cruel when it obviously doesn't mean what she appears/pretends to think it does.\n\nAnother girl from the group told me while drunk that girl A was super into me, and that I was always flirting back to her, which I 100% took as a joke. Half of my communications with girl A has been me telling her that I find it disrespectful how she constantly concludes that what I'm saying is directed at her, and in a negative way at that. I don't do this in an aggressive manner, as I've learned from my life of being big and black that I am easily taken as more intimidating or angry than intended. The only prolonged time we've spent together alone was 10 days ago after she had been complaining about an assignment that was due the next day that she hadn't started working on on, and I spent a couple of hours at night helping her with it at a bench outside. I have issues with sleeping and often sleep a couple of hours at night and a couple during the day, in addition to having worked as a teacher, so in my mind I didn't feel like I was going far out of my way. Just my brain thinking the easiest way to solve both our issues -- she not having done the assignment and me having to listen to her complain about it -- was to actually solve it.\n\nNow in the past days she has changed her communication. In the group chat with all our friends, she has been proposing to me that her and I get together and watch a show called the breakfast club (about rappers I think), writing a lot that I can see her at any time so she can help me with my language studies (she studied french in high school; I'm studying Chinese as my sixth language), and invited me over to watch a movie with her at 11 pm. She's 19 and a virgin, revealed when several of us were playing truth or truth (truth or dare for lazy people), and I am as certain as can be that she wasn't lying about that.\n\nI'm in part rambling to see my thoughts on screen, but also to see if you might have some advice for me. My intuition tells me I need to make it very clear to her that nothing will happen between us, but some key phrases would be greatly appreciated. Due to my personality and culture, I'm mostly either stoic or laughing when communicating. It's a strange combination in the west unfortunately, but laughing is considered appropriate in almost every situation (excluding someone's death) where I'm from. I do however understand that I should avoid it in this situation :D\n\nI would like to avoid hurting her feelings as much as possible, and not have her and our friends seeing her as a victim and me as the baddie with her crying and hearbroken, while I'm just being regular old me. Might sound oddly specific, but it has happened before.\n\nSorry for the rant and the grammar mistakes, but thanks for any insight any of you might offer.\n\n",

Today at my place of work (psychology department), a discussion about a patient who was emotionally neglected as a child started and a lot of the experiences of the patient triggered strong emotions within me. During the discussion I could feel like I wanted to burst out crying like a little child. \n\nChildhood Emotional Neglect is apparently very common and turns out... I was emotionally neglected. I have to say my parents (I'm from a South-East Asian background) tended to every material need of mine but one thing I noticed was that they weren't emotionally attuned with me. My emotions didn't ever seem to matter. My most vivid memory of being extremely upset was when I was four years old and hand-made a card for my mum on mother's day... the next day I saw it in the bin. From a young age then, the belief that 'I am not good enough' and 'anything I do will not be enough' has been reinforced. When I would cry, I would be told off rather than consoled. Any opinion I had was disregarded... they viewed me as the 'young dumb one' which has always stuck with me. This is the role I still play in every situation; I am too young to know anything (25.. not exactly young anymore) and too dumb to know anything (all evidence suggests I'm not dumb but I feel it). Anything I did as a young child was just not enough for instance if I washed the dishes.. rather than be praised.. I was criticised I.e. 'you didn't clean the sink properly.. you're useless'. I wasn't validated!\n\nI am portraying my parents as monsters and they really are not.. they are truly lovely but showing affection is something that they never learnt when they were younger. They were always task-oriented and emotions didn't really matter. Don't think I've ever heard them say 'I love you'.. that's just how they are. By not allowing me a space to feel important or make me feel like I matter, I have internalized this and these are now my core beliefs. Anything I do in life is effected by these core beliefs especially my social life. I feel like I am not good enough to have a conversation, I have low self-esteem and fear rejection/failure so I just don't put myself out there. I avoid social situation due to this fear of being rejected. I feel if people find out about how dumb I am.. they will reject me so I may aswell not put myself in that situation. I come across as awkward and someone who has nothing to talk about but it's just the low self-esteem and anxiety that becomes a barrier. I do have things to say but in social situations I can't think of what to say because I am constantly thinking about what they want to hear/ people pleasing but it isn't authentic. It's just really frustrating. \n\nI know being in the field of psychology will teach me a lot about myself and how to overcome these problems but I just wish it was easy for me not to doubt myself over everything! \n",

(I\u2019m female 27 years old)\n\nI love social gatherings and small talks. I really enjoyed that, like dinner or parties where I can socialise for a short period of time, I feel really happy doing that. I actually love it! \n\nBut when it comes to spend a whole day with someone, by the end of it, I feel like I don\u2019t like them. This happens all the time no matter who it is, family, friends or work colleagues but mostly happens with females, I seemed to be able to last longer with males. \n\nLittle background: My mum and Dad divorced when I was 3. I lived with my dad, live with mum on weekends. \n\nThe only two people I can spend time with all day many days 24/7 are my boyfriend of six years and my childhood friend. I have many childhood friends, but she is the only one I can spend days with. \n\nWith many male friends I can spend the day with quite comfortably and would last much longer. But eventually gets bored. \nCan\u2019t spend two days in a role with anyone. \n\nWhenever I have a whole day out with friends or whoever, I seem to get badly bored and want to be rid of them quickly. I found myself feeling tired and bored after a whole day with someone. It\u2019s very weird. \n\nSometimes, after spending time with certain people, when I\u2019m back home or back by myself, I think I don\u2019t like them and don\u2019t want to hang out with them again for a long time. \n\nI have recently started new job, during the handover period I had to spend 3 weeks with the person who was in my role. She is so lovely and very nice but after a few days, I started to not like her and thinking about how I don\u2019t want to see her. She is so helpful, I am the one with issue I know.\n\n This has always been the issue, since when I was little. I used to sneak out before lunch break in school to eat alone. But I will always join the others to play. I love playing with my friends or hanging out for few hours. Longer than that I get bored and then started not liking them again. \n\nAfter hanging out with someone for too long I started looking at all the negatives and often wanting to go home or if they were at my house, I would wanted them to leave. These people I have known for so long but can never stand to spend too long with them. \n\nEven my niece and nephew whom I adore. I can\u2019t do it. Can\u2019t be with them to long. \n\nForgot to mention, I used to love spending time with my Dad and older brother but they have both sadly passed away. So now only two people in the world I can hang out with, as mentioned above. \n\nI would love to be able to last longer. \n\nPlease share what you think and any suggestions.\n\nI appreciate your time. \n\nThank you \n\n",

        "original": "I (27M) have an amazing friend who we'll call M (26M). We met 4 years ago, but started getting closer about 2 years ago, when we reconnected after a long time. We met through a mutual friend, who was my best friend at the time, but with whom I ended having a fallout. So when we reconnected I was a little bit lonely. He was also going through a rough patch with his family and we started going out to party more often, then to do other things besides partying, until eventually we got so close to each other that he started saying that I am his best friend. I feel the same way about him. He has been increidbly supportive, taught me a lot of things, and we just have a lot of fun when we are together. And he makes an effort to include me in almost all of his plans. That is, until last Saturday. He went to work as a watchman at a party, so we couldn't hang out that day, but when his shift finished, he let me know and asked me if I wanted to go out, but I told him I didn't have any money. However, I had a fight with my older sister that day, with whom I live (and we otherwise love each other very much), because since he told md he wasn't available, I visited another friend, and arrived home drunk (this is a point of contention with my family as they want me to abstain from alcohol, plain and simple, and they don't seem to accept the fact that I will drink socially). So I was fuming and wanted desperately to go out, but wasn't clear enough and I just stayed home. When we met again a few days later, we were with a few friends of his, and they inadvertentky revealed that they were hanging out drinking at his house last Sunday, till the early hours of Monday. I tried to tell myself that I was mad because he did that when he knew that I needed to go ourt, but when I remembered that day I was already on good terms with my sister again, I just realized I felt hurt that he hung out with other friends without me and I wasjust trying to rationalize it. He explained that it was totally unplanned and I just replied that he could have called me regardless. I was upset but decided to calm down and not say anything before analyzing things, and eventually I decided that something like that was bound to happen once in a while, and that I had no reason to freak out. So, comes this Saturday (yesterday) and he got me a job as a watchman, just like him, so that we could hang out without drinking (his words), but since I was new I was assigned to a different event and were separated the whole day. He called me before his shift started from his friend's phone (he didn't have his) to see how I was doing, but didn't talk anymore after that. We had agreed the day before that we would go clubbing after work that day, but he never called, and when I called his friend's phone no one picked up. I went to the club by myself and ended up meeting some other, more superficial friends, but started to constantly check my phone to see if he wouldn't call. I'm freaking out that he might have gone drinking with his other friends without me. I am becoming clingy and needy (even if I refrain from acting that way) and don't know what to do. I don't want to end ruining a great friendship over that.\n\nTLDR.- I am becoming a clingy friend, my best friend hung out with others for the first time and felt upset, don't want to ruin this friendship over something that silly.\n\nEDIT.- Feel free to ask more details, there are more but I just didn't want to write a wall of text",

I actually pinpointed what is the cause. I am afraid of not being able to pee and that other people will notice, which makes me even more stressed and prevents me from peeing at all. I practice after school and on weekends just going to the mall after drinking water and using urinals. I am usually able to go, but the problem is at school. At school, many people know me by face and I am anxious of being seen as a loser who can't even use a urinal by people that see me everyday. All urinals lack dividers. I actually have more issues going if I am alone in a room with just one guy, because he will for sure know if I can't go. If I am in a big bathroom with 5 other guys, none will really know. The problem is that if I go to the big bathroom, it tends to be full so I have to pee elbow to elbow with no dividers, which is always a bit harder.\n\nI know I sound like someone who really overthinks this, but this is exactly what anxiety sounds like. My main worry is being judged for not being able to pee. Judged for standing at a urinal for more than a minute and than just zipping up and leaving without having done anything. Does anyone have tips for this? Most importantly, does anyone actually give a fuck? I would notice if the person next to me wasn't able to pee because I pay a lot of attention to urinals, but do normal people even give a shit? Does anyone actually notice this kind of stuff? Does anyone have advice for a guy who's being severely limited in life by this? Planning what I drink according to when I can go home and pee is terrible. I am often stuck with the need to pee but having to study or listen to a teacher, which is impossible. I still have two more years of college and will still have to deal with this issue all my adult life in an office or in public.\n\nPlease, any help is wanted.

        "original": "I just turned 20, and it's got me in a rather introspective mood. \n\nI've always been very independent. I don't like others to do things for me. For better or for worse, I want to be responsible for my own life, and it's for this reason that I moved out as soon as I graduated high school. \n\nI started out the way most 18 year-old's do, I tried the college thing. I took out a student loan to get an engineering degree, I lived in a little studio apartment close to campus, and I worked 30 hours a week fixing computers at a retail outlet to pay my rent.\n\nAnd I was so unhappy. \n\nMy reserved nature made it really difficult for me to relate to those in my classes. When I wasn't in class I was working, in order to make sure that I could afford to eat. Even if I had made friends, it's not like I would've had time to see them. \n\nI was also going into substantial amounts of debt to get a degree I wasn't passionate about, I was only doing it because I thought it would give me a good job later in life. \n\nI wasn't engaged in college socially or academically, and I felt alienated, like I didn't belong. \n\nSo I dropped out. I thought that there had to be a smarter way to do things. \n\nI've always been pretty good with computers, and I knew that it was an employable skill, so I decided to build on that. I spent what little income I had paying for online classes to get some industry certifications. I also kept my eyes peeled for the right job opportunity. \n\nBy a stroke of luck, I got connected to a rapidly growing company, where I was able to use my skills and knowledge to start building an IT department from the ground up. I guess those that hired me liked my ambition. At 19 years old, I was making the same money that I would be if I'd finished my engineering degree. I've found myself living an adult lifestyle, with an adult schedule and adult responsibilities. \n\nI've got a good job, no debt outside of my student loan, and I even found out that I could afford to purchase my own home soon if I wanted to. By all merits I should feel successful. \n\nBut I don't. Instead, I just feel alone. \n\nTo those that I relate to professionally, they see me as a child. When people find out how old I am, they often make comments like \"oh you're just a baby\", unaware of how much that pisses me off. \n\nI went to \"young adult\" event the other day.

I'm not one for the party scene, which seems to be what a lot of college students are into.

It's like people my age don't know how to think about anyone except themselves. \n\nI'm not saying that there aren't other people like me out there. It's just that, if there are, well... I haven't met any yet.   \n\nLong story short, I just want to have adult relationships with people, but most \"adults\" still see me as a kid.  \n\nI don't really know where else to look.

Sorry if this is a little long, but I'm not a very concise writer and I feel like I need a lot of help.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I've had a very difficult time connecting with people. The things that make other people happy or sad just don't have the same effects on me. I never know how to approach topics or any subject that is any deeper than the shallowest puddle. I know this should all be obvious considering I'm posting to r/socialskills, but I just want to make sure we're all on the same page - I feel utterly disconnected from everyone in my life.\n\nThis isn't to say that I have no friends; I definitely do, and these friendships have lasted many many years and bring me a lot of happiness. However, I don't really feel connected to them. I enjoy being with my friends because they make me laugh, but the thought of somehow losing contact and never seeing them again (or, oppositely, being lifelong friends) doesn't faze me whatsoever. I'm not sure if I'm over-reacting here, but shouldn't I feel at least something? \n\nI've also never had a girlfriend or boyfriend (I'm an 18-year-old female) and every person I've ever found physically attractive never seems to understand that I like them. I've never even had any sort of physical contact with any person that could be considered even somewhat romantic/sexual. I don't know how to make another person understand that I like them or how to even \"make\" (I know this is the wrong word but I don't know how else to put it) someone like me back. I don't even know if I would be able to actually reciprocate any sort of romantic feelings at all - right now I'm just going off of thinking another person is aesthetically pleasing. \n\nI guess my big issue is that I feel lonely. I go out of my way to do nice things for people (I'll buy people lunch or, as I did just yesterday, spend hours making little Valentine's Day gifts for the people in my program) and look forward to making them happy in the hopes that I'll feel something in return, but I never really do. I can't tell if the guy that I currently kind of like is just boring or if we have no connection at all, or how to build a connection in the first place.\n\nI hope this kind of question isn't just a repetition of a million other questions on this sub, as I'm starting to get really tired of feeling so alone.

        "original": "Hey all hopefully this can become trending for everyone to see. I\u2019m gonna do my best to make a brief checklist of all topics that people can research to better themselves. I\u2019ll also go through the comments and add anything that I\u2019ve missed. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be adding more since I can only think of a few right now. \n\nHere it goes: \n\n#1. Eye contact - can\u2019t stress how important if you lack eye contact you might not realize anything weird but people who constantly give eye contact will notice this in conversation \n\n#2. Conversation - it\u2019s fine to be 60%-40%, 75-25 heck even at times 80-20. But know when the other person is not interested. If you surround them with non stop questions and convo it won\u2019t be appealing. Have a good convo you can talk more than the other person SOMETIMES not always. Don\u2019t absolutely dominate the convo by making it 1 way. \n\n#3. Smile and be happy - people who are angry all the time might have anxiety and dep. it\u2019s very important to work on yourself. Read books, YouTube vids, google change your life for you. \n\n#4. Exercise - BAM I just gave you another hobby if you already don\u2019t. Guys can work on lifting weights women might like to do more cardio it\u2019s whatever fits you personally. Just know exercising will change your body image, release stress, make you healthier and so many other good things. \n\n#5. Friends - it\u2019s very easy to feel undervalued, trust me I\u2019ve been there and going thru it now. Don\u2019t keep a mental log in your head like \u201cI did this so I should get that\u201d. With CLOSE friends notice I said CLOSE. Meaning people you hang out with often and visit their houses or something. It\u2019s nice to be generous, it\u2019s fine to spend money on them but they should be doing same for you. Now I don\u2019t mean go buy them 50$ items. But it\u2019ll be a great surprise if you know your close friend is hungry and invited you over to their home, and you bring pizza or snacks. This attitude isn\u2019t limited to this specific scenario. But what is important is the mental shift from being someone who keeps track of things and being someone who is a GIVER. Do not give to those who don\u2019t give back. This also doesn\u2019t mean give something every chance you get, once in a while it\u2019s a nice gesture. \n\n#6. People really don\u2019t care - have you ever been on tinder seen bunch of people ? Maybe. You\u2019ve ever been to a really crowded place? Maybe. If you see a bunch of random people a few will really stick out to you and you remember them. But let\u2019s be realistic you probably don\u2019t even remember anyone. I always used to think random people are judging my appearance non stop. But I don\u2019t think people are as mean as we think. When we see a person we don\u2019t find attractive do we just notice \u201cnot my type\u201d or do we take pictures, approach them and make fun of them, talk about it to our friends ? Probably not. So my point is if we aren\u2019t doing that, it\u2019s very likely the people whose opinions we fear might not even have opinions about us at all. \n\n#7. Meditation - yes it may be boring sometimes or even difficult to keep your mind in the right place but you will reap amazing benefits. It\u2019s also really helpful to stop day dreaming about bad scenarios. When that happens focus on whatever you are doing instead, so stop thinking. Just shower, make your food, do your homework, DONT BE DISTRACTED. Not only will you be more productive finish your tasks quicker, you also will be releasing so much negative energy entering your thoughts. Focus on the moment \n\n#8. You don\u2019t need people to help you - to me I think it\u2019s good to be independent. People don\u2019t always want to help you with your problems. If your angry at someone who MIGHT have a chance of being your friend in the future. Certainly do not lash out and make a scene until you really thought it through. You don\u2019t want to be labels as \u201cthat guy or girl who is always angry\u201d. That was me 15years old but now at 21 people don\u2019t realize that\u2019s not me, they just stuck a label on me and obviously are disappointed I\u2019m not meeting their standards of being worse than them. \n\n#9. Hanging out - this was also me a few years ago. I would be friends with people, lots of people but the ones I was close with, I realize now I might\u2019ve liked them too much. I always wanted to hang out and always would text people to hang out (my home life isn\u2019t great). But you can\u2019t always be the one to text people this goes back to #2 don\u2019t always be the one to initiate when you have a healthy relationship. Not giving someone their space will turn them around no matter how much they liked you at one point. \n\nIdk guys this is just a few topics I feel are important and some topics people don\u2019t bring up specifics about. I\u2019m not a professional but I feel like this might be good general advice. Don\u2019t take what I said 100% just be exposed to the thoughts ",

I am not ugly, I am sort of aware of that, but I am not that hot good-looking guy for whom would women drop instantly their panties.

Which is genetic and I can not do much about it. I cannot blame my parents for not having a jawline or a deep voice for instance. I am not a fan of the MGTOW way of thinking for two simple reasons : First, I can not be an MGTOW because simply there are no women around chasing me, it would be dumb to think \"Well, you know what, I should better go my own way, women are trouble makers and they only want to take advantage of me\", this doesn't make sense in my situation.

I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We\u2019d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said \"Nobody else is as big as you\". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.\n\nAs I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.\n\nWell now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything. She has dated other guys and dated a guy while doing this stuff and just doesn't stop. I made my IG public and screens hotted a funny post from a site I frequent. Days later she posts on that site a question about finding the one and it is just a rant and talking about other guys under her name. Created an account just to post that and never went back on.\n\nI am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it.\n\nPS: I am autistic but on the high functioning end of the spectrum and not everyone knows it or thinks it but I struggle with social cues and such.",

It used to be easy for me to make new friends and to spend time with friends old and new. I notice the older I get, the less tolerance I have for people. I find myself irritated easily by people who talk too much. The way I see it, I feel like socializing becomes a moot point as conversations get recycled on a steady basis in groups of coworkers, friends, group texts, etc. \u201cHow are you? How is the job going? Are you seeing anyone? I gotta tell you...etc.\u201d and a waste of time. \n\nI find myself only spending time with people in a place where I am allowed to leave anytime I want, and not invite them over knowing they will overstay past 2 hours. When people overstay or when I feel over socialized, I have a strong urge to leave and to be alone. I feel like an ass when I leave early and feel as though I have to make a good excuse instead of just telling the truth: I\u2019m not enjoying this anymore and really prefer to be alone; I\u2019m satisfied chatting with you and my social juice is out. this happened two weeks ago and a friend called me out on it. And I only genuinely like maybe 4 people in my circle of friends. The rest, I don\u2019t care. I also suck at texting people back unless it\u2019s about making social plans I actually look forward to. \n\nWhen a social plan is set in place, I have to mentally prepare myself for it. For instance, if I go out with friends on a Friday night, I have to be really alone the whole day before the social plan and the day after. I feel the same way about dating. Dating feels much more of an obligation and a social task than something I actually look forward to. I feel whole by myself.\n\nI feel myself being much more comfortable and satisfied being alone and not get lonely. Though I do get lonely sometimes but when I experience this feeling, it\u2019s almost never strong enough a motivator for me to spend time with others. I prefer to do my own thing.

Both are conservative, close-minded (father less) and unbearable during discussions due to lack of any understanding in how a discussion should work (finding common ground, not getting emotionally abusive etc.). \n\nSo yesterday in my dorm I lit up a joint before I took the train home. I looked more or less fine when I arrived home, just a bit tired in the face. My mum immediately started asking me if I took something and if I'm telling the truth (ofc I lied) blablabla. That's the point where I started to ask myself why my mother has no chill. I'm a 22 yo grown man and maybe I'm still a manchild but why does she care so much about my lifestyle. \n\nIn the end I said that I took nothing and went to my room. Later I had to go on the toilet and my father came home from work. When I was sitting on the toilet my father started to do some testing with the bathroom door cause it's kinda broken. Suddenly he said that I should look in his eyes and he came closer to me(me still sitting on the toilet shitting). He even pulled out a torch from nowhere and blinded me with it. I went loud and said that he immediately should fuck off and never ever try pointing such a strong torchlight at my eyes again. I don't even know how to feel about this. Offended? Feel pity for my dad? Just laugh? \n\nI feel like a fucking 12 yo boy writing this out. It's so damn childish from my parents and the problem is that I can't discuss shit with them. I'd love to love my parents.

        "original": "It\u2019s my first year of college and coming from a place pretty far away from the majority of people who go to my school, it was a bit of a transition. I also live off campus because it helps with my financial situation, but I don\u2019t live with family or anything. Just with strangers as roommates. Because of all this, it was harder to make friends so I came out to a lot of clubs/orgs and met lots of people, lots of guys. We meet and they ask for \nmy social media right away (therefore maintaining a relationship past meeting them once at some event) which made me feel good cause i was finally succeeding in having friends. Some of them did try to hit on me at first, and i immediately told them \u201chey, i\u2019m not looking for anything right now\u201d and they all seemed respectful of that when they said \u201cthat\u2019s okay, we can just be friends\u201d. \n\nBut it seems like a common pattern is that they expect that i\u2019ll just change my mind about that, as if they get me to hang out with them enough, i\u2019ll start to like them in that way. It recently happened with one of my guy \u201cfriends\u201d and I actually got really attached to him in a strictly platonic way- he\u2019s fun to be around and i genuinely enjoy his company. He always invites me to things and introduced me to his friend group and I\u2019ve been consistently hanging with them for the past few months. But at a party he invited me to, his friends were drunk and all told me that he was into me and if i didn\u2019t feel the same i should tell him. So i waited til I was sober and i told him the next day. He seemed to take it well but afterwards stopped talking to me altogether, doesn\u2019t invite me to anything, etc. Since i got so attached to him platonically, it hurts even more that he\u2019s so okay with not talking to me at all. \n\nI can\u2019t help but feel really disappointed since i genuinely enjoyed him, and the general premise of friendship is that each person enjoys the company of the other, but it seems like all my guy friends just pretend to enjoy my company when they actually don\u2019t care about me and it\u2019s a disguise for an opening to hook up/get into a relationship with me. Once they realize i\u2019m not going to \u2018change my mind\u2019 about not wanting a relationship, they stop talking to me and it makes me feel worthless or that i don\u2019t have enough redeemable qualities as a person other than my looks. It feels like they only pretend to be nice, they only pretend to find my jokes funny, only pretend that what i say has worth or that anything about me is interesting. So it makes me feel worse because when it all vanishes, i realize it was only an act.\n\nAlso, maybe the title comes off as cocky but really i have low self confidence. I struggle with an eating disorder and this summer had a failed suicide attempt (getting help now though from a professional), so please do not assume i\u2019m trying to act high and mighty by saying \u2018attractive\u2019. I guess i feel the need to say this since from personal experience people seem to think i\u2019m arrogant just because of the way i look. I\u2019m using \u2018attractive\u2019 because that\u2019s what i\u2019ve been told from others, although i don\u2019t perceive myself in a similar light whatsoever.\n\nam i doing something wrong? Is it the way i approach them? should i just drop hints rather than telling them outright that i don\u2019t like them like that? is there a better way to go about this? \n\nedit: by clubs and orgs, i mean community service clubs and cultural organizations on campus, as well as mixers that professional organizations on campus host.

When I talk to them I feel *so* behind and any of my confidence vanishes. I used to want to be a teacher but nowadays I don't want to pursue it anymore.\n\nI somehow got through life to this point without doing any real socializing. I did well in school but was so quiet and only had a few close friends. I dabbled in different activities but my parents never pushed me to put effort into anything. I am grateful that they let me take horseback riding lessons once a week though, but again, not many social skills learned. I spent soooo much time on the computer online and playing games. I didn't even get a part-time job until I was 18, and only worked Saturdays and it was a super slow shop. Didn't have a job during college either because I was given full financial aid and my social anxiety held me back from seeking anything out. We didn't even have any extended family nearby so I rarely rarely did family things.\n\nSo basically, I've let years and years slide by where I barely had to socialize at all, and when I was younger I just goofed off with my fun bunch of friends (no drinking/drugs or anything) while most others my age were acting much more mature and being put into responsible roles. \n\nI only have one close friend now and she's matured a lot and has a pretty good career path (her parents are wealthy and she has a ton of financial support). All of my other friends have moved to various places. I also have almost no money left.\n\nI don't know what to do.

Dating sucks in the Bay Area anyway (especially for brown guys). Women are attracted way more to men who have social value more than looks. At this point, I just want friends. I want people to give a shit about me. I feel depressed as fuck whenever I go on social media and see people's lives. I'm tired of spending most of my weekends alone watching TV or doing nothing. I've gained 75 lbs over the past 2 years because of this. I wish I was a girl. It's so easy for girls to make friends it's a joke. Guys my age just see other guys as competition, especially in this place.\n\n\\- How does someone like me meet people in an organic way to build friendships? How do I meet people who give enough of a fuck about me who invite me to travel with them and do shit? I don't want to look back at my 20s (which are supposed to be the best years of your life) and see that I missed out on the typical 20s shit.\n\n\\- How do I make myself more active on social media even when my life is pretty boring? I hate social media, but it's necessary if I want people to give a fuck about me.\n\n\\- How do I change my body and my attitude so that when I'm 30 I can look back and be amazed at how much my life has changed?\n\nIf anyone has struggled or is struggling with similar shit at my age, I'd really appreciate it. It would be nice to know that I'm not the only 28-year-old who doesn't have his shit together.\n\nThanks and hope that 2019 is a success for all of you. God bless.",

If I skipped it, I would just make myself feel like shit since I knew that I could've gone but I didn't. I also don't want to miss out on something that could've been a good experience, but would've just been garbage (aka spending money to rent a tux n tickets). If I were to skip this years, I could easily just go to Senior prom but I want at least one good experience in my Junior year to look back on.

No stomach churns. No stuttering. Turned up and was immediately thrust into introducing myself to everybody and making a lotta friends.\n\nAnd the reason why... I made sure I was 2 bottles of wine deep before I showed up.\n\nVirtually every problem I have at social events went away, I wasn\u2019t scared of anybody. The thing I hate doing most of all which is introducing myself turns into my favourite thing to do. Normally at parties I feel uncomfortable in every single room at some point in the night. But there wasn\u2019t one area of this party where i felt like I didn\u2019t belong. \n\nI noticed it straight away when I walked in and everyone asked who I was, I had no fear. I knew it was because of the wine. But I knew this person I was was the real me. The me without the hesitation, the second guessing and the constant panic. I met so many cool people that night.\n\nEveryday I\u2019m wishing I could just down a bottle and live my life as myself as an easy way out. But I know logically that\u2019s problematic and not a good idea at all. It\u2019s just frustrating that there is such an accessible and frankly cheap temporary medicine right there. Ready to make my life better in the short term. But bound to make it grosser for the long term. Sad truth.\n\nI mean I owe alcohol to the fact that I had a 2 year relationship (my only relationship). Sure I wasn\u2019t drunk for the whole thing. But the first day we hung out I was. I don\u2019t think I could have survived without it.  \n\nI\u2019ve definitely gotten a lot better with my social anxiety over the years. There\u2019s still such a long way to go though and it\u2019s gotten to a point where I\u2019m not only nervous to talk to people in person, I now ignore online messages as well. They make me so nervous, sometimes I won\u2019t respond to them for days, a couple weeks and in the worse of cases, not at all.\n\nI woke up the morning after the party and the reality of how nondrunk I was hit me when I saw the unread messages from friends I had been talking to before I went to sleep, and my stomach went sour and my first thought was \u201cnope. me no talky. ignore ignore ignore. bye\u201d... even though I desperately want to make and keep friends.\n\nAnyway I know everyone is saying professional help is the best option. I agree. I had help from yr 9-12. Makes it nearly 3 years since I\u2019ve seen someone about it. I always want to convince myself that I\u2019m so much better than I used to be and I don\u2019t need help anymore. But after this whole daily alcohol desire maybe I\u2019m a little wrong on that. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t know what I want out of this post. Advice? Reassurance? Understanding and compassion? Sharing of similar stories and experiences? I really don\u2019t have a clue. \n\nJust had to get it off my chest I guess. \n",

But I feel obviously excluded from the majority of conversations and potential gatherings. What's more, I think people are a bit hesitant to get to know you these days by texting and meeting face to face. They preffer the security of stalking you for a bit on Facebook, Instagram, etc, and maybe seeing you in a few group chats to gauge what you're like.\n\nI have a group of people I'm trying to get close to; one of whom knows me from my old school, which helps. But they all live in an apartment together about 2 miles from me, and texting them one-on-one doesn't really help me meet up, since there's usually very little plan to their actions. On top of that, it doesn't help me meet their wider friendship group (one of which is a single girl I really like the look of), so I'm constantly re-introducing myself and counting on blind luck for who I'll meet on a given night.\n\nIt seems like just messenger or something would be a step up, but I've been so adamant about not wanting it in the past that it'd be a huge break of character, and I don't want it to come off as attention seeking or desperate behaviour.\n\nAnd let me just say I don't really have a problem with people face-to-face; in fact I've been told I'm quite likeable on mutiple occasions. But that face-to-face is rare due to lack of knowledge about meet ups, and living so far away from everyone else (a tight budget doesn't help either), and I feel a lot of people won't bother talking with strangers on a night out. The few that do always follow up with \"Let me add you on FB\", and when I tell them I don't have it that's either the end of the conversation or I'll give my number in the full knowledge they'll never text me.\n\nThoughts?",

I have been trying to find a part time job to be financially independent to take some stress off my parents, and well because, i\u2019m 19 and i WANT to be independent to make my family and myself proud. \n\nI feel that I\u2019m on a path that I dont even know if I want to be on? I love traveling, dance/music/art/singing has always been my passion. Those are my outlets whenever I\u2019m feeling down or anxious. I want nothing more than to have a clean slate with my family from the years of childhood that I put them through hell and back. I want to find myself and finally find a piece of mind. I want to weed out everyone and everything that serves no purpose in my life. I want to finally find a guy thats not \u201cjust a casual\u201d relationship. I need to find happiness and clarity for my sanity. I need to know what I\u2019m meant to do in life and I need to know how to obtain that. But how can I move forward and make a life for myself if I have no idea what I want to be, or who I am even am now? I know I\u2019m still young and life is TOUGH, but I guess I\u2019m looking for advice/guidance?\n\nI\u2019m not even entirely sure if this text is going in order or making sense, so I apologize if this seems scattered. Thanks for reading and whoever is reading, i hope you see brighter days and are at peace with yourself <3 ",

I meticulously go through all of our interactions (between me and the person cutting contact) and find that there\u2019s really nothing that merits cutting a person off. My other friends are typically just as confused. Each time it happens, it hurts and I hold on to it. I know it\u2019s unhealthy and I shouldn\u2019t hold on to things but I feel like any friend that I absolutely adore could cut me off at any time. It has made me very socially anxious. I want to know if this is just a normal fact or life of it\u2019s because I\u2019m generally a shitty person. \n\nHere are some examples: \nIn early college, I had a friend who would visit me every other day and I would visit her just as much. She would tell me about her relationship, I was the first person she told when she got engaged, etc. When it came time for the wedding, she decided to not invite me. She also unfollowed me on Instagram. I think it was because I went off to a super intense university and kind of just stopped talking to people in general while I was studying. We don\u2019t talk now. \n\nIn university, I was super close with a friend. The first year there, we were the same major and I would sleep over her apartment very often when we were studying. She told me about her relationship when it first started to the point where she got engaged. We graduated and I was going through my own stuff. She got married shortly after and didn\u2019t invite me. We don\u2019t really talk now. \n\nA girl I was close with when I moved out here used have a lot of heart to heart talks with me. I would tell her that I support her and that even tho what she\u2019s doing may not fall in line with what our community expects, I\u2019ll still be there for her. She deleted me off social media. We haven\u2019t talked in a long time. Granted, she did delete everyone in our friend group off of social media. \n\nFinally, a woman I was close with at work is now giving me the cold shoulder. I have thought about what I could have done wrong and I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m sad and I miss talking to her on our lunch breaks. \n\nAnyway, I would love some pieces of encouragement. Is it me? Are these normal life occurrences? Am I monster and I don\u2019t know? How do I let all this go? \n",

        "original": "I wrote an article in 2004 while in high school about human nature being mostly self-centered. Sure, we have family that we care about, jobs that deal with helping people, and general friends and acquaintances, but for the most part, people in real life are generally not going to offer you help, advice or guidance along your journey. Driving is the perfect example; people rarely look and smile at the person next to them at a stoplight and they will cut someone off in a heartbeat just to benefit themselves to get that front spot at the red light. You ever drive out of town and stop at a desolate gas station for sodas? Well, most people don\u2019t acknowledge the person behind the counter, they generally just pay for their items and forget they ever stopped there. The person behind the counter has a life just a vivid and complex as the next person. \n\nI worked as a food server for 10 years and always noticed that people really didn\u2019t care about me, I was just a tool for them to order food from. I was interesting because the restaurant was full of people that were all together under the same roof, but table A couldn\u2019t care less about table B and so on.... \n\nBeing the nice guy that I am, I\u2019m really starting to realize that it doesn\u2019t really benefit me like I thought it would as a younger adult. Women generally don\u2019t want to be to with a nice guy, employers take advantage of the nice people to keep costs down and work loads high, and nice deeds that are done are usually forgotten about in a weeks time. In this day and age, I believe that if you don\u2019t have money, fame or connections, people generally brush you off and move on. This world is so large that most people won\u2019t even meet 90% of the population. It\u2019s sad to me, but I guess it\u2019s good just to wake up everyday and live life for myself maybe I\u2019ll meet some cool people along the way. \n\nThere\u2019s this philosophy called \u201csonder\u201d which is a pretty good example of what I\u2019m talking about.

        "original": "I've never had this kind of issue before but I feel like either I'm somehow cursed or doing something really wrong. Long story short in the last two months I've texted at least 6 girls and out of the sudden they have stop replying my messages. No, I wasn't texting them simultaneously. After being ignored by one I try with the next one and so on...\n\nLet me give you more context. I'm currently 22 years old and feel like I'm ready for my next serious relationship. I broke up with my last gf a little more than a year ago. Since I was 18 I've been living abroad. Recently, I moved back to my home country. Perhaps I somehow forgot how to socialize with girls from here? I don't think I'm doing anything wrong.\n\nI think I'm good looking, I excersice regularly, I'm not shy, I dress well, I put a lot of effort in details, I like to always be clean, smell nice, I clean my room and my car. I have a good job and right now I'm taking online classes to get my degree. I also go to church every Sunday and try my best to be a good person in general. I love my family, speak several languages, practice soccer and play the guitar, I have good friends both guys and girls. Love to go to the beach, socially drink, dance and party.\n\nWhat I do is that I find a girl that interests me usually through social media like an old acquaintance, someone that I met back when I lived here. When I text them they are usually excited to know that I'm back. Some of them even had the initiative to ask me out. However, one I didn't like very much so after thanking her for going out with me I didn't message her anymore.\n\nThe other one went quite well, she even said that if we were going to try to be something more than friends we should go slowly and get to know each other better, we kept texting for around a week after going out, even made plans to go to a concert and one day she just didn't reply to my messages anymore.\n\nWith the other girls, I usually have asked them out and they have agreed but then when the day gets closer I ask them something like \"Hey are we still meeting up on Saturday night?\" and they just don't reply anymore... This is getting really frustrating. I also think that it is really rude to just ignore someone. I would really appreciate if they would tell me \"Hey you are cool but I'm currently not interested in ....\" and perhaps provide me with some feedback? Like \"I didn't really like what you did or what you said or this about you...\". I don't know, maybe this is a weird coincidence? Also after I get ignored I don't really send more messages I don't like to lose my pride, so if I see that I get ignored I just give up and don't try anymore. Weirdly, these girls keep liking my posts on social media. I'm currently talking to a new girl but I'm getting really tired. This has never happened to me before, I've had plenty of gfs and I believe I'm a good bf. Any advice or explanations?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "original": "I\u2019ve shared this story with a few close friends, and it\u2019s relieving to get it off my chest. I have a lot of socially awkward friends, and I\u2019m the opposite. I\u2019m outgoing, charismatic, etc. etc. But I\u2019m not here to brag. I\u2019m here to explain how I became this way, or more so, the event that changed my whole outlook on life. For most of my years, I was very antisocial, shy, nervous. I had no social skills, any jokes I tried were seen as \u2018unfunny\u2019. I had no real friends. I had been abused physically and verbally as a small child, throughout all of elementary, by a drug addicted family member, so it left mental scars which honestly still haven\u2019t fully healed. I had to \u2018grow up\u2019 fast, in comparison to the rest of my grade. I always felt isolated. Did well in school, never caused problems, but just didn\u2019t fit in. \n\nOne day, I had decided that enough was enough. I had been in a depressed state for months on end, crying myself to sleep. The loneliness had settled in and created a void. My social awkwardness was ruining my life. \u201cWhat kind of world wants a fuck up like me? Nobody likes me\u201d. That was the only thought that went through my mind. I decided to end it all. I grabbed a skip-rope, tied it up in my closet, and hung myself. I\u2019m not sure how long I was hung up, but I faded out of consciousness. I woke up on the floor of my closet not long after. The rope had snapped under my weight. I was overweight at the time, which was another reason for my low confidence. But, as I sat there, I realized I had almost just died. Been gone. A nobody. I wouldn\u2019t have been remembered for long by anyone outside of my family. I would\u2019ve just been known as \u201cthat weird kid who killed himself\u201d by my peers. I sat there and really introspected on my life. I wanted to know what truly caused my loneliness. Then, I had an epiphany. It was me.\n\n\nIt was always me. I was the shy one. I was the one not picking up on social cues. I was the one who didn\u2019t fit it, not because of some predetermined factor, but because of how I acted and presented myself. The reason for my poor social skills was completely due to the fear of TRYING to improve. So, that night, as I sat in my closet, a red mark bright around my neck, I decided to change. I decided that if life isn\u2019t worth living, I would make it worth living. Although the mindset change was \u2018overnight\u2019, so to speak, the results weren\u2019t. It took time. First, I was more outwardly positive. Smiled more. Complained less. I started talking to people I wouldn\u2019t normally talk to. Popular people, older people, etc. I\u2019d strike up a conversation with anyone around. It wasn\u2019t easy, my heart raced every conversation. I felt like I\u2019d pass out. But you know what to me, was even harder than breaking out of my shell? Dying and it hardly impacting anyone. I wanted to matter. \nBefore I knew it, without even noticing until far into it, I was making friends. Real friends. Not just people who\u2019d hang out with at school or work and never talk outside of that. I made friends who genuinely cared about me. People who\u2019d notice if I was less cheery than usual. People who would be devastated if anything happened to me. Within a year, I went from nobody knowing I existed, to being the guy that almost EVERYONE knows. I learned how to talk to different people. Small little tips and tricks for every situation, based on repeated trail, error, trail, error, trail, error, until success. Yes, there were difficult times. Sharing my emotions with people is still hard. I cried openly to my friends for the first time last summer. Sat down on a hill after work and just cried, and cried. Before, I would\u2019ve died of embarrassment to cry in front of anyone. Now, I feel safe, and secure, being able to show how I\u2019m feeling to people who care about me. \n\n\nIf I can give you any advice, that I know you\u2019d listen to, I\u2019d tell you to try to be social. Get out of your comfort zone. The funny thing about comfort zones is they grow the more you test their boundaries. Don\u2019t let the failures set you back at all. The more time socializing with people, the better. Don\u2019t let the loneliness take hold. Don\u2019t make what changes your life be something you\u2019ll regret for the rest of it, like me. Don\u2019t try to hurt yourself. Life is about bettering yourself, and if you\u2019re in this subreddit? Congrats. You\u2019re already on your way to improving. You\u2019re showing the will to change. \nAnyone can make friends. Anyone can find people to surround themselves with that truly care. Life does get better, but only once you start taking those first steps. It gets easier.\nToday, I have almost no social awkwardness (except perhaps telling a joke a little too dark here and there). Part of my job is now being in charge of guest experience personally, and I\u2019m in a position of authority at work. I would have never dreamed of having the courage to ever work a job like this years ago. If I can do it, anyone can. I\u2019m not special by any means. Just, do me a favour, and try. It\u2019s the world that\u2019s missing out on you, not the other way around. Remember that. I know you\u2019ll make the world a better place, just by contributing your thoughts and ideas to whoever you\u2019d like, instead of nobody. I believe in you, and I always will.\n~J\n\nTL;DR- I was shy, anxious, and lonely. Tried suicide. Failed and decided to change my life. If I could turn that around, so can you. I believe it.",

        "original": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the best place to post this, butI have really been struggling with this, and I could definitely use some advice. Sorry if it\u2019s long, but I just want to describe my situation the best I can. Also, I really apologize if this is hard to follow. I had a lot of thoughts and it was pretty hard to organize them, so I hope you just bear with me. I also really hope you take some time to try and help me out :)\n\nTL;DR: I feel like I missed a lesson on how to deal with your feelings toward girls. For some reason, it doesn\u2019t feel right for me to express my interest in girls, whether it be with the girl directly or even just telling my friends. \n\nI [17 m] have never been in a relationship with a girl. The closest I\u2019ve ever been was in middle school, when I became good friends with a girl, but failed to capitalize on the hints she was dropping to me. \n\nFor some reason, it just feels weird for me to show my interest in girls. I mean, when I\u2019m with my friends and we see a hot girl, we\u2019ll make comments about her and stuff, but I never reveal my emotions about girls. I don\u2019t know why, but it just doesn\u2019t feel right to tell a girl I like her, or even tell someone else I like her. I think it is partly due to me being scared of committing to speaking my emotions, and not getting the choice to take back what I said, but I am not sure. \n\nI\u2019ve had a few crushes through the years, but I\u2019ve never done anything about them. I was never the one to take action; I would just wait for things to happen. For example, in middle school, I liked a girl. Rather than talking to her and asking her out like a normal person would do, I\u2019d pretend I didn\u2019t notice her. I\u2019d keep an eye on her to see if she would stare at me or something, and I\u2019d try and look for all the signs of her liking me. At the time, my best friend was cousins with her friend. She started hanging out with my friend\u2019s cousin more, and in turn, the four of us became really good friends. Looking back at it, I realized I had the opportunity, but I failed to realize she might\u2019ve liked me back. And so, nothing came of it and i missed my chance with her, because regardless of how close we were, I never told her how I felt. \n\nThat was in middle school, so I\u2019ve realized the mistakes I made. When the same middle school crush got a boyfriend, I promised myself to never wait on a girl again. \n\nWell, I broke my promise. When the same girl became single a couple years later, we weren\u2019t as good of friends yet I still liked her. I didn\u2019t try talking to her ever, and I hid my feelings about her from everyone. It was just day after day of me observing whether or not she liked me. And even if I was confident that she might have some interest, I still did nothing about it, and she got another boyfriend. \n\nI eventually moved on from this girl. It took a while, but I realized that I liked her for too long without telling her that it wasn\u2019t worth it anymore. \n\nI don\u2019t really understand how to talk to girls. I mean, I have friends that are girls, but when I have romantic interest in one, I don\u2019t really know how to act around her. I look at other guys and see how they deal with their crushes. I notice that they are way more open and straightforward about it than me. They are able to let people know about their feelings. They\u2019re able to start talking to the girl without feeling awkward or embarrassed. They don\u2019t do things like I do. \n\nWhen I am attracted to someone, I refuse to make eye contact and basically pretend like they don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s like, I want a girlfriend, but I don\u2019t want to take the steps to get one (or I don\u2019t know how). \n\nThere\u2019s a foreign exchange student at my school who I think is cute. I\u2019ve noticed her for a couple months, and I\u2019m beginning to get annoyed with just waiting for something to happen, when realistically nothing will. The fact that she is a foreign exchange student is a good and bad thing. It\u2019s a good thing because she\u2019s a new person to me. I\u2019ve known pretty much everyone else at my school since first grade. It\u2019s also good because if things go bad with her, I\u2019ll never see her again. It\u2019s not a good thing because she is moving back to Germany in probably around 5 months, so even if things go well, we\u2019ll be separated. I\u2019ve combined this excuse along with my lack of confidence and knowledge, to keep me from talking to her. I texted her once, but that\u2019s pretty much the only interaction we had. \n\nI\u2019ve asked for advice about this girl before. Every response I\u2019ve gotten is something like \u201ctalk to her\u201d, as if I was dumb because of how obvious the answer was. \n\nThis made me realize that for whatever reason, I\u2019m different from other guys about expressing my feelings about girls. I really don\u2019t want to sound entitled, or like I\u2019m special because I have a problem talking to girls or anything, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think I view things the same way, and it sucks. Because again, I want to get to know this girl, and when I play out \u201cwhat could be\u201d in my head, I like it, but I don\u2019t want to/know how to take the steps to do so. \n\nAs I\u2019ve become more aware of my fear of admitting my feelings, I\u2019ve gotten a bit better. I mean, I at least got the courage to text her that one time. I did, however, fail to keep the conversation going. I had a chance to show her I was at least somewhat interested, and I didn\u2019t take it. At least I\u2019m becoming aware of these chances though. \n\nI\u2019ve been telling myself to talk to her the next chance I get. But there are so many things that are holding me back that shouldn\u2019t be. \n\nFor one thing, I know I shouldn\u2019t be affected by it, but other people\u2019s opinions are holding me back. Mainly because I don\u2019t want other people to be involved in my relationships, which will probably happen because I go to a small school. Also because many people think it\u2019s a bad idea to date a foreign exchange student. My friend dated one last year, and many people have called him dumb for getting so close to her because they had to be separated. \n\nAnother thing I feel is holding me back from talking to her is the fact that I don\u2019t know how. Let\u2019s say I see her alone with no one around, so the people issue I just described isn\u2019t a problem. I could walk up to her, but no matter what I say, it just wouldn\u2019t feel organic. No matter if I said something like \u201cHows it going?\u201d or \u201cI just had to let you know I think you\u2019re cute\u201d it would just seem weird, because I\u2019m not close to her at all, but we\u2019re not strangers either. I don\u2019t know, I just feel like it would be weird for her if I all of a sudden started talking to her. \n\nI haven\u2019t told anyone how I feel about her. My friend\u2019s girlfriend is good friends with her, so I have a connection there, but I still am very reluctant to share my feelings to even my closest friends. In fact, I\u2019ve never told my friends about any of my current crushes. Maybe it\u2019s the feeling that if I tell them, they\u2019ll push me to do something I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for. \n\nOne of my friends has been really bummed out because he doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend. I always try to give him advice and stuff, and I tell him I don\u2019t have a girlfriend either. However, he tells me I could get any girl that I want, but that I\u2019m too much of a bitch to talk to any. And he\u2019s right in a way. I do believe that if I knew how to talk to girls and express my emotions, I\u2019d be able to get most girls that I know. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely about me being a bitch. I usually don\u2019t have trouble with speaking to people, but I just have trouble figuring out what to say. If I was told to go ask a hot girl a question just for the sake of getting an answer, I could probably do it no problem with no anxiety whatsoever. But if I was told to approach a hot girl to get her number or something, I wouldn\u2019t really know how to do it. I\u2019d probably tell her she\u2019s cute and just ask her for her number, but after we depart, I don\u2019t know what I would do. If the next day I started texting her, I wouldn\u2019t know what we would talk about or how to start the conversation. \n\nEven this post seems like an example of how I am different when it comes to girls. Realistically, me and this foreign exchange student don\u2019t really know each other at all, yet I just wrote a whole bunch about her, and I\u2019ve been contemplating what to do about my feelings for her for over a month. I imagine most other guys, with the same feelings towards her as me, would\u2019ve talked to her a month ago and at least somewhat hinted their interest.  Yet I\u2019ve done relatively nothing. \n\nI\u2019m just tired of not understanding how to talk to girls. I don\u2019t think my confidence is entirely the issue, nor do I think it\u2019s my appearance or personality. I just feel like I missed out on a lesson where everyone else learned what to do when they have feelings for a girl. \n\nIf you read all of that, I really appreciate it, and I hope it wasn\u2019t too much of a mess. If you could give me any advice, even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s great, it would really help me. ",

        "original": "I was the quiet girl in school. I was also the one with crippling anxiety and depression. I was no stranger to backhanded compliments and people (even teachers) believing I genuinely could not speak. Well, I could. I just chose not to because I was afraid of drawing attention to myself, and plus, I didn\u2019t have proper social skills to understand what was appropriate to say in certain situations. I had no real friends. And yes, it was my fault, because I never bothered to talk to anyone, and I pushed away anyone that got too close. I was afraid of getting hurt, but I only hurt myself by choosing to stay silent.\n\nTomorrow is my 18th birthday, and last week, I learned to talk. I learned to initiate conversations on my own without mommy pushing me to \u201cgo over there and make friends.\u201d\n\nI started driving school the beginning of this month. It was the first time I\u2019d been in anything close to a public school setting in years. I\u2019d been a hermit for at least 5 years prior to this month. I wasn\u2019t nervous about being in public, because I felt like it was time to start becoming independent and be a member of society. I was just nervous about not being able to \u201cfit in\u201d because of my lack of social skills and inability to hold a conversation. \n\nI\u2019m in a class of 20. We\u2019re all teens. The first week, I was learning new names and matching them to faces. Some made groups of friends and others were already friends before enrolling. I sit in the back row with 2 other teens at my table so I can observe the class. At the end of the first day, my teacher asked me how it was, and I stayed silent until I found the courage to respond to him, and I said, \u201cIt was fine. I\u2019m more of an observer, you might not get a lot out of me.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know that was a lie.\n\nThe second week came around and I watched a girl solve a Rubix cube in two minutes flat. The next day, I bet her a dollar if she could do it in one minute and 45 seconds. I was surprised that I actually asked her. Normally we just sat and waited in silence until class started since we are usually the firsts to arrive. She smiled at me and won the bet, and we eventually got to talking more often about our lives and such. \n\nShe\u2019s gay like me, it turns out. And she loves to talk about her girlfriend. Now we talk every day, and we walked to the convenience store together yesterday and were complaining about our classmates while laughing. Just so happens that we have a lot in common! I am much more talkative in class and I just might be sad once it\u2019s over. \n\nI have a friend after not having one for. . .ever? And it\u2019s all because I developed enough social skills to speak. Please please, if you are afraid to speak because you think you may not fit in, I want you to try. Try it slow. Say hi to someone you think you could get along with. See where it goes. If it goes good, that\u2019s great! If not, pick yourself up and try again. You have nothing to lose. \n\nNever allow fear to hold you back. Maybe it\u2019s not fear. Maybe it\u2019s just your lack of skills. But either way, if you try, you will improve, and you may find yourself enjoying things. I used to be miserable because I was too scared to speak, thinking I would say something dumb or people would hate me. Now I\u2019m finally able to fit in because I found my courage. It was never other people disliking me; it was my own fear and unwillingness to try that prevented me. \n\nI still need to work on my mumbling and pausing for too long, but I\u2019ll get there. And so will you. If we all just try, we can make it. So please, if you\u2019re going to school tomorrow, say hi to a classmate. If you\u2019re going to work, ask your coworker how their day has been. \n\nTalk. Please talk. Your social skills may thank you for it.\n\n\n",

I used to make friends with coworkers but now I work at a job where my only coworkers are 18-19 and my boss who is 45 and also my boss. I have a bf and do know his friends but I\u2019m not really friends with them. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to meet new women to be friends with without seeming creepy or desperate. There\u2019s also not really anything to do where I live now. I used to go out for drinks with friends or we would go to clubs and occasionally each other\u2019s houses. But this town I\u2019m in now has fast food places and grocery stores and that\u2019s it. What do I do??? How do I meet people?? My bf is constantly texting and talking to his friends and hanging out with them and I just have no one. \nEdit to add: I\u2019m extremely introverted and awkward as well as super depressed and stuck dwelling on the past. I used to have a very large social circle and now I have no one. The city I live in doesn\u2019t really have many social things to go do. There\u2019s a gym sure but I\u2019m definitely not comfortable enough there to ever speak to anyone. And I can\u2019t get a dog because my bf and roommate are against it. I don\u2019t enjoy sports and I\u2019m not artsy nor do I enjoy trying to be. I enjoy music and I used to work for a nightclub doing social media promo and had a lot of fun doing that but there\u2019s nothing around here like that. Not even live music venues for local music. And I\u2019m relatively poor so I can\u2019t go out and take dance classes or really any classes. Also can\u2019t download things like bumble for friends or get on any kind of website to meet friends because it would cause my bf to worry (not that I think there\u2019s anything wrong with that I\u2019d be worried too if the situation were reversed since that\u2019s how most people cheat nowadays).",

They never allowed me to do stuff that I really wanted and when I turned 18 I decided it was best to take a break from them and move somewhere else. Since then I've started developing a more strong desire for things I want. Before I used to suppress the wanting feeling because I knew my parents weren't going to be supportive. \n\nNow I have this huge disappointment in me because I could have been living a different life if my parents weren't so overprotective. At the age of 10 I was scouted to be a professional football/soccer player but my parents refused the offer. They told me \"it'll be very hard to be accepted and to play into their leagues\". This was their excuse for most things. I left the house after I turned 18 and they tried to let me stay in their house, with the same excuse.\n\nI want to achieve good things but I always have this burning idea in my mind \"it'll be hard\" or \"you won't reach it\" and I can't seem to get rid of it.

        "title": "Deep-rooted fear of showing interest / reaching out / complimenting people",
        "original": "So, I've grown to recognize that there are some things working against me but above all it's my own self-sabotage hurting me. I'm a naturally introverted, independent person as I've grown to figure out, but I feel like I take that aspect a little too far in my life. I simply prefer to do things my own way, but I've gotten myself to a point where I actively fear and avoid reaching out to others -- friends, acquaintances/classmates, strangers, even teachers and my own parents.\n\nBefore I go any further, some context: I'm a 16 year old American male. Currently a junior in HS at a boarding school that I just started attending this year.\n\nSome of my friends say that what's holding me back is that I fade into the background too often. I'm basically never the center of attention and I often just join the background in large group situations. I think I have a naturally quiet voice even when I feel like I'm speaking normally, which often makes me not talk because people mishear and often ask me to repeat myself if I'm acknowledged at all. I have the occasional flash of confidence where I'm much more social in a situation, but this occurs in specific situations (like late-night group study sessions where I'm supposed to actually be focused on something else) and I regress back to the mean the next day.\n\nFor the most part, the only reason I have friends is that I'm in the right places at the right time and they gradually include me / reach out. It takes me too long to be comfortable around people, I'd say. What scares me is that I feel like it's only going to get harder to make friends as I grow. I know I'll go to a college that's much bigger than the campus I'm on now, and then it's into the anonymous \"real world.\" \n\nI think there's some important background here. Maybe my inability to reach out is a manifestation of my fear of vulnerability. I'm mainly limited by this feeling that people don't want to be bothered combined with some insecurity on my part. If I go out with three or four people, I can stay in the background when I want and still interject when I want, so it's the most balanced social situation for me. One-on-one situations worry me somewhat because suddenly all the pressure is on me, even if it's for one person. If I go a few minutes without saying anything, it's a much more noticeable awkwardness.\n\nPeople who know me say I'm a much nicer person than I let on. I'm comfortable just being there for people and listening to their problems, but I come off slightly aloof, cold, maybe awkward/timid to people who don't know me. \n\nI've struggled through classes on my own this semester and I haven't been to a teacher's office hours for extra help a single time. Basically, asking for help is a last resort. My grades are mostly As, but I'm skating by on natural intelligence at a school where that's not supposed to happen (most of my classmates are struggling for Bs) and that's something that I can't do later even if I somehow get away with it now. \n\nHere's what I think lead me here. In sixth grade, I was bullied pretty badly to the point where I switched schools. I was overweight back then and very immature, and I tried too hard to be accepted. I was the dude who girls asked out as a joke, and my direct attempts to socialize were met with open rejection. \n\nSince then, I've changed many things. I'm no longer overweight, and I'm better looking. I'm just solidly average-looking now (peak of the bell curve, you know. I blend into the crowd perfectly, no features stand out, just a regular skinny guy) and I gained a solid understanding of social cues to the extent of being oversensitive. I've thought people hated me who didn't even know who I was before. \n\nThis post isn't motivated by any particular story, but I'll just leave an example. I decided to talk to a girl who I kinda liked. She seemed pretty friendly and complimented me several times. I didn't jump to assume interest there, but it was kinda like... I haven't actually programmed the path in my head where things don't go wrong. I just noticed throughout the conversation that she was leading it and I was coming off as the uninterested party, which isn't the way it should work. Anyway, I just know I'm a warmer person than what I come across as, but I need to show that I actually value people's company even if I am pretty introverted. \n\nI started working out a month or so ago and I also started trying to build a habit of meditation. These things will help me gradually shift my mindset, but I really feel like I need a big paradigm shift where I just let go and say \"fuck it.\" My subconscious mind wants me to, but my conscious mind is powerful enough to rationalize me out of doing anything. I have friends that are much more... visually unappealing than I am (even if I'm not the best looking, just being brutally honest) who don't face the same crippling hesitations talking to people.",

I was bullied, was unpopular, and obviously out of shape back then, but I wasn't socially or generally stupid. I understood she had lost some sort of dare and I didn't like the idea of being used in such a subhuman way. So I decided to mess with her a bit, grabbed her arm, and said \"Hey, interested huh? Sit down, let's chat for a bit\" hoping to have some fun at her expense. She actually had the audacity to break character and mansplain to me that she didn't really mean it and she was just made to do it. I was so intensely frustrated. I knew I was in a horrible bind. I did not predict she would take me seriously because she was quite unattractive by anyone's standards, and if I were to deny my own roleplay it could have been spun as last minute denial to spare my own \"hurt desperate feelings\". I was trapped by her social ignorance and my extremely low social ranking, which apparently was so bad that she was confident enough to assume I was infatuated despite the fact that she was very plain and most girls would be very insecure about that during that age. My attempt at getting in a little laugh just to have her feel some modicum of discomfort ended up with me shooting myself in the foot. I should have known better. I should have just said \"I know you're just messing around, it's not funny, don't use me as a punishment. I'm a person just like you, go sit down.\"\n\nI've long since forgotten her name, but I still remember that look of ignorant and indignant pity on her face, and the feeling of utter hopelessness as I mentally traced though the possible social actions I could take and come up empty.",

I was doing awfully at school, and decided that it wasn't worth going to school to get basically a participation award. In Australia, most universities provide alternate entrance programs (usually designed for people who didn't get a good enough ATAR). I decided I would drop out, and enter into my local university's entrance program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend unfortunately broke up with me (this is for a second time now), and I want to completely move on with her, but I don't want to date anytime soon as I want to get a grip on myself.

I literally know no one, and I'm going to be the youngest person there as well (only a few years difference at most). I'm not very good at socialising - I spent most of my highschool years by myself until I found a group in Year 10 (this is the group I had until recently).

In primary school I had one best friend and we would go out a lot, often we would go to the school football field and play there for hours upon hours every day. After we grew up a little my best friend started to change, going out with the \"cool kids\" and sometimes even ignoring me for the sake of coolness. We kind of separated and when the PS4 console got released I got it for christmas and one of my classmates thought it was really cool so we got to my place a lot and played new games for hours. I felt like they were using me and I was right, it went on for 2 years, I didn't bother. Even when 4 or 5 of us were at my house, I still didn't talk much and they would'nt mind but over time even those friendships fell apart just because I would'nt socialise, didn't know what to say in almost any situation from talking to acquaintances to family members... Many times when some of my friends called me to go out I would refuse just so I could stay home in my comfort zone and that comfort zone ruined my life.\n\nI know that it is all my fault my friends abandoned me, but I can't really socialise and I don't know why. My dad has ptsd and isn't a very talkative person himself but all of his friends like him and he makes everyone laugh all the time. \n\nNow I'm in my second year of highschool and in a class of 20 I have zero friends. A few months before the start of highschool I was hyped for meeting new people and potential friends, but all that went down the drain because I wanted to fit in by acting \"cool\",  since most of my new classmates were cool and joked around with everything and making fun of everyone, and that's where I suck, being made fun of is something I couldn't bear back then and would \"fight back\" with cringy words and phrases. So they started to make even more fun of me and then, as a defense mechanism, I stopped talking again and there was no way out, it was done. Now I'm known in my class as the quiet kid and an \"emotionless\" kid because apparently I don't express my emotions enough, but it's the exact opposite, I am really emotional and scared of getting hurt and being made fun of. I have one old friend in my class that is the only person I can talk to that kind of has empathy towards me, but everytime he gets a chance he makes fun of me and makes the whole class laugh, since he is the funny kid in our class, while I sit back and try not to make eye contact with anyone so I wouldn't see their laughing faces and think of ways to end my life and put myself out of my misery. \n\nCurrently I go out maybe once a month and it's with my \"friend\" I mentioned at the beggining, lets call him Bruce. Bruce and I have a lot in common, we like video games, programming, procrastinating, memes, etc. But when it comes to socialising I don't know how I mess up every time, we talk and all I can think of to say is cringy meme references and gaming related stuff. I want to talk to Bruce about life and more deep things but he always repliess sarcastically so I stopped doing that. And now I have noone except my family to talk to, don't know how and where to make friends since I live in a kind of small city and I know most of the people in my area(I already tried sports but I can't train anymore since my back is messed up).

I hate myself based off the way that I look and girls always talk about guys I know, and say they\u2019re cute and it makes me upset because I literally eat one meal a day and exercise everyday but still nobody cares about me or thinks I\u2019m cute. The thing that makes me upset is that men/ boys are expected to make the first move this is an issue because I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m too ugly to date or be attracted to. And the only people who thrive in this system are people who are confident and secure. And here\u2019s the thing I derive my security and value from the validation and praise of others which basically means if I don\u2019t have someone that likes me ever I\u2019ll never be confident. I don\u2019t have the mental capacity to be alone I don\u2019t Value myself at all. I can\u2019t deal with freedom and I would literally give up my free will to somebody if it meant they could take my loneliness away. I can\u2019t form my own opinions. I resent being around family because I don\u2019t want to be loved by someone related to me and I\u2019d rather be with someone else than near them.  People say I\u2019m average looking but I feel like I\u2019m ugly. I\u2019m not smart I just get all A\u2019s because i stress out and work myself half to death to take my mind off of stuff. I can\u2019t even go outside anymore because I get depressed seeing couples out on the street. I can\u2019t look at Reddit too long because all the \u201cmy girlfriend made me this or drew me this\u201d posts I can\u2019t even watch tv or read books with romance as a subplot because it just makes me upset with how lonely I am. I don\u2019t want to be trapped alone with myself anymore. I don\u2019t need constant attention or affection but the concept of being loved by someone is enough to make me be a less pitiful person. But since I\u2019m not handsome or confident and need someone else to boost my confidence I can\u2019t talk to girls which means I\u2019m just alone. Since I have a music page on Instagram that I HAVE to check on everyday I get depressed because I see all these girls and relationships neither of which I think I can have. I know I\u2019m not owed anything and the only person I hate in this situation is me. I just wanna be loved but my situation makes it impossible. I haven\u2019t even seen a girl my age since middle school and I\u2019m going to an all Male school I have to complete. I\u2019m not sure my social skills is gonna get better in college either because I\u2019d just be in the corner sweating at a party and I\u2019d be too worried about flunking my classes to go anyhow.

I get weirdly antisocial when I listen to music and tend to zone off sometimes in thought, but I can genuinely say that I have more energy, and I am typically more positive and goofy than other people. I have an overly loud voice and I am known to voice my opinions and have arguments with people over things that I find important or funny. I give my all for my friends. I offer them everything I have. Everybody knows me and I was once the big talk of the 300 population school because I'm funny and outgoing. I don't know why people take advantage of me then. No matter how much I bring it up or ask people to do something about it, I am also never in any yearbook or social pictures. I never get invited to anything unless I'm lucky enough that somebody remembers me in the instant things are planned. It doesn't help that my huge friend group plans everything in thirty seconds, but still. It's frustrating how brushed off to the side I am. I've always been the class clown, and I always strive to love others. Even the other day I held hands and snuggled with a girl for easily 5 hours at a friend group activity. She hasn't really talked to me much since and it was over a week ago. The girl is known for doing the same thing with other people frequently, but still I  wasn't trying to date her, I just wanted someone to snuggle with. I just got out of an on/off two-year relationship with a really sweet girl who I am still friends with. I told her I wanted to just date around and not feel stressed to be with one person. That way I can make friends and have fun. I'm not doing anything wrong anywhere I don't think. I'm a very unique person I'd like to think. I am, however, very big on straying from social conformities. I think beauty is relative and people shouldn't have to try to be anybody else's good image, ya know?

I'm extremely lonely and it's killing me. I literally have 0 friends. All my lacrosse buddies went to different schools.\n\n97% of students at my school live in the dorms, I don't. I feel that this puts me at a massive disadvantage for meeting new people. Everyone that I ask for help just says, 'hang out in the dorms.' My school is very strict about strangers in dorm halls. If you don't live in it, you can't enter without a paper signed by someone in that dorm. \n\nSo right now, here is an average day for me. Wake up at 7 a.m. Leave at 8 and drive to school.

        "original": "Hello everyone! I\u2019d like to share a personal story with you. Long ago, I (22M) used to be very introverted. I lived that way for most of my life, until a pivotal moment occurred that would change me forever. I went to a high school dance with some friends and noticed how most of us were dotted around the perimeter of the dance floor or leaning against the walls. I\u2019m sure you know that feeling, looking into the crowd of people and wondering where you belonged. After a considerable period of time, I got fed up with this complacency. I recognized that we won\u2019t be young kids forever, so I challenged myself, I couldn\u2019t leave without dancing with at least three girls. Conveniently,  a friend wanted to go up to a girl but he was too shy, so I dragged him up to her and they just started talking. It was natural. Before I knew it, I was dancing with her friend as he danced with her. I won\u2019t lie, it was easier to push someone to do it rather than doing it for myself. It was a start though. \n\nAfter that ended, he headed back for the dreaded wall. I encouraged him to come with me onto the dance floor, but he didn\u2019t feel comfortable. This was the pivotal moment. My introverted ass realized that my next decision would likely pave the path for years to come, and it did. I decided to go into the crowd. I walked out of it a new man. Honestly, life had changed. As a sixteen year old, it blew my mind that I went from sticking to myself to dancing with the most popular girls in school, even though I couldn\u2019t dance! \n\nFast forward to today. Since that night, I\u2019ve taken public speaking classes in high school and I also got an award for being the best orator, I\u2019ve also become president of Model UN and two foreign language clubs during college. Low key, that\u2019s nothing to brag about lol, but as a former introvert, I\u2019m super proud of it. What\u2019s great is this is normal life for me. I\u2019m not shocked at the results, because I know exactly how I got here: embracing the discomfort. \n\nIt\u2019s important to remind ourselves that a majority of the good things in life tend to lie beyond our comfort zone. Here\u2019s the takeaway: **as long as you live behind your comfort zone, you\u2019re destined to live beneath your comfort zone.** Let\u2019s venture out there, if you\u2019re not feeling anxious then you\u2019re not testing yourself. I\u2019ve made a habit out of conversing with at least one stranger every time I go out. That habit keeps me sharp. \n\nIn closing, I want to call out to you guys. Join me! Walk onto the dance floor. Stride confidently into the unknown. You\u2019ll come out of it a stronger person. You don\u2019t have to change, but simply be ready for action when the situation arises. You don\u2019t want to find yourself walking home in regret. Don\u2019t miss another connection. If you want something, reach out and take it. It\u2019s within our power no matter how introverted we are. \n\nThanks! ",

        "original": "Hey, need some advice on a recent situation. In one of my classes this kid has been messing with me and I\u2019m worried people are starting to think I get bullied or something. I don\u2019t like it when people pity me and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m losing respect by it seemingly be like I get bullied. I tend to ignore the situation or respond back jokingly as the teases usually come in a joking manner, so I\u2019m also concerned if people think I\u2019m a pushover. I can\u2019t go around beating this kid up as the school I go to deals with these things very harshly and it\u2019s a private school so I don\u2019t want to be wasting my parents money. I ended up asking a friend about the situation and he said that he doesn\u2019t think I get bullied and I wouldn\u2019t seem like the kind of person to get bullied as I really don\u2019t do enough to warrant bullying. Should I just go along with this statement and assume everyone thinks like this? Am I really overthinking this whole situation? How do I get him to stop without violence, I talked to the kid messing with me and he said we\u2019re chill (a lot of people say my reactions are funny idk this might be related to it). So how do I respond, do I just ignore it until it goes away? \n\nSide note: I\u2019ve also had this fear that this would lead to girls viewing me as weaker as I\u2019m not really able to defend myself in front of this kid. So it might affect my chances of getting dates lol. I know it\u2019s pretty irrational in all honesty but I can\u2019t shake the feeling. \n\nAnother side note: I don\u2019t get bullied and for the most part people respect me and my wishes, I\u2019m not the most assertive person but people don\u2019t really have a reason to disrespect me and when they do I stand my ground. I\u2019ve got friends etc so there isn\u2019t anything there either.\n\nThanks for letting me vent lol",

        "original": "My roommates [26m] [26m] [27m] [28m] and I [24f] threw a party last weekend, and none of my friends showed up. The party was Oscar themed and guests were encouraged to dress up. We planned the party a month ahead of time and I bought decorations, food, and alcohol in preparation. I spent the entire day cleaning and decorating for the party the day of. \n\nI had invited all my friends from work, as well as friends from college. I sent the invites out weeks ahead of time, with reminders as it got closer. It was around 20 people total. I also encouraged them to bring friends or significant others. At least 10 confirmed on the FB invite, and a few told me they were coming and possibly bringing their friends. Based on that information, I told my roommates that I had at least 5-10 friends coming. \n\nAn hour into the party, most of my roommate\u2019s friends had arrived (around 13 people) but I hadn\u2019t heard from any of mine. I decided to wait a little longer, and then waited for the next 4 hours hoping they were just showing up late. I tried to enjoy the party, and mingled with my roommates friends, but by midnight I realized none of my friends were going to show. I tried really, really hard not to think about it and enjoy my night, but after drinking a few beers I found myself holding back tears. \n\nThey received reminders the day before and the day of the party, so I know they didn\u2019t miss any notifications. Maybe I should have texted them during the party to ask where they were, but I felt too embarrassed. \n\nI thought my coworkers would say something to me about the party on Monday, but no one said anything. I never received any messages either. \n\nI don\u2019t hang out with my friends consistently, but I see my coworkers at work and get lunch with them most days. A few of them have been to my house before, and I definitely considered them my friends. \n\nMy confidence took a huge hit that night, and I feel so embarrassed about the whole thing. It\u2019s only been a few days since the party, but I\u2019m feeling incredibly low and I can\u2019t get over it. I find myself questioning everything about my life. Are these people even my friends? Am I not a likable person? Why didn\u2019t they care enough to send a message or mention it on Monday? What am I doing wrong? \n\nI\u2019ve thought about confronting them, but it would make me feel worse if they got uncomfortable. I also don\u2019t want them hanging out with me out of pity. \n\nTLDR; I invited friends and coworkers to a party with plenty of notice and reminders, but no one showed up even after telling me they were coming. I feel embarrassed and sad and I can\u2019t figure out why no one came. \n\nUPDATE: I\u2019m at work today and slowly reading through all the comments. Your responses have lifted me, thank you for all the support. I\u2019m taking the time to reflect on myself and then I\u2019ll start working towards forming new and genuine relationships.\n\nMy friends might not have shown up that night, but I\u2019m blown away by all the advice and understanding I\u2019ve received from strangers on the internet. If anyone has tips on how to start forming meaningful friendships, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. \n\nUPDATE 2: \nThings I\u2019ve learned since posting this: \n\n1. Coworkers are not friends. As much as I\u2019d like this to be false, this was a pretty consistent theme throughout the comments.\n\n2. An Oscar themed party does not sound fun to a lot of people. I love parties with themes, but I read dozens of comments from people stating that they would not have attended such an elaborate party. For those asking, the party was held on a Saturday.\n\n3. I should have been more aware of my relationship with these people in the first place. I assumed we were friends without fully considering how they might feel about me. \n\n4. The internet can be a really kind place in the right setting. I appreciate every comment and I\u2019m in the process of reading all of them. \n\n5. They\u2019re still assholes for telling me they were coming and then not showing up. Dozens of commenters said they\u2019ve experienced this as well. \n\nI did ask a few of my coworkers how their weekends were, without bringing up the party directly. I got the responses I was expecting, many along the lines of \n\u201cOh yeah sorry about the party by the way, I got off work and was way too tired to go\u201d \n\u201cSorry, it was my best friends birthday that night\u201d\n\n",

I tried to make a list of issues I face. It is kind of disjointed but hopefully It gives you an idea of my troubles.\n\nSocial Issues:\n\n* When I am talking to people and they seem disinterested or I start to drone on I will sometimes cut myself of or drone off as I am ending my statement.\n* Sometimes I will be nervous and say a word wrong or even the wrong word entirely in conversation. I was in a meeting with my professor the other day about a project I am directing and accidentally referred to the client as the wrong name twice,\n* I will often ask people to hang or try to start a conversation and they will be nice but dismissive. It may be in my head but I can almost tell in those moments that they think I am awkward or a loser. I have a wide variety of interests and think I am really fun to be around if people get to know me. \n* When I goto my film club meetings or post in our group chat I often feel like the odd man out. I actually get pretty decent rolls in our projects don't think anyone dislikes me but worry I am one of those kids who people think is nice but wouldn't wan to hang with outside of a work setting. I know everyone kind of has their own friend groups but it seems like even freshman I know are getting involved in social groups and making friends faster than me. A lot of these new group members are really beautiful women and I would love to talk to them but they are always hanging with the head of the club and that clique. \n* I desperately want to join the popular clique of my film school. I think I am generally well liked but feel that if they knew what I had to offer and I could communicate better I may be able to be. I have a lot of friends but those involved in my major are more like aquintences. This makes me feel that they may not want to work with me or something. \n* I know a lot of this may be in my head which is infinitely more frustrating since I am being crippled by issues that aren't even real. I honestly can't tell tho. I just wish I could die and wake up in a charming and confident persons body.\n* I used to feel like I was confident and charming and had a lot of friends my freshman year but after a bad breakup and losing friends due to my own emotional outbursts I have withdrawn into myself. I wish I had a significant other or a friend with the same issues. I don't tho. I have a bunch of friends and none of them understand and It is killing me.\n\nPhysical Issues:\n\n* I have a lazy eye. Not the most noticeable thing in the world but it is really hard not to be nervous about it constantly and it wanders more when I am drunk or high (when is which I feel most comfortable being goofy or social)\n* I sometimes sit weird. I used to sit oddly all the time but have gotten a hang of it pretty well. Nevertheless I am constantly checking my posture an trying to make sure I dont look odd.\n* I look really young. I probably look about 17 but am 20 and a junior in college. This really doesn't help with trying to talk to girls. I sometimes feel like no woman could ever be attracted to me when there are much more masculine and older looking dudes everywhere here in college.\n* I will see pictures of myself and pictures of my friends taken by the same person in the same situation and I will just look so much worse than them. Perhaps I have body dysmorphia or perhaps I really am just unappealing. I will post a few pictures of myself and let you guys judge that. If any women my age are on the sub I would love their honest opinion on whether they could ever find me attractive.  \n* As you can sense I have really low self esteem and just want to be as confident in my physical form as others. But I don't want it to be fake or based on people trying to make me feel good. I am all about self improvement and will do anything I need to do to accomplish my goals\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI constantly am checking to see what could be wrong with me to be the root of all of these issues. I have diagnosed depression and OCD. I would really love to hear if any of you deal with these things or have advice for me.

The other guy ended up leaving though, leaving me to be the only dude, which was totally fine. We all became great friends, but one of the people I met-- we'll just call her Jane-- was really cool and we became *super* good friends. 3 years later, Jane and I still talk and play video games nearly every single day. We started to joke about how we're each other's internet spouse, and at first I was cool with that, but now she's actually starting to act like it. She doesn't like when I talk to the other people in the group chat at all. The other day, Sarah, Jane, and I were in a call on the group chat and Jane left to get some water. Sarah and I started talking and she turned on her camera to show me her puppies. Jane got back, and heard me laughing and talking about a show with Sarah, and she said something like \"Oh really?,\" completely ruining the mood and causing Sarah to go quiet.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Jane. She's a great friend, but I feel like she's ruining my relationships with my other friends. I know the common way to deal with something like this is to talk to the friend about it, but Jane is the type of person to take everything *way* too personally. She's holding a slight grudge over me for asking her not to spam call me during work, and for not calling her for a week when I had a fever after studying my ass off. She knows that Sarah and I confessed to each other a long time before I even knew her, and she gets super aggravated whenever I mention Sarah. She trash talks about Sarah to me a lot, and sure, there are some things I can agree on, but she's my really good friend and ex best friend, so it kinda hurts me a lot.\n\nI know Jane has a lot of problems with personal things, and she get's super depressed and cries a lot.

I told Jane if she died she would have to eat her dog, and I don't know what her intentions were, but she responded with something like, \"You know a lot about that considering you clearly already ate one.,\" Implying that I ate my dog who recently died of a disease. I replied with, \"You just went too far.,\" and she got mad at me just for saying that.\n\nAny form of help would be appreciated. I can't put up with this for another 3 years.",

        "original": "Now that title may sound weird but it'll make sense by the end of this post. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my 20 years of living, I've never kissed anyone... Well that's a lie, I kissed a few girls when I was 9 but, you know, just pecks. Quick backstory: after my last kiss with a girl in primary school, I joined secondary (high) school and slowly lost confidence in my ability to talk to girls. I developed some strange mindsets just before leaving primary school that I think impacted a lot of other social behaviour of mine, bordering on a sociopathic or autistic lack of social awareness (no offence to those on the spectrum). Various things happened that developed into self esteem issues, which developed into social anxiety which peaked around age 16/17. I also had a bad experience around 15 when I thought a girl liked me and I didn't handle the situation well (long story) resulting in ridicule from her and a lot of my peers. Retrospectively, I'd say it was semi-justified. So throughout secondary school, with my social anxiety, I missed a lot of social opportunities. I didn't make deep friendships, I purposefully isolated myself (although I had friends), and of course, never kissed or even romantically took interest in a girl. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now, I'm at university, I've got some confidence back, my self esteem and social anxiety are at better levels although not \"fully\" healed, I have much deeper friendships but... I still haven't kissed a girl. Have I had the opportunity? Probably. A lot of men go their entire single lives not hearing many, if any, direct compliments but I received one from a girl, whose name I can't remember, at a club one time. It was dark and she was likely under the influence of something, but she told me I was \"very attractive\". Given that, and me being a decent person, I probably could've kissed her then (after a bit of dancing) but I realised in that moment that I almost didn't want to. I said \"thank you\" and walked away. After I said that, I almost smacked my head against a wall. There was nothing wrong with this girl, she was decently attractive and we had a mutual friend. After some thinking, I realised I've gotten so used to my life missing that romantic or sexual component that I think I'm almost afraid of what it would be like otherwise. I don't text or talk to girls with romantic intent (at least not very often) and it's always been that way. Some part of me clearly wants it to stay that way. How do I get over this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI encourage reading the full thing but:\n\nTL;DR I developed social anxiety and self esteem issues in secondary school that lead to me missing out on a lot of formative social opportunities. Now in uni, even when presented with a chance, I seem to be subconsciously averse to ever moving forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Don't get me wrong, this doesn't control or lay at the centre of my life, far from it. It's just becoming a tad more concerning the older I get. It's also becoming a lot harder to keep in the dark.\n\n&#x200B\n\nEdit: I think I may have been misinterpreted. I'm not an incel and I don't need help ridding myself of social anxiety. I want to get rid of this mentality that won't let me get out of the comfort of being single. I do actually vaguely desire a sexual or romantic relationship, but some part of me is holding me back (as per the example in 2nd paragraph) even when given opportunity.",

        "original": "I feel so empty it's killing me. I've quit dating for the time of being, because I've despaired at the possibility of genuine connections growing out of that venue. It's all just sex and merry times, which were fine, but now I feel bored out of my mind. Either the other person would talk all day and never listen to me utter a word, or I would have to talk in their place. The actual connection doesn't take place. The men I've found to be interesting are all much older than me and at such a different stage in life that my troubles can hardly move them anymore. Men my age are total snores, on the other hand. All men became interested in me because of how I looked. This is a huge problem. I don't think I'm being approached by the right guys.\n\nMy parents neglected me so we never genuinely connected either. I don't think they ever really asked me how I felt. Was I happy? Was I sad? My dad cared for me as a child, but he doesn't anymore as he has another family.\n\nFriendships are the same too. I have mostly business relationships now. I don't think people even message me anymore if money is not involved. I can't blame them as I can't care much for my friends. I fake interest, but I think they can tell. I have one friend with whom I used to talk a lot who is actually something of a lazy genius. However, we've faded out of each other life, in part because I feel he lacks drive.\n\nRight now, the only thing that interest me is books. I feel like I have real conversations with books, whereas with other people talk is just to keep the channels open, not for real connection.\n\nI have 2 theories about this ongoing pain in my life:\n\n1. I lack the social skills necessary to foster real connections with people. Because of childhood neglect, I do not know what genuine connections even look like or how to keep them going. One friend has told me I seem rather apathetic. However, I'm still struggling to figure out what this mean, as I feel a deep desire for connection. I think I come off as needy actually?? I'm not sure.\n2. I have been pigeonholed by my look and my background, so that in some way I cannot find the people I'm supposed to connect with.  I live in a country with a corroded intellectual tradition. I never went to universities myself because of family and subsequently mental breakdowns around my high school years, but I have always been a well-read person. The universities in my country are not very good either. All the best students have gone abroad to study and work. Therefore, all the people I've met are either rather dumb or assume that I'm dumb. Recently I even had one highly educated lover who I think eventually came to prefer someone much simpler than me. I'm a rather difficult person compared to most people here, but I cannot talk about things like milk tea, or dogs, or whatever. Not that I think I'm above it. I just cannot feign interest for long enough.\n\nI used to think that I was unloved and uncared for, but I came to discover that when I was cared for and loved, I was not happy either. Certain realms of my mind and soul that needed some form of acknowledgement remain neglected by those closest to me. In relationships, I don't feel seen, heard or felt deeply, and it causes me a great deal of anguish.",

When I talk with someone, the other person does most of the talking (like 98% of the talking)... and when he/she is with me for long enough, that person gets bored of me.\n\nIn conversations, I would often try to force myself to say something... anything and would often say something really weird, or completely off topic. For example... when I was at the gym with a friend, that guy told me that he borrowed his friend's workout schedule and this was my response:\n\n\"Oh cool. Well, there's one problem. I like to go to the gym sometimes and workout a muscle group, but when you and I go to the gym and when you want to focus on a muscle group, but I have already worked out that muscle on the day before.... and.... you know.... so you better tell me ahead of time what muscle group we're gonna focus on, yeah? Haha.\"\n\nThe guy just stared at me for a second, nodded, and went away to do his own thing.\n\nI knew what I was saying was very weird when I was saying it, but I couldn't help it. I literally have no idea what to say so I tried to force myself to say something... and I ended up sounding like a dumbass.\n\nI've also never had a girlfriend, and I really, really think I will never get a girlfriend. I'm not scared of telling a girl that I like her/want to hang out with her. What really scares me is the thing that might happen after that.\n\nWhat if I ask a girl out, and she says yes? What happens then? How do I continue the conversation? Set up a time and place for us to meet... but what the hell are we gonna do on this date??? How the HELL am I supposed to hold a conversation with her for 1 to 2 hours?? Also, how do we determine whether we become boyfriends and girlfriends? And if we're in a relationship, what will I have to do with her? Do I have to see her EVERY DAY??? If so, what the flying fuck will we talk about? How are we not supposed to run out of things to talk about? \n\nShe'll inevitably get bored/sick/creeped out by me within 10 minutes of our date -- that is, if she says yes after I ask her out.\n\nAnywayyyyys, sorry for writing all of this out.

        "original": "Okay so I\u2019ve found out through a friend that the majority of my school thinks I\u2019m a weirdo. I\u2019ve always been really quiet, usually because I\u2019m not good at going up to people and start talking to them, I prefer others initiating conversation. In the past I\u2019ll admit I was pretty weird and in some ways I still am, but my close friends say its in a good way and I usually make them laugh a lot.  I wouldn\u2019t call myself cringy or someone who gets up in other\u2019s personal spaces or gets friendly too quickly, I think compared to other people in my year I\u2019m fairly normal, just very quiet. \n\nNow I\u2019m going to shift the blame a tiny bit and it may seem like a dick move, but hear me out. 2 years ago I befriended this loner kid who seemed nice enough and had been ditched by her friendship group. I sympathised with her since I myself had been in those situations in the past, and so I talked to her, turns out we both liked art and musicals so there was no surprise we became friends. \n\nShe followed me around everywhere as you\u2019d expect, even along with my own friendship group. They all hated her, thought she was way too loud, but I felt bad for her so I insisted on maintaining our friendship even if it meant I\u2019d sometimes leave my other friends to hang out with her for a couple lunch breaks(not all the time, I still kept my other friends a priority). I guess this distanced myself from my other friends which I really regret since I much rather prefer their company, however they\u2019re all so much closer with each other than me. I\u2019ve stopped hanging out with this girl, simply put because she\u2019s annoying and very infuriating. When I try to talk to other people she kinda just butts in and ruins my impression. I haven\u2019t directly told her I don\u2019t want to be her friend but you\u2019d think I\u2019ve given enough hints. Now everyone has alienated me simply because I\u2019m always around her and they think I\u2019m a loony. The guys in my class think we\u2019re dating and the girls just think I\u2019m off. I\u2019ve literally damaged my reputation and relationships and I don\u2019t know how to make friends when everyone avoids me.

        "original": "22/m\n\nwarning : unnecessarily long post with a poorly written story of life \n\n\nin school I only rarely talked to people. like I literally went whole days without talking to anyone. this was basically because I had an extremely low self esteem, 0 confidence and also none wanted to associate with me or talk to me. I was someone who was heavily ostracised and so as a reaction I made the conscious decision that I will not be ostracised and will instead reject social contact from everyone (lmao as if anyone wanted to talk to me in the first place). this letter as d to me having literally 0 social skills when I started in college.\n\nwhen I started college I was this lanky wierd dude who didn't talk to anyone. ofcourse the bullies got to me and ripped my ego to shreds, whatever I said was criticized and I became the person who everyone made fun of. in school at least I went and did a lot of extracurriculars and really excelled at them so everyone sort-of respected me and thought I was the smart weird fuck who none wants to talk to. in college all of my extracurricular skills are basically useless because my major is different from what my skills actually are so here everyone started making fun of my social skills and so on. I was the class retard, people literally bonded over making fun of me and the only people who talked to me were my bullies, that too just to make fun of me. \n\nso a year passes and I've gone to gym and gotten somewhat fit, I've changed my hairstyle and improved the way I talk and walk. I've made literally every improvement possible. apart from my bullies who I still can't reply back to properly I can now give a fitting reply to each and every person in my class if they talk shit to my face so people don't think I'm as big of a dumbfuck as they thought before, to add to that I was also able to get into multiple scholarships and event organising committees because of the skills I picked up and excelled at in high school. now noone talks shit to me in person but they all bitch about me to each other when I'm not there. \n\nso objectively my situation has never been better. I'm able to hold interesting conversations and be engaging. but what I don't get it is ; somehow and somewhere I'm still getting ostracised. my bully freinds are still the only people who talk to me. I still feel so unwelcome and ignored whenever I'm with all the other people in my class. whenever I go to the cafeteria none of them even acknowledge me until I say hi, and all of them will just leave me halfway before I have even finished my meal, none of them will ever make any effort to talk to me. in fact whenever I'm not stuffing my face with food so I can end my meal with them so that I don't have to eat alone, I make for good company, laugh at their jokes and make a few good jokes. I still feel like I get 0 respect back and noone wants me their. they still don't acknowledge me or invite me to sit with them even though it has been 10 months since I've started going to the cafeteria where I see them LITERALLY everyday. in fact sometimes when I will come earlier than when they are supposed to come and I am sitting on my table alone they will ignore me and sit on a separate table. it fucking kills me from the inside out. it's like I don't even matter to anyone. ofcourse when the next competition comes along they will all be begging me to do this and do that, I will also have no other option if I want to win I will be forced to cooperate with them. I even try sending them memes, infact I do my best to only send them the very best content which I can find and they all seem to like it yet so many times they will just leave me on read or they won't even open my message. all of them are super active on social media yet none of them will ever send me any message or meme. I have literally never had someone start a conversation with me. I'm always struggling and scrambling to get a good conversation, I do my best to not message anyone without reason so that I don't appear desperate. I just never get anyone who wants to start a conversation with me. It just feels so wrong. I had ONE friend who i confided everything in, I told her everything about me and who all I like and such. at that time she was also very isolated so I guess she just accepted me, but never once did she ever tell me anything about herself. she then went on to find a bunch of 'popular' girls as her freinds and she literally told every one of them whatever I had told her in complete confidence. then she went on to ignore me, wont even open my messages and treat me like a second hand freind, since then I've completely blocked her everywhere and from my life.\n\nI don't fucking get it.\n\nI don't look ugly,I don't smell, I'm fit, im confident, I'm intelligent (atleast to myself?), I have achievements which literally 1% of the people my major have.\n\nive even gotten asked out a few times by random people (mostly people who I have managed to impress somehow at some event or another)\n\nyet every month I go through a cycle where one week I feel satisfied with all that I have achieved and all that I want to achieve but all it takes is one ugly episode of these people treating me like trash and it makes me feel extremely angry, to the point that I can recognize that my anger is of an irrational intensity and is not a valid response. I just can't help but feel wronged. the only people who talk to me are my bullies, that too just so they can gang up on me to make fun of me (one on one they can't do Jack shit). \n\nwhenever they see me irl they will act like we are very good freinds but they will still ignore me in texts, make plans without me and so on. life just feels so hopeless, whatever I achieve noone gives a fuck, whatever I do noone gives a fuck, I'm still the scrawny awkward lanky ugly fucker from 5 years ago. nothing has changed, I still have 0 real freinds, the only one I had used me as gossip, noone wants to talk to me. nowdays when I go to the cafeteria I sit with these same people and don't say a single word and just observe awkardly what the people are talking about. I am unable to join in the conversation, I have lost every shred of personality and confidence I ever had, the only other option than to uncomfortably sit silently is to uncomfortably sit silently alone. ofcourse noone says anything to me, they just act as if I'm not there. I have endured through 5 excruciating years always hoping for things to get better, doing everything in my power to better myself and open up but i have gotten nothing in return. the only people who care about me do so because I'm an easy target to make fun of, the only thing stopping me from killing myself is that if I kill myself then I will never get to take revenge on these motherfuckers who have treated me like shit. I want to see them suffer, while none of them has probably ever consciously done anything wrong to me I want to see them suffer as much as I have suffered.\n\nI feel like a fucking joke. if guns were readilly available in this country I can't not imagine a scenario where I would have shot up my place, infact I sympathize with school shooters because I feel that they must have been treated the same way as me.\n\nevery month feels like hell. I keep learning new skills to keep my mind off of the mess of a social life I have but sooner or later it will catch up. there's too much that has happened in the last 2 years of college to fit in one reddit post but I'm at a dead end.\n\nnothing I do seems to make a difference, people still ignore me and treat me like a dumbfuck. I had to go so far as to go apply for mensa to get some kind of confirmation that I'm not actually retarded and it's just everyone else who is an asshole(which noone knows about because I thought it would be make everybody hate me instantly which is quite logical).\n\neverytime I try my hardest and end up having good conversations but the next day i don't even get a hello from that person. they dont even reply to my texts. \n\nI cannot get therapy, my parents are the only thing which keep me going, both of my parents are very distinguished people in their fields and going to therapy will not only injure the image they have in their fields but will also cause them immense disappointment because I basically have a whole line of siblings, cousins and relatives who are all at the top of their fields and have really good social lives. till now my parents just think that I do have a lot of freinds but dont tell them about it but i just go everywhere alone and tell them that I'm going with freinds.\n\nI just feel so sad that I have to live like this, I feel like my classmates intentionally do this but even if they do i have 0 way to retaliate, infact one particularly bitchy girl even made jokes about how noone wants to talk to me, I can't do anything and feel powerless. I feel like I've missed out on the golden years of my life. everyone around me is having fun and going out, because this is the only time of my life when I will ever be free enough to do all this. once I graduate life will get too busy to experience these. I dont know what I should do, I'm literally crying as i type out this post i feel completely powerless and I have lost all ability to socialize along with any self esteem I ever had.

I'm healthy, I have a job that I enjoy, I make enough money to be comfortable, and I have friends I hang out with occasionally. But I think I missed something, I never learned how to develop meaningful relationships. \n\nGetting out of my first long-term relationship made me come to this realization. I've never sacrificed significant time or energy for other people in my life. My ex-girlfriend was frustrated with me; she felt like she was not a priority in my life. She felt ignored.\n\nReflecting back on it, I think she was right. I was operating in a mode of focusing on myself and my happiness and comfort and did not consider that a healthy, happy relationship requires some give and growth. I guess I just assumed everyone was like that. I assumed everyone was living independent lives, figuring it out on their own, focusing on themselves first. \n\nI don't feel like I've ever had any close, vulnerable friendships. I'm not as close or vulnerable with my family as I'd like to be. When someone needs something from me, I'll think about how I can fit their needs into the context of my life. I won't hesitate to help but only if it's convenient. My friends have rarely described me as compassionate. When they're going through a tough time, I'm the last person they would call. I'd like to change that. I now realize sacrifice is an important part of maintaining any relationship, and that there's some selfishness I need to work through. \n\nI also think I need to practice vulnerability. I thought I had learned how to be vulnerable but I think I just learned to be honest. I am honest and comfortable with who I am but I think I got comfortable and didn't seek out opportunities to share that. \n\nLately, I've been trying to be more giving, of time and energy, being more attentive and listening to those around me, to friends, family, and coworkers. And so far, it's been rewarding, it doesn\u2019t feel as draining as I thought it would be and it's nice to feel somewhat involved in other people's lives. I think for a while I was afraid of giving more of myself. I've struggled with depression for much of my life and still do. I was afraid if I spent energy supporting others, I wouldn't have enough to keep myself going. \n\nI've been looking for more reading on this subject. Or just any information on how to recognize this selfishness and work on my mentality and behavior.

        "original": " \n\nHi all! First time asking something on reddit :D\n\nHere's my background:\n\nI'm a migrant (my mom lives here for 10 years), and I'm here for 3 years, I've ended high school in my country and went right to university here, without speaking local language and understanding mentality etc.\n\nYet I managed to find friends and girlfriend and we had fun times for a year. But after 1st year most of them understood that Software Engineering is not what they like and left. Unlike me, rest of my friends seems to have own social life outside of university, so I just started to study a lot. The thing is that I love this field and after breaking up with a girlfriend and failing a lot in the 1st year (because we used to have fun instead of studying) I was pretty happy just studying without a lot of social interaction.\n\nNow I'm still studying and working hard to be able to enter a good internship, but now I'm just tired of being single and mostly alone for almost 2 years now. I'm not socially awkward or super shy, but I think I was considered by others just as a smart guy.\n\nOne thing is that I don't find myself a very interesting person, while I have few hobbies (not only Software Engineering) they're not very social, and I'm currently not able to do a lot of social interesting things (like traveling) because: 1) I'm really broke right now; 2) I'm learning hard stuff that requires a lot of time.\n\nSo I started to read material about 'how to make people like me' and 'how to seem more interesting' stuff. And it's OK, I can conduct a dialogue and seem like an interesting person, but I'm having trouble to make it to the next friendship or romantic phase, mostly due to this belief that I'm not interesting person, and also not having money is a big mental block for me. I'm trying to go out with a group to build bonds with people and I always feel confident, but It's always the same story: people are talking about local stuff I have no idea, I don't understand language very good, when I'm trying to say something, other someone grabs all attention talking about subject that everyone is suddenly very interested in and I'm just feeling outsider and ending up being sad about my social life and trying to focus on study next day.\n\nIt is same with girls as well. We can speak, flirt, she may show some interest in me, but when we go out with our group she is just losing interest in me because I can't compete with others in attention-grabbing, it already happened few times.\n\nI know that I have to study and my life will get better, but it's hard without feeling that I am important for somebody, and I'm afraid that I'm just losing my best years and it will be hard to build a real friendship after college ends.\n\nTL;DR; : **How can I improve my behavior to stop being an outsider in groups and build friendship and romantic bonds with people?**\n\nThanks!\n\nP.S. I dont know is it the best reddit to ask, so tell me if there's a better place for this question!",

        "original": "Back in Elementary school I used to be extremely shy, I would only talk to my close friends as I was too afraid of interacting with any of the other \"cool kids\". Around 7th grade I completely shed this shyness and had a very egocentric attitude in which I didn't care what anybody else thought about me, I just did what I wanted to do. I was never a dick to anyone, I still very much kept my manners, but thoughts of what others were thinking of me never even occurred to me. 8th grade this carried on somewhat, though I was slightly more reserved in my social interactions. The summer after eighth grade, leading into high school I got really depressed. I don't know what exactly it was that caused me to be so depressed during this time but I never really snapped back to reality from it. I was pretty quiet again, and I slowly recovered from this depressed state (no meds or doctors, just self reflection). So 9th grade wasn't great for me socially, then 10th grade came along and by the end of the year I was a lot more confident. I built up my courage and was much more confident. 11th grade came and I was at about 90% confidence, I was very outgoing and felt good. I didn't feel nervous or anxious too often and I didn't care what anybody thought about me. Around this time I also began dressing a lot nicer which I truly believe was a huge factor in my self confidence. I also got a job around this time so I was interacting with people daily. Up unto this point I had no real control of this confidence. It would come and go and I would embrace it when it was with me and long for it when it was gone. I had no real method or thought process that gave me this self-confidence... until 12th grade. The summer after 11th grade and before 12th grade I worked very often. Work was a lot of fun for me because it mainly consisted of me hanging out with my friends (who also worked there) and us selling people tickets every now and then and for the amount of work we had to do the pay was pretty great. One of my friends who, during this time, I spent a lot of time with, was not the most confident person but he had a very \"don't give a sh\\*t\" attitude; in a good way. Spending so much time with this friend, I began to pick up some of these qualities in my own way. And by the time 12th grade started I was the most confident I had ever been. I would approach people I would have otherwise been too afraid to talk to and I started up conversations with them. And I finally had something mentally that I could control about this newfound self-confidence, I now knew where I was getting it from. I had begun approaching every situation as if it were just a game, I didn't care about the outcomes of my social interactions, if they went badly I would laugh about it and if they went well then I was happy. I began \"pretending\" to be some extremely confident but intentionally awkward individual. By intentionally awkward I mean that I would have awkward mannerisms and pretend like I couldn't pick up on social cues despite having full awareness and control of the interaction. It's hard for me to explain exactly how it was but all I can say is that I made more friends and more people laugh during this time than I had at almost any other point in my life. It is now getting towards the end of 12th grade and I can feel this confidence beginning to fade. I don't know if it is because I don't have the energy to keep up this persona since I quit caffeine or if I am just tired of pretending to be this confident. I had been off of caffeine for 3 weeks, I began drinking my favorite coffee again every morning and I can already feel the confidence coming back. It may just be a placebo but I have come to realize that it doesn't matter if the caffeine helps me uphold this persona or if it is just all in my head because either way, the coffee brings it out in me and it's the version of myself that I love the most. I hate being a nervous, anxious, and shy nobody that doesn't get involved in any social interactions. I do however love being this confident, witty, persona that I can share with the world and people like me for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf any of you have questions for me please feel free to ask away. I am much better at answering questions than I am at just putting down these general thoughts into a cohesive post. I also like to think that I would be pretty good at giving advice if you are looking for any. The only thing that I am still not good with is women (I am a Male). I cannot, for the life of me, retain a good relationship with a female that progresses to anything more than just simple office talk.  No matter how confident I may feel at any point, a girl that I am attracted to completely takes this power away from me and I regress to an unintentionally awkward fool. So if any of you have any advice for me in that area that would actually be great. Anyways, thank you for reading, it felt pretty good to type all of this out. I will admit I am too tired at this point to go back and read over it so there might be some parts that don't make much sense and I apologize in advance for that.

Because of my extreme self-isolation when I was a teenager, I missed out on a lot of the social development people get in high school and had to work it out on my own over the next few years.

I did build some more social skills during that time thanks to a more extroverted friend who has kind of drifted away now, but I was still catching up and so my social life was pretty stale. \n\nI finished my program a year ago and have been working since then. I've still been making progress with my social skills, but I only really have two friends right now and only one of them is available to hang out even semi-regularly (the other is really busy and not good with answering texts).

I've been getting good at bowling in particular. \n\n\\-Going to bars just to sort of observe and get familiar with how people are supposed to act there. I obviously don't mean creepily sitting there and staring at people, I mean just putting myself out there and paying attention to what other people are doing. \n\n\\-Looking for clubs to join around campus. I've been trying to find \"neutral\" ones that will attract a variety of people since I don't really fit into any one particular subculture or niche. I've found a couple which look pretty promising.\n\nSo I just wanted some feedback here. Do I have a good plan? Is there anything else I should do to increase my odds of social success this time?

She (38f) and I (37f) worked by ourselves quite often, and I went through a rough patch in my life. She was a friend to me, showed me enormous amounts of grace, and just kinda let me be me.

I was a little hesitant, because as the years have passed, we are not as close friends anymore and don\u2019t work closely together anymore.

School was a nightmare, not many took me seriously and I\u2019d get teased/ridiculed on the daily. This hurt me, but so did my \u2018lifestyle\u2019. \n\nI\u2019d do the absolute minimum at home. I practically slacked around until I got bored and went out on the weekends like it was nothing. These weren\u2019t your average weekends either; binge drinking and drugs were almost always involved and this started off as early as around age 15/16. \n\nLooking back, I\u2019d go overboard out of fear of not being liked, even though I knew that all it did was put my life at risk and make me a huge disappointment; both to myself and my parents.\n\nI honestly didn\u2019t know any better, and my social anxiety would only get worse and worse, to the point where a typical day in my life would more than likely include me having to take a Xanax just to calm down for the day.\n\nThis was near enough two years ago, I was fed up of always feeling like I was a victim and decided I was better than that. \n\nThe changes started small. I\u2019d do one or two pushups here and there, with a few sit-ups added on if I was feeling \u201cmotivated\u201d. I kept this up for a couple of weeks until I had enough to get myself a gym membership.  I started getting serious about exercising around two months in and was feeling better than I\u2019d have ever felt within the last year. Which to me was crazy; an hour of exercise in return for actually not panicking out of my head sounded like the trade off of the century.\n\nI consistently kept this up (had the odd day off or two because of work) and as  months went past I started gaining weight steadily.

Being around 185lb I\u2019m not exactly huge but I\u2019m already gaining more respect by the day.\n\nI also recently started white collar boxing, (program in which you train for 8 weeks, raise money for charity whilst fight someone in the same skill level at the end) and I\u2019ve never honestly enjoyed myself this much. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy to think how far I\u2019ve come, and how much progress I have left to make. It\u2019s not been easy, I\u2019ve had to cut out toxic friends (some I\u2019ve had for 5+ years) but I\u2019m only getting one shot at this life so as long as I\u2019m alive I\u2019m gonna make sure it\u2019s best suited for me. \n\nHere\u2019s to hoping this new chapter in my life is a good one and everyone else gets to where they want to get, love you all \ud83d\udc99",

        "original": "To reiterate the title, oftentimes in my day-to-day life, I feel as though I have great difficulty communicating clearly to other people. To be clear, it's not that I can't or don't speak, actually I can be quite a chatterbox at times. Also, I do not have any diagnosed mental or personality disabilities, before anyone says \"Maybe you're autistic\" or something like that. By all metrics, I'm an average person. Also, sorry if this post is filled with vague nonsense, that would be par for course I suppose.\n\nThis problem started for me around the time I began puberty, in middle school. I developed a stutter, and I became \"the quiet guy\" in class. I'm sure that moving and going to a different school contributed to that, but I was never a shy kid at my old school. Actually, I was quite popular, but gradually over time I began to feel like I couldn't get people to understand me when I talk. \n\nNow, I'm 27 years old, and I've been told that people enjoy hearing me speak; apparently I'm great at narrating or telling stories. People have even called my voice or speaking \"poetic\", which I think is a bit much and am much too humble to accept. Ironically though, talking to people takes a lot out of me, because I feel like I am often misunderstood and end up having to clarify or backpedal on what I say when someone calls me out (or *thinks* they call me out) on an inaccuracy. It's led to arguments and long debates before, all because something I say wasn't hyper-specific enough to begin with. I say, \"My favorite color is blue\", and apparently that means I hate red and want to see it die painfully and slowly. Stupid example, but that's what it feels like. Or how when I say something to my girlfriend, just to talk and make conversation, or even to share my perspective on matters, and later she says that I was \"complaining\" or lecturing her about something.\n\nIt extends to the internet, not just in-real-life interactions. It happens all the time on social media, and I've literally stopped posting in some places; I've even dialed back my Reddit interactions to a degree, because I'm sick of debating with people and being disagreed with. Interactions in either way go something like this,\n\n> Me: \"My opinion is yadda yadda yadda.\" (a simple statement)\n> \n> Them: \"Well, it's not even that, you're wrong, it's more like yadda yadda.\" (swap this out for an optional sarcastic and more angry response typical of internet users)\n> \n> Me: \"Oh, that's what I meant actually...\" (sincerely wondering why what I said previously wasn't accurate or clear enough, and how what I said was immediately misunderstood)\n\nI find myself wondering why people can't just extrapolate from what I do say other information that would be common sense. Like, if I say, \"This particular thing has been hard to miss, in my experience, the signs are clear\", someone will inevitably say, \"Well, it's not always hard to miss. You clearly have never done it if you think it's always unmistakable. It depends on this and that and....(continues)\" So basically I end up looking wrong and like a fool even though I feel like I didn't disagree with anyone. I just didn't elaborate enough, apparently. Anyone with half a brain and \"horse sense\" could or should know what I meant, but that's not the way things go for me. \n\nAm I really that incomprehensible? I have no idea. I'm tired of feeling like I have to be super-hyper-extra-turbo painfully specific about everything I say or I'll be misunderstood.",

I am having serious issues with something concerning race but am too afraid to bring it up with anyone. \n\nBasically I am a severe trauma survivor who has overcome most of my challenges. I have a few hang ups still but over all I am doing so much better. I grew up very poor and lived with my mentally ill verbally and physically abusive mother, my father who was in an out and physically and verbally abusive to my mother, and my mothers boyfriends who would abuse her verbally and physically and rape her. I was sexually abused by these boyfriends. I had cigarettes put out on me. I saw my dad stab my uncle. I have been left in strange men\u2019s homes. I have laid by mothers unconscious body in her own vomit crying for her to awaken. So much more but that is a summary. \n\n My grandparents gained custody of me when I was 6 and I have been in weekly therapy since then. My grandfather died 3 years ago and I considered him my father. I am doing so well but have always struggled with PTSD, depression, anxiety, sexual hangups, OCD...the list can go on. I have never had money or anything handed to me. I am legally and financially an independent putting myself through college and grad school. Paying all of my bills on my own. I do not necessarily feel sorry for myself but I have some issues with my Grad program that I also feel bad about for having.\n\nWe only focus on race issues in this program. Everything is about race. Every speaker is black and speaks about white privilege. I understand white privilege and am very familiar with the concept, having majored in Sociology and now going for my MSW. I accept and acknowledge my white privilege. I will never completely be able to understand how it feels to be oppressed because of the color of my skin or ever have to go through what people of color go through on a daily basis because of this. \n\nThe problem is I can\u2019t seem to keep my shit together when I am told, along with the rest of the white people in my class to stand up and walk to the front of class and put a dot on the \u201cprivilege chart\u201d where I am basically right at the top underneath white cisgendered males. Below me is black cisgender males, black female cisgender males, and so on...understand and appreciate the concept but it triggers me. One side of me understands and this other side of me becomes enraged because I think. \u201cHow dare you and all these other people assume my privilege? You haven\u2019t an ounce of a clue what I have been through. I have been through hell and back. I have the mental and physical scars to prove it. I made it to where I am today by working so hard and forcing myself not to let my past cripple me. How dare you force me to stand up here and pronounce myself as more privileged than my black peer and friend who I know for a fact grew up in a stable loving environment, who\u2019s parents are both realtors paying for her education and housing.\u201d \n\nI understand that there may be a person of color in my class who has also been through similar things as me and I also do not know what everyone has gone through. But for some reason it still just makes me so angry and I end up crying and having to excuse myself from the classroom because it also triggers all the horrible memories and I do end up falling into the rabbit hole of \u201cfeeling sorry for myself\u201d I do not share my history with my peers and when I try to contribute to certain discussions with an occasional different point of view people always make assumptions about me. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t count when you grew up with your family being able to provide for you.\u201d \u201cIf you haven\u2019t experienced severe trauma then that point is irrelevant.\u201d Things like that because people for whatever reason are assuming I\u2019m some basic white girl who grew up with mommy and daddy providing for me. \n\nAm I still wrong? Do I not have a right to be upset by these things? Am I being racist? I feel guilty and too afraid to express this to anyone in person but I just can\u2019t seem to get past and not become triggered when other people insist I shout from the rooftops that I am so privileged when it feels like the only privilege I have ever been given in my whole life is my race. \n\nAlso all comments are welcomed but please mention if you are a person of color.",

        "original": "## \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nTl;dr is in the past paragraph for those who don't want to read a whole lot.\n\nFirst off: I am aware the title sounds like an obnoxious humblebrag (feel free to post to [/r/humblebrag](https://www.reddit.com/r/humblebrag)). But the reason I am posting here is because I actually feel extremely unattractive and undesirable. A bit about my backstory...\n\nAt 20 I did the opposite of what most people my age do and moved to a small country town (not a big sleepless city) with my family on the opposite side of the country. Having completed education and being in a town of 90,000 people, I began to suffer slight depression and cabin fever. For the first year I became borderline agoraphobic because I didn't know anyone and so I had minimal reason to leave the house. This became habitualized and became quite a hurdle for me to get over. But after a year, I challenged myself to get a job. To get myself out there.\n\nAt this point, you might be thinking I sound like some shy, insecure neckbeardish kind of a guy (and I wouldn't blame you). But before this mess of a move I was a completely functional person living a completely normal life and attending university who had had amazing relationships with a number of girlfriends. I went from being the captain of my football team to being uprooted and completely losing my sense of identity in the process. And now I believe I suffer from something known as impostor syndrome. A social life is easy when you already have friends. People trust you when you have friends, people find you more attractive when you're not by yourself (the Cheerleader Effect). Friends are a bit like money in that sense \u2014 it's easier to make more of it when you already have it. But when you're new in town and know no-one it's considerably harder. Much harder. You become the outlier. Perhaps in my first year in this town I could have successfully gotten away with the *''I'm new here''* when being introduced to people... But I've now been here for three years and I still don't know anyone (but they all recognise me). What this means is that I'm always seen alone. I'm never with friends. Being a small town and all, a great portion of the residents don't know you personally but will recognise you from around. Whereas most people know someone as a friend of a friend of a friend of theirs, no similar connection can be made about me.\n\nI used to think this was all in my head and paranoia, but a female co-worker recently called me out on it recently. *''Do you have any friends?''*. To which I responded defensively with a yes, of course I do. *''Really?... Because you never tell me about any of them. I always tell you about my friends''*. And that's when it hit me hard like a tonne of bricks just how hard it is to solidify a social network out of nothing (and how transparent my attempts at hiding it were to other people). All of my friends are back in my hometown (people I haven't seen for multiple years now). So I never have any social escapades to share or discuss with acquaintances or colleagues. I feel this makes me appear less trustworthy... Because we all assume, by default, that every person we meet is a product of past and present stories and connections to other people. And we often use this to determine how ''safe'' a person is. When someone deprives us of that then a determination can't be made.\n\nWhat I wanted to ask though... Once I finally got my job. Within the first year, I had upwards of 10 different women from work (from varying departments and varying times) crush on me intensely and then ask me out. Some of these women I outright rejected. And some of these women I felt were genuine friends. But once they confessed and I rejected them they no longer wanted to be friends (fair enough). All of these women have since left the workplace and have been replaced by many, many more women. Three years have past and I've noticed I no longer receive even an iota of attention. It went from 360 mpr to 0 after that year. And I can't help but wonder if I've changed in that time... Or if the times have changed. I'm now 25.",

About a year ago, I was a completely different person. I will turn 20 years old in 2 weeks. Last year, I didn\u2019t have many friends. I was working at a job I hated and wasn\u2019t interacting with many people at my community college. I was miserable. I had been depressed for years and thought nobody wanted to be around me. I\u2019ve never had a gf before and thought I\u2019d always be single and thought I was not a good looking guy. My best friend was in Kansas in the Military, and I thought he was the only friend I had. I felt worthless. \n\nSo one day, I said I was done being miserable. I had enough. I realized that I was the only one who could change myself. I started going to therapy to improve myself. I cut off my long hair and got a nicer hairstyle and got some nicer clothes. I started forcing myself to get out there. I started talking to more people. I started bowling again recently, which is a hobby I\u2019ve always enjoyed, and hadn\u2019t done in years. I forgot just how much I loved it. When I\u2019m not at work or college, I\u2019m usually bowling, and I\u2019ve made quite a few friends there. A year ago I\u2019d be home watching tv or something. One group of people invited me to be on their league team tonight. It feels awesome that I\u2019ve actually found a decent group of friends, and that I can talk to just about anyone. I feel as though I\u2019ve made some decent progress.\n\nAll it takes is a little self motivation. It\u2019s way easier said than done, but anyone can change and anything is possible. Get out there and build your social skills. You will get better as you go along. I went from being shy to a bit more confident. I\u2019m still a little bit shy but I\u2019m definitely getting better. It\u2019s even a little easier for me to talk to girls now too. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll meet somebody awesome soon. Get out there, smile, and motivate yourself. Go to therapy if you have to. There is light at the end of the tunnel. It\u2019s awesome to read posts about how people have improved, so I thought I would share my story. \n\n",

I have seen doctors that recommend using lists and such to remember stuff, but I cant even remember to write things down on my lists, which has ultimately remained empty.

I cannot seem to wrap my head around the fact that they think they know whats best for me even without walking in my shoes. You simply cannot truly understand something until you experience it.\n\nI have also done much research into autism since my diagnosis a few years ago, and have found that around 90% of people with autism cannot live by themselves.

I strive everyday to be part of that 10%, but it feels as though I am only sliding further and further from my goal.\n\nI guess what im asking for here is advice, I dont need people who think they know whats best for me, I need people who can give me constructive advice as to how to move forward.\n\nI hate being a burden to people, im just feeling as though my life is in a hole, separated from society that is continuing to get deeper.

As I result I did get picked on still do get the odd comment about my weight. So I thought I would go to the gym and start to put on weight. But every time I walk to the gym I stop outside and feel sick thinking there might be someone I know in there and they\u2019ll tell people and I\u2019ll get laughed at. Obviously eating is a major part of gaining weight but I don\u2019t like eating in front of others. I would say I\u2019m someone who really wants to be social. I say this due to the fact I\u2019m always up for going out with my friends but when I comes to speaking to others outside my friend group - girls, I can\u2019t do it. I am someone who really wants a relationship but I can\u2019t even talk to a girl so I mean all hope is gone.

But all of my friend group has a girlfriend and it\u2019s something I get quite jealous of. I think I\u2019m just someone who wants a relationship. Quite recently I went on a school trip and there was only one other boy there with the rest of the trip consisting of girls. During the trip I had many of the girls saying that I was funny and obviously it was a massive boost to my confidence.

        "original": "This is gonna be long, so sorry. I'm writing this down not only to seek help but also to try and organize my thoughts.\n\nI'm a freshman in college that's been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for the past 2 years. When I first came to college, I was doing a lot better than in high school. I was making a lot of friends, and started to hit it off with the super hot girl next door, but she had a boyfriend. Eventually, they broke up and we started hooking up around November. She was the first girl that I got with in 2 years... Yeah it was a pretty bad dry spell. I never had trouble talking to girls and (sorry for sounding narcissistic) I'm a pretty handsome guy, but I get over attached and as a result the girls I talk to see me as really weird and over sensitive. Once I see that a girl I like shows interest in me, I focus all my attention on her and stop talking to any other girls. This has resulted in girls sort of leading me on and then ghosting/ditching/hooking up with my friends many times and it kills me. That went on for 2 years until I hooked up with the girl next door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of October, my psychiatrist prescribed me new anti depressants, as the old ones made me sweaty. Little did I know that these new pills actually caused me to be even more depressed. I stopped eating and socialising, I couldn't make myself go to any of my classes or get out of bed, I started failing all my classes, I had constant panic attacks and my thoughts were just pure insanity (my dose started at 20 mg and ended at 200 mg). By January I realised it was the pills and I decided that I'd rather be sweaty than fucking suicidal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was getting with the girl next door, she would always try to ask me what was wrong, but I would just shrug it off. My relationship with her started getting weird: she would be very interactive and close one day but then ignore me other days. I should probably mention that I'm pretty sure she was getting with other guys and I was really, really fucking awkward with her and basically all we did was make out... Anyways, I asked her friend what was up and she said that Sarah didn't know what she wanted and that I shouldn't be surprised if she got back with her boyfriend. I knew I was getting way too clingy with her and I felt like she didn't like me as much as I liked her, so I told her that we should stop hooking up. I did this because: 1) I wouldn't be absolutely crushed if she ditched me and 2) if she did leave me, she didn't deserve to feel bad for me because I was so over attached. She said that we could keep hooking up, but I said I wouldn't be able to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told her that I needed someone that I could talk to, and she said I could tell her everything, so I did. After that, though, she kinda became a bitch. She started to obviously flirt with my roommate right in front of me and just straight up ignore me. That really, really, really sucked mixed with all the other shit that was going on. I was already incredibly suicidal and I started to cut myself. It was the only thing I could feel besides this constant excruciating pain throughout my body. I kept talking to her though, and I told her my thoughts and about how I cut myself. My roommate told me that she said she was really overwhelmed by what I told her, and that she didn't like it when I talked to her about that, so I stopped telling her because she didn't deserve to have all this dropped on her. I got so bad that I almost killed myself before winter break. During break (late Dec - mid Jan), she got back with her boyfriend, and I was mostly alright with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I'm back, and I'm doing a lot better. But it's sort of killing me seeing her and hearing her get fucked, while I have to stay in my dorm all night. I can't go out because I didn't accept any bids to a frat, as my GPA the first semester was a 1.1... How do I stop thinking about her all the time and drop these feelings that shouldn't even exist? I know that it sounds like I'm a bitch who's over reacting, but the thoughts and feelings that I have are not my choice, and I want to change.",

        "original": "All throughout school I never seemed to have a hard time making friends, but couldn\u2019t seem to maintain most friendships longer than a few months. People would just stop answering my texts, stop accepting invitations, and just lose interest. I did have a group of girl friends who I considered my best friends in high school but I always felt a little left out. They seemed to have a closer bond with eachother than they did with me. I was usually the last one to be invited to events, the last one to hear about everyone\u2019s exciting news, and no one ever really seemed that interested in my life despite me taking in interest in theirs. After high school I got a boyfriend, and it got even worse. I tried so hard to not be the girl who gets a boyfriend and forgot about all of her friends, but they just never accepted any of my invitations. After he and I had been dating a few months I accidentally became pregnant, and I told one friend out of the group. After I told her I had decided to keep the pregnancy, she congratulated me and I didn\u2019t hear from her or anyone else in the group again for months. I attributed it to them just not knowing how to handle the pregnancy and our lives becoming very different all at once, and while that was hurtful I forgave them and tried to move on. When I was 6 or 7 months pregnant, I ran into a couple of the girls and found out another one of them was pregnant too, due about a month after me. I expressed interest in getting together with them and they seemed interested too, but again a lot of texts went unanswered and invitations went unaccepted. Fast forward a while, my son is one and a half and my ex boyfriend and I have split up over the last 6 months and we are currently in the process of going to court over parenting time. The other day, one of the girls came into the coffee shop where I work with the girl who was also pregnant and her son.  We said hi to eachother and talked for a minute, but for some reason it really really bothered me that this girl managed to keep all of her friends through an unplanned pregnancy and I didn\u2019t. Having a baby was a very isolating experience for me, I was just starting to get to the point where I was ready to get back out and start making new friends, and then this reminder that I wasn\u2019t good enough to be included just walked right into my work during an already hard time. I do have an anxiety disorder, which has become aggravated by dealing with the breakup so I\u2019m sure that\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m feeling so stuck on this. It just seems like every time I gain some confidence and reach out to someone I just get rejected and set back again.

I\u2019m a young mom, I\u2019m only 21, that seems to make it even harder to maintain friendships I manage to make as I\u2019m not nearly as available as other girls my age. ",

Currently, I am a bitter, self loathing cynic who lives with intense depression and anxiety, constantly battles suicidal thoughts, and harbors an immense amount of hatred mainly for myself. For example i haven\u2019t left my room in almost 40 hours except to use the restroom. 30 of them I spent lying in my bed staring at the ceiling. I just have no reason at all to interact with the outside world because I seem to just be universally disliked. I wasn\u2019t always in that state of mind, I used to be a happy and optimistic kid.  I even had lots of friends, except for one underlying aspect that always gnawed at me until it got to be too much to handle, and I\u2019ve landed where I am now.  \n\nThat\u2019s the fact that no woman has *ever* shown interest in even carrying on a conversation with me, or responded to any of my attempts to introduce myself.  It has literally been my entire life and at this point I just don\u2019t even try anymore, the point has been made more than clear that I will never have a chance at a romantic relationship. What I am trying to figure out before I absolutely give in for good and just let go is if there is something I\u2019ve somehow missed about me. I know it\u2019s something about me as a person. It\u2019s most definitely not my appearance, for one I\u2019ve heard that women don\u2019t care nearly as much about appearance as men do, and when it does come to looks I am rather masculine and used to even powerlift so most of my life I\u2019ve been very fit. I\u2019m also just under 6\u20195\u201d so it\u2019s not because I\u2019m short, I can grow a serious beard which I know at least some girls like. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m a stud, I just mean that if it were just my appearance I\u2019m sure that *someone* along the way could have got past it.  As for how established I am, I have my own house, I own a car, I\u2019m a musician, I have more than 1 source of income and my fathers a doctor.  I\u2019ve seen amazing women bend over backwards for guys that don\u2019t have any of those things so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that. \n\nLike I was saying, I used to be popular in my early life, mostly throughout school. I was no jock, but I got along with pretty much everyone (guys) because they all thought I was funny and a good hang, and I thought the same of them. We\u2019d throw parties and hang out on weekends, go out to eat, go to games etc. etc.  It was a decent life. Up until we all started getting interested in girls. All of us knew the same people because it wasn\u2019t a huge school, and most of my friends had found relationships and lost their virginities by the end of freshman year. But not me, all I got was hard rejection after hard rejection, if I could even get a girl to pay attention to me long enough for me to ask her out somewhere or something. It was like I wasn\u2019t even on their radar as a possible option. Some of them even treated me like I was a kid or like their brother. They\u2019d say things like \u201cAre you asking *me* out?  Really?\u201d and if I wasn\u2019t to crushed to say yes they\u2019d either laugh in my face or say \u201cEw\u201d or something. Some girls were at least polite and said they had plans which was nice. Regardless of this I kept trying and trying. \n\nStarting junior year, I started to get invited to things less because most of my guy friends would have their girls with them at anything we did, and I would always end up just kind of being present rather than in on the night because I was by myself. After this I started seeing my friends less and less, and women seemed to start being repelled by me even more. I would walk up to groups of my guy friends and wait until there was something I could add to the conversation, but if there was a girl present, she wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge me. They wouldn\u2019t reply to anything I said and would even talk over me. It felt like a twilight zone episode. It was so surreal that I remember asking myself, Is there something glaringly wrong with me that no ones ever told me?  I even considered that I could be mentally retarded and no one ever told me, and that the friends I thought I had were just being nice to me.  I quit going to parties senior year because all they were were places for people to hook up, and it was torture seeing all these beautiful girls hooking up with literally everyone but me.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve missed out on a huge part of life, I never got to have that \u201cfirst kiss\u201d or even a \u201cfirst date.\u201d  I\u2019ve never shared anything personal with anyone except my parents, and what\u2019s been too personal for them I\u2019ve just kept to myself. I\u2019ve never slept in a room with another person, let alone a bed. I\u2019ve literally never been told \u201cI love you\u201d by anyone except my immediate family. I look around and all I see are people who are happy and not missing out on this seemingly wonderful part of life, and I can\u2019t join in.  It\u2019s a literal hell because I love women. I love their unashamed passion and that they will wear their emotions on their sleeves.  Women are expressive and intelligent, and it just seems like if i had a chance I could build a good relationship with one.  Not to mention I\u2019m absolutely head over heels for the female form and have even had a powerful sex drive since late middle school so its not like I\u2019m not driven, but I\u2019ve never got to exercise it except by jerking off like a fucking 13 year old. \n\nAfter high school I tried college, but couldn\u2019t find friends because every guy wanted to be around girls, but girls wanted me no where near them so I was always by myself. My depression kicked into full speed and I just quit showing up. Since then it\u2019s just been me on my own regardless of how many times I\u2019ve tried to break my curse. Ffs I even tried tinder but in almost 2 years made exactly 0 matches except with bots, it got to the point where I was just swiping right regardless of looks or personality because I just wanted to see if anyone at all had enough interest to absentmindedly swipe on a fucking app and still nothing. I\u2019m that invisible. \n\nWhen I failed college it was the first time I got a glimpse of my true self, I\u2019m just your average nobody. Nothing special. It eventually turned into hatred towards women because I couldn\u2019t accept the fact that I am the issue, but that obviously would never get me a girl. Eventually I realized I\u2019m just a fucking piece of shit. I obviously know fuck all about interacting with other humans and if I haven\u2019t learned how by now then I don\u2019t deserve a relationship and no woman I am attracted to deserves to deal with such an absolute idiot. I\u2019ve accepted the fact that I\u2019m fucked, and this is my absolute last effort to try and figure put what\u2019s wrong with me. I know that if I remain alone I won\u2019t be able to fight suicide forever so as a responsibility to myself I\u2019m giving this last sort of hurrah. When existence is suffering, the opposite looks wonderfully enticing. \n\nFeel free to be as frank as you like, I promise you you don\u2019t hate me as much as I do and if there\u2019s something specifically shitty about me that I just haven\u2019t noticed, I want to know about it regardless if it seems cruel.  My feelings have been beaten to shit over the years so you won\u2019t upset me.  I just want to know so fucking bad what it is about my personality that sends every woman running. I\u2019ve even asked friends before and if they knew they didn\u2019t tell me about it. They\u2019d just say the usual shit about confidence. I literally couldn\u2019t be any more confident, I was having to approach groups of women by myself and ask her in front of all her friends because no girl would ever approach me.  That made it even worse when I got rejected because then her and her whole group would laugh at me. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what I will do with the information, but it would at least be nice to identify what part of me is so deeply toxic that people pick it up without even speaking to me. I could keep going but I\u2019m sure I am boring people at this point so if you do have any advice I\u2019d be glad to hear it. ",

I've tried to make contact with old friends of mine but i realized that it's simply not gonna happen as they don't share any of my interests, or if they do they seem to have become people who I really don't want to be associated with for various reasons (that's like 3 or 4 people I'm talking about). So essentially I'm left all alone without anyone to even talk to.  \n\n\nI dropped out of college a few years ago because I found a great job in my hometown which is a really small community and there's almost no people that I don't know in one way or another. I'm really satisfied with my job and it seems to be a promising career as I've advanced a lot and the pay is good too. That's what's holding me down to stay here, and this is where problems arise; the pool of people here is really small, therefore making it extremely hard, impossible even to make any friends that I'd enjoy spending time with.  \n\n\nNow what I need advice about is this: I'm contemplating on quitting my job that I enjoy very much and going back to college in a bigger city that will give me at least some opportunities of meeting people and having meaningful relationships. The reason why I'm thinking about that is that my current mental state is being extremely miserable because I don't have any friends to share my thoughts with, and I know I can't continue like this forever as my misery will just get bigger and bigger until I finally snap. I have completed almost 3 years of college previously but now it's like I didn't go at all as too much time passed and whatever I did there is now completely void, and the town it was located in was just slightly bigger than my hometown and didn't offer much social opportunities either.  \n\n\nI've saved up some money that would pay for tuition and could sell my car to cover my living expenses for the duration.  \nFinding work elsewhere is an option too but work means very little social contact in my line of work, so that's kinda beating the idea by itself.  \n\n\nWhat is my best option? Should I leave everything behind and go back to college and make some friends/meaningful relationships or stay here and be happy with my job for 2/3 of the day and basically feel miserable for the last 1/3 of the day until I'm completely fed up with it?  \n\n\nThere's much more to my story but this is long enough and I feel like not much people would care to listen to the whole thing, so this should suffice for you guys to give me some advice",

        "original": "So, I'm incredibly frustrated at my lack of social skills, or social anxiety, or both, or whatever it is that is holding me back. I'm 24, have pretty much only one friend that I see with any sort of regularity, and have never had sex or been in a relationship. For many years I have been shy, sometimes due to anxiety, but more recently because of this 'not knowing what to say' that just comes over me. I want to have a social circle, a relationship, and in general 'be better socially', or just be 'normal' in terms of socialising but have no idea how to do this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome brief context. Throughout school up to my early-mid teens I wasn't exactly socially anxious or shy, what I would do though is have no gauge of what was or wasn't appropriate, and so would occasionally make a fool of myself by making sexual jokes, or just act like an idiot in general, perhaps trying to compensate for a lack of belief in myself and a need to 'big myself up'. Eventually I caught on that this didn't win friends and made me a laughing stock, so I kept quiet rather than risk being perceived negatively. To this day I have 'repressed extrovert' tendencies, notably whenever I drink this repressed personality comes out and I become loud and 'silly', not even needing to be very drunk to cause this, compared to other people who I've known who may be extremely drunk but whose personalities more or less stay the same. So I'm aware I have a filter that is too risk-averse when it comes to social interaction due to past experiences. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the past my problem was definitely social anxiety. I would be afraid to talk to people because of the above, which led to a lack of friends and relationships for the opposite reason of being weird and acting foolish, rather I just kept my head down and went about unnoticed. Of course while this has kept me out of trouble, it has denied me other opportunities, and has time goes on the lack of actual experience of going out and being social has just reinforced the problem, catch-22. More recently with the small amount of experience I've had I would say I have 'grown out' of the social anxiety factor to a large degree, the problem is more so not knowing what to say; wanting and being ready to connect with those around me but just not knowing how to proceed, probably due to a lack of experience. What is as natural as breathing to most other people because they have been immersed in it for their entire lives is just incomprehensible to me.  I try to 'study' other people, particularly those at my place of work, to emulate how they start and continue conversations and build relationships, but in such cases they have often already built a solid rapport with each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not as though I don't have conversations or make small talk, I often do, it's just that the instances of being quiet and shy seem to outnumber the moments of 'social fluency', although they have slowly become more common over the years. For every instance of finding myself able to chat to a coworker or acquaintance, able to joke, feel a connection, these are outnumbered instances of awkward silence, as well as the ongoing 'end result'  of having no friends and not being in a relationship, which is what all of this is a means toward. My social skills and confidence could be worse, as they were in years past, but at the end of the day when comparing myself to other people, I am far more quiet, don't have friends, and haven't got a girlfriend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWithin the past year or so, I've got annoyed at myself for letting this aspect of my life fall to pieces, so resolved to turn it around, setting for myself the goal of one day having a large circle of casual friends and a small circle of close friends within that, and of having romantic relationships. To try and get better I started working out and running to increase self esteem, joined various clubs to I would be around people more, and meditated to try and improve my mental state generally. Again, year on year I seem to be improving, but the pace is extremely slow and I'm still frustrated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis relative quietness compared to other people is pretty much the main factor that I can see that contributes to not having friends or a girlfriend. And when I do talk there seems to be this underlying tension, this reluctance 'to let go'. I know I need to lower my filter of subject matter, banal conversation is ok etc, but still this doesn't help me to be able to come up with anything to say to connect with people when I find myself in a situation when I'm awkwardly silent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been reading various books about social skills and social anxiety, and so far the key takeaways are: 1. Just talk to people, push through the discomfort 2. Don't have such a high filter for what comes out of your mouth 3. Have warm intentions towards other people 4. Go out so you meet more people 5. Work on your self esteem and mental health generally... and yeah it's helped a little bit, but I'm not THERE yet. It doesn't help that a lot of advice out there is catered specifically for the context of trying to pick up women in clubs and bars but what I'm after is far more general and basic, and is something a lot of these people/programmes/books seem to just assume you already 'have'. Picking up random strangers seems levels above what I'm after. I just want to have friends, just to start off with a basic foundation of social skills/fluency that most people around me seemingly take for granted. What is it that other people know that I missed out on?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough I've been getting better, it's been at a glacial pace. When I compare my social confidence/competence to years ago there is a clear improvement. But when it comes to my overall objectives, having a social circle and being in a relationship, nothing has changed. If I were 18 or whatever I probably wouldn't make such a big deal about it, I'd probably think I've got plenty of time to play catch-up, but at 24 there's this urgency, I want to turn my life around completely, and fast, and this slow pace can't continue if it leaves me in more or less the same position in my 30s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor people who think 'well there's nothing wrong with being an introvert', ok fine, but aren't I too much of introvert if at the end of the day I don't have friends or a girlfriend? Or am I barking up the wrong tree, is 'being quiet' even the problem I should be focused on? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo I just stick with the slow pace with the expectation that I will improve exponentially as each win leads to more experience which increases the frequency of future wins and so on? Or do you have any advice as to how I can get better at socialising fast? Or at all?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if this post is all a bit of a mess, I wrote it all in one go and can't be bother 'redrafting' it, and thank you if you read all of this.",

When i was young I wasn't the best on the social part and some people picked on me and my parents were not really helping and both more busy with their work.  But i got over it. \n\nAt age of 14 I started to have lot more friends,  we saw each other every weekend and went on holidays. I still have a lot of friends but sometimes I feel they are slipping away a bit. Because i dont meet with them enough because I am scared I have not enough to say. \n\nI have to say that i pushed my social anxiety always a bit away with drinking and smoking cigarettes. (Weekends) Makes it easier for me to be comfortable to talk. \n\nLife has a lot of up and down periods for me. When I am in a good phase of my life and feeling great I dont feel social anxious and are not scared what to say. But when I am in a bad phase I dont know what to say and question myself a lot. \nI will have thoughts like: I am  not good enough, I am not intresting, My friends like other friends a lot more then me etc. \nSometimes it puts me off then and i rather stay alone...\n\nNow i am 24 and living with 3 of my best friends. But sometimes i dont know what to say? Should I always have something to say? Or is it normal you are sometimes out of talking when you live with 4 guys? \n\nI am also scared when I think abouy being with a girl for a longer time. (for example on a holiday or a long term relationship in general) \nI am good with girls just for a day or a night when going on a date or going out. But when I think about long-term I feel scared and questiong myself a lot.\nI am scared that i dont have enough to say and she will find me a boring, shy and introvert person and leave me. \nNote; i never had an official relationship for long time. I only had some one night stands and some dating for couple months. \n\nI would like to know how i can improve my social skills in general. With my friends, with strangers and especially girls. How can i be more interesting? How can I have more things to talk about? \n\nCurrently I am watching a lot of soccer and Netflix but I dont think this are good topics to talk about. \nWhat topics are good to know a lot about and talk about? I was thinking about start reading  (self-helping) books or newspapers? Or a hobby? Or how do i built up common intrests more easy with other people?\n\nSorry for the long story and lot of questions hope you can help me out a bit\n\n",

That was the only relationship I had and I miss having someone to share my life with.\n\nI've just come back home from studying abroad and something extraordinary happened to me while I was travelling by train to another city where I'm supposed to start my new job.\n\nFor the whole journey a gorgeous girl was sitting next to me and kept looking at me like she was interested. I'm usually a shy person when it comes to making a move or starting a conversation, but I have no problem on keeping the flow once the other person initiates the talk. As I was talking to my friends (a couple), who were sitting in front of us she started laughing at my jokes, even though she wasn't participating in the conversation. Also, at some point, I apologized for interrupting her from reading her book and she told me that it's a delight to listen to my little plans and other stuff I'm saying, giving me the warmest and the most beautiful smile I have ever seen in my life. \n\nAt that point I was sure that she was interested, but I could not gather the courage to start a conversation with her. We didn't talk for the entire journey, except for a few trivial lines. This kind of stuff never happened to me and I would have never imagined could happen, since I don't consider myself a good looking person. \n\nWhen we arrived at the destination I told my friends that I'm not in a hurry. They left, we said goodbye and the girl also seemed like she wasn't hurrying. I sensed that she was waiting for me to make a move, but I still couldn't do it, even though I had already prepared a simple line, which I thought it was appropriate, in my head, so I could ask for her number. \n\nNothing happened and now, after two days, I'm sitting in my bed at home with the biggest regret of my life. I know that I should just move on, because it's just a crush, but this thing never happened to me and I don't think it will ever happen again. I absolutely regret it and seriously don't know what to do, since I dind't even ask what her name is. There are close to 0 chances to find her because we are in a huge city.\n\nGetting into the first relationship was kinda easy, because she was really into me and things went really smoothly with her making a lot of moves. Not sure I will ever be able to find someone to be with again. What is frustrating is that I almost started to accept the fact that I will be lonely for the rest of my life, but now this happened.

        "original": "Hello, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a throw away account for obvious reasons. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a 29 year old male. I have never been in a real relationship with a woman. I am here to tell my story and ask for advice. I will try to keep things brief as to not have this be a very long read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nElementary and middle school \n\nThere is not a whole lot to tell here. I was bullied a lot during these years. I had friends, but a very tight knit group. Outside of them I had a pretty bad time during these years. I didn't have much interest in girls during this time so that is why this portion is so brief. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigh School\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was still bullied a lot during this time up until near the end of my junior year. Up until then I was a very skinny kid with glasses. During that time I decided to try to better myself. I started working out and once I got in shape the bullying stopped for the most part. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had friends during high school as well. I never felt like the most important person in our group, but felt appreciated. During high school I had a couple romantic interests, but nothing ever panned out. I was not really sure how to relate with women. The few woman I did ask out I got rejected. Thinking back on those times now I can see why. Most of them were people I thought were physically attractive, but really knew nothing about. They were people I had classes with who I talked to occasionally. Then one day I would hype myself up and ask them out and get rejected. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAges 18-21\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the years after high school I got into drugs. This portion could be a novel, but it is not very relevant to my issues with women. I did have friends during this period, but it mostly consisted of me being under the influence 24/7. I never made a single attempt to approach women during this period as I had given up on that and other things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n22-26\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the age of 22 I finally dealt with my drug/alcohol addiction. I started going to meetings and stayed clean for over 5 years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring this time I didn't have much success with women either. I remember many people I knew from meetings and other places meeting women and getting into relationships. It always felt like a foreign concept to me. I could be friends with women, but never really knew how to take it past there. I did try online dating, but that resulted in two dates. Both of them went okay, but neither lead to a relationship. One was me as I didn't like the other person. The second was the opposite as I was interested in them and they were not into me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n27-29\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was still a virgin at this point. I decided enough was enough and decided to just pay for sex. I was already going to Las Vegas on vacation. During that vacation I decided to go to a brothel and pay for sex. I always thought my fear of women had to do with me never having sex. The sex I had their was great, but didn't really fix my confidence issues like I thought it would. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround this time I also graduated college and got a decent job. My timing was delayed due to my drug issues. I am currently working a stable job and making a decent income. I am even in the market now for buying a house. I feel like I have checked off all the boxes of adulthood except one thing. Having a meaningful relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have always had close friendships, but never a romantic relationship. At this point I am really not sure where to even start. I feel like I am still 13 years old whenever I talk with a woman in a romantic way. I have literally no idea what I am doing. I can't seem to ever foster any kind of relationship with a woman that isn't a friendship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thank you everyone for reading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "original": "Ok I have serious issues with my mental state now because of how people treat and react to me. It has driven me insane and is making very hostile because I truly believe it is negative. I am 24 and have never been in a relationship because I have despised being around men who have made me uncomfortable my whole life since childhood. I cant get over their stares and actions. When I get on the train ALOT of men STARE at me. Alot of men literally change their behavior and some try and come close to me and rub on me while others look at me with MALICE and a stare of absolute hatred. Women stare too but I Ignore the hell out of them. The reason I dont ignore men is because I am watching them to keep myself safe. Now now now, I know most of you would love to jump to the conclusion and say its because I am attractive but I beg to differ and hear me out. I dont think thats the reason AT ALL. I dont dress provocative but I am very skinny and I think when guys look at me they are thinking this \u201cOmg she is so skinny wtf!\u201d Or \u201comg she is so ugly and probably thinks she looks cute in that outfit\u201d.  The men I see with smirks are thinking \u201comfg she is so hideous but thinks she is rocking it this morning pfffft\u201d. The men staring with malice are probably thinking    \u201ceww!! Why are ugly people allowed to live, I really hope she doesnt breed\u201d. The moment I see a single eye contact my blood pressure and anxiety sky rockets because people are judging me harshly in their minds and it makes me want to just disappear but because I am so distressed and stuck with them on the train, I end up cursing people out. \n\nI have started to become very very hostile and I think in my mind \u201cfuk you for staring!! Quit fucking judging me you pieces of shit!!\u201d My mind races with all the anger for people thinking all the negative crap about me and I spiral into anger. I have on more than one occasion almost physically assaulted people for just looking at me. Just about a week ago I was going up the escalator and I KNEW the moment I would look to the side of the other escalator by me I would see someone staring and BAM I was right. There he was, a man in his 40s just GLARING with hatred and I yelled \u201cWHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING AT MOTHER FUCKER?!!\u201d He looked away but didnt even seem fazed. I dont want this to sound like a victim sob story because I dont see myself as a victim. I was molested as a kid and men have always tried touching me since I was 6 but I am really savage now and they cant get anywhere near me. I literally have growled at men at times. I just dont know whats on their mind or how others are seeing me but most of all I want to be left the hell alone. People staring is the BANE of my existence. \n\nNow the reason why I even question my notions is because my therapist SWEARS I am attractive enough to be a model which I seriously think is absolutely them just trying to make me feel better and I told them this but they insist that I am and swear by it. Alot of guys have said to my face that I am hot but girls never say that to me. Only a few of my friends say I am pretty but girl friends just say that to each other. Strangers dont compliment me they just fucking stare like assholes or vicious vultures. The men complimenting me i dont take seriously because they are just horny. The only person who ever actually made me question my attractiveness is my therapist. My mother even said I was ugly to her friend and I over heard her. I dont know what to make out of this when I get such a cold and callous attitude from sooooo many people while others literally try to stick to me like freaking glue. I dont understand it. The answer being that I may be attractive would not make life better for me at all. I just want to know the truth because It would just help my confusion. I dont want to be stared at no matter what the reason is but maybe I can somehow help myself to be less hostile if the reasons weren\u2019t so negative but I am searching for the truth.  I even posted my pictures in r/amiugly and most people said I was attractive, some said I was seriously hot with natural beauty and ONE comment said I was a 3/10. I believe the 3/10 because I am sure everyone else just wanted me to feel better. All this circling and different opinions being thrown at me has driven me to the point of insanity because I dont know how to see and carry myself and I dont know what to do anymore especially with people staring at me in public, please HELP. I have lost it and now I hate myself more and more and cant stand myself or others. \n\n",

Looking at my life from the outside it's what some consider ideal (maybe not for a 23 year old, but you get the jist).   \n\n\nIn highschool, I was semi-popular, did well in athletics, did well with girls. I always spent time hanging out with a friend. I was almost never alone. Now, in my adult life, that has completely changed. I'm stuck in some weird limbo where everyone my age are living lives that a 23 year old would typically live. Most are single, or in a newer relationship. Most of them go bar hopping often, spend time with the boys, have poker nights, etc. I have tried reaching out to my old friends and I find myself just zoning out. I find their conversations unbearable. I really just have an awful time, every time. It's not like they've changed, I'm the one who changed.   \n\n\nOn the flipside, my wife is 30. She works in the medical field and often has dinners and social outings. These outings consist of people I would consider \"similar\" to me based on social, marital, and paternal status. After several of these dinner parties, I'm realizing that the whole thing ends up being a pissing contest. These people joke and laugh but it's all so fake. They have no real interests! They talk about their things, and that's it. I'm not sure if it's because it's a \"formal\" setting and that's why? My wife insists that I'm looking into it too hard and I just need to relax. I just don't find anyone interesting anymore. I do live in a small town, so there aren't many options for friends. Currently, I am working on a plan to relocate my family to Portland (for employment reasons) and I want to think this will create opportunities to make friends, I'm just afraid that my social skills are deteriorating.   \n\n\nI feel like I'm stuck in this social limbo where I don't really fit in with anyone.

Ever since I progressed through puberty I became more socially anxious, self-conscious, more quiet, lost enthusiasm, people don't interest me and nothing really phases or interests me so I find myself speaking with little emotion (unless I'm drunk or high of course but you don't make real friends not sober). I have no interests or hobbies apart from that I used to go to the gym and sometimes I play video games for hours a day which I don't really enjoy that much anymore its like a habit and also because I have no real life friends only a couple of online friends who I befriended irl when I was a young teen but they live far away now so we just play online and meet up a couple of times a year now.\n\nI spent most of my free time on video games since I was 4 and playing online since I was 11 but I only started losing sociability when I was 14/15. I was basically a shut in from 14 and only really went outside to go to school and my only friends were just classmates. This is something I regret as I have not experienced much of life and what it has to offer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to uni for 5 months but dropped out and am reapplying for another course this September. I went to uni basically having only 2 irl acquaintance friends from college (UK) for 2 years so my social skills were (and still are) shit and my anxiety was sky high. Somehow I managed to make some close acquaintance friends in my accommodation because I drank a bottle of wine to muster up the courage to go into the courtyard where people were sitting but ever since Christmas we drifted apart but still hugged and small talked when we saw each other (they are mostly female and I am a cute boy). For about 2 months I had some stoner 'friends' but I had literally no common interests and different personality from them so we only really spoke when about to get high, getting high and post high. \n\nI miss my uni friends probably more than they miss me despite drifting apart probably because they were a huge part of my limited social interactions and I was not a big part of theirs. I also miss my flatmate neighbour even though she probably hates me and we have barely spoken sentences to eachother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am less socially anxious now because I had forced myself (albeit not hard enough) to talk to new people during freshers and I also got a job for the first time so I had to meet and speak to new people again just so it wasn't awkward if I just show up and say nothing at all for 8 hours which I would have been fine with if it wasn't awkward.\n\nFrom my uni experience, I have realized some things about myself:\n\n* I'm scared of being judged, think everyone is judging me and that people will view me negatively. This is probably because I judge everyone myself and think everyone else is the same.\n* I am almost a blank canvas who changes based on who I'm around. Maybe I have a fear of rejection or displeasing people.\n* I can be socially isolated for a day and a half but then I feel depressed, lonely and empty but even in this state I'm still quiet and just enjoy being in the presence of others.\n* I feel emotions but I don't express them much so no one knows how I feel.\n* I miss people I see around a lot or am in the presence of a lot even if I haven't spoken to them. I didn't know I could even miss people greatly because I haven't missed anyone since I was a kid.\n* I perceive people liking me less than they actually do.\n* I don't speak much because I feel as if there is nothing to say\n* People want to talk to me but I have nothing to say (or at least feel as if I don't) so the conversation dies and I lose a potential friend.\n* I hate small talk because it seems insincere and I also hate acting in social settings because it is insincere\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am excited for uni this year because of a new opportunity to make friends so\n\nI need advice on:\n\n1. How to strike up a conversation. (pretty sure during freshers I once opened up with \"hi im (name)\" outside a pub)\n2.  How to hold a conversation and have things to say because I always find that the conversation fizzles into awkwardness because I have nothing to say and I am not interesting nor interested in other people (I hate this quality of myself).\n3. How to progress your relationship and bond with someone you met the night before (with my close acquaintance friends I didn't want to add them out of the blue on social media the day after and ask if they want to hang out because I felt that it makes me seem needy and they didn't want to do anything with me but we bumped into each other and did stuff).\n4. How to change my perception on how others perceive me or not care how they perceive me and to not be insecure.\n5. If possible, how to become more interested in others, have more enthusiasm and feel the need to talk more.\n\nI hate my personality and want to change but I don't want to pretend and I don't think its possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to die sad and alone.",

After 7th grade my last friend that I had stopped wanting to hang out or text, and the other one I cut off because she threatened to stab me (long story). My mom has been a pretty emotionally and mentally abusive person towards me since my brother was born (when I was 6, so 10 years ago), and was over controlling and convinced me that it didn't matter if I had friends or not because I would have them when I become an adult. This only made me think it was acceptable to sit on my ass all day and never go outside. When she found out that I had (still have, neither of my parents know) internet friends, she forced me to get off the internet and delete all my social media accounts for a year. (I figured out the password to the wifi two weeks into my punishment, and just hid everything from her. I no longer have to deal with her because she cheated on my dad and he kicked her out 5 months ago.)  Up until last month I've lived out in the middle of the country and it would take up to 30 or 40 minutes to go to town, and we didn't have much extra money to spend, so I rarely had the opportunity to go out and do things other than occasionally going to the movies with one of my parents. I fell into a deep depression partly due to that, and I now lack the social skills to even hold a basic conversation with people my age.

        "title": "Finding meaningful friendships when I feel no emotional attachment",
        "original": "Hi, I'm a 21 year-old guy in college and I don't have close friends / meaningful friendships. I have plenty of superficial, surface-level friendships, but nothing sporting the qualities of understanding, honesty, loyalty, etc. that /meaningful/ (\"interpersonal\"?) friendships have. I'll be graduating in about a year and I'm terrified that I'm going to be pushed out into the world, I'll have missed my best chance to socialize, and I'll be all alone. I feel like I'm under time pressure now.\n\nI have autism (Asperger's; high-functioning) and a part of that is something called \"alexithymia\" which REALLY impairs my ability to experience social/emotional attachment. It's really hard to explain so I'm sorry, but in essence it means (at least for me) that I don't feel those \"attractions\" or \"gravitations\"  that \"come naturally\" when you wanna be friends with someone. I'm just not drawn to anyone, for any emotional reason, ever.\n\nThere's this guy I met freshman year and we shared a lot of interests and hobbies. Because we had that in common, I took it as a good opportunity to start a close friendship. Throughout the past 3 years we've been talking and hanging out-- going to get food, see movies, even attending conventions together, but I still feel nothing for him as a friend nor our friendship. I don't even feel like I know who he is at all, even though I technically have all these memories of times with him.\n\nI tried so hard to be true \"friends\" and in the end I feel like I wasted all that time trying to feel something that I apparently cannot feel because I'm cognitively/neurologically disabled. I know, it sounds like complete bullshit to think that  someone literally could be unable to feel attraction or attachment for their own friends. That's what I thought too, which is why I tried so hard for 3 years, but I still feel /nothing/ so I think it might be the truth that I have to accept.\n\nFor the record, I've had other friendships, but they were all very short-lived and probably a lot shallower than the usual friendship is supposed to be, by \"normal\" standards. I even had a girlfriend once, but retrospectively, I think it might have been a huge misunderstanding and accident that never should have happened because I was so clueless about this.\n\nThat was a lot of exposition but my real question here is: If I find myself starting to make a friend, should I tell them about my alexithemia? When?\n\nI'm afraid that if I keep it a secret, and the friendship continues to grow closer, they'll eventually realize something is wrong with me and will feel extremely hurt and betrayed when I have to tell the truth-- that I feel no emotional attachment. But I'm also afraid that if I bring it up, I'll be seen as a robot incapable of love...a potential psychopathic murderer...etc.\n\nI do have a past of emotional abuse I'm extremely deeply regretful of. I was very scared of myself for a long time but recently I've decided that I want to be a better person. I don't want to hurt people, but I also fully realize it's such an easy pitfall when I never feel emotional attachment. EVERYBODY has the right to leave a friendship they don't feel comfortable in or aren't getting anything out of. I feel like ethically, it's not right of me to accept feelings of attachment that I cannot give back. I should not take what I cannot give.\n\nSince people are looking for emotional closeness in friendships, and I can't feel emotional closeness, I feel like it would be wrong of me to even have friendships at all. But at the same time, I also realize that isn't a healthy mindset to have, and everyone needs friends in their life. I'm unsure of what to do.\n\nAll of this must make me sound extremely dull, but I do try very hard to be an approachable person, since I have such a hard time taking the initiative and reaching out myself. It's kind of a cover to compensate for the fact that I lack attachment, but I get good grades, I love art, education, video games...there are a bunch of things I genuinely DO get attached to, just not...you know, people. Friends.\n\nIs it possible that someone would still want to be friends with me even if they know I don't care (emotionally, not logically) about them or our friendship together?

        "title": "9 years of self-improvements paid off.",
        "original": "This is the success story of how 9 years of self-improvement paid off with someone unexpected - my old high school crush.\n\n**2010**- I was a shy deaf introvert with a cochlear implant. My speaking skills were not great and I didn't have much experience socializing with hearing people growing up in a deaf school. I was also a new kid to a noisy school where I can't hear anything. I first met this girl when my captioner (sitting in back of room) decided to chat with her and introduced us to each other. We were 15. We quickly became friends in classes we shared with each other.\n\n**2011** - I fell for her hard. She was my very first crush. But my communication skills were bad and I ended up chasing her. I came across as desperate. She was returning my long texts with one or two words. I then tried to ask her out to bowling, but found out she had a crush on a guy at the alley. My heart was broken and I was tired of her lack of effort.\n\n**2012** - I stopped texting her and avoided her. I was diagnosed with depression and became obese due to poor eating habits. We ran into each other once at football game, but that was it. \n\n**2013** - We ran into each other at high school graduation and return to the same room to get our stuff. We hugged each other and she told me that \"we'll see each other again\". That didn't happen for few years.\n\n**2014** - I was a mess, ugly, obese, and depressed by the time I go to college. I joined a club sport team and lost 60 pounds to normal weight. I finally broke out of my shell and found a hearing friend circle. I spent nights looking up how to be more social, reading these little tips on self-improvement, changed how I dressed (no more sweatpants), and watched bunch of movies for culture references. I hired a counselor and learned how to manage my mental health. I also discovered my love of hiking mountains.\n\n**2015** - I found a hobby in photography and became really good at it. I was doing well in classes and socializing with more people. Went to the gym often. \n\n**2016** - big challenges came. I started to struggle balancing everything. I was doing poorly in couple classes, I wasn't getting playing time in my club sport team, my friends were drifting from me, I got rejected by a girl I was interested in, etc. After 3 years of absence, my depression came creeping back in. It was tough, but I distracted myself by starting to travel more regionally with my camera. One day, I remembered it was my former crush's birthday so I texted her to see how she was doing. Surprisingly, she asked to see me for lunch during our break. We ate chicken wings and caught up on our lives, but that was it. We're living like 10 hours from each other so we didn't keep in touch after our quick catch-up lunch. \n\n**2017** - things I were struggling with fell apart completely. I got couple Ds in school. I quit my club sport team. My friends isolated me out of their group. I had my worst ever depression episode. It was a miserable last semester of college, but I graduated. I did it. Then I moved away from my home state for my first job to start over again. I was forced to re-learn how to socialize, how to make myself presentable, and to find confidence in myself all over again. I also traveled across the country, seeing 25 states in one summer and a total solar eclipse.\n\n**2018** - I finally caved and started to date different girls online for first time in my life. My job was okay. I traveled internationally for first time and saw northern lights. But still, I was not satisfied. I didn't like what I was doing. My dates were going nowhere. I was by myself away from my family in a different state. My depression crippled me again so I hired a therapist. I kept asking my parents for money to pay off my rising bills. It was another challenging time. In December of 2018, I was feeling lonely before my holiday travel back home where my family and friends were. Couple months before this, my old crush added me on Snapchat out of blue so I figured I'd finally send her something. After two days, she sent a snap back. We quickly moved over to texting. I told her I was in town visiting and asked her if she want to go for drinks with me. Now, here's a thing - me at 15 had NO confidence to ask a girl like her out to anywhere. But me at 24 had no problem and hesitation to ask her out for drinks at a bar. I no longer see her as a crush, but as a person I'd like to hang out and have fun catching up with. She quickly accepted my offer and, to my surprise, called every bar in the city to ask about their noise level so I can hear her with my cochlear implant. It felt good she still cared little things about me after 9 years. Few days after Christmas, we met for first time in few years. She then brought the first round of drinks for us and we moved to a quiet corner. We ended up talking for 6 hours talking about life, with us taking turns on buying drinks. She introduced me to few new drinks. We laughed at old memories from our high school days. We talked about the uncertainty of future. She was amazed at how I was still hearing her at a loud bar (cochlear implant tech improved a lot in 9 years). She also commented about significant improvements I made on my speaking skills, my outgoing personality, how I broke out of my shell, how cute I am now, and more. It felt good. We ended the evening with heart-to-heart conversation about romantic relationships. She was dealing with lot of terrible guys and I was getting over a girl I recently dated. She said we'll find someone for us one day. We hugged for a while and, before I left, I told her that I wish there was a way I can see her more often. She suggested that we should do Skype calls. I agreed.\n\n**2019** - we started the year off by doing Skype video calls once a week. The thing is... I've never done a Skype call for anyone. I can't use phone to call people due to difficulties with my cochlear implant. Too much background noise interference. So it took a lot of courage for me to do that first ever Skype video call for someone I used to have a crush on. I was worried about my hearing not doing well with technical sounds. To my surprise, it turned out we communicated smoothly through the video call. She's changed a lot since high school. She was no longer shallow, but a caring person who like to check on my days and sometimes initiate on when we do our Skype calls. She also texted me whenever I can't understand her on our video calls. We became partners against our similar struggles. She helped me as I applied for another job in my state. I helped her as she tried to get into a graduate school. Last couple weeks, we both received bad news. She took it especially hard over her rejection from grad school on top of an ex abusing her emotionally. I made a decision to return to my parents' house to re-evaluate my life. We didn't text much for couple weeks, but then she requested to call me on Skype tonight. We just went three hours having heart-to-heart conversation about our life. She knew I was returning to our small town so she was excited that we'll be near each other again. We talked about things we'll do this summer together. Then I told her that I was taking her out for another round of drinks the first chance I get when I make my return. She eagerly said yes! We have such a good vibes toward each other so I could see amazing things happening for us down the road :)\n\nWe're now 24. We met when we were 15 at beginning of this story. It took me 9 freaking years of self-improvements to get where I am with this girl. It was completely unexpected because we'd written each other off. The lesson here for you teenagers on here? Keep working on yourself. Push yourself out there to socialize even if it's uncomfortable. Make mistakes. Learn from them. It'll build your confidence and personality over the time. Don't get obsessed with your crush and move on quickly if it's a no. Meet new people. Go on dates with different people, even if they don't go anywhere. Be fearless. Never stop learning. Prepare for the unexpected.\n\n**TL;DR - I met a girl when we're 15. Had a crush on her at 16. Heart broken at 17. Spent next 7 years improving myself. Forgot about her and moved on with my life. We reconnected unexpectedly at 24 and had drinks. Few months of Skype calls later, she eagerly said yes to go out with me.**",

We got along great I make her laugh I feel like she likes me. Third week of knowing me she gave me her number she said incase I needed to know something work related. We start texting, eventually she even starts hugging me when she sees me, big hugs too. She even text me that she loves hugging me. Around June she is moved to different area to do more complicated work, I also change to night shift and different area on other side of building because of school. We still see each other when she is leaving work in break room, everything is good. But then the fall semester starts so I start my shift earlier but still in night shift, so we dont see each other anymore but still text. I should also mention that I think I am friend zoned because she would text me stuff like \"good night friend\" \"hi Buddy\". But I'm FA so idk.\n\nThis is when my first mistake happens. Im texting with her and mention that I got a good raise. She text me this \"Thats good now you can take me out\". What do I do? I reject her by saying \"I would take you out but I'm so busy, when I have free time for sure\". In my defense I was super busy work 40+ hrs and full-time school. But I panicked, i got insecure because I have no experience, I wouldn't even know where to take her.\n\nSo after this we still text occasionally but we both are busy so not much.

I was like whatever, if she wants to talk to me ill let her text me first. She never responded. Then like 2 months later on New years day I decided to take another shot, and sent her a happy new years text, again she never responded.\n\nThis whole time we still work same company, but haven't seen her in person like for 4 months.

But she had turned around and left I was able to see the side of her face thru the window in the door. So she opened the door saw me in there and just turned around and left. I was like wtf, why would she avoid me?\n \nI know that I have oneitis, I know I should move on and I know I have 0% chance now.

In high school, I was always drawing something in my notebooks, but I studied hard and got good grades so I also became known as \u201cthe smart kid\u201d (even tho I\u2019m shit at math, and my English is far from perfect). Despite this, I still found \u201cmy people\u201d and had a close friend group throughout high school. Then graduation happened and over time I\u2019ve stopped talking with all but one of my close friends. I\u2019ll call her BFF (24F).\n\nFast forward to now, and I\u2019m discovering how lonely I actually feel. While I do appreciate the company of BFF, she\u2019s on the extrovert side and had the opportunity to make friends in college while I went to work where all the staff are old people nowhere near my age. \n\nWithout getting too detailed, BFF made her own friends and they invite her places and do things together, meanwhile I haven\u2019t made real life friends since high school. I\u2019m sometimes invited to come w/ BFF, but I\u2019m not comfortable tagging along because her friends aren\u2019t my friends. I don\u2019t know these people and I feel like a 3rd wheel who doesn\u2019t belong there. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m intentionally left out or ignored, (BFFs friends don\u2019t mind me at all) but I just feel it\u2019s so obvious the only reason I\u2019m even there is because of BFF. So I often don\u2019t go w/ BFF when she\u2019s w/ her college buds since I end up feeling more uncomfortable instead of enjoying myself.\n\nI know it\u2019s up to me to get myself out there and socialize, but it\u2019s difficult. I\u2019m worried people are judging me the minute I speak to them. I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll think my clothes look dumb, or that I shouldn\u2019t wear certain outfits because I don\u2019t have \u201cthe right body for it\u201d, or maybe they\u2019ll think I\u2019m trying too hard to fit in, maybe they\u2019ll notice the dark circles under my eyes, or my weird teeth, my buggy eyes.. \n\nAnyway, I resolved w/ myself to do more fun and exciting things and try to talk to at least one new person w/ each different thing. I bought a couple concert tickets for me and BFF and I\u2019m VERY EXCITED to go! I\u2019m also looking to attend community college and take classes in criminal justice and law enforcement (a subject I\u2019ve always been fascinated with), but a cloud of doubt still hangs over me..

My parents are divorced since I was 6 (now I'm 24) and they live 350km apart so I only saw my dad every two weekends. Where he lives I made so many friends and I love each of them. As time went by I grew apart from my father and I don't visit as often so I don't see these friends more than 3 weekends a year. Meanwhile, where I live, I made almost no friends at school and I made 2 friends at uni (both not talking to me right now for different reasons.)  After uni I made a new group of friend who live 1 hour and a half away from me even if in the same city. They meet a lot but I can't go often. That's so frustrating. \n\nI have a girlfriend, we love each other but her situation is kinda similar to mine so even if we have each other that is certainly not enough when you live together and basically every day ends up being a very badly paid job that lasts 2 hours a day, being with the same person the rest of the day and going to the gym. That's all I do. I don't have the energy to focus on my hobbies. I just feel it's worthless. I remember being MUCH MORE productive when I met people often. Right now my job does not even demand me to talk to people other than children (teacher.) I am getting anxious,today I proposed my friends to meet and come home have a relaxing time with games and fun. My girlfriend and I were excited but then they said that it would make them go home too late so basically it's not happening. I'm literally crying. I don't even know where to look for comfort. Every time I manage to make a friend they live far away or it doesn't work. I feel terribly alone. I know many of you feel alone from what I've read for different reasons.\n\nI definitely need to make new friends, expand my horizons. I want to feel I have value. It's easy to lose sight of how much worth we are. As much as I know this I'm just defeated. Days are dull. No real job not much money no hobbies no nothing. Gaming is all I get from time to time and it does not fill the void. I don't read anymore and I loved it. I don't write, I don't play any instruments. I'm becoming a stone. Why do something if no one cares? It sounds edgy out loud but it's the truth. Being so far from my friends leads to me being a bit less important indirectly. They share so many times together. I just can't. I need more people. I need to feel the love. I have love to give. I just want the hard times to be over or at least manageable.\n\nHow can I meet new people at 24-25 years old?",

I feel like  everything is falling apart (or never been built, maybe). I shouldn't feel like this, I'm studying two master's degrees, I have a good family (not perfect, but there is no perfect family), I have friends (not many, but enough), I'm not completely poor and I live in a privileged country. \n\nRegarding my career, I'm studying what I want to do for the rest of my life but I'm starting to see that I'm awful at it. My \"classmates\" do everything so effortlessly, brilliantly and with such creativity (while I'm not nearly mediocre) that I feel like trash/stupid everyday day. I try really hard, but it's obvious that is a no-no for me. This is making me anxious because I can't change paths now, I'm too old and there is no other career that I can/want to do. I still live with my parents (I pay my part of the rent and my expenses, because I work here and there in summer but not serious jobs) and it is not normal, by now I should be living on my own.

Yes, all guys I've loved laughed at my face, never wanted anything with me. Right now, I have a huge crush on this guy (half teacher of me, too complicated to explain). I took the first step, talked to him (we met at a couple parties, never intentionally, always surrounded by people). I try to stablish some kind of friendship to see if he's interested, but he's always \"too busy\" to talk when I'm trying to make the conversation deep (to know him). He's really nice with me and I'm  trying to be very straight forward about my interest in him, but he's not paying attention (or pretends he isn't realising). We only talk through Instagram, he never asked for my number. This is just adding up and I feel completely unwanted, not worthy, not good enough and so on. \n\nI don't have many friends, but at last they are really good friends.

        "original": "Hey reddit,\n\nI've been a long time lurker here but never had anything to post. I'll start with a little backstory first though.\n\nI'm a grad student in my first year in the US. I came from a different country so it's taken me sometime to get used to how social interactions play out here. During this time I experienced intense feelings of loneliness and isolation. I'd very often think that I'll never be able to meet someone new and have fun with them. For the last few weeks I'd been feeling particularly bad and I was beating myself up by downplaying my existing social skills. I'm a decent looking guy and very well spoken, so I have a lot going for me. But I'd forget all that when I told myself that I'll never really be social here.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to now, I get on Tinder and start talking to a bunch of matches. That gives me a confidence boost. One of the matches suggests that I should try going to a pub alone sometimes. It is very liberating. I think about this for a bit and am overcome with a feeling of intense paranoia, I imagine the worst-case scenario of people just flat out not liking me. Sometime passes and I realize how silly I'm being. It really is true that people don't notice you as much as you think and are generally more forgiving of awkward behavior than what popular media makes it seem. So I decide to go out.\n\nI book an Uber Pool to the pub thinking I'll meet some people on the way there and could get talking. That's exactly what happens - two girls also book the same cab, and once they get in, I jump at the first opportunity to talk to them. One of them says \"We're going to Cornerstone\" to the driver, and I immediately say \"No way, that's where I'm going too!\" And that was it! We started talking, they knew some people at the pub so we all got free shots and I had a fantastic time. I even got the girl's number and am going to text her sometime later.\n\nThis all seems a little convenient, I know, but the important thing to remember there is that I made the choice to go out and that's why this happened in the first place. THE CHOICE was important, and I think we all need to choose to be social for it to happen. I was very nervous for a second before talking with those girls, but again, I chose to speak, that's what made all the difference.\n\nWe all have our struggles, and I'd like to think reading this might give someone the confidence to say, fuck it I'm doing this!  \n\n\nEDIT: This was my first time ever going to a pub alone. Before I'd always have friends with me and I'd stick to them and not talk to other people.   \n\n\n<3",

        "original": "A little backstory:\n\nI am your average gamer/programmer introverted 20 y/o guy. I've always thought that at some point in my life I will just burn my bridges and be alone until I die. I was fine with this, I felt that this is just the way I am. I felt that I don't need any social interactions irl. I loved the idea of walking to the same job everyday, earning money to waste it on myself. It was until the day when my former friend introdused me to one girl - it was love at the first sight. In one week I've talked with her more than with everyone else from last year combined. She also had problems with socializing, but hers weren't as bad as mine. In the first days of our acquaintance, I warned her that I might be a very boring person with nothing to talk about. She didn't care, she accepted me as I was.Three months into our friendship I confessed my feelings to her as did she. She told me that she was scared that I only saw her as a friend. \n\nMonths went on and our feelings for each other grew on and on, until my biggest fear came - I stopped having themes for talking. One and a quarter of a year and my gf knows everything that I will say about any situation, about any news. She knows all my jokes, all my quirks, everything because I am too simple. It started a couple of months ago I started to feel that she is becoming more distant each day. So last week I asked her what was wrong, to which she replied that \"I don't change at all and it's boring to talk to me because of that\". Her words are true. I never try new things, never talk to anyone besides her. I tried to change before, I said to her that I will try. I tried and failed every time. She always forgave me, she always encouraged me to socialize and get better. Every time when I failed, she told me that \"It was amazing that I at least tried to change\". She still believes in me, she still tells me that she loves me. But I am scared, because she is distancing herself and I don't want to dissapoint her again with my failed attempts.\n\nSo what is wrong:\n\nI have no skills besides playing video games and programming. For the past five years I just watched YouTube, listened to the same music and played games. I have no idea how to earn new friends. I started to read books, journals, news - nothing helps, I still don't understand how to talk to people or what to talk to people about. I ask them to talk about themselves, it starts fine, but they get bored of this monologue, I just have nothing to say about anything. I tried to make music, drawing, writing. But it doesn't help me to get friends or to be more interesting to people. (Although I admit, I didn't try to tell anyone about it, besides my gf of course. Like, what I say to them? \"Hello, my name is OP, I don't know how to do anything, besides drawing that I started to practice one week ago! Here is my terrible drawing of a tree! garbage.png\") This just seems dumb to me. \n\nI want to become more interesting to at least save my relationship and maybe in the process I will save myself from the future that I've planned for myself before. But I am miserable, I feel that I don't have enough time, that I will dissapoint my girlfriend again and she will leave me. And this will be only my own fault. Now I fear of being alone and I don't want it. I want to become better, I want to have friends, I just don't know how to earn them. I just feel that if she will leave me now, it'll destroy my self-confidence into oblivion, because I will always know that I could've saved this relationship if I weren't so weak. I don't want to lose her because she helped me so much, because of all the moments that we had, because she is so genuine, kind and caring. Please, help me to understand how to talk to people, please. I don't know how to run across my last bridge that is already on fire.",

        "original": "\nFirst, I would be interested of opinions from short men in particular but of course not just that. I just need someone who can relate to this\n\n\nI need someone to cheer me up and give me some perspective, somethign that it actually constructive and not just it doesn\u2019t matter talk. Because height does matter, I live it everyday, taller man are treated and perceived differently from their peers and especially the opposite sex. \n\nLately I feel like I\u2019m definitely diverging into incel spheres these days and I find it so appealing because there is a lot of harsh \u201ctruths\u201c that are kind of never expressed in other circles and I feel like many people don\u2019t even want to awknowlede them. However the perspective they give you and the general outlook on life is just utterly depressing and devastating and unrealistic although I am not even sure about the last one I know height is a really big deal but I want to overcome it, I have had a very hard time coming to terms with being 165cm(5\u20184.5-5\u20185) at my age 22 now. It\u2018s has had a huge impact from early on in my life, like 15-16 I started to feel like shit that everyone was towering over me, I was in athletics and I could never make it due to an underdeveloped body\n\n\nNow that I\u2019m in college dating is obviously a big issue. I can\u2019t seem to really achieve to attract anyone especially not the kind of women I want to attract. These are in not models i am talking about, just regular girls I find interesting and cute. And i am by no means ugly at all. Just very short.\n\n But I seem to not being able to compete with the massive over supply of men(men female ratio is kind of out of whack at my college) and it\u2018s just absolutely brutal, every other guy is taller than me, literally every single one. Sometimes I can\u2019t even wrap my head around how short I am. Most of the girls are taller than me as well, it\u2018s seriously demoralizing and depressing as fck. Im also balding quite badly which is really rough with my mental state and confidence and of course overall appearance as well. \n\nNext to most guys my age I am really unattractive and look like a joke. I find it impossible to cope and deal with this right now and I have never found a proper way or mindset that can help me accept this fade and work towards a sensible solution. I am just so overwhelmed with bitterness resentfullness and frustration that\u2019s all I can really focus on I try to dress nice, work out to stay in shape, at least try to somewhat socialize but I never meet interesting women for some reason and if I do they are taller than me most of the time so what\u2019s the point\n\n\nBut my height seems to really hold me back. I don\u2019t feel comfortable in my body and I definitely feel like other people are looking down on me. It\u2018s seriously disheartening to realize even though you out in so much effort, some tall looking guy just has to stand there and smile and he can immediately get any girl you can just dream off\n\n\n\nSo how could I not get bitter about it. The only reason I don\u2019t participate more in this community is the stupid sexism which is of course not acceptable. But the bitterness and hopelessness I do have and I think with good reason.. I don\u2019t know where to go and what to do anymore tbh, my life is just passing by\n\n\nTdlr: big issues to overcome my height, places like /r/short give me a place to vent but make me more miserable and resentful long term, not have a productive way to tackle my frustration and achieve success in dating and life",

She's a shy, small girl about 5 feet tall at max (we're both 15, don't worry, it would be legal) and she's probably the most beautiful girl in the whole class. Problem is, we're not exactly in the same class. The whole class is separated into A and B, which have different classrooms, assigned teachers, lecture schedules and much more. I'm in B and she's in A. The only time I can ever talk to her is in English, when the class is separated into three groups, regardless if you're A or B and those three groups stayed from third grade, up to nine grade today. I could just message her on Facebook and I do have her in my friend's list, there are three problems.\n\n\n1. I've never been actually that much of girl lover before, never really fancied another girl like that and I've been a dick to girls up to eighth grade, I've never talked to her outside of class assignments and even if so I was a bit of a dick. I've also been known as the \"guy that smokes weed\" for the last school year and I've gotten a bit into drugs (that's why I'm using a throwaway account, I'm on r/trees and other drugs Subreddits that I could get banned from if I reveal I'm under 18), I've also used to sell weed and she knows it 100% since the other guy I used to do it with, my not-so-friend-anymore blew it around like wildfire and it got to everyone in ninth grade and bled a bit into the eighth (only got one deal with a mate and he still hasn't paid)\n\n\n2. She's the shyest girl in the whole class. Like literally. There are forty people in our class and she has a group of close friends, outside of she never talks to anyone, or at least anyone that I know of.\n\n\n3. I have huge social anxiety. I don't get anxiety attacks anymore, which used to be triggered by wasps that I used to be really afraid of and because I was like that, people would laugh etc. I just used to have anxiety attacks like that. I don't fear wasps and other insects anymore and I've learned to somewhat control my anxiety, I'm that guy that constantly fixes his hair, checks if it looks like he doesn't have a boner etc. etc. and I would probably never even manage to blurt out anything coherent in front of her about her and me going out or anything. \n\n\nHow should I get closer to her? I won't accept any answers like \"flirt with her\" because I don't even get a chance to and anything like \"just get in her DMs\" because I feel like that would make her really uncomfortable and I wouldn't feel good at that. At least tell me what kinda way I should DM her if there really isn't any other way or what reason I should have to do it like \"what was the English homework\" etc. etc. BTW I won't use that one because of how obvious it is. I wouldn't probably even ask you guys and just let her gets some hints in and then talk to her a bit etc. etc. but there is the problem that I might not ever see her again at the start of summer, since I never even saw her outside so she definitely doesn't live where I live (from the few photos on Facebook she did put there, it looks like the urban part of town which I'm not exactly close to).

First I'm 24(M) and I've recently been feeling really lonely causing me to get depressed. My whole life I've lived basically alone and was raised alone. (Only person in my life was my mom and sister but they were always busy working or being out) But people have told me that the hardest part of life is school, work, bills, etc. And I agree they are hard but i figured out that finding out who you are as a person is far more difficult. I feel more lost than ever even though the way my life is going I should be happy. I have an okay job, finished my AA and about to get into a University. I have my own place. And only have about 6 or 7k debt.\n\nThe problem I seem to be having is I can't find \"love\". I understand that my family love me but that's not the type of love Im looking for. Most of my life I've been the \"late bloomer\" as people say. I've never been in a relationship. I've just recently had sex for the first time. (The part that sucks about this is that for some reason people are congratulating me for that instead of earning my AAs). My friends and family call me gay joking around and I'm not but it's recently starting to hurt me. (I have no problem with gay people I just know I'm not gay). I've been talking to girls more often than before but for some reason I seem to continue making mistakes and scaring the girl away or pushing them away. (I believe that it's because I'm not used to having someone in life and it scares me). I see all my friends in relationships and finding someone they love. And I'm happy for them but seeing it just gets me more depressed and lonely. \n\nI don't know what to expect from posting this. I guess I'm hoping it well help me feel better talking about it. I would talk about it to my friends and family but they're the type of people to just say man up, or stop being a little bitch. And that doesn't help, it makes me feel worse, like if I'm the only one going through this. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm lost in what I want from life and being lonely is making me feel worse. \n\n(I'm not feeling suicidal just in case I gave off that vibe. I just feel like if this continues I'm going to be depressed for a while.)",

I'm a university student who is a social recluse not because I don't know how to socialize, but because I find it so boring. \"Nice weather\", \"how are you?\" This kind of small talk really is boring af. \n\nNever really initiated interest in a women before. I'm naturally well-built in size and have the face of a 30 yr old guy lol even though I'm 21. I take care of myself the usual way, like hitting the gym, studying, grooming etc. \n\nI don't seem to have a problem talking to guys at all. In fact I'll sometimes start a conversation out of nowhere just to alleviate the boredom. But women are a completely different story. At some times, my mind wanders to think of them as a different and exotic species. I have to remind myself that they're humans like me and I do find the courage to engage in short conversations with them. Never long. And when I mean women, I mean attractive women at my university. \n\nIf I do engage in conversation, I look into their eyes. I picture the woman and feel the need to be soft with her so that I could date her one day. To appear good, smart, safe and that she thinks I'm a suitable guy.  It's like something sparks inside of me, making me feel off-guard, vulnerable, and makes me forgetful of stuff. I start to sweat and get clammy hands. It becomes noticeable in that them talking to me is a burden to me, and they walk away or avoid eye contact when I see them again.\n\nI have to partly blame the feminist culture on my dating life tbh. If I were to go up to an attractive woman and strike conversation, I feel that she may think I'm very aggressive or taking advantage of her. Men are seen as the predators nowadays and it can take 1 rumor to ruin a man's life. It really hurts my romantic side. \n\nAnd to add on, I cannot simply be \"friends\" with women. There's a voice in my head saying (maybe one day she'll want to be with you, so appear good so that you can seduce her). Sometimes I fake being social just to appear good. I want to change that. I talk just fine with my sisters and family members, but when it comes to attractive women I see a potential future with, I freeze up and can't maintain conversation with her for log periods of time. A period of awkwardness ensues before I tell her I'm off for a class, when it's actually me trying to get away and re-collect myself. It's hard for me tbh. \n\nI probably appear as a sociopath to some of you. Friends did say I was somewhat sociopathic. ",

        "original": "I never considered my self as someone that had social problems. I talked to a bunch of people at school I\u2019m 16M by the way. But over the years I constantly had this empty feeling of loneliness. Even though I talked with a lot of people I didn\u2019t really hang out with any of them outside of school. I never really understood this. At my school I can be considered the big guy with no feelings and I never considered that that would shy people away. I mean I play football and I am commonly liked. One day this feeling of Loneliness just took over. I had a therapist that I rarely see and that was usually only because my mother made me, but this was the first time my first thought was ask for a meeting with my therapist. I have had a therapist for probably about 6 or 7 years (anger issues, anxiety, ect.) but not once have I ever asked to go to one. So of course when I asked my mom to schedule one she freaked out. I\u2019d also like to point out that I like my therapist a lot. He is a really cool guy and even though I haven\u2019t seen him in maybe 8 months I could easily talk with him. Back to me being a dumb jock and shit. I\u2019m not one to cry like ever, but one day I just started bawling. I explained to him my loneliness and stuff and he knew the type of person I was. The first thing he said to me was I was acting like everything was ok to other people. The best way people connect with each other is with emotion and I was walking around high school like everything was perfect (let me tell yah it fuckin isn\u2019t). This allowed for people to like me but no one to genuinely connect with me. He wanted me to find someone I can share my feelings with and that would help me. Finally he said when we share something that can hard to share for some people, others appreciate it and will confide in you and will strengthen your relationship. So my final statement for any emotionless jocks (or any others that have many aquintences but few friends) share your emotions. It won\u2019t scare people away like you think but it will bring them closer to you. Some won\u2019t like you expressing your feelings and that\u2019s why you won\u2019t be friends with everyone. The people who connect with you after sharing your feelings are the real ones. \nI typed this on my phone at 10:30 so if it\u2019s bad sorry\nThank you all...\n\nEdit: While I believe this advice can help me I am struggling to apply to my life.

For context, I have about 10 or so good friends I should be able to relax around and a wider group of friendly acquaintances - about 20 more people or so. I work longish hours (45hrs a week) and see friends/people I know about twice a week.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD and Aspergers as a child but the main ways these manifest are difficulty concentrating, tendency to talk 100 miles an hour and unintentionally interrupt people (I've been actively trying to fix this for about 6 years) and being a little socially clueless. I'm also quite tall with big hair, a loud voice, and essentially I feel like a manic, socially insensitive nuisance. When I think about myself I picture a British version of Janice from Friends, but with far less self confidence. I feel like I get more obnoxious when I've been drinking, which is not too often, but leaves me with a crushing sense of anxiety and self loathing the day after.\n\nI know, logically, that I can't be that bad. A lot of people love me and reaffirm this often. My views are liberal and I actively try to make people around me feel good. In my youth I would often blurt out insensitive things and unintentionally hurt people - now I am older I am trying to atone for this by being actively kind to those around me. I can be daft and vulgar but most often, I see that people laugh with me & not at me (I'm a total clown).\n\nBut I can't stop putting myself down in my head. It's a vicious cycle that I can't seem to stop. I was out at a book club last night and had been drinking, and I'm at my desk cringing at how awful I must have been to be around. How I was too cuddly with someone, how I weirded everyone out with a garbled joke, how I bored someone to death or talked over them. I parted ways with the other attendees and organisers on jovial, friendly terms. Inside I feel horrified at how I behaved. I just dropped a bowl of milk & porridge oats in my work kitchen and I'm trying not to cry at how stupid and clumsy I am.\n\nAm I normal to feel this way? How can I retrain my brain to be kinder to myself? Therapy isn't really an option for me as there are very few public mental health resources where I live and I feel these should be reserved for other people.

That's all. \n\nI think I'm actually a people pleaser; I may seem rough about it, but that's just because there's a consistent buildup of things I want to say, and the things i actually say. \n\nFor example: one of my co workers recently mentions my birthday coming up while the ENTIRE staff is in the room. He knows i hate that day. I did my best to come up with a polite response. idk, i can't remember what i said. what i do remember, instinctively, was telling him to fuck himself, in my head, in my thoughts.

First grade when I was 5 years old. I was behind everyone socially and had difficulty making friends.\n2. I am a piano genius. I can read and play anything. It's my only gift. Listen to Rachmaninoff's Prelude no. 23 in G minor. Learned that when I was 17.\n3. I failed highschool but I graduated because they felt sorry for me. Dropped out of half my classes, failed most, got low Ds, skipped a lot of school. I spent my time contemplating life and playing piano. I was extremely philosophical.\n4. I was sheltered. A lot. My parents wouldn't let me drive. I was \"given\" a job, was horrible at it. I was not taught any life experience.\n5. I am currently an alcohol, I would say.\n\nNow let's get on with the story, up to now. I will end with what my issue is.\n\nEver since I started developing a \"womans\" body I always wanted a real boyfriend. I had about, 7 to 8 online relationships, between the ages 13-17. A couple I still talk to. No one at school talked to me, I was a loner. I didn't have real friends. I tried to be a person of faith and I was going through a major existential crisis. All I could think about is, why are people alive, what are we to do on this Earth? I did not feel mentally stable to be in the real world. I felt like something was always wrong with me. I didn't fit in. I questioned my sexuality some days, I didn't know who I was. Towards the end of m senior year, someone at school noticed me. He touched me in detention one week, and I guess I was hooked. By touch I mean, touched. I am not going into vivid details, let's just say it was under the table and I did it back. He took me out that weekend and had his way with me in the park, outside, in the middle of the night, on the ground. Because I was still a virgin, and he was black, I finished him by sucking him off. He bought me a burger and dropped me off back at home. Couple weeks later I go to a local youth group. I am, 17 I believe, and the youth leader is 23. He took me somewhere to teach him how to play piano, since I was so good at it. He had his way with me in his car, for hours on end, and we kept seeing eachother throughout the rest of the week. I let him do whatever he wanted to me. He had a fiance in Canada. I snuck out of my house at midnight to go meet him. I blocked his number after a week to feel like I had some kind of self-entitled control. I was still hungry. I needed more. I graduate highschool and go get a job my mom hooked up for me. Yes, I was very coddled. A man there was 32. I led him on and he fell for it, kept talking to me and wanted to be with me. Was going to wait till I turned 18. I don't remember whether or not he kissed me. Throughout all this time I ended up getting into relationships, lying about being in other relationships, waiting until the guy wanted to really be with me or propose to me out of \"Good christian faith\" and immediately cut them out or blocked them. I snuck out of my house at midnight on my bike and met up with guys. After some time, I start to get a lot of anxiety about what I am going to do with my life so I decide to go on a whim and join the military. I will not say what branch, but let's say it's the branch that's NOT gay. I end up \\*\\*\\*\\*ing a lot. A lot. When I was 18 and in the fleet, I went and got married, lied, cheated on him, and got a divorce. Ended up being with even more men. Every other night I have someone in my bed or I am in someone's bed. If I were to count every single guy, it would add up to about 80. I lost my virginity at 17. I am 21 right now. I am still in the military. I am upholding 6 real relationships with 6 different men at the same time and none of them know that I am talking to all of them at once. Not even the ones who just want to commit to an open relationship. I have 3 more men who are expecting to see me at some point to start a real relationship and I do not want to let them down, either. I do not want to let anyone down. I have to uphold everything. I have manipulated all of them to be happy with me. I have lied to all of them. I have had sex over a million times already. I never use condoms. I have had one abortion. I have downed about 30 plan B pills, if you count them all. The most I did at one time, back to back, was 4. Night after night after night. The lowest I have ever been was, I went a-wall when I was supposed to be on leave to California and instead I drove to someone's house and hid in their closet for a week so no one could find me and only came out to have sex with them. He brought food up for me every night, and bought me all the plan b pills. I am not proud of that, but it was all I wanted to do. I couldn't not do it. Even though I payed for my plane ticket and everything.\n\nI have been raped about 3 times now. Yes, I say about. I blame myself for one of them..\n\nWhat has made me crack? I was forced to be alone in this special training I am on so I have not been able to satisfy my needs and as I look in the mirror, at myself, I do not know what I am looking at. I get anxiety and hug my sleeping bag, looking for comfort but finding none. I have been very successful in the military. I was hazed a little bit starting out, and I developed into the biggest \\*\\*\\*hole you'll ever meet. I have a heart and I can be nice to people, when I see someone hurt I try to be as selfless as possible. But when it comes to people and friends, I do not and have never maintained an active, healthy relationship with someone ever since I was born. I have never actually had real friends. Just classmates. Acquaintances. Peers I am forced to be around. All my contacts on my phone are DTF contacts and people I work with. I have never had someone actually be my friend. People have been friendly to me and I have been friendly back, but I do not know what to do or how to react to anyone. All I know how to do is \\*\\*\\*\\*.\n\nRight now. I know this is wrong. I can't be happy. I am never happy. What is wrong with me? Why am I so good at manipulating people? Why do things have to be this way? Ever since I was 15 I have been taking nudes, saving them, sending them... But really, who am I. I am financially unstable. Still paying off divorce debt. I don't know what I am going to do when I become a civilian again. What kind of person am I? Is any of this normal? Have people been through worse? I started out as a Christian. And this is what happens..... Now that I have been completely honest with you, as of now, I am experiencing self-worth issues, I lack my self identity, everything I experience every day is a lie, I have anxiety, I over think things. All I do with my spare time is go to the gym to try and get as big as possible because all I truly care about is my muscle mass and how many \"appointments\" I have. I feel like I am mentally messed up in the head and I need to know now. What steps do I take to stop all of this? All of it is for some kind of self-gain, all of it is to satisfy me in some way, shape, or form. I have messed a lot of people up in the process. I have broke a lot of people in the process. I feel like now it's my turn to be broke. I need to end this. I have to end this. If I ever want to have kids. If I ever want to have a husband. If I ever want to have a life of meaning.... of worth. Where I can look at a picture my daughter made one day and smile at it, instead of manipulating everyone around me to cheat. That's another thing. I have never been in a relationship where I didn't cheat. Ever since my first heartbreak when I was 13, I have felt evil inside...\n\nUPDATE\n\nI cracked again. I got super drunk off half a bottle of crown and half a bottle of Jack. Apparently people were touching me but I wasn't about it. Someone hacked into my Facebook and riled up like 6 guys on my messenger whom look like ive \"fucked\" but it actually had family and superiors in the list, and made a group chat and announced \"I am a slut.\" I removed everyone from the room and only four people saw. My mom was in it. I wasn't mad or upset, it was honestly kind of awkward but the issue is.... It hit me hard. Because, that wasnt even all of them.. there's also snapchat. I just feel disgusting. I got my ass chewed out by my co-workers for getting unbelievably drunk and there's probably going to be paperwork waiting for me at the office but... I just can't shake this pain. This hangover has been the worst hangover of my life. I almost killed myself today but a kind soul saved me, and I've felt safe most of the day. I try not to go to my room because my roommate absolutely hates me because I'm going through a divorce and still collecting BAH while living in the barracks so apparently I'm just a crook now. I don't want to feel like a burden so I never go to my room, so she can live happily... Ive made a decision today that this has to be it. I can't drink anymore. I can't.... People talk, nobody enjoys it, what am I trying to prove? I almost got in two fights last night, I don't even know how to fight. I just have all this anger and anxiety I can't shake... Even if I go to the gym. Workout. Do work. I can't get rid of this anxiety. I haven't yet looked at the sex addict therapy but I'm doing some research right now... I downed another plan b pill last week and, I'm not proud of it.. \n",

Anyway I am 17 right now and in the last year of school.\u00a0 I have always been more of an introverted, shy guy especially towards girls. Three years ago we had a new girl joining our class. I fell in love with her and I think she was interested too. (yes, I now stupid idea to fall in love with a classmate). But\u00a0 because I was too shy I never made any serious move for maybe a year or so. One day, I still don't know why, I wrote her one of these weird text messages, like \"hey you're so cute, wanna hang out some time?\". Of course I got rejected and I totally understand this.\n\nBut now the problem began. I think this gave her some kind of a confidence boost. Some months later she had something going on with one of my classmates. After that she never stopped and seemed to have a lot of affairs and she seems proud of those. I was still attracted to her and it took away any confidence I had towards girls. She has a quite special face and developped a very attractive body which made me saying to myself that there is probably no second one like her although I now it's bullshit. She always treats me like an old friend and I don't know why but this really fucks me up. She is always flirting with other classmates and just seems to have a good time. In this situations I always get very quiet and can barely look at anyone. Also when she\u00a0is talking about the guys she mets I feel like someone is punching my stomach. She always\u00a0makes me feel\u00a0like I have\u00a0a really\u00a0low status.\u00a0\n\nLately my attraction\u00a0for her is changing into\u00a0hate and\u00a0envy and this makes\u00a0me\u00a0feel even\u00a0worse.\u00a0\n\nIn the last three years I have never kissed a girl or even tried to flirt with someone, while my classmates are getting girlfriends and having sex (ok, not all of them). This just makes me feel like shit. \n\nAlthough I would never admit this to myself, I am probably afraid that if I try to approach another girl and fail that she will\u00a0 laugh at me or some shit. Yes I know this sounds really fucked up, and I theoretically now that failure is nothing bad.\n\nBtw my life is not that bad as it sounds, I have learned a lot of new things in the last years, I wrote a kindle ebook, created several websites, invested in cryptocurrencys and started coding.\n\nSorry for my first world problem and this too long post but I guess I just wanted to have it off my chest.

        "original": "Hey Reddit, I've asked this question a couple of times but I keep getting responses saying \"just wait\" and I'm really sick of that response. If that is what you have to say, then please don't be the 29318th person to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Situation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a 2nd year university student studying mechanical engineering with a specialisation in Aerospace and Artificial Intelligence. I'm currently interning at the Canadian National Research Council for integrating Artificial Intelligence into the Canadian system. I have been diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, MDD, and GAD. I have MDD and GAD controlled via medication and therapy but apparently my therapist says that no one can really \"cure autism\", let alone treat it significantly. This shapes me into the person I am, which is:\n\n1. I am a pure geek. I love math and science to hell and back. If I'm bored, I'm coding AI to play games just for fun.\n   1. For those who are curious, I'm currently implementing Q-learning mixed in with a convolution neural net that can play any digital basic video game. Ex. anything from pacman to mario with this single program.\n2. I have no life outside of academia. I've tried to get into some things like sports but I just end up getting hazed and bullied, and that contributes to my MDD. I've also tried some engineering clubs but have had difficulty socialising. My GAD and Asperger Syndrome make me a complete introvert. I only have 2 close friends with me and 1 long distance close friend. I can't take more friends than I can handle.\n3. I have no hobbies outside of studying and coding. I know a lot of people are going to suggest that I get hobbies to meet people, but the only hobbies that I really enjoy are designing and coding and learning. Whenever I do find an event for such (small events; I can't handle too many people), there are ZERO women. There is not a single female in my whole engineering class, and only 2 girls I have ever met in other engineering departments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy credentials for a potential mate:\n\n1. I have a bright future in all industries pertaining to A.I., Aerospace, and Entrepreneurship. My life has long term stability.\n2. I am a shy version of Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory, but have a lot of confidence when it comes to academia and anything scientific. My only weak spot in the sciences is biology and advanced chemistry and I excel in every other field to a moderate degree.\n3. I am a 20th century history nut.\n4. Aside from my autism, I have the rest of my mental disorders under control. I have experience with mental health and have experienced the darkness in this world; I have grown and have valuable experience to share and use.\n5. I have a solid resilient caring and chill persona. Because of my past experiences, I truly value a sentimental human-human connection, as it was something I never had. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy I suspect I'm struggling\n\n1. Women don't like geeks. All throughout my life, I've been harassed and bullied to the point where people chanted \"kill yourself!\" when I was about to end my life in front of them with a razor (I ended up going to the hospital, I'm all ok now). So I've rationally came to the conclusion that geeks and nerds are not welcomed in today's world. After all, nerds and geeks are automating everything to take over other people's jobs. People don't like that I guess. A lot of this bullying was happening in '09 and '10, so I think the bully's parents were going through hard times and were blaming automation and such. But once again, I'm not too certain.\n2. I've never had friends until last year, so I'm socially stagnant at a 14 year old's social skill. Because of severe bullying and harassment, I effectively went through all of middle school and high school without talking to anyone outside of my teachers and group members for projects. So I never really developed advanced social skills, well, because no one really gave me the chance. I can't really practice conversations when I'm scared of people thinking they want me to kill myself. I mean, now I know that's not the case after 2 years of therapy, but that is why I was stagnant until now.\n3. I can't learn 5 years of social skills in 1 year. The issue with saying I'm socially immature as an excuse is that I know a lot of people in far worse situations than me getting women. Hell, 13 and 14 year old teens have relationships. So I don't understand why social immaturity would be too big of an issue. After all, don't all of us have an Achilles heel? Mine happens to be human interaction. For others, it may be alcohol, or parties, or food, or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiven my analysis, what does the Reddit community think? How should I go about getting a romantic experience in my life? I'm honestly sick of \"just waiting\" and \"let it happen\" because it wasn't until I forced myself to get friends did I get three close friends. Same logic with women, right? After all, how would I have gotten friends if I didn't go knocking on every door in my dorm and asking if they were interested in being friends with me. That's how I got my friends! It did take about 300 no's, a complaint from the dorm don, and warnings from the university residency office, for 2 yes's, but that's the reality I face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I did find getting romantic partners to be different. Over the course of 2 years, I've asked out 35 women and got rejected by all of them, including the friends I have now. It was this that got me labelled as the \"pervy loser\" in my engineering cohort. This effectively eliminated all potential mates within the science and engineering community of my university. So this approach doesn't seem to be working.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo how do I go about this?",

I have friends but the only thing that brings us together is school work (they don't share common music genre interest and I know they'll say no). I don't buy food on campus not that I can't afford it but because of the mere fact that I don't want to embarrass myself in front of people. I don't go to free events on campus. I don't go to any gatherings or have much social interactions other than people from my classes and 95% of the time it's just lecture.   \n\n\nThere are so many thoughts that have restricted me form buying that damn ticket. Traveling to and from the show will be scary alone, do I want to put myself in that position? The doors open at 7 pm and close at 8 pm so does that mean I should show up at 7:50 so I could avoid as much alone time as possible while everyone is talking to their friends? What will people think of my apparel? What I'm most comfortable in and wear often is chinos with a tshirt and a basic sweater over. What happens when and if I encounter someone?  \n\n\nSCREW IT! Damn to hell with these thoughts. I know one thing will be true if I didn't go to this show, I'll regret it! I would wake up and go to bed for the next month just thinking how stupid I was because of the voice in my head telling me of things that never happened yet! So I bought the ticket and my heart was pounding. Literally, my heart was pounding from just buying tickets??? How silly is that.. Just imagining myself walking out after the show I'll feel like climbing a mountain. The show is two weeks from now and I'm still anxious but mostly excited. I think I learned something in the past two weeks considering to go to this show or not. Have you ever turned a certain age and think \"Well damn.. I didn't do much in life yet and I'm 1/5 the way through my life span, what the hell am I doing with my life?\"   \n\n\nI hope this reached out to someone and you do the same thing.

It's an experience meant to happen sometime in your lifetime, not regrets of what should have been. Life is about experiences the good and the bad.

        "original": "Last year in January I [17M] began working at a small grocery store. I never was able to really form a connection with my coworkers. \n\nI think it all started with the interview. I was nervous as it was my first one, and I ended up being a different person. I acted and said things in the way I thought my boss would like. I wasn\u2019t original or genuine. I wasn\u2019t being myself. \n\nThis continued as I began working there. I was never able to find the balance between professional and casual. I wasn\u2019t used to meeting new people of different ages and having to work with them, so it was really awkward for me to adjust. \n\nSo everyday I had to work, I\u2019d basically put on a mask. I had never had a genuine conversation with any of my coworkers and they never really saw who I actually was. When I came into the store with my friends while I was not working, I felt incredibly awkward because that really demonstrated for me the difference between \u201cwork\u201d me and actual me. \n\nI quit working there in October, partly due to the pay, partly due to how much I hated it, and partly due to me wanting to get a fresh start at my new job. \n\nWell, a couple days ago I had an interview at Best Buy. It went pretty well, and my interviewer said he was going to pass me on to the GM for another interview, which was promising. \n\nHowever, I felt really uncomfortable. For one, he made it seem like working there was a huge challenge and required an excellent work ethic with all the stress it provides. But the main reason why I am so skeptical about working there is the other employees. \n\nPretty much everyone that works there is a 30-40 year old man, and for someone who\u2019s 17, it was really hard to feel comfortable there. All the workers seem nice, and besides the supposed difficult workload, the atmosphere seems pretty easy going. The employees all seemed like they were really good friends, and most of them acknowledged me when I was given a tour. However, I still just felt so uncomfortable. \n\nWhen some of them talked to me, I sort of had flashbacks of my previous job: I\u2019d smile, laugh, and say some half-ass response rather than being genuine. I don\u2019t really know how to get around this. At least I\u2019m aware, but I don\u2019t know how to just relax and be myself around coworkers that aren\u2019t near my age. \n\nI think I just lose confidence when around people older than me. I don\u2019t know, but I think it just makes me feel smaller and less important. \n\nTL;DR: I am awkward around people that aren\u2019t my age, and I can never just be myself. ",

When I was like 15, I thought I had the entire world figured out, and that I had to be this hardened soldier, and that everybody who thought differently from me was a weak sheeple. C is like that now, and both of us are 20. S stops talking to us if we criticize her or C, ever, so our group has to put up with him. She is an extremely nice person otherwise so we tolerate it for the most part. He is helping her leave a bad home life, and they expect to be together for the rest of their lives. She thinks everything that happened so far is my fault and that he is doing nothing wrong.\n\n**TL;DR: C is extremely judgmental if I disagree with him. He twists my words around to make me out to be an awful person, and if I criticize him, I am just a man hater who took what he said out of context on purpose. He thinks everything I do is carefully calculated with ulterior motives and secret agendas. If I tell him to drop it, he accuses me of censoring everybody who has a different opinion from me, and that I must be jealous of his success and that he is dating my friend. Absolutely nobody sees me that way either. He says I deep down feel scared of him. I leave every single argument feeling like I need to die, and that I am a secret sociopath despite how much my friends reassure me. Is it wrong to not talk to him ever again? My friends guilt me whenever I ignore people.**\n\nC is weirdly judgmental when you have different hobbies and beliefs. If C likes spiders and you hate spiders, he says, \"That sounds stupid, but you do you.\" My friend K feels too intimidated to disagree with him. He was talking to her about how my culture is just gangs, guns, etc, and I said I would not be participating because I disagree with everything he said. He said, \"You can talk if you want. I just might call you dumb.\" If you actually do agree with him, he just reinterprets a single point you made to make you look stupid until you just give up and agree with him. He says he lacks empathy for anybody who is not his friend, and I could genuinely see him not caring if my brother shot himself. He only likes talking to me if we talk about photography or travelling.\n\nWe were fighting last night. I am an abuse survivor who is in the process of leaving, to which all of my friends can verify that is true. He said I just wanted to be a victim because I choose not to fight back against my father who has a legal team, and that it is stupid of me to not leave right away instead of learning how to drive and saving up $3,000. I told him the conversation was over because he kept being a jerk about it, and he said I have no right to censor him just because he refuses to coddle me.\n\nHe has this weird conspiracy that deep down, I am some kind of horrible person who plans his day around being his inconvenience. Everything I do is carefully calculated with hidden motives. If I disagree with him on something, I just have a moral high horse superiority complex, and that I think all men are evil. (Even though I am also a man.) Deep down, I must be secretly in love with S. That inside of me is this whimpering child who is jealous of how successful he is. Literally nobody sees me that way except for him, and I asked almost all of my friends.\n\nIs it wrong to not want to talk to him? Another kid in the group constantly called me the N word, and another friend said I was being narcissistic for ignoring that kid when that kid was trying to have an actual conversation with me.\n\nEvery single time I leave a heated conversation with him, I want to end my life for the next couple hours, in addition to constantly questioning if I have narcissistic personality disorder or if I am a sociopath in denial.

TLDR at the bottom\n\nSo I (22f) am a 4th year student at university set to graduate next year so I guess I still have a chance to make friends while at school. So far, my only \"friends\" were made in my first year living in residence where we collectively got drunk and partied constantly with not much more in common. Some of the gang are tighter than others and I feel like I get invited to things only as an extension of first year vibes to get drunk once or twice a semester. And now that most of them are graduating, I fear I'll have no social life at all. \n\nI've been longing for more fulfilling relationships with people I can talk to about real things! My biggest problem is getting classmates to become friends. I can small talk and get along well with the people I have group assignments with but I'm too anxious to invite them to hangout outside of working together. And after 4 years of school, there are plenty of classmates I recognise but don't know but would like to get to know... \n\nI just want to know if I'll be considered a total weirdo if I try sparking up a convo with someone I think is super cool. In particular, this one girl has great style and I've seen her at the local live music shows and she's getting the same degree so I feel like we'd vibe well. I know were getting the same degree because in September she and I chatted. 7 months ago!! and I blushed really bad during the convo because I already thought she was cool and I have a hard time talking to people sometimes. Since then, we have smiled at each other in the hall but not much more. I feel super creepy for developing like a friendship crush and I want to know if its too late for me to try to build something?\n\nWhat are the best ways to invite classmates to become friends?\n\nTLDR: haven't developed any friends with more in common than an alcohol problem in the 4 years I've been at uni. I have a friend crush on a girl that I talked to 7 months ago. Would I be considered creepy if I tried to talk to her again? How do people turn classmates into friends?",

I am a 22 year old, female, college senior, and I feel as though one of my friends is being toxic and abusive towards me. Let's call her Jade.\n\nJade and I have been friends since our freshmen year and back then she was the sweetest girl. She supported me through some really dark times and never put me down. Eventually another girl joined our group, we'll call her Blue.\n\nBlue and Jade really hit it off and really connected over their bisexuality. They started to go to our school's SAGA(sexuality and gender alliance) organization. I was happy that they became friends and we were the perfect trio. However, towards the end of sophomore year, things started to change. \n\nJade and Blue started to make fun of me for wearing plaid shirts and would ask me if I was still straight every time we hung out. Jade would often tell me that I wasn't straight because at the time, I was dating someone who was non-binary.\n\nWhen junior year started, our group grew to include Donny, an attractive young man. After that Jade's behavior started to change again. She started to put me down, make fun of me for my clumsiness, and she tried to make me feel awkward about my sheltered background. Blue also started to act like Jade as well.\n\nWhile I admit that they were supportive as I broke up with my partner during junior year. They did drill it into my head that I only got out of the situation because of them, not because of my own strength. \n\nWhen I was ready to start dating again Jade would constantly criticize my taste in men and call them ugly or neck-beards. Jade also criticizes the races of the guys I like. She still does this today. Jade would encourage me to try dating people that she approved of. When I would come back from dates, Jade would and still does pick the guys apart or calls me shallow for not dating short men often.\n\nNow that she and Blue are sexually active, Jade renamed our girls only group chat to reflect the fact that I'm still a virgin. They also leave me out of sexual conversations.\n\nNow I'm in my last two months of college and I find myself thinking that Jade is a toxic person yet I can't let go of the Jade who was nice to me, the one who was my friend. We still have good times but they don't last long. The group dynamic is now twisted with Jade at the top and me at the bottom.\n\nEvery time a new person joins our group, it doesn't take long before they start acting like Jade and start treating me like her. I try to assert myself but Jade just tells everyone that I'm pmsing. Its gotten worse since junior year. I'm turning to reddit for advice, in the hopes that I'm simply being too sensitive. ",

I had therapy a few years ago, but I don\u2019t really count that experience because I only went a few times and it just didn\u2019t help me at all.\n\nI was really nervous going there. The drive there felt scarier than going to a job interview. I really didn\u2019t know what to expect, and I was scared to talk about personal issues that I've never really spoken to anyone about before, besides my parents and people I met online.\n\nMy therapist was a nice, younger woman. She first asked me if I was nervous, and I said that I was. She was a little bit stern but she seemed compassionate and understanding. The session was kind of like an evaluation where she would ask me questions relating to anxiety and depression. Lots of \u201cscale of 1-10\u201d questions, lots of questions relating to family history of mental illness, and general yes/no questions.\n\nShe asked what I go to school for, and if I enjoy it. I replied no. I actually hate what I'm studying. But it's too late to change it, I don't want to be in college for another 4 years. She also asked how my childhood was in relation to making friends, I told her that I always struggled to fit in, and I still struggle to this day. I explained that there were long periods throughout my life where I just didn't have any friends at all, and I never had more than two friends at a time.\n\nShe asked me if I fear going into crowded stores or walking in crowded areas. I said not really, because I usually do that every day. She then asked me what my social anxiety felt like. I told her that I have immense trouble fitting in, I worry too much about what the person I\u2019m talking to is thinking about me during a conversation, I overanalyze people\u2019s reactions, and most people seem to be apprehensive towards me. I told her that I also fear going to social events and have trouble mingling and striking conversations with others, and just generally lack social skills.\n\nShe also asked questions if I date or if I\u2019m sexually active. A hard \u201cno\u201d to both. She asked why, I just said I wasn\u2019t sure. I told her that I knew it wasn\u2019t normal, probably because of my social anxiety. She told me that it wasn\u2019t necessarily abnormal, but it is atypical at my age...which stung a little. Even my therapist is telling me that I should have dated by now. At least she understood that anxiety and depression can make dating difficult.\n\nWe talked about my relationship with my parents and other family members. I talked about some issues I\u2019ve had with my relationship with my parents and other family members that I honestly never really talked about before.\n\nAt the end, she asked if there was anything else on my mind. I told her that I was unhappy about the fact that I don't have any friends. I also explained that I have very little, basically non-existent self esteem. She didn\u2019t offer much feedback, mostly just took notes and moved onto the next question. I did want some feedback from her, but I suppose I\u2019ll get more of that in my next session.\n\nAnyway. That was the session. It felt good to get some of it out, but I also feel a little bit weird after spilling certain things that have been bothering me. I don\u2019t feel any different really, but it kind of opened my eyes to how bad my anxiety is. Mostly every question was a definite agree, except for questions about violence and hurting myself. When she asked me questions about how often I feel negative, depressed, anxious, I replied to nearly every question with \u201cevery day\u201d. I was a little paranoid that she might be thinking that I\u2019m too \u201cmessed up\u201d or beyond help. I\u2019ll have to go to more sessions before I get a real idea on if it helps me or not. Right now I just feel kind of depressed.",

I realize very well that I am not the most sociable person, but I am dedicated to improve myself. \n\nThe first thing everybody on the internet is telling me, is to improve social skills by practice. I really have no idea what to do though: I live in a moderately sized town with only a couple dozen night activities (bars, clubs, etc). I certainly want to go out a lot more than the friends I talked about earlier, so going out with them is not always an option: they are constantly working hard to get at least passing grades in school, whereas I barely have to do anything. I even would like to go out on weekdays, if only to get a good deal of 'practice' with social skills. Because I am currently also trying to lose some weight I do want to avoid (binge) drinking alcohol.\n\nI am anxious about what people (especially of my age, or vague acquaintances) would think of me when they would see me all on my own. I also have no idea how I would connect with new people in such situation: most people are not alone but with a group of friends. \n\nAny advice here? If anybody has another suggestion to make my evenings/nights a bit more enjoyable (obviously not interested in any more 'alone time') and practice my social skills in a different manner, please let me know too.",

        "original": "hi, hello, advice seeker here. So I want to know some good ways of becoming a better human being and conversationalist. I dont want to explain my entire life story to you so Ill try to keep it short and sweet. Pretty much my problem started when I was bullied in school and was taken out and homeschooled 7th to 9th grade. Went back to public school in 10th grade, became a social outcast, and went back on homeschool till I graduated. Went to community college but all my classes were online so no social skills were learned their either. Fast forward to now (currently 23 years old), I work from home with a great company, and great people, but yet again, no chance of brushing up on my social skills. I am bilingual, originally born in Europe, but I speak English with no accent, people don't even know I'm not \"American\" until they read my name. But I do have somewhat of a problem with my lingo, I fumble over my words a lot and its hard for me to explain what I mean with my words sometimes, Im all over the place. At home and within my foreign community, I am the complete opposite of what I appear to the outside world. I am strong and confident, funny and loud, I always start the conversations, and organize the events, people say I am the life of the party. But at work, around American \"friends\" or strangers, I am so often the quiet, socially awkward and misunderstood person. It drives me crazy but I dont know how to change the stupid physiological switch I make around other people and why I care so much what they think of me. Sometimes its not even that, sometimes I dont care what they think of me but I still end up saying something that just doesnt make sense, and I get all frazzled. I watch so many videos and read books on the topic of confidence and self help, but I dont understand how I can be so confident and confrontational with some people and the complete opposite with others. I wish I had went to a four year college and did things like go to parties when I was younger that would have helped me break out of this habit, but I work full time now and don't really have a need for college or that life. Nonetheless, I want to become a better speaker, conversationalist, a more knowledgeable, human being, and just be more interesting in general and confident with who I am no matter who is around me. I have recently started just reading books outloud and acting out personas to help with my vocabulary/flow, but again, I hope there is something more I can do that could help make me better. Any ideas? ",

        "original": "(To those with anxiety who might be reading this, please don't. Scroll down to the comments first and listen to others opinions first because I'm not a professional, and though these are my true feelings, I want to state them so that I can help her, not to discourage people from trying to form relationships, also sorry if I should take this to another sub.)\n\nHey, so my friend and I haven't known each other for very long (maybe a year at most) but in that time we've grown quite close. I've introduced her to a bunch of my friends and we all get on pretty swell.\n\nHowever, she has anxiety through the fucking roof, and (I want to put this delicately because I know a lot of people with anxiety and such browse this sub and I don't want any of you guys to feel like bad people) recently I'm having an increasing amount of difficulty managing it. And additionally, though I am grateful for her being open and honest about her feelings, I can't help but feel like she's making me and our friends out to be some kind of evil that is secretly plotting to hurt her.\n\nMost recently, she told me that she feels like I \"just don't care about recording\" (we have a band together). I have told her time and time again that I do care, I just have work and university on my plate as well so it's quite hard for me to balance everything all at once. I told her that (and this was probably a bad idea) she sucks at reading people's feelings because I was quite hurt by her accusation. What I wanted to say but didn't was that I don't feel like she trusts me. But I get the sense that she can't truly ever trust me or our friends because she always finds tiny hints and details to blow up out of proportion.\n\nThat may seem like a smaller example, but it's an accusation my friends and I seem to get a lot. If we don't reply to a message, if we're unorganized about going to an event  (like all 20 y/os are), if we don't talk a lot in a group chat, etc. Out of all my friends she's the one who I see most often, and the one who I talk to the most with online, but I still get told that I don't care enough.\n\nI just got a message from her saying that I filled her with self-doubt because she's changing her degree to a much more STEM focused field, and I told her that it would be a big difference from what she's currently studying, and that she should be prepared instead of encouraging her.\n\nI'm quite frustrated because I don't feel like I can act like myself fully around her, like I have to be constantly reassuring her that our friends don't hate her.\n\nAnd they don't, they really do like her. I really like her. But there are other instances where my friends have felt the same way I do. And my friends, love them though I do, might not be as willing to work on this with her, and (again, I know how this might read to people with anxiety, please don't let this ruin your self-confidence)  I worry that her constant worrying might actually drive them away. And I really don't want that to happen because I think she's really cool. But I and our friends can't help but feel like her anxiety is damaging our relationship, and I can't help but feel like I must be doing something wrong when she keeps telling me that she feels like \"I don't care\". It's actually quite hurtful and though I understand where it comes from, I want her to acknowledge that it hurts me. But I feel like if I say that to her, that will only cause her to shut down and stop talking about her problems, which isn't what I want.\n\nSo is there any way I can let her know that she's hurting us and herself, without making her feel like she should just shut up and not talk about her problems? I feel like in the past whenever I have tried to express these feelings I always make her feel like a monster. That is not my intention.\n\n",

        "original": "Hi, \n\nA few things have happened to me in the past month which have made me re-evaluate my social life and relationship with family. One of the particular triggers was becoming a little obsessed over a colleague I had a crush on, who left the company last week when I planned to ask her out, and before.  It turned out she had a boyfriend so I feel a bit ridiculous, but she is also 6 years younger than me. I took my time asking due to concern it could be classed as sexual harassment, and only found out she had a bf by finding her on social media. I read into a really sweet goodbye note she left me...which really was just a friendly memo like the office 'thank you' card she left. \n\nThe fact I interpreted what may have been friendliness or even basic professional courtesy as romantic interest is making me ask why I am so needy and struggling to consider many options.\n\nMy brother is also getting married later this month and has attained a PhD as well as led some social groups.\n\nFinally I saw two 'ghosts from my past' earlier in the week. One was either my ex, with a new man and kid; I glanced in her direction a few times and she walked away. Another was my old stoner friend who like me is not far from rock bottom. Difference being that he seems comfortable there when all our other school friends have moved on. Seriously they've all left our hometown to either work in another city or abroad. Many are married and have their own homes. \n\nI'm not content to stay at rock bottom, I just try not to think about it TOO hard as it's a recipe for toxic shame and sliding back into depression. I'm proud that I finally moved out at the end of last year.\n\nI feel like now that I am 26, if I don't take action soon to seek out new friendship circles it is only going to get harder. I already missed my opportunity at University due to my poor mental health.\n\nMost adults I've spoke to about this just make it sound fatalist. That it just 'gets harder' to make time to see everybody as get older. However, they still manage to have friendships and relationships. \n\nAt risk of sounding desperate I would like to expand my social circle, and that includes meeting women. My friends who I hang out with are awesome but they're also a safe choice. It's a mixed-sex group and we have been friends for years, but all we really ever do is meet up once every few weeks and go for a meal or to see a movie, often at the same pub. The few times we have tried socialising with other people have involved drama and generally failed.\n\nMy problem is that if I am invited to these things, I struggle to say No. I might even ditch my (admittedly not set-in-stone) plan to finally join a new meet-up group in town. I cannot discern whether this is fear of change, because I feel an obligation to be there for them...or a bit of both. We've actually lost touch with 2 social groups over the years for...no apparent reason. Well, one are the now-married friends in new cities, the other however I can't explain. We just started hanging out with the one close-knit friendship group every time.\n\nI also have a helicopter mother who wants to see me a lot and check up on me (I've recently moved out). I feel some responsibility for managing her anxiety about how I'm getting on. Catch-22 of course as I would hope she would be happy with me going out and meeting new people. \n\nAs to the extended family in general, my brother chose his social life and career over family. I sometimes feel like I have to over-compensate for my brother never calling home because my grandma will be dead one day, for example. My sister has an excuse; she is a single mum and studying full-time to become a nurse. She's always asking for Mum, Dad or grandparents to babysit while she works nights.\n\nAny help you can give would be greatly appreciated. I just feel like I still give off anxiety-ridden socially awkward hermit vibes and having such a limited social circle may be part of that. I sometimes wonder if I derive validation from defining myself as reliable, dependable, loyal, etc. I.e. standard Nice Guy bullshit. \n\n(And, irony of ironies, I am often late...)\n",

        "original": "I am very quiet and I guess maybe I don\u2019t know how to prolong conversations with others, or how to make it funny, or fun or cute or bubbly or interesting. For example, I\u2019ve been working at my new (ish) job for a little over a year. And I still haven\u2019t made any connections with any of my coworkers. I\u2019m still incredibly shy with some of them (especially the males, I think my relationship issues with my dad kind of subconsciously make me afraid of men),l. I work at a restaurant, and it has a pretty laid back ambience, where we can all speak and be silly with one another most of the time. A lot of the girls I work with have cute little relationships with one another. Some are sillier and laugh a lot together, some hug one another hello and goodbye. They try speaking to me sometimes, and sometimes we\u2019ll have little bits of conversation. But they don\u2019t have a very long lifespan. I think\u2014 no, I KNOW\u2014 I have to be the reason for this. I try asking questions as much as I can. During conversations with everyone though, I feel it\u2019s important to note that I have severe social anxiety\u2014maybe something else too, who knows at this point\u2014 and my face will turn painfully beet red. It has gotten better with time, but it\u2019s still something I\u2019m working on. It\u2019s hard to maintain eye contact too during this, but I will usually, and sometimes I\u2019ll even lightly joke about it (\u201cidk why my face is doing that!\u201d \u201cOh there goes my face again!\u201d) if it\u2019s super obvious and bad. I thought sometimes saying that kinda stuff out loud and acknowledging it will ease how painfully embarrassing it is and maybe the redness too. I kinda found out that when I speak about myself, or people ask me questions about me, I turn red. I do have a fear of over-sharing, that I think sometimes even sharing a bit about myself causes a flare up. How can I help myself get OUT of my head when speaking to people, and just say what I want and need to say? I understand it\u2019s because I live in my head too much. I just cannot get out of my head. I want to be warm and hug people too. I want to have friends that consider me helpful and funny and we can go places and talk about anything. I just overthink things and what I could possibly contribute to conversations, and sometimes when I do, the subject has already changed in them. I am sad, I feel like I don\u2019t have anyone besides my bf to talk to. I don\u2019t really go hang out with friends either. I have 1 true friend that I\u2019ve been friends with before my anxiety went through the roof in my teen years. I haven\u2019t recovered from my anxiety since. If i didn\u2019t know her before then, I probably wouldn\u2019t have her either. Even when I\u2019m hanging out with \u201cfriends\u201d to catch up, they have very kindly pointed out how I never speak about myself. I try to sometimes, but I think it\u2019s also deeper than me just not talking enough... \n  I am exhausted with myself. I know I\u2019m impersonal and not memorable.

I\u2019m a 20 year old community college student who has never had a girlfriend. I\u2019ve gone on some dates (all we\u2019re through tinder) and \u201cdone it\u201d (immediately regretted it), but I haven\u2019t been able to fall in love with anyone. I\u2019ve had girls say that I\u2019m attractive, and that I\u2019m not ugly. I\u2019m a pretty happy person who has been focused on self improvement for much of the last year. I cut my hair shorter, bought some nicer clothes, and my confidence went up a bit. I\u2019ve been making a huge effort to put myself out there. I go to the bowling alley every weekend because I love to bowl. I average about 140-150. It\u2019s my 2nd home. I just got back into it this year because I forgot how much I loved it. I am also a huge sports fan, always keeping on stats and going to sporting events, most recent one being Phillies Opening Day in Philadelphia. I also work 2 jobs. I know I have quite a bit going for me right now, but I always wonder if I\u2019m ever going to meet the girl of my dreams. \n\nI was very socially awkward as a child. My parents kept me inside a lot, and the only people I would interact with were my outer families members, who always messed with me. I have always been extremely introverted. I did start making some friends my junior and senior year of high school, but I hardly interact with most of them anymore. The whole love thing didn\u2019t really hit me until I went to my senior prom, when I was way to nervous to ask girls to go with me and too afraid to ask them to dance with me. I felt so left out. It made me feel defeated and lonely. \n\nThrough most of my high school years, I was extremely depressed, and about a year and a half ago, a few months after graduating, I went to seek professional help. I\u2019ve since made many improvements. I have a great group of friends. My birthday was last weekend and about 10 people showed up to the bowling alley. It meant the world to me because nobody would show up to anything I wanted to do in the past except for my best friend. \n\nI\u2019m not a guy who is after just sex. When the tinder date turned into more, I realized that sex wasn\u2019t everything. I want real love. I\u2019ve always been very into shy girls especially, but I still have a difficult time approaching girls. Other than my college, I really don\u2019t know where to meet them. I would love to have a girl to go on adventures with, go to sporting events with, cuddle up with on rainy days and watch movies, and someone to laugh with about everything and just enjoy life. I would do anything and everything to make her happy. I feel like I have a lot to give. I\u2019ve just been craving companionship for quite a while now. When I held a girls hand, I thought it was one of the greatest feelings. I know a lot of this sounds corny and all but I think my heart is just a bit restless. Will I ever meet someone?

This is my first job and it\u2019s tough work but i\u2019m making money which hopefully i\u2019ll buy a house with some day. \n\nBut working at mcdonald\u2019s isn\u2019t always fun. My internet friends make fun of me for my job, and when i\u2019m serving food in the drive thru, parents often point at me and tell their kids something usually like \u201cstay in school and you won\u2019t end up like him\u201d and I try to look unbothered but truthfully it hurts me every time.

I think about quitting mcdonalds every time a customer is rude to me and that\u2019s almost daily.  \n\nmy question to you guys is how do i command respect from people who are better than me (which i feel like everyone is) and also not be walked on by my long distance girlfriend who barely talks to me but still takes my money?

I was always deemed as unlikeable, but I never knew why and to this day I still don't know why. I'm a kind, nice person. I am selfless and I put other people first. I am told I'm quirky and funny, yet people still don't want to be friends with me.\n\nWhen I moved away to college, I thought it could be a nice fresh start to meet loads of new people, and make connections. At the start, I would talk to a lot of people and everyone was friendly, and I was friendly to everyone, but as time has gone on, those people that I made friends with have distanced themselves away from me. This happens every time. Sometimes people are happy to get to know me, but as soon as they do, they don't want anything to do with me and distance themselves. Every time I make a new friend, I lose them pretty quickly, in some way or another. I don't know why that is. It must be something to do with my personality. It makes me feel so crappy about myself. I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone. I spend days wondering what it is about me that people dislike so much. Every time I get to know a person and start becoming friends, I get frightened that they will leave soon as well, like everyone else.\n\nIn my whole life, I have only had a few friends combined, and after some time a lot of them ended up confessing that they never really liked me, or one has said after a long 5 year friendship that she just doesn't want to be seen with me anymore and doesn't ever want to talk to me again, which was heartbreaking. \n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? Does anyone have any advice? I don't want advice how to make friends, as I have no problem meeting people and talking to them to get to know them, I just have a problem where people that get to know me don't like me. I'm baffled as I don't know what I'm doing wrong.\n\nI tried therapy and talking this through with a therapist and it didn't help.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for so many replies! I wasn't expecting so many people to reply and to relate to me. Thank you for all the advice, I'm trying to reply to everyone.\n\nTo all the people that relate to me, just know that you are not alone with this and there are so many more people like yourself. Anyone can message me at any point and we can be friends, if you want someone to talk to:)\n\nANOTHER UPDATE: Thank you for all the private messages, I have received an overwhelming amount so I may take a little longer to reply to everyone :)",

In fact, every interview or telephone call from HR comes with a  anxiety and ends with me being absolutely tired and not being able continue into the day.\n\nI've been studying for the last 10 years. I finished my studies in my home country, started working and had a good perspective as a managing director in a developing company. Nevertheless I had to move to another country due to changing political situation - I had to sell basically everything I've had, leave not only my life but also friends and family behind. \n\nThe only legal way to stay there was to start studying. Foreign students have very limited opportunities of working, which are basically limited to 90 days a year. With my friend's help I got a place as a student assistant at the university, which is seen as a student activity by the migration office - so it was totally fine working there even though it is a typical job which is not being rewarded very good (I could cover the cost of my apartment, but I had to live from money I had from selling my stuff).\n\nI finished my bachelor studies last fall and supposed to start my master's, but my financial situation required me to start working. Through my internship I've got a place at a very prestigious company, but it turned out that it was underpaid and short-term, so my working visa was not approved. So basically it's very cool to have the company listed in my CV, but it's not very cool to work there for my legal status. \n\nCurrently I have working permission till May 2020. This means I have to find a job respectively to my qualification where I can also get enough money to get visa. I've started applying for different positions two weeks ago, and now I'm getting some responses. \n\nI've just got a call from an HR agent. I was extremely anxious and after the call I felt absolutely drained. Now I'm thinking that I will not be able to work in any environment, as I  am super self-conscious (also because I'm a foreigner) and cannot stop thinking about being not good enough for anyone. So I'm lying in my bed and think of all the stuff I could have said that would make me look good in the eyes of the agent. Funny thing tough - mid through the call I felt calm and super confident. But then it was my turn to talk...\n\nI'm thinking of starting master's (university seems to be a comfoy environment for me) but I need to work for the next couple months so that I can cover my bills.\n\nIf I take an objective look at my CV, I can say that I've done a very good job everywhere I was working. I'm a perfectionist, a quick-learner, super efficient. But I cannot chase my anxiety away.\n\nIs there any way or exercise to overcome this?\n\nEDIT: some misspellings; grammar. Sorry, behind also super self-conscious about it",

He would constantly make jokes about how I'm ugly and no one would date me, saying stuff that my boyfriend must be blind etc. He said it as a joke, but it hurts.

I looked at my Apple Watch, it read my heart as 130 bpm. Kept telling myself to calm down and that I had this. I had this in the bag. I have been practicing, I know what I\u2019m talking about, I\u2019m not going to read off of the slides. When it came down to me I started talking, and then..my voice. I couldn\u2019t get anything out. My breathing was so severe, my arms trembling to the point where I couldn\u2019t continue. All I could say was \u201clet\u2019s skip this one\u201d and I felt incredibly defeated as everyone looked at each other in confusion. My other team member read their slides, and then I went back to another one of mine as \u201credemption\u201d for myself. I still wasn\u2019t able to fully say all that I had to say for it. My voice was shakey and I wanted it to just be over. I say down, noticed the stares of my team members. I felt so horrible I cried all the way back home.

        "title": "How to Make Friends? I've Always Been Alone",
        "original": "This is kind of long, so bear with me.\n\nI had an... unusual childhood, to say the least. It wasn't bad, it was actually quite great but I went to a private, Catholic school where everyone knew everyone, so I guess I took my friends for granted back then. Then, when I moved at the end of the 3rd grade my illusion of social security was shattered.\n\nI did absolutely awful in the friend making department. My first set of friends made fun of me behind my back and made me so insecure I eventually avoided making friendships again from 6th to 7th grade, among other things. Then I made a new set of friends, and that wasn't much better. They accused me of masturbating in class (Mind you, I was an innocent child back then and didn't even know what that meant), and they made fun of me for getting my period and taunted me ruthlessly.\n\nI split up with them in the beginning of 8th grade, where I made much better but much less interested friends. I don't think they intentionally excluded me, it's just I wasn't into what they were into (mainly, theater). I finally caught a break when I met someone I instantly clicked with at the end of eighth grade, but low and behold we were going to different high schools.\n\nI'm 16 now, in my sophomore year. I'm sick of my life, just done. I'm not suicidal, but my moods are as shifty as the daily cycle, and I always feel alone. It's not clique pressure or anything, given that I go to a high school of almost 4,000 people and tons of kids (At least 10%) sit alone at lunch. It's just that I feel so empty. I pass my time biking, listening to music, discovering new places, hiking, writing, reading, watching television, or jumping on my trampoline; but none of it's enough.\n\nI've looked this topic up so many times I could recite it by memory. There's always \"join clubs\", which I tried and was so humiliated I couldn't make any friends after two years I eventually gave up. I've tried talking to new people, but since there's so many loners at my school they kind of just go on their phones and ignore me if I come up to them. I tried branching out with acquaintances, but I always feel like I'm taking advantage of their politeness and shrink away again.\n\nThere's this guy I talked to, I thought we hit it off really well and he was new to school so I didn't have the pressure of having to talk to his social group. But he avoided the library after we talked once (Where I sit for lunch), and seemingly doesn't remember it in class. It crushed me. I felt like it was a last ditch effort of an uphill battle to be more social. I know, just KNOW he's avoiding me.\n\nI'm more comfortable with guy friends now, because all my relationships with girls have ended badly and they're too much trouble. But I have such hard time talking to new people and 'clicking' with them. And online, it always says that lonely people want to meet others. I feel I'm offsetting, that no one really likes me or cares about me that much. I know I'm awkward, and I tend to be very ignorant of others' personal space so it always sounds like I'm flirting and I try not to but I'm just naturally too intimate. The generic advice online only further serves to isolate me.\n\nI wanted to go back up to that kid and give him my number. I want to be honest and just say that I'm lonely and, if he wants, he can text me and we can be friends. Or he can throw out my number, burn it, spit on it, and I'll still be amicable and friendly in class. No hard feelings. I know it's forward, and desperate and clingy and degrading, but I don't understand the complexity of body cues and I want to make friends my own way. I'm trying to go at friendship with no regrets, and remember that it probably won't be that significant ten years from now. Because, honestly, if it doesn't work out I'll probably end up clamming up again for another year.\n\nI have an unhealthy aversion of girls. I have girl friends that I adore, but they're even more inexplicable than guys. They're complicated and make me hate myself, and yet some of them are so comforting. In truth, I'm even willing to take a boyfriend if that's how I get a friend. I want someone to talk to, to laugh with and do stupid crap with. I've been uptight my whole life, and I'm making an effort to stop. It's SO hard, especially since I know on the inside I am carefree. But the problem is my extreme mood swings means that right now I can confidently say I would go up to that guy and give him my number, but when it comes down to it I'll just prowl around him like a creep (I think he found me creepy, as I often tend to watch people before I approach them because I hate being embarrassed).\n\nI just need advice. Should I go up to him? I know in my heart it's dumb and probably not worth it, to grovel so earnestly to a stranger, but I'm terrified I'll never be able to make a true connection. I've talked to my family about it, I've picked up hobbies just to fill that space and now I want to experience those hobbies with others. I live in the past, and narrate my life and I have severe depersonalization and anxiety and I meticulously fantasize about the life I WANT to have but am so limited by my own constraints. I don't like generic do-gooder advice, I guess I have this as more of a rant. I can't listen well, and it seems anyone who writes about making friends in high school doesn't realize how much high school has changed. It's not a vicious clique-filled environment, and I honestly wish it was. My school's too big for anyone to be \"popular\", and everyone's wrapped into their own things. I just wish I could approach the strangers who sit alone, but they always have their headphones in. And worst of all, we have two lunches for A and B days, so I never know if they're truly someone who will understand my feelings or if they're just sitting alone because they don't share lunch with their friends.\n\nI can't approach people in a group, and worst of all I have a pretty socially crippling anxiety. I just clam up and overthink it, and ramble (Like I am right now). I don't know what to do. I now it's a pretty miniscule problem, but it's practically shaped my life. I can't think about anything BUT making friends, and I'm terrified of being alone forever. Thanks for reading this whole thing, if you did. I just... I'm just beyond confused, in ways I never thought I would be.\n\nUpdate: 4/24/2019\nOkay, so I guess I\u2019ve gotta give an update, although there\u2019s not much to actually update on in the first place. I\u2019ve pretty much given up on friendships. No one knows it\u2019s my birthday tomorrow and I\u2019m glad because then I get to avoid the awkward ordeal of no one remembering it in the first place.\n\nI did get that guy\u2019s number. We actually texted a little bit and it was casual, but he hasn\u2019t responded in days and I\u2019m not gonna crush any remaining dignity by caving first when I was the one who texted in the first place. Guess he really doesn\u2019t wanna be my friend.\n\nTruth is, I\u2019m very disappointed in myself and I\u2019ll go on a miny speal. I tried to get Snapchat and Instagram in an effort to reach out but I instantly deleted it because I felt so insecure and boring. I eventually got SpotaFriend, which I had no idea was basically Tinder for teenagers. I wasn\u2019t a fan since anyone who I genuinely wanted to be my friend either didn\u2019t respond or just wanted something sexual.\n\nI tried to form a meetup to make new friends. It was reasonable; I have a math chat group where we go over my teacher\u2019s lessons and I tried to get that guy to come along by asked everyone. No one responded and I was so embarrassed I\u2019m never doing that again. I know so many acquaintances who are always on their phones but never actually respond to my texts. I know I should have some pride and cut off anyone who isn\u2019t interested in talking to me or finds me important but that would literally be everyone.\n\nI have fun chatting with them in class, but by class\u2019s end they don\u2019t care anymore and I\u2019m constantly in a state of ups-and-downs. There\u2019s so many kids at my school (3,500) and many who sit alone and yet none of them are remotely interested when I reach out. Is it a me thing? I don\u2019t know, but what I do know is I\u2019m certainly the third-wheel type, the one that no one invites out and I always have to initiate any conversation. I\u2019m jealous of those that can instantly become friends by speaking once to them.\n\nI wonder if it\u2019s my desperation. But I\u2019ve become unmotivated and dejected. My grades haven\u2019t fallen and certainly aren\u2019t going to this year. But next year? Junior year, the most important? I have no idea. And that scares me; it all does. I\u2019m so unhappy and alone and even though I\u2019m always surrounded by people it feels like no one is there.\n\nIt\u2019s pitiful but I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m in a slump, my hobbies just remind me of my loneliness all the time. It\u2019s supposedly as simple as saying hello, which I wish were the truth. I get giddy at anyone talking to me, showing an interest in ME but that interest always wanes quickly.\n\nI\u2019ve kept saying to myself next year will be a fresh start, I\u2019ll meet new people and become friends. But I don\u2019t know what kind of damage I\u2019ll do in that time. I can\u2019t wait a whole six months for the mere heave of meeting friends when it\u2019s failed so epically previously. And everyone I\u2019ve met who shares my interests aren\u2019t really people I\u2019d like to be friends with either. Quiet and awkward, like me. I know I shouldn\u2019t be picky but they only make me unhappy, because when I\u2019m with them we don\u2019t communicate or have fun, we have nothing to talk about. It\u2019s just sad.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of starting a hiking club. But the looming feeling of no one showing up is haunting me. I need to invite people in and make posters but I don\u2019t have the confidence to do that. And I need friends to at least be officers, but idk if that\u2019s possible.\n\nAlienation comes from television. On TV, it\u2019s always so easy and glamorous, and I just think \u201cWhy not me?\u201d I\u2019m reminded again and again.\n\nAnyway I\u2019m tired and delusional and in class so I just wanted to rant. I feel like I\u2019ll snap any day now and do something I can\u2019t take back. A few eeeks ago I seemed really, REALLY motivated to pursue my anorexia. Although I\u2019ve had anorexia previously for three months, a few years ago, i haven\u2019t had it again. I never told my parents.\n\nBut t resurfaced again. Thankfully, I was able to read about all the detrimental things it does to your body and I diswayed myself. But I\u2019m afraid next time I won\u2019t be able to do that. It\u2019s awful, but I\u2019d probably just do it for attention. Like people usually accuse mentally ill kids of, it\u2019s an attention-whore thing. As terrible as it is, i had hoped that I would one day faint and class and someone would feel pity and adopt me into their friend group.\n\nIt\u2019s awful and sick but I just couldn\u2019t help but wish for that. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever actually do it, but the fact that I contemplated it is worrisome enough. My moods are so shifty when I looked back on this I\u2019ll have the urge to delete it and never looks again; it\u2019s possible I have mild bipolar because I don\u2019t think my drastic mood swings are normal. I don\u2019t want to have anorexia, it\u2019s awful and all-consuming. I don\u2019t want to be so moody, or be lonely. But I feel like much more to this and I\u2019ll do something drastic.\n\nI just can\u2019t get out. This is the only place I can vent my frustrations. After this, I\u2019ll fall asleep in class and hope it all goes away. I just never thought being a teenager would be like this. It\u2019s awful, and not in the cliche high-school-is-terrible way. It\u2019s terrible when I see so many kids laughing with their friends in the halls and going off campus for lunch and having sleepovers. If I did one of these things I\u2019d cherish it forever, lock it away and love it and cling to the memory forever. But I can\u2019t even do any of this. Is this what true loneliness is? I don\u2019t know.\n\nThanks for reading, I guess.",

        "original": "Alright so here's my situation: I'm currently a 23 year old university student. I'm currently a senior and only need roughly 9 more classes to graduate. My plan is to graduate next year, during the spring. I originally attended community college for 2 years and transferred to my local university where I've been currently enrolled for 4 years. This next year will be my 5th year. So in total, I've been enrolled at school for about 7 years trying to getting my bachelors degree.\n\nThe problem: I have really bad social anxiety. Ever since I was a kid, I've struggled with it. As a result, I don't have much friends, I find it hard to socialize with people, and I'm pretty awkward. Because of this, I've been putting off/failed/dropped most classes that involve doing presentations or any 'social' related assignments/projects. As a result, I have about a total of 7 F's in my transcript and will probably get another 3 more after this semester is over. Although I calculated that I might still avoid being on academic suspension if I get at least an A and C or B and B for the 2 remaining classes I'm enrolled this semester. Overall I'm just tired of this shit I've put myself into.\n\n7 classes that I need are group/presentation based. I'm taking 2 presentation/group biased classes this summer. One of them is a speech class which obviously requires me to talk in front of others in order to pass. The other is a group/presentation based class. I've took this speech class twice, dropped it the first time and failed the second time, and the other class once (failed it). At this point, if I can't pass these 2 classes during the summer, I'd rather just dropout out completely since I'll end up in academic suspension.\n\nSo yeah, overall I need some sort of advice/help. I'm planning to drink a bit of alcohol to ease my nerves for the presentation. I'm not sure if that's a good idea since I've never tried it. Illegal drugs isn't an option since I don't want to get caught and go to jail or end up expelled.\n\nGoing to a therapist or something like that isn't an option since I can't afford it at this moment and I'm not sure what my parents will think about this. They don't 'approve' mental health.\n\nAny advice/tips will be appreciated. I'm also willing to provide more info about myself/situation since I'm not sure what else to add.\n\nThanks.",

        "original": "TLDR: Returned to old job as a last resort. Forced into position I didnt want and my first day was handled every unprofessionally. Felt like the second day would be better but almost had a panic attack. Told my managers I couldnt do it and cried after not being able to make them understand my point of view. Tears were shed, but stood my ground and it all worked out.\n\n\nI usually lurk, but felt like I should share my story with you all. Maybe you can learn something from it.\n\nToday was my 2nd day at my new job, but this wasnt my first rodeo: I worked at this place from 2014-16 and left because of the environment. Due to various pressures (mostly financial) I had to return and felt awful about it, but was happy to finally be able to save money again and go forward. \n\nThen my disaster of a first day happened. This isnt required reading, but helps with context: https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b8dcoo/new_cashier_here_just_had_a_shitty_first_day_at/\n\nSo first day wasnt good, but I was determined to get this down! I went to the library on my day off and wrote down everything I needed and studied as much as possible. I was going to do this. As I set out I was nervous, but in a better mindset than the first day and confident things would be different...well they were different alright. As I got closer to the store I felt like I couldnt catch my breath, I kept breathing deeper and deeper to rid myself of this breathlessness, but nothing was working. I pushed through it and clocked in, but before they put me on register I started to get tremors in my hands that wouldnt stop.\n\nThis went on for 30 minutes before I pulled my managers aside and told them point blank that I couldnt do this. I am no stranger to hard work or stress: I worked at this store for 2 years and then went on to work at a high end retirement community whose rich, entitled residents treated the staff like the help. I liked the job and only left due to lack of staff making it difficult to care for the increasing number of residents. I can work no problem, but I know my disposition. One manager was more understanding than the other, who kept asking me why I was so effected by this. She also tried to make me feel small asking if I really wanted to be in this job position the rest of my life (says the person who hasn't done anything else in 3 years) and being skeptical of my back pain.\n\nI tried to explain why I felt the way I did, but they couldnt understand. Then it happened. I started to cry. Not full out bawling, but there was a steady flow of tears. Thinking back, I started getting emotional because I'm already in a spot I dont wont to be in: broke as fuck and forced to return to my old shitty job out of necessity. It was made worse by them making me take the cashier position when I didnt want it and then realizing that I would probably have debilitating back pain, carpal tunnel, and even worse self-esteem issues from dealing with shitty people all day for at least a couple of years.\n\nThe unsympathetic manager refused to look at me after the tears came and eventually left. The kind manager told me if a new hire tried to pull something like this they would be fired on the spot, but because they know of my work ethic they will find a place for me. In the meantime I'm back where I was and I guess I'm okay with that for now. I feel ashamed of crying, but am happy I stood my ground and spoke my mind.\n\nWith all that being said I suppose my point is: just go for it. Whatever \"it\" is. It was damn scary for me to approach my managers and say what I did, especially since I took this job as a last resort and really couldnt afford to get fired, but I followed through and stayed the course and it all worked out. So make the leap, I'm sure whatever the result is would be better than me possibly getting fired and having no money to live!\n\n",

I only go in order to spend time with my friends and in some ways I believe it\u2019s one of the only ways to meet people here. I\u2019m the only introvert in my friend group which gets rough sometimes because I feel like they don\u2019t understand me. \nThe panic attack was scary, I just  remember getting more and more tense and my breathing became more labored and I started to shake so i decided to leave the party.  I had a breakdown in my car, crying uncontrollably and all and I decided to stay in the parking lot because I didn\u2019t want to leave my friends stranded since they didn\u2019t have money and I was the only one with a car I waited two hours for them to come out because I didn\u2019t want their fun to be ruined. When one of my three friends came back to the car, I told him what happened and he said I should\u2019ve said something but he said \u201coh god\u201d like he was annoyed with me like \u201coh here we go again\u201d\n\nThat made me shut down further. Once my other friends came back I drove us Home and cried the whole way there. After dropping the first friend off, I told The other two what happened and I didn\u2019t get one reaction whatsoever. They just kind of ignored it and continued a conversation which hurt and i started crying more. One of the friends consoled me a little after I kept trying to tell them how scary it was for me and that I was suffering, but it hurt that she didn\u2019t do anything until I had to say \u201cI know y\u2019all probably don\u2019t know how to respond but...\u201d over and over. The other friend didn\u2019t acknowledge it at all and kept going about her business.

I found some solace in my two friends in another state that I called but i needed someone who was physically there. It further solidified the fact that I\u2019m kind of the odd one out in the group. I\u2019ve been crying off and on, but what do you suggest I do? I feel so hurt and disappointed by them but am I overthinking this?

I always had 0-1 friends, I couldnt attract any people into my life who'd stay by my side but I still believed that this would change when I'd get older.\n\nSadly, nothing has changed at all. This year my destination to be excluded has manifested itself undeniably and it's so depressing. To tell you a bit about me...I'm not introverted at all but being left out has made me turn into an introvert because I believed for years that nobody cared about me except for my own mother. I am not ugly, I have no anxiety and also I have been pretty confident my entire life but I'm not arrogant either. I have like 2 close friends that I know irl and thats about it, they are the only friends that really appreciate me.\n\nNow this is where I have understood that I'm destined to be left out. This year I took part in a project that does a lot of voluntary work and its honestly awesome. I like the workshops and everything and we're a group of 18 people. When I first got there I thought to myself \"Okay girl, its time to make some friends. Just be yourself, you can do it THIS time!!!\" \n\n2 months into this project and guess who is left out again? Yup, me. And I'll repeat myself, I am NOT shy nor am I RUDE or anything. I talk to everybody like they talk to anyone but that's it...they have formed groups and chose to exlude me. I am really starting to think that it's over for me. I never cared what people thought about me but it is really getting into me now. I heard a girl in that project wanted to beat me up because she thought I did something which I clearly didnt. A guy I got along in the first few weeks now completely dislikes me for no apparent reason and everytime I have to do a group work with him he indirectly makes fun of me and everybody laughs. I totally lost and chose to ignore him because he has a wrong picture of me.\n\nIt's like I always have to prove myself to people. I have to do ten times as much to get like 1 person to talk to me. Meanwhile people who look boring or dont talk a lot get a lot of friends and I as a helpful and funny girl get shat on by the whole project. I feel like my existence is a joke. I havent cried in months but that was the last straw, today I have understood what I am meant to be- and that is to be always left out and wrongly judged.\n\nI know that you (as a reader) will think that I'm playing the victim card but honestly its been ages and I couldnt attract people in my life. Nobody cares about me. You know how sad it is when you hear somebody say your name and you get so excited because you're not used to people acknowledging your existence? Thats always been me. \n\nI hope somebody can relate because I cant cope with this anymore. I used to be suicidal because of constantly being excluded, its no joke :( \n\n\n",

I didn't even think *I* cared if others did, but *surprise*, it turns out I do.\n\n(TL;DRs at the bottom, I tend to write walls of text)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProfessionally, I'm exactly where I want to be: in grad school researching an interesting topic with great working conditions. I even just received funding to continue my project at the PhD level. I should be thrilled, yet, that doesn't even make me happy and that's where I have a problem.\n\nIt doesn't help that, for the last year, I had the poor taste of falling in love with my closest friend and chickening out of telling her until it was both unbearable *and* too late. Obviously that put a bit of a damper on things and made me realize that I don't even *have* close friends anymore, hence why I'm venting on here instead of *actually doing something about it*.\n\nLooking back, it seems that I managed to go through undergrad (and, to be fair, a good part of highschool) getting my minimal level of social interaction (which I didn't even know I had) talking to people in my classes and during breaks. Even now, all I want when I get home is to get some peace and quiet to either get work done or just relax. (I live with my parents and siblings, so it's not like I'm completely alone all the time).\n\n(**TL;DR** can start here)\n\nGiven that my situation isn't much different from a lot of what gets posted on here, I know what I'm *supposed* to do (pick up a hobby, go out there and *do stuff* where I'll meet people, maybe try dating if I can conjure up the patience for that), but between knowing and doing there's a step that I can't bring myself to cross. I think it's usually a matter of \"too tired\", \"don't feel like it right now\", \"I'm not sure \\[activity\\] and what it implies matches who I am, who I want to be or what I want to do\" as well as plain old transport logistics, with (dis)honourable mentions to \"I don't have time\" and \"not worth the effort\".\n\nIt doesn't help that I'm usually quite picky with people in general, so it's unlikely that I'll meet someone in a structured group/setting with whom I'll want to hangout outside of said group/setting.\n\nThen there's the extra difficulty of being in a linguistic minority: the default language for any organized activity will be English, but I find it's much easier to connect with fellow Francophones (which can be hard to find), as there's no need for that extra layer of translating language and culture.\n\n(**TL;DR#2**)\n\nBasically, knowing *what* I need to do (go out more, change mindset a bit) doesn't help me with *how* to do it, practically.

It's always mildly been there, but got a lot better in my 3rd year at uni when I just went to everything and talked to anyone. However I spent from September to March last year pretty isolated. I had just graduated and didn't have a job for those months, just pretty much living in my room at my parents house smoking pot and playing computer games. It totally destroyed my self confidence. Sure, I was attending band rehearsals with a couple army regiments twice a week and even performed a concerto with a local community orchestra, but I spent all that time in constant fear when I had to talk to anyone.\n\nIt's a little better this year. I've been working all year since last April,  i exercise at least 3 times a week, smoke only a couple times on the weekends, but I still get these anxious thoughts when I talk to people. It hit me that my anxiety was a real problem when I got anxious just talking to my dad, who lives in the same house. We were just talking about his recent gramophone collection, but I spent the whole time gripped with fear, and I don't understand why. I tell myself, it's fine, what could you be worried about? But I still worry I'm going to sound stupid, that I won't have a response to something he'll say, and I'll just stand there silent. When this fear comes over I have trouble comprehending what people are saying.  I start to focus on the sounds of the words they're saying. Then when I realize it's happening, I try to focus on the substance of what they're saying, but for some reason my mind just can't grasp it.\n\nIt's really one of the worst pains in the world. Sometimes even when I'm with a group of close friends, people I went to uni with and at one time was totally comfortable around, I get anxiety. I want to be able to hang out with people and not worry. I want to talk to my boss without feeling like I can't breathe. I really need help.",

My college experience has been absolute shit i.e. I have been alone for the entirety of it. Seriously haven't met one person, and idk what to tell people when they ask about my friends. I'm still trying to figure out why I haven't made a friend in 4 fucking years when I had no problems doing it in high school.

Fast forward to now because there's no way I can succinctly express everything that's gone on in the past 3ish years. I've been in college and my one friend (who I knew before college btw) dropped out. So almost every day of my life in college has been extremely lonely. I have no idea why I haven't been able to make friends, but maybe because I've hardly initiated anything? I'm not sure, I never really had to do that in high school. Do I give off a repulsive vibe? I don't know. But I am absolutely terrified because I'll be entering the world outside of college as a friendless virgin with a disability. And I dont know how much longer I'll want to live. I feel like I've matured so much faster than I was ready for, and it's really fucking with me. Like, I truly cannot believe that I am in the place that I am as a 21 year old adult and I'm not sure how to conduct myself. \n\nIt seems like something is really wrong right now. I'm seeing all my high school friends thriving and beginning serious relationships, and I'm in this piss poor shape. Would therapy really help though? I feel like my life is already so far down the shitter it won't help. There's a ton of stuff I neglected to mention about myself, like the fact that I don't have and can't currently drive a car.

        "title": "Just realized people hate unsolicited advice",
        "original": "Hiya!\n\nI posted here not long ago lamenting about my less than successful relationship history.\n\nThink I just realized a critical problem I've been completely unaware of for most of my life. A big thing for me is that, I really love helping people. It is a genuine passion, I love educating and assisting those that need it and I love making a difference wherever I can.   \nI absorb information extremely well, I'm the sort of person that could like, attend a lecture 5 months ago and then pass a test about it without studying. Anything and everything I learn that is interesting or useful, I remember.   \n\n\nI have a few mental and social issues, one of them I most recently found out about is that I am autistic, and a lot of my behavior makes more sense with that context. I also have a panic disorder, some ptsd, and an anxiety disorder as well as ADHD.\n\nI love people, I'm very empathetic and I had a very poor support system in my own home. I overly depended on friends and therefore, lost a lot of them, and ended up in some bad grooming type possessive relationships because of this. So I guess I'm naturally inclined to want to prevent people from being in that position themselves. I want to be there for my friends and family in the way no one was for me growing up.\n\nI help a lot, and with that help comes a lot of advice, it's been for years one of the main ways I show that I love someone.  If I'm friends with you, I'll want to have tons of conversations about your life goals and try to help you realize them somehow! I love passionate people and hearing about the things they want to do.   \nIf I care about you I'll worry about you, and I'll try very hard to pitch in and assist in your life developments and endeavors.  If I see someone doing something \"wrong\", usually in a manner that violates some sort of safety precaution or will cause/exacerbate issues, I will tell them. My intention is always genuine, and vindictive or prideful behavior is something I don't fully understand, honestly.\n\nThis is especially true for things that are my area of expertise or special interest. Stuff like animal training and pet care across the board, especially regarding dogs and birds. Animal husbandry, food chemistry, mental and physical health,   \nthese are the things I'm most likely to want to help with.   \nAs well as general health and safety, things pertaining to ecology and environmentalism to a non zealous degree, and things that could be considered common sense life skills.   \n\n\nI also came from a poor home, and learned how to save a lot of money through means that aren't obvious in a world where you're brainwashed to spend as much as possible every time you leave the house.  \n\n\nIf I see or notice something that contradicts things I know, such as promoting problem animal behavior, which is extremely common especially with dog owners, behavior that is detrimental to one's physical health such as excessive drug and alcohol use/medication mixing, spending huge amounts on costs that could be sidestepped or otherwise just neglecting your personal health for the sake of convenience, I am inclined to say something about it. Sometimes it is very, very difficult not to, sometimes it causes me anxiety not to and in some cases it makes me angry.\n\nI fixate on justice a lot and I feel like, if I have the ability to help, that I am obligated to and it would be somehow bad for me not to. And that I would be morally reprehensible if I declined to comment on something that ended up getting a loved one hurt. I don't ever mean to be obnoxious, truly.\n\nNow I've actually done some good with this, I've gotten a few friends access to insurance, healthcare, helped them accomplish things like earning a driver's license, getting a GED, and even getting people to attend college.\n\nNot everyone hates this either, my boyfriend credits me with saving his life even. He loves listening to and engaging with me about the things I care about. He's probably one of the only people I've ever met that cares about my interests in that way.  \nObjectively I guess it can be hard to keep in mind that, not everyone will be interested in being given advice like that.\n\nI take a lot onto myself trying to parent other people, sometimes it personally exhausts me. And after reading a reddit thread about pet peeves to see that actually, a lot of people really hate this behavior, I'm thinking back on my actions and wondering if/how I should try to stop this. Should I just stop saying things altogether? Or change the way in which I present the information?\n\nA recent relationship in which I tried to completely play the parental role of a troubled person failed badly, and last I heard that person has fallen back onto problem behaviors I tried to correct. When I found this out, I became enraged, like ridiculously loathing towards them. After a year or so of just pondering this event, I kinda came to the conclusion that, not everyone can learn through word of mouth. Sometimes I need to step back and let them blunder it out themselves. It was hard, because I cared so much, but in the end I realized, *I cannot care more about someone than they do about themselves!*\n\nIt's strange, and a huge thing that makes this hard for me is that, I love being given advice. I love learning new things, and I would adore to have someone tell me about everything they know. I think sometimes people have tried to one up me by condescendingly correcting my behavior and it just flies over my head, and I take it as them being nice and I appreciate it a lot. The idea of using the sharing of information as a social weapon of sorts is confusing and backwards to me. The only time it would make me angry is if I know it's incorrect information and they aren't open to being corrected.\n\nI think I need to accept that people are inherently prideful beings, and do not enjoy being told what they should do, especially not in my age demographic. The idea of me being perceived as bossy or a know it all is strange, since I'm just, there's no other way to describe it, completely disconnected from that entirely, and I only desire to prevent bad things from happening to people I love. But that isn't how people process it when a 23 year old friend of their's tries lecturing them about something they're doing wrong and how they can improve it.\n\nI don't want to be the mom friend necessarily or some annoying know it all. I simply don't want people to suffer the way I have for being unaware. How can I stop this behavior, or manage my anxiety/guilt response over not being able to prevent all bad things that might happen to people I love? I think it does impact me socially that I'm like this. I don't want to upset people.\n\nEdit: trying to format better, bear with me I'm really shitty at paraphrasing lol, and jeez reddit doesn't make formatting easy at all does it",

        "original": "I haven't had a date with a girl in six years. Like, no joke, the last date I had was in college my sophomore year. Otherwise, I was \"too busy\" (too anxious/unavailable) and did weird things to not go on \"dates.\" Basically, I made up a lot of excuses and did a lot of avoidant things to look \"cool\" without dating. I was scared out of my mind of girls and of talking to people in general. Plus, I had zero self-esteem or confidence in talking to people. \n\n\nI've had friendships with girls and relationships that were borderline romantic, but never dated or really hung out. Again, I made a lot of excuses and kept myself busy to avoid romantic anything as much as possible. I realized a few years ago it was because I had really bad social skills. I really started working on social skills with the help of this subreddit. I began working on small things first (like eye contact and maintaining conversations) to bigger things (like what boundaries are). I do my best to at least keep my skills intact daily, if not improve on yesterday. This is the crux of my success story.\n\n\nI won't go super heavy into the details, but basically I've had a crush on this girl at work for a while. I seemed to come across like an asshole at first because I was immature and had this pretend long-distance relationship with someone else. The person this was with was real, but the relationship wasn't romantic or serious. I stopped being friends with my fake lover and took this real crush more seriously. We went from acquaintances to good friends at work. It started when I stopped trying to \"win her over\" and worked on not being inauthentic. I let myself be not-great socially rather than pretend to be this cool, poised person I'm really not. It seemed to have worked over the past few months. I've definitely not been that smooth talking to her haha. Some of what I've said probably goes against advice on here, even... Anyways, things got more serious recently over text and the intermittent small talk we've had at work here and there. Neither of us seemed to commit to the relationship that seriously up until now. I'm not sure what started it, but the stars seemed to align these past few weeks. I went into work early yesterday before my shift and somehow caught her on her break. We had a solid, fairly long conversation and she told me she was interested in talking to me again (seemed like a big hint I finally saw :D). I decided that this was my chance and I asked her out today for a real date. I almost dipped owing to performance/social anxiety, but I approached her anyways. It was actually really easy, my anxiety dropped to nothing (because she has that effect on me), and I didn't feel like I failed. Being friends for a little while made it feel pretty easy; I knew how to read her.   \n\n\nWe're going out for coffee on Monday and I am grateful to this subreddit (I lurk like crazy), my family, and a lot of people in my life who (finally) give me feedback and those who called me out when I was an immature asshole throughout last year. I thank my ex-friend for opening my eyes to how toxic I was being, too. That relationship ended disastrously because I didn't respect her boundaries and was just generally mean to her. I'm glad I committed myself to changing, otherwise I would've morphed into some incel terror of sorts lol. ",

However, I\u2019m not really sure if he\u2019s interested. \nI feel like if he felt the same he\u2019d make it more obvious, but I\u2019m pretty much the one who always says hi first and starts the conversations. I also pick at him a lot and compliment him sometimes so I feel like im being hella obvious ya know? A couple months back I asked for his Snapchat hoping he\u2019d Snapchat me one day but he never did, so one night I texted him first and told him a guest had asked about him and we started a short conversation then. It was getting pretty late at night so he said he was going to bed and gave me his number so that we could continue the conversation off of Snapchat. I had fallen asleep so I saw that message in the morning, thought it was a great sign and texted him right then, but he left it on read and never responded. Since then I haven\u2019t tried texting him again cause I just figure he\u2019s not interested, but I still have this stupid crush.

They just live for the weekends. \n\nI\u2019ve recently decided to make a conscious decision to go sober for good. I have anxiety and I just don\u2019t see the benefits of it anymore. I feel I only drink when I go out so that I\u2019m able to socialise, like self medication for my anxiety. I\u2019m sick of my own BS and realise if I want to get rid of my anxiety I have to stop using things to cover it up and just deal with it head on. \n\nSo I want to go out and do new (sober) things. Just go on walks/hikes in new places, have a little art painting session together whilst jamming to some music, chill at the beach, make new foods.

Just not talking and seeing everybody else have fun, I just don\u2019t feel like I fit in and I should just leave. \n\nAs the dinner ended I decided to take a rose from one of the tables. As I was looking at it I realized I\u2019ve never gave a girl a flower, ever. So I was talking with my friend and we decided we would find girls to give our flowers too (kinda weird writing it but it was our goal for the night and it sounded like a plan).\n\nSo we go off into the lobby of the hotel that was hosting our ball and we\u2019re just casually conversing. Immediately we see a pretty women  walk down the stairs next to us and take a seat on the couch near ours. The moment she walked in my friend gave me the look to take my shot but I turned it down. I guess I was just looking for an excuse to say no. Shortly afterwards a sergeant came up to me and my friend and asked us what we were doing in the lobby away from the party with roses in our hands. \n\nI spoke up. \n\n\u201cYou know Sergeant. In my 20 years on this earth I have NEVER given a pretty girl a flower and I\u2019m gonna make that my goal for tonight.\u201d \n\nI hadn\u2019t notice but my friend told me the girl on the couch looked up in disbelief.\n\nHe gave us great advice to have fun and enjoy ourselves for the night. So me and my friend get back to our business talking and then she speaks up asking if me and my friend were in the military and were on base nearby just making small talk that her friend was also in the army. \n\nAnd it goes off from there. I start talking to her and asking we\u2019re she\u2019s from and what she\u2019s doing around here and the conversation didn\u2019t go too bad I actually got her Snapchat. After 10 minutes or so she gets up and says she has to go back to work even though she didn\u2019t want to. So that\u2019s when I asked if she would like a flower for the night and she was so surprised and flattered it was great seeing her smile. And just like that I accomplished my goal for the night and it was worth going through everything. \n\nOn the bad note: she still hasn\u2019t accepted my snap request. I make sure to look out for signs if women feel uncomfortable and I should leave, I never want to be a creep. When I asked if she was on snap she gladly pulled out her app quickly and let me add her and I\u2019m sure her emotions were pure when I gave her the flower. So any advice on that? \n\nMy regret is not asking her out on a date at the end of that conversation. Even though it seems  kinda fast thinking in retrospect I personally believe it would have been the best time it just really didn\u2019t cross my mind at the time. \n\nTL;DR.

        "original": "I'm an introvert, I've had social anxiety my whole life and due to childhood abuse by my father I have a destroyed self esteem, I have been working to better myself though. \n\nI'm at a point where I force myself to talk to people, I'm not the type of person that others usually approach, I don't know the exact reason why, no one really shows interest in me, maybe I have the vibe that I don't want to talk to others, maybe I'm just boring and have nothing interesting to show, but anyway, I'm always approaching others.\n\nI have moved to a new state for work, and obviously this sucks ass, new life new people, I'm 27 so I'm at the point where college is done and you gotta work hard to make friends, even at work most of my colleagues are in the range of 40s-60s. \n\nAnyway, one of older friends told me to use meet up app, which I have never used before. I liked the idea, and joined volleyball and soccer groups. \n\nI have RSVBed to 5 games so far, which I have enjoyed, but at the same time I don't feel like I'm wanted there, maybe I'm just negative about it, you guys tell me.\n\nMy first volleyball game I went there early to talk to people, I'm new in the area and I don't know anyone, I have met a sweet older lady that was on my team and she was nice enough to have a conversation with me. She had been supportive throughout the entire game as I was a beginner and honestly was a bit nervous and made some mistakes, I thought others were friendly too, I tried to have conversions with them but didn't feel like anyone wanted to talk or had any interest. \n\nThe next game I went to was a soccer game (open to all skill levels), I used to play soccer a lot but haven't in years ago obviously I knew I wasn't gonna do great, but I wanted to use this as an opportunity to meet people. Well, the soccer guys had no interest in talking to me, it was a small group and they all knew each other, I played with them but no one bothered to even ask my name, I kept approaching them before the game and tried to actually be part of whatever conversation they had, you know I was trying to initiate the part where they would acknowledge me and I would introduce myself, never happened and I got ignored. Oh well. \n\nSo the game started and I wasn't in a great shape, also didn't help that literally all of them were very skilled, the moment they saw how I played my team literally ghosted me and stopped even passing the ball to me, even if I was the very last option they would still not pass and instead let the other team take the ball, so didn't feel great about that, but again I knew I sucked but at the same time I felt disrespected. After the game again I tried to talk to them, I introduced myself to two of the guys, they literally showed no interest, never asked me and questions, just said their names.\n\nThe last volleyball game I went to was with a new group, again everyone seemed like they knew each other, I tried to get close to them to acknowledge me, no one looked at me, I asked if they need any help (they were sitting up the net and other stuff) they said no. I just kept moving from one small group to another trying to get involved but no one would look at me or ask who I am or involve me in a conversation. \n\nThe only time someone would ask my name is when I make a mistake in the game and they try to give me advice (which they were friendly about), but then again after the game when we sit on the porch I try to get involved but no one even looks at me, I did try again to introduce myself to some people next to me, but they just tell me their name then look the other way and start talking with the other guys/girls. \n\nFirst of all, am I doing something wrong? I hate doing all this but sitting by myself quietly has never worked, no one would approach me, but it seems like even when I approach others no one is interested to even ask me where I came from. I don't know if it has anything to do with my ethnicity, I'm not originally from the U.S. But my English is pretty good (I have a slight accent), but then again I didn't think those people were racist or anything, they seemed friendly but no one had any interest about me at all.\n\nI felt awkward and not wanted, I tried to make things not awkward by trying to talk but that didn't work, I don't know what I'm gonna do, normally I would give up and stop going to these events, but I don't wanna do that yet. \n\nI would appreciate any advice.",

        "original": "I'm 23 years old and have been basically alone my whole life. I've been in two long-term toxic relationships that shattered me, I grew up with an abusive father who mentally tormented my family for years, and I have never had close friends or experiences. I'm analytical and reserved by nature. I'm not funny, I  have no stories to tell or funny things to say, and nobody ever wants to hang out or be around me unless they're forced to through work, being in projects together, or some other means where being around me is by force.\n\nThis year, I'm traveling with a sports team doing analytics work. In September, I was absolutely crushed by a girl I really liked, but flaked on two months without notice. Nothing has gone right for me. I don't fit into this culture. I'm not a jock, I don't like strip clubs, and I'm just not funny. I don't know. Everywhere I go, I stand silent in hatred of myself because I have nothing to say, and even if I did, I hate myself and have no confidence in myself to where even if I thought I had something to say, I'd keep my mouth shut out of fear of judgement or being made fun of. As a result, I'm always close to the vest, I was always shit on in school or told I didn't matter. I don't want to be judged, mocked, hurt, or give people a reason to dislike me - so I shut up and be alone.\n\nI thought this new job would revitalize me. Traveling with a team was never ideal - excessive travel is bad for my head, but the opportunity to grow in an industry I love was tempting. It's a good job, but I feel unqualified. I feel like I don't deserve this job. I feel like the other three guys who have this job are smarter, have their shit more together, and can do more than me. As I'm struggling to just get my requirements sorted out, they are off going above and beyond, always having time to do advanced independent work that will help them be full time. I fight and fight and fight for what I want in life, but no matter what, I feel unqualified. I'm not creative, I need direction and instruction to succeed. I'm personable, but any sense of intelligence people get from me is a facade. People think I know so much more than I do - I probably conned these people into giving me this job. All I do is walk around like a deer in headlights. I feel like a fraud who deserves nothing. I was almost homeless looking for a job in this industry because I love it so much. Yet through all the sacrifice and fight, I have no faith in my intellect. I know nothing. And I keep my mouth shut.\n\nWomen don't like me. I'm awkward, I can't talk to women. I have nothing to say. I'm not funny, I can't make one laugh. I'm polite and kind, but I'm dull and serious. I can't lighten up because I can't let loose. I think I'm hideously ugly. I never get matches. And when I do online, I get no replies because my first line is awkward as all fuck because I don't know how to talk to women. In reality, I'm about as average as one gets. 5'9, average body, decent looking, nothing offensive. But, I'm not tall or rich or jacked or funny - no one would want to be around me. Look at all the options out there. Again, back on the common theme of people only being around me if it is by force. All I can attract are people who are morbidly obese. And sorry if that sounds sucky, but I deserve someone who tries as hard as I do. I don't need to be with a supermodel, but I deserve someone kind and caring and who tries. Don't I? Or am I doomed to settle with someone I hate out of fear of loneliness? \n\nSo in short, I'm an idiot, an asshole, with no personality or life experiences to make myself appear likable. Nobody is with me by choice. At work, I'm the dumbest of three people despite all I worked for. I can't get a date because I guess I'm ugly as all sin. This new job is just me surrounded by jocks who I cant talk to, so I'm awkward. I can't talk to girls because I'm awkward. I have ZERO life experience. No fun memories, I've always been alone, on the brink of poverty, clawing for the little I have. I'm tired of hating myself. I'm tired of seeing people with pictures of friends all over, while mine are all alone. I'm tired of hating who I am and always keeping my mouth shut because I'll be judged and hated. I don't even deserve what I fought for because I might as well be a used-car salesman. So fucking tired of being alone.",

It's not like I don't like my current group of friends, it's more like I feel as though they aren't keeping up with me.   \n\n\nI am going back to school for IT this fall and I am working on my mental health. I am also trying to learn to get out more and be more social. The problem is this requires me to do a lot of stuff alone. I have social anxiety and I am extremely timid, so typically when I want to hang out I try to find someone to stuff with. My friends don't seem to share this anymore. They just seem content with their lives being stagnant and staying home all day watching anime or playing video games. It's not like they are useless or anything. For the most part, they all have jobs, can hold a conversation and what not. It's just I want to get more out of life than the glow of a computer screen. I even talked to my close friend and pretty much I am just like \"I just want to go out and do stuff\". His response was \"Well what kind of stuff..?\".   \n\n\nLike there are a couple of questions I can be asked that I just don't know the answer too because my life experiences are just so...limited. \"Do I want to get married one day?\" \"What is my ideal career?\" \"What is my overall endgame?\". Its like I have some stuff figured out but I feel like I haven't tried enough of life to give myself solid answers due in part to my almost hermit lifestyle for the past few years and now that I am bored of it I feel like I am at ground zero and need to somehow make new friends.   \n\n\nThis is the funny thing, its more like I have become so accustomed to being home all the time, I got used to it, but its like I woke up one day and really just wanted more from life than an empty bed in my parents house with nothing of joy to look forward too but hours of video games or my current job. It's like I can't answer that question cause I don't know what it is and it gets frustrating when I am belittled for it like wanting to go to a show or something when \"you can always see it online\" or \"just wait for the DVD and save money\".   \n\n\nIt's hard to explain, I don't think I am giving my feeling and the words in my head any justice with what I am putting in my post.   \n\n\nOne more thing, I don't look at them as bad people. They are like family to me. But it's also hard introducing them to other people, especially when one has a body pillow or the others' have figures and whatnot. It's like I need to live a double life almost but not want to give up the things I like. I also know that having figures isn't necessarily indicative of a bad thing, it's more like....how they treat it. I don't know how to say it nicer. Let's just say I never been one to partake in that sort of thing. I want to date 3-d people, yeah let's go with that.  \n\n\nTLDR: I feel like I am becoming more incompatible with my friends but also don't want to be completely alone.

        "original": "I\u2019ve been dealing with having no friends for close to 8 years now (28F, USA).\n\nWhen I was in junior high and high school, I had tons of friends of all different levels of closeness. I was often referred to as the nicest or funniest girl people knew. I had a boyfriend more often than not. I was friends with both girls and boys. I\u2019m scared that the person I once was is permanently gone, or is no longer likable in the adult world.\n\nOnce I entered college, my ex was very critical of my friends. I was always insecure about my looks and being loved, so yes, I was an idiot who did everything to make my ex happy, including avoiding people he either didn\u2019t like or might not like. I thought as long as he was happy, my life would be good. I know I was wrong, and now I\u2019ve suffered the consequences of that 6 year relationship and have only kept 1 good friend who lives in my home state (I moved away). Otherwise, I\u2019ve lost all my past friends and acquaintances.\n\nI\u2019ve tried being friends with people from work and my current boyfriend\u2019s friends/family, but I cannot seem to connect on any level. I often find myself in my mind focusing on the bad points of people. Often I find the people I meet are: racist, sexist, petty, immature, or insensitive. I\u2019ve been told I am too quiet. I\u2019ve been going to therapy and actively trying to speak up during social situations (asking people questions about their lives, etc.) but I find I am never given reciprocal treatment. I am now the least funny person in every group I\u2019m in. I don\u2019t even find myself laughing along with people because I don\u2019t think the jokes are funny, so then I come off like an extremely serious person who has no sense of humor.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that my life is boring compared to everyone I meet. Most people have either traveled the world, have awesome jobs, or have funny past memories to share with everyone else who is there since I am the \u201cnew girl\u201d. A lot of people also share the same college experiences that I lack.\n\nMeanwhile, I have been working a boring admin job, am studying part time for accounting (which, let\u2019s face it, many people find boring), and have been dealing with multiple physical injuries which preclude me from partaking in physical hobbies I want to do, such as running. Every time someone asks me how life is, all I have to talk about is school, work, and TV shows I watch. \n\nI\u2019ll admit that I have been dealing with depression since I was 15. But even back then, I was making friends at school and even in college there were some people who I hung out with between classes. I regret not staying in touch with those people due to wanting to please my ex. But now, having no friends exasperates my depression, since I often have no one to turn to to cheer me up (my boyfriend tries, but he doesn\u2019t really know how). Also, I don\u2019t want my boyfriend to be my only friend. I want to be able to get a funny text from a friend, have someone to go to places with, and I can\u2019t have that with my only friend from the city because she is constantly busy with work and we have to travel to see each other.\n\nSometimes I wonder how much I need to change and how much my circumstances factor in to my lack of friendships. How can I have a healthy balance so that my self improvements don\u2019t go wasted on making friends with people that just aren\u2019t meant for me? Is there something wrong with me after years of being isolated from people or am I just socializing with the wrong people?\n\nThanks!",

And I also have the ability to read social cues of a 2x4. I was literally checking out at the grocery store and the woman behind me was hitting on me, I didn't realize this until I was home. So I am hopeless.\n\nAny way I was talking to my best friend about highschool and we were talking about how I always found my self in the same social circles (think alternative/stoner/criminal) and even today these are the people I fit in with the best. She told me the reason that that was was because I was the center of the group. She told me that she referred to me to her other friends as everyone's token freak friend. Because I knew and was friends or close acquaintances with at lest two or three people from every circle. I was stunned.  \n\nThe reason for this, she said, was a strange mix of introvert and extrovert.  She said she saw this a parties of when we went to hangout at a friend's. I would come in and find the most comfortable spot to sit, usually a couch or a chair or even a corner of a room. And it was to use her word's \"like I was sitting on a throne\" and no matter what I was doing following the conversation thinking quietly or reading a book it made people want to come over and talk to and get to know me. \n\nThis is where the mix comes in on the outside I was being an extrovert however I was just really carrying on with my introverted ways with company.\n\nThe point of this is for all the young socially awkward introverts out there. Here are two tips. One when you find yourself in a group  find a space, a chair, a corner, a wall to lean against, or even just the spot you are standing and make it your own. So that even in a group you are alone and comfortable. Two when you find yourself in your personal space don't be afraid to bullshit with the people outside of your space. It doesn't even matter what you say really, I once argued for an hour over the reality of time, just talk if you know something about the subject or have an opinion on it than speak up.  If you don't then listen if it is interesting, ask questions or don't be afraid to bullshit there is an old saying that verbal communication is 10% what you say and 90% how you say it. And besides you are in you own world and most of the people outside of it don't matter because you will have very limited contact if any with them.

Tried online dating apps like tinder, POF, and OkCupid, found it very hard to come up with an opening line that would get a response and maintaining a conversation. Most conversations I\u2019ve had in online dating apps, I could tell the girl wasn\u2019t interested.

It\u2019s just always been one-sided for me, girls I liked never shared the same feelings for me, and I just feel that I\u2019ve never been seen as attractive or \u201cdating material\u201d by literally any woman I\u2019ve ever met. \n\nI\u2019m just confused.

I use to have a rather cooperate part-time job but changed to a chill younger office with a good old \u201cstartup\u201d vibe. \n\nMy colleagues are honestly so nice and some of them have become work friends. \nThis is a bit of a big deal for me, at previous jobs I had colleagues that I didn\u2019t really talk to because I\u2019m a really introverted and shy person in an extroverted country. \nBut these people just really want to get to know me and I\u2019ve noticed that all of them hang out after work. They post in the group chat where they are hanging and invite everyone to join. I feel a bit to shy to just drop what I\u2019m doing (at random) to hang with them all. A big group might be a bit overwhelming for me.\n\nBut! \n\nSome colleagues I really like and I want to be part of this group of friends. And want to show this as well. So I thought about it and maybe I could just be the one that starts 'the hanging' so I can invite the group and people will be arriving at different times so I won\u2019t be overwhelmed.\n\nMy plan is: is ask a colleague I like to be friends with to maybe go swim after work one time? (We have been talking about this). And than I invited other people to join? Is that how I do this? \n\nDo you have tips how I could go about this? (The river is next to work and there are plenty of nice spots to swim and even have a BBQ if we\u2019d like to). \n\nSo uhm... help? ^^\n\nEdit: spelling (yup title in wonky but can\u2019t change it)",

        "original": "Every time my husband and I argue, he gets really frustrated and begins treating me like I'm annoying.  Over the past year those arguments have become more and more frequent as I am working from home now and we are around each other a lot more than we used to be.  He often tells me that I'm being difficult, or that I am difficult to deal with.  Whether or not it's true, I'm starting to believe it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a highly sensitive introvert, and growing up I twice lost all of my friends in situations where the group consensus was that I was too annoying to be friends with.  Those experiences really affected me, and drew me into my introversion to the point where I basically stopped speaking to anyone in high school.  When I went to college I finally started to get over it.  I made friends at school and \"came out of my shell\" again, a bit more.  I started to feel like I have some value, but never truly felt like I belonged, always a bit of a weirdo and an outsider.  I think because of my introversion, I like to go much deeper into topics and discussions than most people are comfortable or want to go, and that leaves me feeling alone with no one to truly open up to.  Consequently,  while I do have good friends now, I don't know if I ever truly let myself just be me around anyone except my significant other.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now, the impact of his recent attitude and words has left me feeling helpless.  When we argue now, I try to accept what he says and not fight back, and not irritate him at all.  Despite my best efforts he still gets annoyed and says I'm difficult. I've confronted him about this, and he has afterward said that I'm not really that difficult and it isn't really fair to say that just because we see things from two very different points of view.  But despite his explanation, my beliefs from childhood just won't go away.  I feel like at the core of me there must be something so annoying or difficult that anyone who gets to know the real me won't be able to stand me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been trying to get over it. I meditate Loving Kindness daily and journal gratitude daily (including gratitude towards myself daily).  I try to remind myself of my good qualities, take workout classes at the gym all the time, and I'm proud of my career.  No one else but him treats me like I'm annoying, but I feel sad all the time.  I feel ridiculous because I'm an adult and I should be over the events of my childhood but the constant fear that anything I could say could frustrate him continues to bring me back.  The worst part is that I almost never see it coming.  I'm often shocked at the things that I do that irritate him (like tell him we should hire a trainer when he is complaining about our dog misbehaving).  If I could pinpoint the things, then I could eliminate them.  But I never see it coming until it's too late, so it leaves me with the conclusion that I can't *help* but be super annoying even without realizing it.  I've become awkward, guarded and fearful around him just because I don't want to annoy him and I don't know what else to do.  He, of course, says my fear is making it worse, but I don't know how to let it go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne last thing, I've also begged him to try to temper his annoyance at me unless it is really warranted.  However, he complains that he feels like he's being told that he's not allowed to \"have feelings\" or at least like he's not at liberty to express his feelings.  I get it, I'm highly sensitive, so I take negativity, in tone, physicality and words, more poorly than most, which must be stifling.  I simply don't know what to do...",

        "original": "So, I\u2019m a freshman [19F] college. There is this sophomore boy on campus [20M] who I have seen and passed countless times since the beginning of the school year, but we have never talked. I have no idea how to go from stranger to speaking terms. \n\nI think he has a great sense of style; I can tell he puts effort into the way that he looks which is something I find attractive because I do the same. Not to mention, I love fashion. I have never seen him in just sweats and a sweatshirt \u2014 not that there is anything wrong with this \u2014 because I oftentimes dress this way on lazy days as well. I just find this to be an attractive physical trait in a person because sometimes it\u2019s a symbol of their creativity. \n\nHe is a psychology major just like I am, and he is into art and photography, as well as fitness. I think this seems like the perfect mix and I only know this because I looked at his Instagram. He doesn\u2019t strike me as a cocky guy who wants to play the field, however, I could always be wrong. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my brain dramatizing these instances, but I feel as if every time I see him, he does look at me and makes some sort of eye contact. This \u201ceye contact\u201d makes me want him all the more, because I feel so much tension. However, he could easily do this to every girl/person he passes, and it might not be him going out of his way to look at me. \n\nFor example. Yesterday, I was sitting alone in this huge lounge room at my university. Students do work up here, socialize, or just hangout. I looked up from my phone and all I see are his eyes staring directly into mine as he walked towards me with friends behind him. My stupid brain goes \u201cOh my god, imagine if he said something, look down at your phone quickly\u201d. So I did. I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t coming to say something, but still. Then, I looked back up from my phone about a minute or two later and he was in a seat somewhat diagonally from me, and his head was turned to the side staring at me and he was tapping his fingers on the seat. He looked away when I caught him. I honestly took that as a sign because he had to run the risk of getting caught by turning his head like that. Did he want to say something? The finger tapping got me too. \n\nHe probably just sees me as, at the very least, another pretty face... that is, if he even finds me attractive. I feel as if he has no desire to actually talk to me because I have no way of appearing interesting to him as he does to me since I creeped on his social media hahaha. \n\nI have no idea how to come into contact with him. We do not share the same friends, I do not see him when I am out on the weekends, I don\u2019t even see him in my psychology building due to different schedules. I just see him around. \n\nI\u2019m kind of worried because I seriously think about him so much when I\u2019m at school, only because it drives me nuts how I know he is there, I am so interested in him, I don\u2019t know when I am going to see him and when I do we don\u2019t speak. Is this a problem? \n\nWhat should I do? I feel as if whenever I want a guy first, it doesn\u2019t work and is a telltale sign I should wait for men to come to me. I\u2019m only basing this off of 2 previous experiences though, otherwise I have been totally fine. \n\nAdvice? Sorry for the length of this :)",

I\u2019m a host, so you may think that\u2019d be a struggle for a shy person like me, but surprisingly that\u2019s the easy part. I force a smile at the guests, welcome them in, and take them to their table, no sweat. My real struggle is talking with my coworkers. Everyone\u2019s pretty young, between the ages of 16-20 basically, and when the restaurant gets slow and no one\u2019s really coming in, they talk to each other. I can\u2019t tell if I come off as weird or something because I\u2019m the tall quiet kid, but say I\u2019m standing up at the host stand with another host (there\u2019s usually 2 at a time), one of the bussers/servers will come up and start talking to the other host like I\u2019m not even there. No acknowledgement, no eye contact, nothing. Even if I ever try to chip in, they\u2019ll reply to me, and then go back to their conversation like I\u2019m not even there.

I just found this sub and from the skimming I have done, it seems that a common root of the social anxiety is feeling like others in public settings are negatively judging you, and that people automatically find you unattractive and downright unappealing and my rant goes in a pretty different direction. \n\nI (F23) know that I am pretty decent looking, and I feel pretty confident that a solid portion of individuals sexually attracted to my gender are into my appearance and personality. I glided through college and into life beyond using Tinder and flirtation to create a false sense of social satisfaction: sure I have very few close girl friends to confide in and share experiences with, but look how many guys want to hang out with me all night! Even the few female friends I currently have are lesbian or bi and originally tagged along with me hoping I would change my mind and give them a chance.\n\nFor the past 6 months or so I have been trying to move away from desperate attempts to make friends (real or undercover fuckboys) and just learn to be comfortable alone, which has been great but I decided 2019 would be the year I crack this code and get down to business and form actual connections. Then this evening I go to the grocery store and kid around with one of the clerks. He is about my age and seems to share my odd sense of self-deprecating humor, and we have joked in many of my past visits about how I need to stop being so damn lonely all the time. This time he suggests we exchange numbers and he will \"adopt\" me and help me make more friends. \n\nOn the surface level this is awesome: he seems to truly think I am worthy of hanging out with and our texts have suggested that he'd like to indoctrinate me into his friend group and I have a lot in common with them. However past experience has me SO worried that he is only talking to me because (despite how many times I said I am looking for FRIENDS) he is hoping to get in my pants and I am a horrible person leading him on just like I seem to have done with so many other guys and girls. This is definitely also exacerbated by my experience with rape almost a year and a half ago, which further reinforces my worry that he only wants to use me and leave me even more hollow. I have been through a lot of therapy and rationally know I am overthinking but I am currently just so damn frustrated that less than 24 hours after declaring new year new me I am laying on my couch because my legs are too wobbly from the anxiety of opening up and hurting someone unintentionally, and being hurt by the experience too.\n\nMore than anything I think I just wanted to rant and work out my feelings. But if anyone else can sympathize I'd love to know that I'm not alone. Advice for the future would also be awesome. I was thinking of getting a fake engagement ring or something to send the signal that I'm not interested in romance or sex without risking being that \"umm I have a boyfriend\" bitch. Or should I just stay away from men, or single men, or bisexuals or lesbians or everyone just to avoid being liked for the wrong reasons? Is there some guide to identifying mannerisms that you may not realize are flirtatious? Also is disclosing these anxieties and being vulnerable a good way to open up and get my honest point across or is that super off-putting?\n\nTL;DR: I have social anxiety but can use my sexual attractiveness to bypass it when applicable.

And you look great without that extra weight! It's time for you to fall in love, or even just get a girlfriend.\"\n\nI shut that conversation down immediately. Afterwards I realised something. She actually still thinks I just need to \"come out of my shell\" or \"stop being shy\" or something like that. The closest person in my life, the only one that has known me for my entire 28 years, has no idea who I am. That's not her fault as I keep my issues to myself but it still surprises me that she doesn't realise something is actually wrong with me.

Social anxiety developed as I hit puberty, and I've lived a sheltered and closed in life ever since.  I am married with two cats, rent a house from my work friend that I've all but ignored since moving in, and have a great job with mostly caring and sensitive people.  I've been in therapy about 6 years now, but not consecutive.  \n\nTwo years ago I felt like I was getting in the way of my own therapy, and decided to take a break from therapy and medications to find my own way.  I also started smoking pot, which I've just stopped.  During the break from therapy, I started meditating and taking my own time to find some purpose, or at least a hobby that would help me have something to look forward to.  I stopped meditating as I felt fine during meditation, but once I was finished, it was like nothing happened.  Maybe I was doing it wrong, I don't know, but I also didn't particularly enjoy it, it was just too boring to me.  \n\nI was not making any progress on my search for a hobby, and it was increasingly making me more and more depressed.  I broke a few months ago due to this stress and work stress, and with tears told my wife that I was lost and was losing the will to live.  I got back in touch with my therapist then and got back on medication, and also let my work know that I was extremely burned out and needed help.  They've been great and my boss has basically taken me under his wing for the last few months so I can work through my issues.  I've restarted therapy and medication, but it's only just barely working to keep back the suicidal thoughts, and not helping me get a grip on things.  Previously, I've tried half a dozen different medications with no or little effect, so trying to switch meds seems pointless.  I've also tried working out, but it triggers me since gym class was where I got bullied the worst (there was almost no supervision there); besides, I've had periods in my life where I was working out a lot and still hated it even after years of doing all sorts of exercise.  I know I need to work out more purely for my health, but I'm not in a place where I can work on my issues surrounding it.\n\nI've thought about trying a different therapist, but with my trust issues, it took 3 years for me to even open up, and even then it was very difficult.  I don't think I have that much time.  Since I quit smoking pot, I really have nothing to look forward to after work anymore, and I'm scared that it's going to be the straw that broke the camel's back.  I don't know what to do.  I'm so depressed that everything new I try I hate, and am too scared to make any changes.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this, it's the first post I've ever made on Reddit, the first post I've made about my problems anywhere, but I'm desperate for some ideas.  I've read every post I can find, every article about this, they all say the same bullshit that hasn't helped.  I'm afraid this might be my last post ever.  I don't want to be done, but I can't see any reasons to keep going.\n\nSince this is a throwaway, I won't be able to respond, but I will be reading replies for the next few days.",

        "original": "So I work at a pretty busy local restaurant and that environment is notorious for drugs and alcohol abuse ESPECIALLY on the clock. Earlier this week one of the underage servers was caught drinking tequila (or six shots of it rather) on the job and accusations started pouring out from everyone at everyone. I drink but only moderately at home on my own time and I\u2019ve been clean off drugs for over a year now so there\u2019s no reason for me to be nervous... right?\n\nToday rolls around and a meeting is scheduled after close at 10pm to talk about how bad of a problem it\u2019s been lately. I then get a text from one of my fellow shift leads saying she would like to move the meeting to 9:30 if possible. I figured it was a loose 9:30 since everyone always shows up to meetings late. I show up at 9:38. The meeting is ending AS I WALK IN. I\u2019m a fucking shift lead and in a position of leadership and I\u2019m showing up late. So I talk to my boss, sign a piece of paper saying I won\u2019t do what I\u2019m already not doing and that\u2019s that. \n\nI get home and my buddy texts me saying he\u2019s on his way to the meeting and I tell him \u201cdon\u2019t bother, it\u2019s already over just talk to our boss tomorrow.\u201d\n\nI tell my girlfriend about how my buddy\u2019s an idiot and she looks at me stunned and asks if he\u2019ll get fired for not showing up to a meeting like that. Dread sets in. So I call my buddy and tell him to double check with our boss first instead of just not showing up. He says he didn\u2019t answer. Heart rate increases. I call my boss. Nothing. Cold sweats drip off my face and French my back. It\u2019s not a panic attack but it\u2019s extreme nervousness and anxiety of me possibly getting my best friend fired for dumb advice I had no grounds to give. I call the store phone on the off chance he\u2019s still there. Now. Backstory. We have a sister restaurant about fifteen minutes away in the same town. When the phone picks up, I don\u2019t recognize the voice that answers and I worry I called the wrong store. Now, here\u2019s how it went down.\n\nI don\u2019t recognize the person who answered and it throws me into fully unnecessary \u201cFUCKING PANIC\u201d mode and I forget what I\u2019m doing or even how to talk to these people I\u2019ve known for more than a year. I say my name and he\u2019s like \u201cyeah okay what\u2019s up\u201d and I have no recollection of why I called but I know it\u2019s important so I just say nothing and stay on the line. He\u2019s like \u201cwhatever one sec\u201d and hands off the phone to another guy. He answers super positively asking what\u2019s up but I\u2019m still not sure it\u2019s the right store so I try to throw him a little test to see and make sure.\n\nWith cocaine like speed and jitters I say \u201cI\u2019m wondering about the meeting, is it still happening?\u201d\n\n\u201cBud\u201d the person I now can hear as my boss starts suddenly very serious. \u201cWe just had the meeting.. are you oka-\u201c\n\nI cut him off and just spew out with all the information I had forgotten but still nervously slurring my words. He says it\u2019s all good but I can hear the goddamn suspicion in his voice. I was late when I\u2019m never late, I went home, called and sounded super weird repeating my name and asking which store this is and all this dumbass druggy shit. It just looked so bad and I\u2019m still panicking two hours later. I just need support and to feel like I\u2019m not a fucking freak.\n\nTL;DR: After a meeting covering the abuse of drugs and alcohol in my company, I almost immediately call my boss once I get home and have the most delirious out of body conversation I\u2019ve ever had cause I got a little nervous and it sounded like I was on drugs.

That was just once, though, and next time I went for a checkup at the doctor, I mentioned that I get really anxious when I have to talk to strangers or give presentations and he was like \u201coh it\u2019s normal, mindfulness works to get rid of it\u201d and I was like *no I don\u2019t think you understand the severity of this situation* but I was too **_anxious_** to say that.

I'm strangling with anxiety and depression over 15 years now and back than it was probably the worst time for me. I went to special school for people with same needs and problems, and stays there for about 6 years.\n\n\nOver the years I developed social skills and became a different person. From being scared from my own shadow, I became one of the most popular people I knew, both with friends and girls. \n\n\nAfter living the place, I served the Israeli army for a year, and left my parents house to an apt with rommates at the south of country,  payd almost fully by the state because of my needs as an handicap. \n\n\nWithout going too much into details, my last few months living there I felt into a big depression,  something that can happen for me as I have chronic depression and it's hard to maintain it when it realy goes wild... I started to smoke weed more and more, i even dropped the cigarette and started smoking weed full time.  One day, a new rommate came, and he told the state worker that I'm a drug addict. Long story short, they sent me home and canceled my state handicap privileges. \n\n(I live in a state witch smoking weed is very illegal in... they also cancle the handicap privileges if they catch you drinking a beer).\n\nSo. To the point. It's been about 2 years since I went back to my parents, and my social life became less and less...\nPeople lost touch one after the other, and I have very few friends left.\n\n\nBut here's the kicker... when I ask myself how it came to this... I mostly come to think it's because I didnt have any routine like school to meet people. But today my firm took the worker to the movies as a treat. I came and said hello to some people, but that's about all. I watch almost all of them are having some sort of small talk between each,  but I couldn't find a way to just naturally talk with anyone... I felt like if someone watched from the side, I would be the only weirdo to drink coffee alone and occasionally look at my phone....\n\nLike if someone ask someone else what they think of me, they wont even remember who I am....\n\n\nMaybe me being a long for so long wasn't just because of not having a place to meet people,  but because i subcutaneously pushing everyone away?\n\nCould it be that Me being lonely for so long, made my social skills much worse than before?\n\n\nWhat would be the right way for me to act so ill learn again to attract people around me and just feel natural around them?\n\nSorry for the long post and bad English.

        "original": "Here it goes..\n\nI may be 2 years late to answer this question, just as I\u2019m late to the pleasures of having sex, but I\u2019ll answer anyway. Take it or leave it.\n\nI\u2019m the 40 year-old virgin. Not Steve Carell, but a more realistic real-life version of what the film would have people believe being an Incel is like.\n\nThere are many reasons for this, but to save time, let\u2019s just say that I suffer from various disorders and body image issues due to my unattractive appearance. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve imagined, either. It\u2019s been confirmed by others all my life exactly what I look like, so I have no doubts about that.\n\nThe problem is that I can\u2019t accept my flaws. The majority of people seem to grow out of their esteem issues at a certain point, but I never did. I started feeling insecure at the age of 14 (puberty) and now, at 40, there seems to be no stopping the progression of depression and feelings of hopelessness. It\u2019s getting worse all the time.\n\nI\u2019m stuck in a catch-22. I want to have a girlfriend, but I feel too ugly to pursue one. And if any woman (ANY woman) showed interest, I\u2019d panic and reject her because I don\u2019t feel worthy of being loved.\n\nSo if you add this conundrum to my general feelings of worthlessness, it all becomes a bit too much to cope with, really. All my friends and relatives have families of their own. And growing up, I was the only one anyone knew who didn\u2019t even date. Instead, I hid away in my room, waiting for\u2026something.\n\nAnd today, nothing\u2019s changed. I\u2019m on disability because my social anxiety prevents me from having a job. I can\u2019t socialize or make friends. I never travel and I don\u2019t have any hobbies. All I do is read books and play video games like an overgrown man-child. And the only contact I ever have with another human being is when someone delivers the food I\u2019ve ordered online.\n\nI left my apartment today for the first time in 3 months, and only because I had an obligation I couldn\u2019t get out of. And I hated every minute of being away from home! Home is \u201csafe\u201d. Home is the place where no one can judge you. And it\u2019s an absolute torment to depend on being in it, and never taking any risks.\n\nI\u2019ve tried therapies and medication. Nothing worked. And now I don\u2019t even want to meet with a therapist, because hey, people judge you, and therapists are people! I haven\u2019t even met my parents for the last 16 years because I can\u2019t stand them looking at me either. It\u2019s a nightmare.\n\nYou could argue that this isn\u2019t strictly an Incel problem. I\u2019ve got other things going on here. And that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s also undeniable that someone who can\u2019t stand the way they look, and who fears being looked at by others, is inevitably going to have to deal with the realities of being an Incel.\n\nWomen don\u2019t exactly throw themselves at someone who doesn\u2019t want to live but is too afraid to end it all, do they? And rightfully so. I don\u2019t think it would be fair for me to start going after women. They don\u2019t need to deal with my problems. It\u2019s more than enough that I have to.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a burden to live with the knowledge that you don\u2019t have a choice in the matter. I\u2019d have to be completely rehabilitated before I could even dream of starting to date anyone. And like I said, I\u2019m 40 now, so even if my mental state improves, I don\u2019t see how could possibly \u201cget out there\u201d before I\u2019m 55 or so. And what\u2019s the point of having your first girlfriend at 55?\n\nMy best years are behind me, and all that remains is to grow ever more bitter and lonely. And Christmas is just around the corner as I write this.\n\nHo ho ho\u2026\n\nAnyway, THIS is what can happen if you being Incel is caused by mental issues. What I wouldn\u2019t give for a simple \u201cdry spell\u201d!\n\n",

I've never had a close friend in my entire life because I constantly fear they're judging me, it's hard for me to even talk to my own family. About 3 months ago I got a girlfriend. I was extremely nervous around her but she asked me to be her boyfriend because she thought I was cute. It was extremely difficult for me to talk to her but I admired her personality. Fast forward a couple months to today and I still get nervous when I talk to her, it's not that bad but around friends I get loud and kind of yell sometimes but around her I talk very timidly. I can make some jokes and she'll laugh but I'm always too scared to continue on a joke because I think she's just laughing to make me happy. As a side not, I never had a single female friend before this, I couldn't even talk to girls, like literally they would say hi and I wouldn't respond. So, back to the thing with my girlfriend, when I talk to her I can't carry on a conversation even though around my friends I actually like to carry the conversation, she doesn't carry the conversation either. She says it's not but I always feel like it's awkward when we hang out, and I honestly don't enjoy hanging out and doing stuff with her because I can't joke around and have fun with her, I'm too nervous to speak 1/2 the time. I guess what I'm trying to say is I don't know if I like this girl, I love her personality, she's cute, she's understanding af about my depression, but I can't enjoy spending time around her because I feel sick because I'm too nervous. I think part of it is that all of my friends have low self esteem, and I'm friends with them because I can feel comfortable around them, but she's not that way. Also, I've always been too nervous to even talk to a girl in the form of just a simple hello. I'm not sure if I like my girlfriend or not, I've talked to her mom and stuff and I know I mean the world to her so I would feel terrible about leading her on. What should I do about this, I'm thinking the best thing to do would be to tell her exactly how I feel so she can decide what to do on her own but I'm not sure.",

The anxiety is in my chest too and sometimes I feel like I\u2019m dying. \n\nI feel anxious cause I have only two friends who aren\u2019t even in the same group as each other. One of them isn\u2019t even in any of my classes. The fact that I miss school a lot means I miss work and leave my one friend behind in classes. And I feel a strain on my workload and the relationship with my friend. \n\nThis gives me even more anxiety when I stay home. But even if I do go to school, my anxiety is still pretty bad. \n\nMy friend also doesn\u2019t get me and is pretty logical. She probably thinks I\u2019m too emotional because she doesn\u2019t do that even though she  has more to deal with. \n\nThis gives me more anxiety to face her and my classes the next day. I\u2019m scared they\u2019re going to send me to a counsellor or get me in permanent trouble. \n\nOver the past few days, I\u2019ve gotten the flu and had to stay home so far this week. I missed the first day back from winter break and a field trip today. But given my track record, idk if anyone will believe me. I left her alone on the first day back and on the field trip. My class is going to look at me and think I\u2019m pathetic and stupid for not coming even though I was sick. \n\nI\u2019m so scared. My depression caused me to stop doing any work.

I like my tasks (it's business related but a lot of writing and researching without many phone calls which I absolute despise etc.) and get along well with other interns and workers. \n\nAt the same time, I interviewed for a permanent job related to my degree for a company in my home country. I was so nervous and, as always, was beet-red throughout the whole interview (as a 26 year old guy... my biggest issue with my SA = it is so visible instantly...) but got offered the job and it would be essentially slightly over double the salary of my upgraded internship. \n\nHowever, the job is a lot of telemarketing, connecting buyers with sellers, organizing meetings etc and that just sounds super stressful and was my most hated part of the internship. Also I heard about stressful work environment at that company (quotas to reach, overtime, quite typical hierarchical structure etc as it's a organization backed by the government of my degree country known for those harsh working conditions). \n\nAlmost everybody thinks I am crazy that I am leaning towards staying in my target country but I really notice positive changes over the last few months to lessen my SA and want to stay here.

First started recognizing something was up at about 13 but it was only mid last year that I finally discovered this place and realize that actually something really was up lol.  \n\nI've started college here in the UK this year where it hit hardest, at the start of the year. Every day felt so sick I didn't eat breakfast because I was too busy dreading the day's interactions with new people and whatnot. Since October/November it's subsided enough but it's always lingered, denying me opportunities all the time. Presented right in front of me, only for me to hesitate and squirm due to irrational thoughts.\n\nAnyways, on to today.\n\nIt didn't really feel like a special day. Recently I've reconnected with an old friend of mine and we made plans (that I assumed were forgotten about lol) to hang out at lunch break for once, which of course I was dreading since there was a fair few (many) people I'd never even seen before that I would be suddenly introduced to. I said a few days ago we could do it today (its kinda awkward to find suitable times because I've got my own dependencies) but she said today wasnt a good time for whatever reason so I kinda assumed it'd be a normal thursday. Anyways at this point im rambling, I get jumped at lunch by her when she said about it being today. This was definitely one of those opportunities in front of me I could easily decline and squirm out of... but nope! I agreed to it.\n\nFast forward a while and eventually we come to the crowded lunch hall which I usually avoid because there's too many people crowded in one spot so I don't often feel too comfortable there. As it happens I didnt see any new faces (saving that for a later day - I'm keen to meet these people I just hope I pull through to do it), but there wasnt any available seats we could immediately see. As a result, for that moment we just had to kinda stand around right in plain sight which would normally absolutely kill me but I really just didn't feel it. Eventually we found some chairs at an empty table but for 3 people there was only 2. I see on the table next to that which is half empty seats, half random girls I'd never seen in my life before, so without much thinking at all I go up to them and ask them if they're using a chair so I could have one - unheard of only a few months ago!

I was fairly easy going as a kid but SA cropped up really bad in high school (new area) for me because I didn't know anyone and wasn't in any of the local cliques. Anyway, I've progressed a lot since then thankfully via study abroad experiences and therapy (don't get as nervous around friends or people I know, and can tolerate strangers whereas meeting up with friends or strangers before in public would induce a lot of physical symptoms of anxiety, worked through some early relationship anxiety, I actually drive now and don't get as worked up about other drivers, etc), but I still have trouble.

In my friend life and in my \"career\" life so to speak, I'm STILL afraid of doing or saying something wrong. All of this seems stupid to me, too, because I know I have made big strides in the past few years. But \"real life\" is approaching (grad soon) and frankly I don't know if I can handle it/anything, really. \n\nI've been off medication for almost a year (I was on a brand I normally wouldn't be able to be on bc of my other meds for another condition which tbh is likely intertwined w my anxiety but I can't really go into detail) but I am thinking about getting back on to prep for life after graduation. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to vent.

        "original": "I've always had problems talking to people and forming interpersonal relationships, but it's now at a point where it's safe to say that it is ruining my life. \n\nI only have two people that I somewhat regularly talk to, because they're friends from all the way back in elementary school. My family life is fucked, I live alone in a small apartment and talk to them only very occasionally. The only person from my family that I have a deeper connection with is my twin sister, who however has moved to the other side of the country, so I only see her very rarely. Even she doesn't know of the full extent of my anxiety and depression, I think she just thinks that's who I am. \n\n---\n\nI just turned 21 now and I'm about to finish up an internship at an IT company, that I luckily got not because of my social skills, but because I was top of my class and they offered it to me because of that. Just like with every other job/school I've been to before though, I talk to no one unless it's absolutely necessary and I have to do it because of the job. I feel uncomfortable and don't feel like I can relate to anyone there, even though they're not bad people or anything.\n\nNow my supervisor came up to me last Friday and told me that while I do my job well, I won't be able to get a full time position after the internship (which was the mutual plan from the start) because of my lacking social skills and me not talking to anyone. This honestly didn't surprise me that much, but it still hit me like a brick. I was trying to hold back tears and felt completely dumbstruck for the rest of the day, not because I want the job so desperately, but because this is the nail in the coffin in my realization that my social anxiety is absolutely ruining my life. \n\nI am dealing with depression because of how miserable my life is and because of how terrible it feels to miss out on life. Life is passing me by and I watch every year go by with minimal change. I've never even kissed a girl, I spend most of my time playing computer games or browsing the internet, because I have nothing else to do. The thought of engaging in social activity, let alone go to parties or something, ignites instant panic in me.\n\nThe thing is that my supervisor offered to give me one last chance to better my social behavior in the remaining 1.5 months of my internship. He's surprisingly nice considering that most people usually write off my social anxiety as ignorance, and I don't hold a grudge against him for not wanting to employ me, I honestly probably wouldn't employ myself either. He recommended me to join an acting club because he believes that would help, but honestly that just made me panic and I can't even see myself doing something like this. I think I literally couldn't do it. He said I should think about it over the weekend.\n\nSo what do I do? I can't see myself joining an acting club, the thought of that alone frightens me and I think I would only leave even more retreated in my shell. But if I say no that would show them that I'm not trying to better myself. The thought of seeing a therapist sounds more promising to me, there would be less pressure and I could try to figure myself out as to why I am like this. I definitely think it has to do with past experiences in my life, I developed trust issues from an abusive mother that might have developed into me not being able to get personal with anybody.\n\nThen again I started questioning if it might be better if I don't even try to stay at that company after the internship. People there, while nice, already have the impression of me being a freak, and the longer I know people the harder it is to be myself around them after all this time. I might need a fresh start or just some time off for myself to really self reflect and get a handle on things. I just want to start living and stop this endless cycle of mundane existence. Regardless, tomorrow I have to tell my supervisor what I have envisioned for the future, and I still don't know.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, especially if you've been or are still going through the same things. Thanks.",

It was relentless, from the time I stepped into the classroom first thing in the morning, and even on the schoolbus home. I'd end up getting physically sick (vomiting, clammy skin, fevers from panicking) to either get sent home early or to avoid school altogether. I had no idea what \"anxiety\" was, and neither did my parents. I was just being unruly and lying in my father's eyes. It got worse in middle school, and eventually my dad decided to homeschool me due to me missing school all the time. My schoolwork improved, I was overall happier, but things were still rough at home. I ended up dropping out of school, got my GED as soon as I turned 18, but by now I was incredibly socially withdrawn. I no longer talked to any friends from school, all I had was my mom and my dogs. By 18, I could no longer make eye contact with anyone, its near impossible for me to answer or make phone calls.. even if its with family or friends online. I hate going out in public, and so far I've only had 2 jobs in my lifetime, both of which I couldn't handle. The clammy skin, vomiting, the hyperventilating, the inability to do or say anything, it all came back both times. I was miserable. I don't know how I'm supposed to keep a job when I have absolute mental breakdowns like this. \n\nMy stepfather had a heart attack 3 years ago, and I was (and still am) too much of a piece of shit to dial 911 myself.. luckily my mom was on break at work and was able to call just in time. I still can't forgive myself for that.  I've been seeing a therapist, but so far I'm not finding it very helpful? I'm also regularly seeing a psychiatrist but finding the right medication is a pain.\nI'm just sick and tired of seeing my few friends moving on, moving out, doing things with their lives, while I struggle even going to the grocery store.

        "title": "How can I stop being so shy?",
        "original": " I literally feel like I can't talk to people at all. I know my vocal chords are capable because I've screamed before, and I yell across the house to my siblings all the time, and I speak normally to my mom when we're at home, but when I try to talk to my teacher on the phone my mind literally goes blank and I mumble. It's not that there's nothing in my head, because I can write my essays and get a good grade and stuff, but when they ask me questions it's like I can't remember anything and I end up making a fool of myself.  And when I try talking to someone in public, unless it's just a \"sorry\" or \"thanks\", my face gets hot and my throat gets sore like I'm about to cry. I feel like, in my soul, I'm really outgoing and like I can go talk to everyone, but in reality I'm too scared to even ask the lady at self checkout if I can buy a bag. I also have this reoccurring nightmare where I'm trying to call out for help and I'm screaming as hard as I can but I'm not making any sound. \n\nI've been afraid of talking to people for as long as I can remember. Earliest memory of this was when I was in kindergarten and my music class was singing the \"who stole the cookie from the cookie jar\" song, when it was my turn to say \"who me?\" or whatever, I was too afraid to do it, so I just stood there awkwardly until another kid was like \"she doesn't talk\" and they moved on with the song. Another thing is that when I do talk; I'm really quiet. When people introduce themselves to me and I have to say my name back, most of the time they'll ask me to repeat myself and then after I do that, they'll be like \"Olivia?\", and I'm too scared to correct them so I just nod. \n\nAs I've said, I've always been shy, but it's only just now starting to really affect me. When I was little and people would talk to me and I wouldn't answer them, I feel like they probably didn't think much of it because people don't except much from kids, but now that I'm almost an adult, when I mumble or speak so quietly that they have to ask me to repeat myself, it's incredibly embarrassing. Besides the whole speaking thing, when I go places, I'm always very nervous and uncomfortable and I feel like I can't act like a normal person. I don't know where to look, if I should just stare straight ahead, at the floor, or look around.. what ever I do, I just feel really weird and like everyone is watching me like \"what the heck is she doing?\".. I come back from going somewhere feeling like I'm about to have a breakdown. Sometimes I wish that I could just trip and hit my head and forgot everything so that I would lose my personality and start over and I know that that's not how it works, but still. I know this probably seems so trivial and like not a big deal at all, which is probably true considering people have waaaaay bigger problems than this, but **it's really starting to take a toll on me and I need to change, but I don't know how.

It's frustrating because before uni I was actually making small strides and feeling more confident generally in day-to-day situations, but this since September has made me feel as though I'm back to square one. I guess it breaks down into two problems - \n\n \\- I just can't physically bear the small talk and the inevitable silence that follows after a while. I just feel plain uninteresting and exposed when I have to stand there and cook with someone else and as I said, it is actually physically painful in my chest and stomach to do. This has resulted in nobody in the flat knowing me that well (although I've made some small talk) which feels really isolating. It has meant me living off pre-bought cold food, which is detrimental to both my wallet and my health.\n\n\\- There's one person in my flat who I've never spoken to or met properly, for some reason I just got really intimidated when I heard him outside on the first day. So I've basically hidden from him and now it would be extremely awkward if we were in the kitchen alone at the same time. This also results in me not using the kitchen or timing it when I know he goes out.\n\nHas anyone who's been in any sort of similar situations advise any tips for how to combat this and take small steps?

I started this past Tuesday but had been sick through the beginning of the week as well as sleep-deprived (mostly due to anxiety but also sickness). Anyways, today I meet this girl due to circumstance and we start walking around campus and talking. After talking for a bit I learned she graduated high school pretty young and was already a senior (from what a gathered this girl was only 19, maybe 20); and of course on top of that, I found her attractive, so already I'm already struggling to hold conversation because I just find her amazing. We keep talking and she doesn't seem too bothered by me, (we ended getting lunch together and talking for another hour before she had to leave for class). Just as a side-note this is the third girl I have talked to in college and the other two were almost exactly like this girl; they had all been through pretty traumatic shit in their past, this girl had lost her boyfriend (I didn't ask how, as to not be rude) and her mother was diagnosed with cancer. So, I just had this immense respect for her as I had for these other two women on top of everything else mentioned earlier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I end up exchanging numbers with this girl which is where my already growing anxiety just goes ballistic. I make one shitty joke, begin to think about how poorly it went with the other two girls, start thinking about how awkward I must have been at lunch; since I was sick and sleep deprived I wasn't exactly sharp, on top of the way I had almost immediately felt about this girl. Just, shit starts piling up which in turn starts making me feel more depressed and anxious than normal ; and when I get back from school I get home and my body aching, I have a headache and I can't stop thinking about this girl. I keep thinking what's wrong with me for being here again; and, even if it were possible, do I need a friend or something more (I had just recently lost my best friend of 20 years and had been feeling more lonely than ever this past year), so I'm just currently a mess; I honestly just don't want to mess this up and be friends with this girl but can't help feel like I did something wrong or said something really stupid (we've stopped texting each other so I'm probably reading into that too much as well), but I'm really unsure what to do.

My parents don't treat me as a middle child, though sometimes I can tell they don't favor me as much as they favor my siblings. My middle school principle told me that I need to \"step up my game\", I was fucking 11 at that for god's sake!

I remember times when my mom would introduce my older sister to her friend's daughters. She would tell her to add my sister on facebook and add her in contacts. Most of the time these girls are almost my age, not my sister's. I guess my mom thinks I'm not that responsible because I'm younger. And to make it worse, these girls would talk to my sister more and kind of avoid me. I always feel like the third wheel. I guess rejection has made me more anxious as a person. I'm also very sensitive, which I say, is not a bad thing but it has its cons. My mom cares about me deeply because she's a highly sensitive person like me but I can't help but think I'm their least favorite child.

Like, I danced multiple times in front of class and the school by myself with no problems. I can't remember where everything went wrong.\n\nSo I'm in 12th grade now, with more or less no social life, struggling to to go school, struggling to even talk to my siblings (who are twice my age) and a thriving eating disorder, which I want to say that I have control over, but I don't. Social anxiety and an ed, definitely go hand in hand and just makes everything a hundred times harder.\n\nAs I'm writing this, I'm sitting in one of the school bathrooms and bawling my eyes out, because of foreign languages class (which I'm ditching again for the fourth time in three weeks). I've been learning German for like five years now, and Korean for two (self-taught). BUT my classmates act like they are perfect in everything and have this totally fake personality when speaking to others. Also the teacher is pretty strict and doesn't teach well. Everything about German class gives me anxiety. Like, I understand it, but do not dare to speak. I guess this is where my social anxiety kicks in. I have talked to the school and they said that they would not put me under an oral pressure (except from presentations). But you can't learn a language properly without speaking it tho. My anxiety is so bad I'm like cold sweating, rapid heart beat, dizziness and headaches (the ed makes it even worse). I can sit in class and hold back my tears, but it's hard considering we have double classes. So two hours of every class. I don't raise my hand in other classes either.\n\nI'm going to change school after summer vacation. I currently go to what is considered the \"best\" and \"most prestigious\" school in my city and considering how hard it is to get in, I shouldn't complain. Maybe changing to a more \"normal\" school could help relive som of my stress... I go to a psychiatrist, but I don't feel like it's doing anything good. My mom is also aware of this, but she doens't understand it...\n\nDoes anyone have tips on how to deal w all of this? I feel very overwhelmed and on the verge of giving up, been that for years now.

The work is unpaid now but if I pass the one month internship period I will get hired full time (with good pay) and will be able to get a Visa. Social anxiety has made me doubt I'll get the job. If I don't get it, I'll be in extreme financial difficulty and will likely end up homeless.**\n\nI have terrible social anxiety, like most people in this sub. I graduated from college last year in the US and recently was offered an internship role with a small company/startup for a position that's basically a tech consultant. The internship period is unpaid but if they're satisfied with my technical and social skills, then I'll be offered a full time job that pays well.\n\nThis is the end of the second week of a five week period as an intern. A couple times a week I have to give a mock presentation to my boss who plays the role of the client. So far it's been a disaster. My voice shakes, my hands shake, and I can barely speak coherently because I'm so nervous (I'm from an English speaking country so it's not like I have to deal with a language barrier). One time my boss literally put his hands over his face as I was done presenting and said something like 'I barely understood anything you said. Speak more clearly next time'. I know I still have three weeks left but I just feel like there's no way I can drastically improve socially (i.e when giving presentation).\n\nWhat's making me even more nervous is the situation I'll be in if I don't get the job. My apartment lease ends at the end of February and at that point I'll literally have no money unless I get a job. My student visa also expires at the end of the year. I haven't talked to my parents in years and since I have no friends in the US, I'll have no place to go at the end of February. I could conceivably ask a friend from back home to let me stay with them but they are also struggling financially after just graduating from college. I don't even know if any of them would be able to pay the $1k plane ticket for me to fly back home and stay with them.\n\nI've thought about looking for another job right now but I feel like that's pretty much giving up. I already told my friends at home that I was hired and it would be so embarrassing to tell them I didn't get the job (tbh they'd probably also know it's because of my social skills because I told them about the position).\n\nThe way I see it, there are 3 possible scenarios:\n\n1. Get this job and be able to get a Visa and pay rent\n2. Assume I don't get this job and look for a retail type of job while I'm interning that at least allows me to pay rent from March onward. I'm not sure if I have the time since I work M-F 9-5 and I'd have to be hired almost immediately. Also I'd have to look for another job during my time in retail that can give me a work Visa since it expires at the end of the year \n3. End up homeless at the end of February and just try to find freelance programming work until I get back on my feet\n\nI'd pretty much feel like a failure unless I get the job which seems increasingly unlikely. \n\n\\\\rant",

        "original": "This is a transcription of something I posted elsewhere, and wanted to share it.  This is all my opinion, subject to change, and I would absolutely love to dialogue about these ideas and go in-depth on anything brushed over quickly.  Here goes:\n\nWe like realistic games because we want to believe that we could overcome if a situation like that came up in real life.  That's why I'm a big fan of games like TerraFirmaCraft, Project Zomboid, and Neo Scavenger.  But I find myself getting into a loop where I want to play as many realistic games as possible getting more and more realistic, but never actually taking action in the real world to learn the skills I'm trying to replicate.  It's like I'm trying to get closer and closer to the real thing, but the real world is 1000x more realistic than the most realistic game (obvious but true).  I'm tricking myself thinking I'll 'get there', but it won't happen.\n\nThat's why lately I've been abandoning video games and deciding to learn real skills -- like actual fighting techniques and survival skills.  I want to be prepared for the worst case scenario.  I want to be someone people can't beat in a fight, someone who could survive if society crumbled, someone with solid first aid skills, and someone who can hold ground in an invasion if, God forbid, it ever happens for some reason.  I also want to have skills applicable right now -- to be able to start a business with nothing to my name, learn to own property, and be financially fruitful.\n\nAll the realistic video games (probably even unrealistic ones to some extent!) are trying to scratch that same itch.  It must be an innate human instinct.  But the sad truth is that games can't do it.  They trick you into thinking you are becoming more skilled and adept, but the transferable application to real life is only 1/1000th of what it feels like.  They screw with the reward centers in our heads.  I honestly think video games are a bit of an epidemic issue, and a huge problem for some people (like me).\n\nI have found that the best way to combat the coincidence of video game addiction, feeling helpless, being anxious, and having a generally low-testosterone existence is to start exercising.  I've been a pretty bad case of anxiety and shit for 25 years, but just by starting a rigorous exercise routine in the last few months, I've absolutely blasted through many of my issues with social anxiety, I've made ridiculous progress in my romantic pursuits, and I finally feel like I'm becoming a real \"man's man\".  It's insane how much difference exercise has made for me.  I haven't even changed my diet at all.  I still eat unhealthy (not recommended), but feel like everything in my life is at least ten times better now.\n\nHuge rabbit trail-ing rant, I know.  If anyone has read all of this, thank you.  I hope it's helped you somehow.  Again, I will be very receptive to dialoguing about this stuff -- let me know what you think.",

I also dance, get angry, shout, and that kind of stuff you do when you feel confident. But when I'm with other people (friends, classmates, strangers) I feel like something stops me of being myself. I can't sing, I never talk about the music I like, somehow I can't show when I get angry (people often tell me that I'm always smiling), and I barely talk.\n\nI find it so difficult to make new friends because I can't talk to strangers. I think I am extremely boring. Most times when I go to parties I don't have anyone to talk to.

I do have a small group of friends for 4 years but as I said I can't be myself when I'm with them.\n\nI've never had a girlfriend or even a date cause I find it so hard to talk to girls I find cute and cool, so guess I avoid having conversations with them.\n\nWhen I have to do something like talking in front others about myself, I would be shaking and my heart will start racing so fast, I could feel my palpitations, or feel a lump in my throat, never so intense like panic attacks.

However, when we were introduced again, he brought up how he remembered my other colleague, but when it came to me he fell silent. Meeting someone simultaneously with someone else and that same \"someone\" only remembering the other person tends to happen to me frequently. Another similar situation happened just this Monday, when a program manager said they loved my peer (who met her at the same time I did) but in fact did not remember me. Does anyone else ever just feel so forgettable? It really put me down when thinking about how many times this has happened to me since I was around 9 years old. \n\nAlso, I have worked very hard to learn to be more of a presence in groups. However, I always ALWAYS get told I am quiet or \"serious.\" I could be having the best time and think \"wow I was so extroverted today!\" and someone would still comment on how I am quiet. WHAT.

When he is put in a social situation without my mom he sweats profusely. He currently takes medication for anxiety. \n\nAlthough I have not told him, I have felt the exact same way as him. I have worked very hard to overcome it/ at least mask it by several means,  but I don't see any attempt from him. We could go to a family member's house and he'll still just be silent and obviously a bit nervous when he does actually speak. Is there anyone (who also helped an older person/who is themselves older) who may know how  I can help my dad? I want him to not have a war in his head every time he has to have a conversation. I know how that feels and it is terrible.",

        "original": "I'm in graduate school. I graduate in May, and I'm panicking about finding my first full-time job. As an undergraduate, I studied biology and was going to go to med school. My family and friends had high hopes for me because I was always a good student. They thought I'd be a successful doctor. But I developed this terrible social anxiety disorder. It got so bad that for a time I was afraid to go to class. I decided not to go to medical school, even though I had the grades to go. I thought I'd have a breakdown or become very depressed because the medical profession is known for causing a degradation in mental health. I decided to get my masters in accounting, so I could quickly get a job. When I switched from the medical path, my family turned on me. They started telling me I was too old to be in school, and pressuring me because I've never worked full-time in my life.\n\nI thought that accountants didn't need to speak to people very often. I was wrong. The interview process for accounting is all about your personality, being a good fit for the office. Unfortunately, interviews nearly bring me to full-blown panic attacks. I practice interview questions, but it hasn't helped. I've gotten some interviews with top public firms due to my grades, but I've blown all of them because of my anxiety. I don't have a job lined up yet. My family now tells me I'll never work, and they're afraid for my future, like there's something defective about me. They get angry with me for not getting hired. The need for a job and my past failures to reach any potential I may have had have caused me to dread my future.\n\nI fear working. Just the thought of being stuck in a place with people I don't know and having to complete tasks that I don't understand, of having deadlines and expectations, of having to continually talk to people, eat with people, keep up appearances, causes me to panic. I know it's a normal part of life, but I'm mentally weak. I don't believe in myself. I've failed repeatedly to beat this disorder and get out on my own. I tried therapy and I seemed to get better, but it was a false hope. I do alright after getting used to a routine, but when something changes, the anxiety comes back. For example, I had a class last semester where every class the professor randomly called on people to answer questions. Something so simple as answering homework problems caused my fear of going to class to return after a few years. It's been a decade of being stuck in my body, knowing the fear is irrational, yet failing to cope. A decade of panic attacks, derealization/depersonalization, few close friendships, working hard in school for seemingly no reason if I can't get a job. I'm 26. My parents tell me they were married with a house and kids at my age. I have student loan debt. No job aside from a part-time substitute teaching position, where I only sub a couple times per month. I thought I might be able to become a CPA and still have a good career, even if accounting isn't my true passion, but I've failed to get a public accounting job. I supposedly had so much potential, and I've accomplished nothing.",

My GF says other girls do it to me and don't notice.\n\n3. I don't have a \"best friend,\" someone to hang out with (besides my GF). I do hang around people but I do not have someone I talk to or contact on a regular basis.\n\n4. I have a hard time asking people to hang out or asking to join a group.\n\n5. I am not a fan of alcohol or drugs so parties become a real challenge to show people I can be fun. Usually, it isn't bad but I don't feel like I connect with people.\n\n6. I am a yes man. Oh my gosh, I have inconvenienced myself so much because I have said yes to other people's request.\n\n7. My personal relationship and parental relationship has been affected by my anxiety.

        "original": "Hello, this is the first time I am posting something here and I have something that has been in my mind for many weeks.\n\nI'm a 19 years old male and I have had social anxiety for as long as I can remember. \n\nMy few close friends are all in a different university so I do not see them that much. I made myself another close friend (at least I think she is) in my school but she is way older than me (7 years older) so I am scared that she thinks that I'm just a whiny kid. She is very wise since she went through worst things than I did, but she has always been very kind to me (I'm not sure if its real or just because I am pitiful). She told me bad things that happened to her and about her cancer but I don't feel that special because I think that she tells that to everyone (even though she told me not to speak about that).\n\nA month ago, I have been to a bar with her and other people that I didn't knew that much. First, it is very hard for me to go out with people, especially if I don't know them but also, that day I was already feeling bad and I just wanted to forget my bad social skills and relations by drinking.\n\nWe were sitting around a table and everybody were very talkative (except me),  I was impressed by how people were able to talk about things that I would never think about. I was feeling more and more bad since no one was speaking to me, I tried to join  conversations but people were just ignoring my existence and I just felt like a ghost. I continued to drink a lot and alone to forget what was happening to me. \n\nFew hours later, I was so drunk that I just didn't say a word, I was all alone in my mind and outside, yet we were 10+. I found that incredible that no one talked to me for hours, I still don't understand why. Then we decided to move to a guy's flat. It was just getting worst because we were sitting on a couch, everybody were joking and smoking weed and I was silent, no one was noticing me and the anxiety continued to hurt me as I was less and less drunk.\n\nThen few minutes later, we decided to go home but my friend (the girl) was so high that she couldn't stay up and I saw that. We were going down the stairs when she fell, I catched her in time because I was next to her, the other guys took her in charge and no one ever thanked me (I don't care). Even she doesn't remember. \n\nWe were splitting up, some people had their car, my friend lives next to the train station and I was going there. I told them but no one listened, my friend was speaking to a guy and they were in front of me and completly ignoring me because I am a ghost. Little by little, i was separating myself from them just to see if they would notice me going away. My friend did and asked me twice if I was alright, I told her I was but I was not, I was feeling terribly bad. Then more and more dark ideas came to my mind, I wouldn't bother her with my problems. So I fled, I heard her calling me but I was to scared to face her, I just runned away and almost got hit by a car (sometimes I regret that I didn't). I walked through a street all alone in the dark and I was trying to have beautiful ideas in my mind but it was impossible. I was hopping that someone had followed me, but as aslways, I'm alone, I'm no one, not important enough, not interesting enough. \n\nI arrived at the train station, I received messages from her, she was asking me why did I left without telling her anything, I told her that I was feeling bad, that it was my fault, that I feel so lonely, abandoned. I knew that its worst than that. Then she told me that she doens't want a bad relationship with me, that I can speak to her but I told her that I don't want to speak through messenger. \n\n\nSince that, I told her that I have a journal in which I write my feelings and that I medidate when I feel bad. She told me that her door is open and that she would like to read it, but i feel like she hates me, that she doesn't want anything to do with me. I feel like she's ignoring me, she doesn't speak to me anymore because I am bland, annoying, boring etc etc. Today, I just want to speak about my SA but the idea of facing her is making me so anxious. \nSo my question is : should I tell her that I want to speak with her ? \n\n(PS : sorry if the story doesn't make any sense, I am not that good in english and Im bad at telling stories)\n",

        "original": "**tl;dr:** My social anxiety keeps me from making new friends or establishing deep connections. I have friends, a girlfriend and a job. My anxiety pretty much puts me on the bottom of the dominance hierarchy. I am usually only capable of being fully truthful in private and when I'm out in the world, my persona kicks in and all the truth that I had in private, creeps into my shadow, never to be seen by eyes other than my own.\n\nHello!\n\n***Background***\n\nMy name is Thomas, and I am 17. I have a job, girlfriend, friends, family and a roof to live under. Ever since 4th grade I've had trouble socially and most presumably a turning point in my anxiety. In the fourth grade, I had made the choice to abandon my close friends for an offer to become friends with the popular kids, which I hastily took. Due to medical issues, (FM system, and fluids leaking out my ears due to death at birth), I was ***very*** self conscience at a very young age. \n\nBeing 17 now, I smoke weed regularly when I'm home; at work, school and other activities I don't tend to, but you gotta have fun sometimes at work, right? I smoke because it lets me focus instead of over-worrying, putting me in a meditative like state becoming hyper-aware of my body, and the scene around me.\n\n***Anxiety***\n\nMy anxiety isn't to the point of depression, but it's playing a big role in my life. I constantly barrage myself with criticisms, like such: (and they typically arise when I'm with friends or in a conversation or a group conversation)\n\n\"Why aren't you talking to him/her?\"\n\n\"They think you weird if you don't talk to them.\"\n\n\"I wish I could be like \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, they talk better and act better. People like them more!\"\n\nMy anxiety pretty much has me held. \n\nI am introverted by nature, but not talking to people and establishing deep connections leaves me feeling secluded and a loner. I don't have many friends, but I have some fun close ones. I am not very good at making friends, mainly because I can't talk in social situations, I FREEZE! (Verbally, anyway.)\n\nI listen to conversations that others have, and it seems to flow so nicely and effortlessly, then when I try to have a conversation or start one, it's like trying to give a presentation on the fundamentals of astrophysics; I can't do that shit. Well at least I think I can't. Keeping conversations with my girlfriend can be stressful too. This lack of true, meaningful connection is killing me slowly.\n\nI don't even know how to make new friends. :(\n\nAdditonally, I have attempted to keep a journal. I can write freely and effortlessly in that journal, just as I did on this post. Does the mean that I am so untruthful in my speech to others that I can't speak? The only time I can truly express myself is in private?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***If anyone out there on earth could help me through this time, I would be grateful beyond the stars.*** \n\n**We may not know each other, we Reddit users, but for some reason people to reach out and offer help to a complete stranger is miraculous.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading,\n\ntommytonga",

I think the \"constantly wondering what is wrong with me\" is social anxiety itself. \n\nFor years now I've been insanely self conscious about my image as soon as I wake up to until I fall asleep. It's eating me alive. I'm always thinking about myself from a 3rd person view. \"How does my hair look? What does my facial expression look like rn? How do I look when I'm walking?\"\n\nThe walking bit seems to be a common symptom just by skimming through this sub. I'm so conscious about walking normally that I walk like an idiot. I end up kind of lunging and I have no balance. I've been told I walk like I've \"shat myself\"\n\nAnother thing. I posted a story on Instagram yesterday. For the 24 hours, I was looking at it at every option I had to see who had seen it. I was making insane assumptions on what people thought of me by shit like the time of day in which they viewed my story  (Instagram prioritizes stories based on who's profile you look at the most) and whether or not they looked at the 2nd story that I posted or just swiped past. Just making crazy reasoning in my head as to what someone thinks of me purely from a little counter telling me how many and who viewed my story. Nobody said anything to me about my stories but for some reason I've already made these really unrealistic assumptions about what they think of me all in my head. \n\nThis goes for real life too. I have this constant  voice in my head thinking that everyone thinks I'm an idiot or whatever else that's negative despite no one saying anything to prove that. \n\nI think it stems from being bullied in primary school and to an extent at high school as well. Constantly getting words thrown at me seems to have stuck inside my head even after I stopped getting bullied.\n\nMy dad also left me at a young age and never told me why so I think that from the age of a kid I was judging and blaming myself for things because I had no answer as to why he left so I blamed myself",

Honestly she showed some interest (maybe she was just being nice), and so I decided maybe I could approach her. Few months ago, last November, I met with her at a bus stop, and we happened to be going in the same direction, we talked a lot in the sense of getting to know each other, and I asked her number before she got down at her destination.\nShe seemed to be more friendly from then on but I noticed, it was just that and nothing more. I slowly decided to gradually reducing contact with her, coz that is not what I wanted.\nLast week she happened to catch me by the staff canteen (which I think was intentional). I was done with my shift and heading home when she found me passing by the canteen. This time she talked a lot like we were old pals, and she even began telling me of some trouble in her department, even tearing up a bit.\nHonestly I saw this as a development, but I said bye after talking enough and I left.\nI thought about sending an SMS or sending her a msg on fb for the first couple of days, but I didn't. But the old feeling of crushing on her again began growing.\nYesterday something good happened in her department, I saw this as an opening for me to begin contact on phone. And so I messaged her a casual message about the event yesterday around noon time.\nShe hasn't even read the message I sent even though she has come online a couple of times including today and right now, which is killing me.\nI'm thinking I shouldn't have messaged her in the first place, and honestly I don't even want to see her on my messenger list anymore cause it is unsettling my mind. I really would not want to cross paths with her again and wish I turn invisible if she does. Honestly I feel embarrassed and hurt.\n\nWhat I understood: 1) she has no actual interest in me\nWhat I'm not sure about: 1) does she know I am/was interested .. how should I proceed from now, if I see her or cross paths (honestly I want to ask why she didn't respond, which is a shameful question to ask, so I wouldnt ask)\n2) should I intentionally ignore her when she sees me at workplace in the future? \n3) Am I making any sense??.. have I done something wrong? Is my thinking about this situation and what I'm inferring all wrong?\n\nI hate that I asked her number. I hate that I messaged her yesterday. This is affecting my work as I am visibly sad that this happened.\n\nTl;Dr : a girl I'm crushing on at the workplace is troubling my mind. I reduced my contact with her. When she restarted contact, i began pursuing with zero response right at the bud.

So I am dependent on my parents about anything. I use their car, I live in their home, I pay no bills, I eat their food etc. I have spent my fucking last ten years of my life doing almost nothing except of getting a Master degree in Contemporary History, with many absences and a lot of excuses to my proffesors due to my bad mental health. \n\nAs you have may assume already I suffer from social anxiety, depression , depersonalization  and who knows what other mental condition. \n\nThe last year I have experienced an AWFUL break up after 12 yrs long relationship that cause me more anxiety, suicidal thoughts and EXTREME isolation. I literally Lost my self identity. Who the fuck am I? What I am doing with my life? How the hell I will stand in my own feet? These are some of the most crucial question that I had to answer even now.  \n\nSo in the last year I understand that I am alone in the life. I was living for too long in a dream. A dream that someone or something will come and save me. That I will find a job, then marry that woman etc.\n\nA year now I struggle to make some positive changes. I have a new girlfriend, I still have my old friends, I have my parents, I am going to the gym, I have started to love myself day by day, eating better, stop drinkin alcohol etc. But guess what, I am still stuck in my head.\n\nAfter all these years of being almost isolated in my room I have a HUGE problem to become a piece of community again. I feel like a stranger, or better like an alien. I feel almost dead inside, pathetic and looser.\n\nI dont know how to act and what to say in front of people, I lack social skills, I lack a strong identity of my self, everyday I am waking up just to do nothing but goind to the gym, drink a coffee with some friends, talk with my new gf in phone, and sitting alone in my room. The world seems like a movie, my face seems unfamiliar etc.\n\nPeople say to me that I am great, kind, intelligent person, but deep inside me I know they are wrong. I feel like a shit.\n\nPerhaps  one of the greatest solution is to find a job. But guess what: I am terrified even to send some CVs, or visualise myself in work. Somehow, I have found a way to cope with the anxiety that going to gym or going out with my friends cause. But even the thought of working make me feel paralysed.\n\nAlso, one of my proffesor suggest me to do a phd with him. It is a big opportunity for me, but I am terrified again, so I dont want even to give a try. \n\nI feel sick amd tired of my life. I cant stand anymore this life. Just to be here and wait for something magical to happen. What can I do? Is anybody of you guys have the same problem? Are you afraid to work? Did you had this problem and now you succed?then how? Do any of you have come to a point that your mind is in total denial to do a specific thing? What the hell is going wrong with me??\n\nI hope for some good replies guys.

I used to be relatively normal and social up until I was about 11 or 12, and then my dad went into a downward spiral with drugs and basically depended emotionally on me and my brother. Also he had borderline personality disorder. First he was binge drinking for awhile, where he would suddenly start indulging in liquor for like a week, and then finally sober up for the next week or two before he relapsed. After about a year, he injured his arm while CHASING me while he was drunk. He was overweight so when he fell he completely landed on and twisted his arm.  It was a really bad break, and he was put in some sort of metal cast structure that had metal rods penetrating through his elbow. This lead to him abusing the opiates he was given. Basically I was a mess this whole time, I couldn't focus in school because I had borderline schizophrenic thoughts and beliefs of people laughing and talking about how I looked in the middle of class, so I would put my head down in my hands and just shut down my brain the whole period. Computer games became an escape during this time. I basically had nobody to talk except for a couple of other outcasts, and I couldn't even maintain a stable personality and relationship with them either because I felt just completely depersonalized and like an impostor. After several years of this I moved into my moms house because my dad could no longer support us financially. I have still been a mess since, I work a minimum wage job and I can't even talk to my boss. I can't even think in front of people, it's like my brain turns off. My dad passed away 6 months ago, I had found him in his apartment on the floor, completely cold and lifeless, after I went over there to check on him after he didn't respond to texts. So all of this trauma has me in this persisting state of depression and negativity. I do have my mania highs though occasionally, which typically happen only when I'm alone and in my little mental fantasy world. I feel seriously mentally disturbed and can't make connections with anybody. I am seen as a weirdo, a freak, a pariah, by my coworkers. I couldn't even build up the courage to ask my boss for more work hours the past 3 days I've worked even though I'm in debt and can't pay off my braces. Am I at a dead end? I feel like I have a very dependent personality and can't survive in the world by myself. I have no motivation to keep going. I don't like the way I look, I have embarrassed myself in front of all my old friends and have done awkward things, and I feel like if I'm not handsome, and if I'm not socially competent, there's no purpose for me to live.

I have a few friends who I see here and there-or speak to over the phone- but I cannot seem to penetrate a space for a meaningful conversation with my colleagues, which makes me feel lonely in a city that is isolating in itself. Work friends a requisite to a rich social life in a very atomized society.\n\nIn my previous workplace, I was able to connect well with a few very interesting people, given that the though my team was larger, the overall capacity of the office was much smaller. Here, as the place is so large, people tend to stick to small cliques that are permeated by a shared nationality, religion etc.\n\nI work in a foreign team that focuses on the country my parents are from.

        "original": "Posting on my throwaway because I can't sleep and my suicidal ideation is waking back up again. \n\nI have nothing right now. I'm in the process of letting go of my last couple of friends. I have nothing to say to them. I'm not interested in anything. I don't want to go anywhere. I have nothing to say to anyone, at all. Every time I've tried pushing through and going somewhere and being around people just feels so...pointless. I've had jobs before where once I get comfortable, or as comfortable as I ever will in a situation like that, I can carry on a conversation just fine, but I hear the shit I say and I don't know why I bother talking. \n\nAnd a lot of the time I'm so anxious that nothing comes out right, people think in stupid. I've known my best friend nine years and I still can't talk right in front of him -- except once, a couple weeks ago, I had a rare self-possessed moment and gave him like a therapy talk and he looked at me like I was a centaur with nine dicks and said \"Did you get smarter? I feel like all of a sudden you're finally on my level. Good job !\" I've been here this whole time, and I keep trying to talk to him but it's like he never hears me. My best fucking friend thinks I'm stupid. It's only part of why I'm getting rid of him. I'm fine with not being as intelligent as I'd like to be, but he thinks I'm even dumber than I actually am and I can't stand it. I've been screaming into a vacuum for nine years, and for what? I know beggars can't be choosers but I finally think I'd rather be alone.\n\nI haven't worked in a couple years because of health and mobility issues, and I need a job and hate not being able to work. But the thought of having a job where I have to go somewhere and deal with other people makes me literally want to shoot myself. I have no education and no skills, though, so working from home isn't really an option. I'm out of money and I have no idea what I'm gonna do.\n\nI find myself doing this bizarre, obnoxious gatekeeping shit, too. I'll see someone talking about their social anxiety and I'm like, that's great. Can't help noticing you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, though. You have this crippling social anxiety and you think you're nobody and yet...here you are. Well, somebody saw you. Somebody agreed that you get to participate in that aspect of human existence. I've been invisible my entire life. What the fuck are you even complaining about. You think you hate yourself? Nah, trust me, you don't. \n\nThis is obviously weirding me out because that's incel talk. It's fucking gross. It's competitively toxic and one-dimensional and self-indulgent and self-pitying. If I want to be seen so badly I should try being somebody, right. I know.\n\nBut I look at couples and I wonder...what do they talk about? Do they actually like talking to one another or do they just do this to fill the time between fucks? How many people find themselves completely fascinated by a new partner's thoughts and quirks in the honeymoon phase, only to later find out they were in the throes of limerence and the person is actually suffocatingly ordinary?\n \nHow is it that some people walk around blatantly mistreating people so, so casually -- coworkers, retail workers, whoever -- and still get to go home and be held by somebody at the end of the day? Like, how the fuck did they find someone to love them? How the fuck does this system even work? \n\nAnd that's my problem, really. I don't understand it because I fundamentally don't know what it's like to be somebody. I feel like I don't have a soul, and everyone can see it.\n\nI wasn't always this self-pitying, either. I used to be much less toxic, less judgmental. This is all just something that's gradually dawned on me over the last several decades of trying and failing to be a person. \n\nI feel like I'm going crazy trying to make sense of it. The pinnacle of human existence is supposed to be the ability to connect to one another. I try to imagine it in my head and it feels like all the air gets sucked out of the room and I just feel so disgusted with myself. It's a joke I tell myself to pass the time more easily. I really just need to scri ble myself out and start over but I can't and now I just want to put a gun in my mouth and spray myself all over the fucking g walls and stop being the sad awkward little girl who never had any fucking friends and never knew what she did wrong.",

And the only anomaly in my life at the time was that I got into a wonderful relationship with someone I had known since childhood and that was wonderful.   \nAnyway all good things must come to an end and that relationship went to shit and in the shitter...  \nI haven't been out on a date or even close to being intimate with a woman in 2 years which is kinda strange because I'm a good looking dude I'm 6'1 187pounds.. I workout.. take good care of myself and come from a well off family so everything seems to be going good for me...so it is kinda strange that I don't meet or am make the effort to meet women.... its weird....also is now a good time to mention that I have a problem with pornopraphy and have had it most my life (I'm 26), and if you are of the RARE breed that thinks porn can be a real problem, mine is probably as bad as it can be just based on how much I crave, the type of porn I watch and how I use it to escape.  \nI been working on it and am currently at 2 weeks without consuming any.   \nThe reason why I suddenly got the motivation to completely stop porn and sorta get my act together was because this girl I had gone to uni with couple of years ago..  We never really spoke much in university but offered each other help on random essays and such since we shared a lot of classes. Point being that we're not totally strangers but never talked much in person. I thought she was super attractive and nice but she was in a relationship and so was I so no point in pursing that thought at the time.  \nFast forward to to last week I find out through social media she's single now and I was tipsy at the time so I sent her a message and we get to talking and eventually I said to myself she's worth it ... fuck it ...and I asked if I could take her out for dinner sometime and  she somehow agreed. This is something that i should do, its healthy and its necessary ... its fucking normal ffs but my heart starts racing every time I think about the date and picking her up, is the car ride gonna be awkward? How should I greet her? Handshake? Kiss? How fast can we get to this restaurant so I can have a drink to relax and calm my nerves. These are sorta the reality of what's going on in my head right now I know its pathetic but it's my reality. The fact that she agreed is super exciting and definitely a confidence booster but what I'm feeling right now is crippling enough for me to this blow off this opportunity and regret it forever.    \n\n\nThis is social anxiety right? This is a random example but I feel very uncomfortable at social gatherings especially if I feel there will be a big crowd and there's no bottle of vodka around for me to chug down.  I know I do WAYYY better in one on one interactions but even then the anxiety is still there.....\n\nI know I went on a rant and this is might be more appropriate in another subreddit like nofap or whatever but I don't want the entire comment section to be about superpowers....    \n\n\nSo I'm all ears, I'd love to hear more from you guys, maybe about your past experiences or words of advice.. anything really.   \ndamn this post literally took me an hour and ten minutes to write.",

A kid that always said yes and never complained about anything. He was an \"easy\" \"good\" child. His parents never find his shyness (or awkwardness) as a problem. instead they encourage him to be like this, maybe because of neglect, maybe because they find it better to have a quite child instead of a yawper. \n\nAs Tomas grew up, he went to the school where he finds himself uneasy to express his thoughts, to be competitive, to make friends. Even if Tomad was an intelligent kid, maybe the most intelligent of his class, he always choose to go unnoticed. Deep inside he wanted so much to express his knowledge. Instead he remained quite while other less intelligent students than him, but more extroverted, gain praise from their teachers. \n\nMany years ears after, Tomas went to the high school, then to the college, but nothing have changed. He was still the low profile guy. After so many definitions from the others as the quite guy, finally Tomas accept this role. He become so attached to his role that he completely lost his identity. Others opinion became his guide of Life instead of following his own will. Tomas became a ghost, a looser, a pathetic guy. Tomas lived the life of the others. \n\nOne day, Tomas took a look in the mirror. His face was really old and his hair almost white. Tomas knew that he spent his entire life in the fear of what the others think about him. Unfortunately for him, it was too late. He has ruined his life while the others have succeeded in life. Tomas has rejected so many chances that life gave him. That girl that stare on him in the library, that great job in the other side of the world, those invitations from his colleagues for a lunch and so on. \n\nTomas cried like a small kid, but unfortunately it was too late. Tomas left his life in the hands of the others. Tomas was now alone and poor.\n\nYou may wonder who is Tomas. Tomas is me, Tomas is you, Tomas is all of us! BUT unlike as Tomas, we are much younger than him, so we have the time to change our lives.  Dont let the others opinions ruin your life! You are more than Tomas guys. I believe in you. \n\nWhat the hell we are afraid of? Fuck their opinions! Stand up for yourselves! Dont let others traumatized or make fun of you. Dont let them defines who you are. All of you are amazing people. I know it deep inside of me because I know myself. We are kind souls in search of real love and good people. We afraid this fucking world because we find it dangerous or  tough. BUT it is not! Most people in this world are good people that respect you as you are. It is just that we have learn to focus to the jerks' reactions. Now or never guys. Dont become Tomas, please.\n\nApologise for my english!",

        "original": "Hey, my name is B, I am 21 years old and I have social anxiety. It's ruining my life and I need help.\n\nAlmost every social situation gets me nervous. I can't sit in a bus, study in class, workout in the gym, work at my job, get groceries, order a pizza or even visiting my friends or a party wihout getting anxious. Just every situation where there are people triggers my anxiety.\n\nTo examplify, going to school by bus is a daily drama I experience. I cycle to the busstop. When I see people standing and waiting for the bus, my anxiety immediately increases. I know I will have to stand next to them and either talk or be quiet. Now, both trigger my anxiety. I know talking won't help me, because I'm very shy and my voice will sound weak, silenced and have stutters in it. I can't relax while people look at me, which is mostly the case when communicating, as I think they will notice my nervousness which would make them feel uncomfortable. Being quiet isn't a good choice either, as it makes me very awkward and self aware. That means that I don't know where to look at, I constantly change my body stance and begin to get nervous, dizzy and sweat a lot when others notice. This all happens in 5 minutes of waiting.\n\nThen, finally the bus comes. Somehow I am relieved that the current situation is over, but then I have to sit next to someone which makes me anxious again. An example of what happens is that I notice my breath and the others breath and my mind suddenly start to breathe in the same tempo and at the same time as the other. This is very awkward when it happens. Also just sitting alone, but with other people in the bus triggers my anxiety. I am constantly feeling like I am being watched which makes me uncomfortable. I can't move anymore, look anywhere and totally freeze.\n\nTo explain the anxiety further, when it is triggered, I start being very alert of my surroundings, I become self consious of my movements, I begin sweating, shaking and just overal can't function or communicate properly. I get uncomfortable when people look at me and sometimes I don't know when to look back at them. I don't understand why this is. Im not ugly and most people I know say that Im actually good looking.\n\nIt's just, I don't have a lot of real close friends, but more like a group of 20 friends who drink and do drugs in weekend together. I really like all of them and I can talk and relate to them as well, but I have no deep emotional connection with them. In other words, I have no real best friends. \n\nAlso, most importantly perhaps, I just broke up with my girlfriend after 3 years. She was the best friend I have ever had, but I screwed up with her. I cheated several times and didn't tell her and lie. Eventually, she found out about one time and trust broke us. Eventually, I confessed the others as well. Although I loved her, during our relationship I discovered something else about myself. I think I'm gay, or at least bi. I started dreaming about guys during my relationship and had feelings/attractions for some men. I guess have to find out if I really am in the next months.\n\nNow, I assume that the possibility of being gay and in the closet and the lack of sexual/physical contact with gay men is greatly responsible for my being extremely anxious in social situations. Could that be the case?\n\nIm just so uncertain about who I am, what I want to do in my life and who Im actually attracted to. I really hope that things change in the future, which means I can relax, be calm and smile in every social situation, make new friends and find a partner in life. \n\nFor now, having a laugh with someone I know eases my anxiety or consume a lot of alcohol during social situations. Unfortunately, I am not in a state of doing one of these all the time. Therefore, I have to find a way to become relaxed by myself in every social situation.\n\nThanks for reading my story so far. I'm in very desperate need of help and would love to hear all your advices and/or experiences.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. B\n\n",

I've constantly been in and out of social groups ever few years it seems like. I was apart of the \"popular group\" for a good part of elementary school and middle school, but then by the time 8th grade rolled around I noticed them beginning to just treat me poorly so I took it upon myself to leave the group and then for the remainder of middle school I would literally sit at an empty lunch table eating by myself (really healthy for the mental am I right).

I\u2019ve applied at several jobs & even scheduled interviews for some, but always ended up being too anxious and never show up\n\nBut tomorrow morning I have an interview at a dog boarding facility! The job will pretty much be me taking care of the dogs & playing with them. Not too much interaction with humans besides co-workers which to me is a great thing. Even thought I\u2019m feeling nervous I know I have to show up because a job this good doesn\u2019t come along often. I can\u2019t pass it up. \n\nI\u2019m mainly feeling nervous about coming off as too awkward or if I say the wrong thing or smothering. I keep overthinking about little things like what do I say when I walk in? \n\nOverall I know this will be a good thing for me because I\u2019m 19 & I\u2019m going to have to get a job at some point.

Everytime I see a girl I find attractive and can see myself with I turn into a mute and shake profusely especially when they are really close to me like face-to-face or if they decide to take the seat right next to me. My social anxiety/shyness has held me back from doing so much because of this I have so many regrets. I can still remember during my sophomore year of high school their was this girl I really liked and wanted to be with I found out from someone people I knew that she liked me to and I know what you're thinking \"what was the problem then?\" \"if you liked her and she liked you it should of been easy right?\" well the thing is I was the shy one not her she was outgoing and had friends and was also on the volleyball team at my high school.\n\nEverytime we got face-to-face I would become a mute no words would come out at all my brain knew what I wanted to say but my mouth just wouldn't produce sound and this went on for a few weeks until she just became uninterested and moved on. \n\nWe would see each other during passing periods going to are respective classes and would lock eyes and I would die inside knowing that I couldn't tell her how I felt no matter how hard I tried and she would give me that look like I wish you would just come over and talk to me and it didn't help that we had the same gym period but not the same gym class because she was a freshman and I was a sophomore at the time so we would see each other from time to time when all the gym classes would have gym together or was downstairs by the lockers were we put are stuff at and changed into are gym clothes. I hate being this shy shell of a man and would like to get out of this situation... anyone have any tips and advice on how to become less socially awkward when it comes to talking to the opposite sex? I want to one day get married and have kids but how is that going to ever happen when I can even get the words hi out my mouth.\n\nI know my rant was all over the place but I hope you got the gist of my situation.",

I understand I'm young bad have plenty of time, but that doesn't stop me from being worried about my future.\n\nI'd like to start by mentioning, I used to be so much worse. I have been to therapy, taken medication, and developed methods at feeling better. My anxiety used to be so bad that I would nearly hyperventilate just shopping and once threw trying to talk to a girl. I can manage a lot better now. I keep myself composed in public and can speak simple sentences to strangers, which may seem like nothing, but I can tell I've made a lot of progress.\n\nBut dating just seems way out of my wheelhouse. Honestly, since I am so socially anxious, I would absolutely love to have someone I care so deeply about in my life that could help me through things and that I could try my best make feel better too, but I don't even understand how that's possible?\n\nWhenever I go out, I try my best to meet new people. Occasionally, I'll see a girl I find attractive or that seems kind, but I don't know how I'm suppose to approach them? I physically and emotionally can't do it, no matter how much I'd like to. Plus, I'm definitely not the type of guy a girl would be interested in. I've never had a girl say they like something about me or had a girl approach me romantically, so I don't think that's an option. I wouldn't say I have a bad personality other than my anxiety. I always try my best to be kind, attention, caring, and such, but that hasn't seemed to get me anywhere. I'm clean and spend plenty of self care time on my skin, nails, and hair so my assumption is I'm just not pleasant to look at, which I understand.\n\nMy point is, I don't expect women to want to approach me first, but if my anxiety is so bad, does anyone know how I can approach dating? I don't want to be hidden away in my shell, so if anyone has any ideas, please share!\n\n(Sorry if this comes off as whiny. That's not my intention.

        "original": "I've been working in therapy on my anxiety for about a year now. It's been a year of increasingly stressful situations where I've had to work outside of my comfort zone, but I managed to pull through with the help of my therapist, medication, and friends. Now it's all culminated in a cross-country move from the East Coast to Portland, OR. We leave in a month and honestly I'm not sure I can do it. All the phone calls and strangers I have to talk to to get through this... it's terrifying. I've been missing work, sleep, meals.. I lay awake thinking about it, can't focus on anything productive. Instead, I feel absolutely paralyzed. My husband is already in Portland, and he's as supportive as he can be, but with the time difference and his work hours, he can't really do much to help. I have friends who want to help me with packing and getting ready, but I'm so scared of having them in my house or asking them to help me with such tiny, basic things like phone calls. It's embarrassing. I feel like a child. \n\nI'm renting an SUV to drive my four cats and two small dogs. I've rented cars before and the whole process is unendingly stressful for me. I'm a complete doormat when talking to a salesperson of any kind, just nodding and accepting anything they throw at me to make the transaction over with as soon as possible. Meaning I've gotten hosed renting before, paying way more than I want to for services I don't need and feeling ashamed afterward. I managed to set up the car reservation online, at least, so that's done. I'm flying my best friend here to accompany me on the drive, thank god, and hopefully that will make things easier. If it were me alone, I just know I would end up sleeping on the side of the road in the car to avoid calling a hotel or going inside to the front desk for a reservation. I'm already freaking out because not all hotels are pet friendly, and even those chains that are usually have a 2-pet limit per room. From what I've read online, places will waive that if you call ahead of time and explain, but that is, obviously, a nightmare for me. \n\nBefore we leave I have to update my pets' vaccinations and get certificates of health from the vet, since we'll be staying overnight in hotels along the way. This is my biggest hurdle. I love my animals and I honestly, really do know and understand how important regular veterinary care and vaccinations are, but the past few years I just haven't been able to go through with regular vet appointments. I've made them and cancelled. Then once vaccination updates were overdue, I felt too ashamed to go in and more and more terrified of being berated and fussed at by a vet for letting these important things lapse. Now everyone is behind on vaccinations and I have to get it all done at once, which will be expensive but more importantly, absolutely terrifying. I've decided to work with a mobile vet who can come to my house to see everyone, hoping that this will make my cats less demonic (they're absolutely vicious at the vet, another anxiety point). I've sent an email and communicated a bit, even going as far as to mention my anxiety issues as an excuse for why I've been such a bad pet parent, and the person said we could set something up over the phone and asked when the last time my pets had been to the vet was. That was three days ago. I've been freaking out over the phone call since then as the most immediate source of anxiety. I don't know how I'm going to get through the call, let alone having a stranger in my house. I'm tearing up just at the thought. \n\nHonestly, that's just the tip of the iceberg. I really thought I was getting better at handling my anxiety, even pushing myself over the last year by doing things like taking a night class with heavy group discussion, going to the doctor and optometrist, and getting my hair cut. Now I have so much to do, and I don't know if I can handle it. I'm so scared. \n\nI feel like I'm unraveling and no one understands. When I try to explain my fear, I just get hit with questions about what's so scary, and no one understands. ",

I do have social anxiety because I never got the chance to socialize and try new things when people typically do from high school age to early 20s. I feel like I\u2019m behind because I never lived that drinking, clubbing, going to festival life that most young people go through. I have time constraints from being a single mom and my daughter also has separation anxiety so it\u2019s been hard to go out and meet people. Ever since I\u2019ve had her, my social life only consisted of a 1.5 year relationship and a few casual relationships that lasted a few months. I\u2019ve never had a time where I went out for fun or had a friend group and it\u2019s been eating me up inside for the longest time.\n\nShe\u2019s older now and understands a bit more why I need my own time. It\u2019s still a struggle but I managed to go out last night to a meetup mixer event at a downtown bar with about 40 attending.\n\nMy anxiety kicked in when I got to the event parking structure. I was on time but I stayed in my car not wanting to get out in fear that I was too early. When I did get into the venue, there were about 5 people already there. I talked to two of them in depth. It was great. One was a girl who was new to the area and seemed like she needed a mall and club buddy. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m looking for. For the rest of the night, an endless stream of people kept on coming up to me to talk. I had so much fun getting to know them, cracking jokes, and just talking about life. I wish I got out of my seat and walked around to get to know even more people but my anxiety kept me in my seat. Luckily, people came up to me and we all had a good time talking.\n\nI think it went well for my first night out in years and I exchanged my contact with a few people. I know it was only one night but it really raised my confidence. I didn\u2019t want the night to end. The organizer of the meetup actually planned an after party at a nearby club and I was dying to go but it was already 12 am and I had promised my daughter I would be home by then. Plus I didn\u2019t really dress up for the club so I gave them a rain check. \n\nI\u2019m really excited for the next one.

I've had sometimes when girls for almost throwing themselves at me, but I would say something so stupid that would ruin my chances completely. And it wasn't like I said the first thing that came to my mind, I would think for a few seconds because I thought if I flirted or showed interest in this girl overtly then what would people think? So I would try to play it cool, and it was usually a very casual, bland attitude that got me nowhere.\n\nAnd I feel like that's been the story of my life really. Interact with people, but because I have this filter brought on by social anxiety and shyness and lack of confidence, I would sometimes be very quiet and try to say things that are ok.\n\nUnless I would get drunk. That's when the anxiety would go away, where the shy guy would be shy no more and the filter would be thrown away in the garbage somewhere. All of my friends told me they love me when I'm drunk. I'm fun, sarcastic, smart and more.\n\nAnd this social anxiety I've heard it be called the illness of missed opportunities and I think that's what it's done to my life. I've missed so many opportunities I can't even count. And since I'm edging closer and closer to the end of the decade of my life in which I should make the most of, I really want to start making a change.\n\nHowever, I can't move past that fear and anxiety of being more open.

It's kind of a nightmare right?\n\n  It's so exhausting having to be THAT social all day. It's the most laid-back work environment possible. The part owner and manager as well as every employee range from best friends to at least having gone to the same high school. I grew up a few towns over so i never really have any reference to who they are talking about and all of that. I'm the oldest person there besides the main cook who is like 34 and kind of a man child. So basically i'm doing a job that's already stressful enough fro me, but now with 18-22 yr old bullshit. It's honestly a different generation now. It sucks, all they want to talk about is girls on tinder/instagram, while i've never used the former and recently deleted the latter in attempts to reduce my anxiety. I rarely go out, and haven't as much as touched a woman romantically in over 3 years probably. What the fuck do i have to say?\n\n  So i end up having no confidence, and not going back at people, even jokingly. I'm pretty funny among a good handful of my friends who i've been through alot with and we have each others back. I'm ten times more quick witted even in general, than i appear with my Co-workers. It's a fuck around environment, but I am always so tense. I don't know what the fuck i'm scared of. What are they gonna say i'm weird? kinda ugly? Don't even talk to girls? I know all this already. And to be frank, I'm not exactly scared of confrontation when i am being attacked to a certain level. I'm not the most physically imposing person, 5'11 190. Played Football and wrestled a couple years in high school. I can hold my own, and i'm not afraid to get hit. Sorry if the last bit seems unnecessary, but it just adds to my own criticism of myself..What the fuck am i so afraid of?\n\n I go to therapy weekly as well as working with a job counselor in attempts to land any type of office job That could at least give me relevant experience and rent a room. Although my job sucks, i get 7/hr cash and average like 5/hr in tips. I'm also in the middle of trying to find a place like immediately. I've been staying with my Grandmother, but she  has a ton of issues herself and more or less it's borderline personality type of stuff, so despite me giving her rent and being respectful and grateful, and everything i'm doing to try to become stable and independent, she just wants me out.\n\n This Turned into an actual essay.

Now I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m just being judgy or whether I\u2019m \u201cguessing them\u201d, but I am not happy with how I act. \nBut I just can\u2019t break the mold\n\nFor example, during a musical I met another guy my age. I was very enthusiastic for about three minutes and quickly dialed down. However, as I spent time alone with him, I talked more and cracked jokes. After about an hour I was confident. However, when we joined another group of about 10, I immediately switched off. No jokes were funny. I didn\u2019t really speak unless I really really could or was spoken too. I would pretend to do shit on my phone when really I\u2019m not super intrested in the phone but intrested in socialising. Once we leave, I\u2019m very quiet. It takes a while to slowly ease back in, but not like before. \n\n(When I talk to new people or personally to a crowd, I trip over my words) \n\nI feel that I need to get better at this too be able too be better at musical theatre, but I just don\u2019t know HOW. it\u2019s like as if I am being tested or something. I know that I am a good person to talk too (listen too me brag) and I really want to show who I truly am too everyone\n\n",

Being in a toxic environment full of bullies in primary school added even more to my introversion, so I've always loathed any kind of group work and public speaking. Anyway, since high school (where I was surrounded with far more decent human beings) I've been trying to change that and I really am much better at making friends. So when time has come for university, I chose English language and literature, and I ended up in the teaching sub-department.\n\nHaving had practice as a teacher this semester, I realized that my social anxiety and public speaking fear were still there, and I've underrated them so badly. Two months ago we all had a task to hold one class in a primary school, and it went terribly for me, I got the least points and probably am gonna fail the whole subject. These two years have been an extremely harsh period of my life in many aspects, including financial problems... so the issue of finishing university and finding a proper job afterwards is a great struggle for me. I live with my (recently widowed) mother who has always put me down for my introversion and social anxiety, even considering me \"abnormal\" - and she puts pressure on me every day, discouraging me from my idea to try freelancing (which according to her isn't even a proper job and is for freaks).\n\nIf anyone has experience with such kind of job (doesn't have to be a teacher), please share it.

I feel sort of like an asshole saying this but I've never had an issue getting a boyfriend or a date with a guy. Relationships with men have always come easy to me, and I'm relatively happy with how I look. I'm an artist and I sell paintings frequently  (locally and on social media--I have a big following). I have played piano my entire life, I've worked as a graphic designer for a huge brand, and all over I think I present myself as a pretty happy, welcoming person to others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut deep down I'm miserable that I don't have many female friends. I have one female best friend who is awesome, who I have known for years. We hike together, chill out and make crafts, get tea, explore outside, etc. It's a very genuine friendship and I love that. I also find it very easy to befriend coworkers in any workplace, and I usually end up becoming pretty tight with the females in those environments. But what kills me is that other than these circumstances, I feel like most of my other interactions with females SUCK. I feel like girls judge me the second they interact with me. I feel like their tone of voice becomes snotty and judgmental, fake and just straight up weird. And you could be thinking \"well maybe you present yourself as standoffish\" but truly I always make a point to be welcoming and friendly to other girls because I know exactly how shitty it feels to feel bullied and isolated. I just feel like they hate me before they even get to know me. This is random but lately I stopped wearing makeup (I only ever wear a little eye makeup anyway) as an experiment to see if girls would treat me nicer. Oddly enough it seems like it works. It's bizarre but I've had way more warmer interactions since I've just been going out everywhere barefaced. There are still some females who are totally standoffish to me either way, but for the most part it seems like interactions have been smoother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExample of my experiences: I have a male friend who dated a girl last year, and this girl befriended me. I'll call her Bell. While dating my friend, Bell wanted to become friends with me from the beginning, but I always felt a the vibe that she didn't genuinely like me. I went to her house one time to play music with her boyfriend and our circle of friends, and the second I started playing piano she went upstairs for the entire night and wouldn't come back down. My male friend had to go upstairs and console her the entire night. One day Bell's friend mysteriously blocked me on social media for no reason, someone I've never spoken a fucking word to. I asked Bell about it a year later when we got coffee one day, and she said \"oh she just doesn't like you because you're friends with my ex.\" This is just one example of petty shit I've experienced. Why would someone dislike me to the extent of blocking me online, when I've done absolutely nothing to them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sucks because I dearly love a deep female friendship and for this reason I feel a huge void inside me. I miss having awesome girlfriends that I can trust and feel totally comfortable around. I've had a few female friends growing up but they always made fun of me in certain ways. One convinced me to lose weight (I was never overweight but she was extremely skinny). One would bully me about playing piano. One would make fun of my artwork. So nowadays as an adult I just keep to myself, keep to the genuine people in my life which are only a handful of friends. It just feels like so many girls these days are more interested in competing against each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould love to hear your experiences and thoughts on this. ",

        "original": "I \\[20M\\] was always the type to have only a few close friends at the most and was never usually the outgoing type.  I had my moments \"of fame\" so to speak back in high school, but they were scarce.  In fact, there were a number of students in high school that envied my grades and if I received an A, the usual reply was \"XXX got another A and always worries for nothing.\"  So on the outside, you could say my life was actually alright.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCome senior year, I had a friend circle of 3-4 pretty close friends.  Two of them even set me up with a date for the dance.  She and I hit it off very quickly and became best friends.  We dated the remainder of the school year and she was extremely supportive of me as I would deal with ever-increasing houselife problems with my parents (to the point of getting kicked out numerous times - as a straight A student).  Up to this point, I'm sure you'd still argue everything's mostly alright - a healthy friend circle, a girlfriend, good grades, and college acceptances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, let me preface this with I do not really use social media.  So many of the acquaintances and semi-close friends from high school immediately dropped off the face of the earth when we graduated \\[I was valedictorian, so again I'm sure many envied without realizing what was going on on the inside\\].  So now I'm left with two close friends attending the same college as me and relatively similar majors (rooming together) and my girlfriend.  Because my house life had gotten to the extreme points (was living with my girlfriend's family for \\~2 weeks before and during graduation), she invited me to go on a trip for the summer across the country with a family member she hadn't seen in a very long time.  I accepted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to a month in the trip and \\[as I now understand\\], I'd become obsessive of the relationship and borderline controlling because of my questionable mental state back home.  One thing led to another and she dumped me across the country and that was the last time I ever saw her.  I used to think that was a one-off incident, but it was not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to school starting, and for the first couple of months my two best friends from high school and I are getting along quite nicely, but as time passed and \\*both\\* sides made some mistakes, I found myself against them most of the times, which led to me being completely silent for weeks in an attempt to squelch the fires.  That didn't help, and by the time the year ended and new rooms were assigned, they were both so glad to be rid of me they posted on social media (which again I don't use) \"can't wait to get away from XXX\" and \"buttdialing\" me over the summer conveniently in the middle of a conversation of them and a bunch of my former high school friends completely and utterly shittalking my name.  Again, I thought that happened to be another one-off incident and while it took a long time to sink in I more or less got over it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now I'm left with one friend IRL.  He is admittedly a really good friend but I rarely see him and I think that's probably why.  I turned more into social games and had been leading an online community guild for a long time now and thought \"at least I have these guys.\"  Well... I even found a way to kill that.  Many of the people that used to play with me online all the time have now blocked me, ignored me, distanced themselves, and more, because of another mistake I'd made.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I don't have anything left.  I've come to realize the trend and am starting to feel the effects of living a completely silent life.  I don't have time for clubs, and when I do go I usually don't find the meetings that enjoying, and at best I've got some acquaintances from various classes but nobody that actively hangs out \\[talk about homework, basically\\].  While I still do have one good friend, when I'm at school I do not see him and considering he'll be off to school in another part of the country soon enough, that'll about spell the end for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd there's not somebody I can talk to about how I feel, how I feel completely alone and without a chance of recovery.  My parents are fine with me now, but again, that's probably because I'm not there as much anymore \\[moved away for school\\], and I doubt we'll ever reach the point where we can talk about sensitive issues.  There seems to be a direct relationship with how much people despise me vs. how much time I spend with them.  I do not have \\*anybody\\* to talk feelings with.  It's starting to detriment my drive in school, and all-consuming depression is ever so frequent now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI apologize for the long-winded post but I thought it might help for me to get it on paper and ask for help.",

        "original": "Hey guys. So lately I haven't been feeling the best lately. As for why its because I've been feeling a mix of negative emotions. Guilt, regret, anger, sadness and betrayed. Being born with Asperger's Syndrome,  aformof wutism meant thwt I experienced major social awkwardness, anxiety and generally had little to no friends growing up. And there's several reasons but it mainly has to do with some recent events in my life. It's a long story, so if you want you can read it [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/9uhos2/story_i_learned_the_hard_way_that_despite_what/) but the short version is...\n\n\n\nMy old friend from my old town, someone I had at one time loved like a brother and trusted had not only used and manipulated me, but then I find out had molested my sister. To break down the details shortly, I have Asperger's and have never been the best socially. That meant quite a few blunders making friends and attracting girls and the like. Thus I eventually befriended ''Simba'', and was so lonely that at the time I didn't fully comprehend the red flags like the demanding attitude, put downs, using me as a source of free snacks and having me give him my phones to text girls he liked as his Conservative Christian parents were onto him. \n\n\nI even let him come over when my mother wasn't home, even taking the fall for some things he did. I moved to a new town from 2014 and VERY rarely heard from him till a few days ago. You see back during summer after one of me and my sisters arguments she broke down crying and confessing that he had molested her when I was preoccupied during one of his visits. I remember breaking down crying that day, and it really cements the doubts I already had about him. It's been awhile, and pressing charges I'm not sure how to go about as building a case is difficult. \n\n\n\nThis just makes me feel worst about my loneliness throughout my childhood and adolescence, the missed opportunities and not having the high school experience the adults including my parents say as well as telling me these are the best years of my life. That's like saying I'm missing out, which I felt I have and now this. I can't help but wonder what could have been if maybe I wasn't so socially awkward, if I knew how to approach people better, if my parents didn't have issues and so on. [Plus I did NOT have a great home life](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/9e2dty/despite_my_moderate_views_this_pissed_me_off/). I envy my former peers who have nostalgic memories of dates, parties, and crazy adventures like urban exploring and doing mischievous things. My dysfunctional home life made me really just want to wait high school out because I felt I couldn't have friends with all the constant drama. This is especially since there was the time my mom's ex beat his dog so hard we thought he killed her and had to hide outside because we thought he went insane, orwhen my sister was suicidal I had to wrestle a bottle of Windex from her because she was trying to drink it.\n\n\n\n It just feels like much on top of some people are having the college experience and I'm stuck at community college working at Dominos. Everything just doesn't feel to great right now because everyone else can easily move on in life with blissful memories of what was while I'm left to always wonder what could have been...",

The island is deserted with no other people (except for some local fisherman that occasionally visit the island). So I am looking for a fellow social anxiety/introvert like myself who would be interested in joining. I am doing it with a company that specialises in deserted island experiences and the reason I am looking for another person is because its actually cheaper if 2 people go instead of 1. \n\nThis sort of experience has been on my bucket list for a while plus I sortof want to see what its like to live like this as a trial run for doing it longer term. If you are interested PM me to chat more, I believe it would be good to at some point chat over skype just to make sure we gel a bit atleast. Having a fellow introvert to do this with is better than finding some very adventurous person IMO, we could go off and do our own things at points on the island, etc. No pressure to talk or interact too much, just experience the island.\n\nInfo:  \n\n- The tropical island is in Indonesia   \n- You don't need to have survival experience (I don't) but you do need to be of average fitness.    \n- The company has been operating for a while (since 2013) and offering these experiences on this island the whole time. They require that people doing it take enough water, dried food and place a guard on the island with you.    \n- The island has 2 shacks to sleep in, and you get provided with a cooking equipment, fishing equipment, first-aid kit. But you'd need to catch fish, crabs, gather fruit and coconuts to eat or eat the dried food you bring (rice, etc.).   \n- The cost is a bit expensive, 1050 Euros plus the cost of the flight to and from Indonesia. They are quoting me 2100 euros for the package. The package is for 2 people so people usually split the cost between them whereas a single person needs to pay the full cost. Note, the package includes all things except the plane to Indonesia. So it includes round trip local flights between Jakarta and the local town in Indonesia, permission using the island for our activity, round trip land/sea transfer between the local airport and the pier, survival kit (machetes, fishing lines & hooks), a guard option during your stay.   \n- I am planning the trip for sometime in August 2019   \n- I am 32/M, you can be any age or gender.   \n\nI can provide more details about me and the experience in PM.",

I\u2019ve been told a few times that I\u2019m quiet or introverted- like not in a negative or confrontational way, but more in a light hearted or joking way?\n\nI\u2019m really curious to hear your reactions, because I get angry and I think it\u2019s a pretty rude thing to say. I\u2019m really not quiet in smaller groups and close friends, and I\u2019m very confident and successful in my career. I don\u2019t shine in big loud groups and I really don\u2019t know how.

Which is my biggest insecurity! It\u2019s not like it\u2019s strangers saying it to me, it\u2019s usually friends. \n\nWhen I\u2019ve asked people, trusted friends or family their opinion, they always say it\u2019s not really an insult and people likely don\u2019t mean it in the way I take it (that they\u2019re saying I\u2019m awkward or strange). I do tend to be more of a listener in large or loud groups, but I\u2019ve given presentations in front of hundreds of people, maintain a strong professional network, I\u2019m married to a wonderful man, and closer friends would never describe me as quiet.\n\nI can get in my head a lot, and sometimes I drift off in thought in social settings and forget to really engage in the larger conversation, but I do come back and participate. I try really hard - harder than anyone knows! I go to therapy, I work on all of these behavior training things, and I have anxiety medication when I need it.

        "original": "I\u2019m 18 and a freshman in college. I went to a super small high school and even there I struggled to make new friends. I was bullied in elementary school but I was a naive kid then so I didn\u2019t have much affect on me until middle school. In middle school I started to become really self conscious and by Highschool it was on full blast. Didn\u2019t really know I had an anxiety issue until I came to college. The first semester I could hardly go to class because all my classes were during rush hour on the campus. So there were huge crowds of people walking to classes when I had to go. When I managed to work up the courage to go I kept my eyes glued to the ground. When I heard conversations of people who passed by me it seemed like they were all laughing behind my back. Then when I got to class I always picked a seat a good distance from others because I don\u2019t want to bother them. And then there\u2019s group work.... \n\nDuring this time My mother was pressuring to get a job because school is expensive, as well as the cost of living. Especially in California. I got a job only after mumbling my way through the interview. I ended up quitting because I hated it so much. Coworkers were nice but I was deathly afraid of speaking to them. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t show up for work or class because I couldn\u2019t leave my dorm. Naturally this behavior led to poor standing with my managers and academic probation. \n\nLiving in the dorm has been difficult too. The walls are thin, so even in the comfort of my own home I can hear others having fun/partying. My roommate is nice, we actually get along okay, but I wouldn\u2019t consider us friends because the only thing I say to them is \u201chello\u201d when they return and \u201cbye\u201d when they leave. Then there\u2019s the cafeteria. Sometimes I don\u2019t eat because I can\u2019t drag myself out the dorm. I hate asking the employees for things, even if it\u2019s their job to do assist me. I always go to the Self serve buffet and I always eat in my room.\n\nI rarely go out but when I do, I very carefully pick my outfits, I don\u2019t want to be laughed at or stand out. But just being in my own skin I feel like I stand out. I feel like everyone\u2019s watching me.  We have fire drills occasionally and I\u2019m caught off guard every time. I\u2019m literally forced outside.  Then we have to stand out there for 15-20 minutes while the rest of the buildings evacuate, naturally people form into groups with people they know, since I don\u2019t know anyone I pretend to look at my phone. \n\nAcne made everything worse. When I break out it\u2019s really severe, I still have scars from when I was 16. When I force myself to hold conversation I\u2019m convinced that the other person is staring at my skin, it\u2019s a really nasty feeling.  I think the worst part is trying to date. I\u2019ve been obsessed with the same girl for 3 years and I still haven\u2019t told her how I feel. It\u2019s torture. I think about her nonstop everyday and I fantasize about being with her.  I\u2019ve heard from friends that she\u2019s into me and I should just go for it but I just caaaaaaannnnt. I\u2019ve seen people come and go from her life, whenever she\u2019s single she always texts me and asks to hang out, but I flake on her half the time. I\u2019m lucky she\u2019s even giving me a fraction of her time. She\u2019s deserves better than someone like me, I\u2019d only be a drag because of my baggage.I almost told her how I felt once, but I couldn\u2019t get the words out because I was thinking about the likely outcome that she may reject me. \n\nI\u2019ve lost countless hours of sleep due to staying up and worrying about things I said 10+ years ago. Even though it\u2019s in the past I can\u2019t help but cringe at the memories. Sometimes they are recent events that I analyze, things I said yesterday to a cashier or a classmate.  Half the time I stay up until 5 or 6am because I can\u2019t fall asleep.  It\u2019s hell.\n\nThis may sound dramatic but I\u2019m at a point where I just don\u2019t see the point in living if my life is so unenjoyable 24/7. The highlight of my week in when I can stay in all day on Saturdays to play video games and smoke weed. Weed has been a tremendous help at times, but sometimes it triggers panic attacks. The only thing I look forward to is the latest releases of games and movies I like or talking with online friends on discord. Online communities is the only place I get social interaction, thank god for the internet.",

For the past 5, now going on 6 years all I have done is live at home with my parents, work 12-18ish hours per week, and avoid going out as much as possible. I just turned 24 and feel like a failure/loser. I have one friend (bless his heart) who is \"doing\" life by the book. Just got the job his degree prepared him for as a recruiter and will be making at least 80K within 2-3 years. We sometimes hang out and have a few drinks. He never wants to go places though, so even when we chill I am stuck inside another building the entire time.\n\nI failed out of the state college I went to after high school because I couldn't figure out what I want to do in life. I promptly went to a community college after and I failed out there, too. I have gone back a few times and when I force myself to stay I get As in the classes (gen eds), other wise I have all Fs and a few Ds because I didn't complete the classes. If I applied myself I would have around a 3.3-3.5 GPA, I know it. Right now I am at around 1.89 after my last semester thanks to all the times that I dropped out. I retook one class last semester and got an A to help slowly repair my GPA.\n\nI feel so fucking LOST in life. How can I find myself? I am still stuck in my parent's house, in the same city I was born. I am so boring and that makes it hard for me to be social. Some days are too much to handle. The confusion of life + insane boredom + no friends or social contact just make me want to end it. I used to cope by getting high on weed but I quit 315 days ago. I thought that the daily weed use was my main problem but I am still an unmotivated, anxious, piece of shit. I used to smoke every day which fucked up my brain. Just thinking and especially talking is somewhat difficult, especially when combined with anxiety.\n\nMy good days consist of me binging my latest Netflix or Amazon Prime show, and thinking to myself how I will study IT and everything will be ok. Then I get a sigh of relief, but not for long. I hate IT, I just know it pays well. To tell the truth, I fucking hate sitting at a computer all day, but how ironic is it that I do just that. I fuck around on Reddit, and YouTube all day. I have goals of my owning my own E-commerce business for years now. I have taken so much action towards it (created an LLC, own multiple websites, have set up stores, yada yada, but my lack of deep interest in anything and procreation features keeps me from succeeding). It is hard to stay motivated for me since I have to use my computer to work on it. At this point, after putting so much mental energy and money into it (without really \"going for it\") the thought of my Ecom business makes me sick. I used to have huge goals of beating the status quo, and not working in a cubical for 30 years. I was going to make it by 29ish. Nope. Now, I just want to stop being a delivery driver for fucks sake.\n\nI want to go back to college to get my BA so that I don't regret it in the future. I have constant FOMO and \"The grass is always greener on the other side\" feelings whenever I do decide on doing anything (which is rare because I am extremely indecisive. When I decide that I will go back to school I think about my business and how much more potential there is there and no need for (scary) student loans, on the other hand, the idea of not having a degree terrifies me because then in the future I will most likely be fucked. I am not interested in any of the trades. I wanted to become a mechanical engineer but I am not smart enough. I have not even taken calc.\n\nI take prescription drugs too. 1mg/day of Klonopin has literally kept me alive for the past 3 years. I also take Trileptal for my mood (when I started it it helped so much). Now my doc has lowered the Trileptal and put me on 1500mg of Gabapentin/day so I can try to get off the addictive Klonopin. I have tried multiple SSRIs but none have really worked. I am really scared and skeptical of them so the longest I went was around 2 months on Celexa @ 20mg/day. I told myself it helped but it felt like a placebo. I sure as fuck didn't start becoming a better person, all I noticed was I tricked myself into being a little happier and I couldn't get my dick up as a side effect. I've tried other anti-depressants but was too much of a bitch to get past the starting side effects. At this point, I might try one again. I CANT LEAVE MY HOUSE. Even going to try and work on my computer at a coffee shop makes me feel worse than if I was about to give a huge public speech.\n\nPlease help me. I could end my life easily if I prove to myself that I really am fucked. I don't know what to do. I know this post is terribly written, I just needed to put my thoughts down, and might as well see if anyone can help push me in the right direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTD;DR: I am 24 and have sat in my parent's house since high school. I want to kill myself. I need advice.\n\nPS: Gonna post this other places. Advice as to where I could get good/better answers would be great.",

        "title": "My story",
        "original": "Includes social anxiety, body dysmorphia and incel. \n\nEnglish is not my native language, so u can read some weird words.\n\nI will try to \u00b4\u00b4summarize\u00b4\u00b4 this (at the bottom, there is a real summary).\n\nAs a child, when i was around 11, i was really attractive to everyone. I know this because at school, i got all the girls chasing me, and so outside. Obviously, i was too young to \u00b4\u00b4benefit\u00b4\u00b4 on this. At that age, i remember myself as an outgoing kid,  that had friends and did some regular stuff. Later on, something happened. I think that the inflection point was the haircut that i started wearing, the classic mushroom haircut that a lot of kids wear...with the difference that i was a teenager already. From  being a young Adonis, i started to hear the mock of some girls, through the nicknames that they put on me, refered to my haircut. All my friends started having some interactions with girls, while i was just staring, too afraid of rejection. That was the beginning of my fearful existence, and it continued (with ups and downs) until my current age of 25.\n\nSo yeah, right now i feel like i didnt live at all. I never had a girlfriend, i only have 1 friend that i meet every few months, i never had a job and never been to a party. This decade has been a mix of playing World of Warcraft, doing sport (cycling and calisthenics, obv individual sports), and studying some random useless shit that my mother suggested me to. I feel like it doesnt matter what i study, since there is people in almost every single profession. Ive studied hostelry and quitted it cos its too customer-facing. Ive studied sport and physical activity animator...but it was only because i like to practice it, im too insecure for teaching or doing anything in fron of a group. Now i switched to programming...but seems that im too autistic even for the nerd-world, since the teacher already told me that i have to learn to participate more while working in a groupal project...but i just end up excluding myself.\n\n Sport is what saved me through all this time. When im at home, i cant stop thinking about the past and the future, and i listen a lot of depressing music. So i need to take a ride on my bike almost every day. Im prety good at it and its hard to think about random shit when you are under big physical effort.\n\nI consider myself a good interlocutor, but i only can show this in individual conversations. In a group (specially if i dont know the members), im unable to articulate a single word unless someone ask my oponion directly. This is hard for me, because everybody that ever meet me, told me that im a very witty person and i can contribute to the conversation. Im really quick at making word games. Somebody once told me that i should try rap battles. And i would...if i could articulate a fucking word in front of groups of strangers -.-\u00ba. Because of this witty personality, i know that people want me in their groups, and i got invited to random plans and parties many times...but always refused. I just cant stop thinking about little details that throw me back: what if i have to dance, what if they wanna take photos, what if my clothes are not suitable...And so, for me, saturday is just another weekday to play WoW and do some sport...\n\nI once challenged myselft to go to a psychologist. Since the first session was free and it was one to one conversation, i thought i had no excuse. It went pretty well, she got really interested in me, because we talked for an hour and a half (the session had one hour) and she even invited me to come for another free session and to pay whatever amount i could for the next ones. Not to vary, i rejected...\n\nAs to relationships, ive always been on this dating webs, but it has been useless because my profile photos sucks. I hate being photographed, i dont want to recognize myself on the pics(i think im much better in person) .I always have the same 3 pics from a specific angle and blurry. I consider myself pretty good at flirting, but if the profile pic is not attractive, u wont get the chance to start a conversation. And so, i didnt meet a single girl this way.\n\nWell...i actually met one. It was on a social anxiety forum. We exchanged numbers. I could see her picture, but she couldnt see mine, so everything was ok xD. She was really pretty, which surprised me(even more, when i discovered that she had like 1k followers on IG). We chatted for a week straight, it was amazing. One day, she asked me to meet in real life, which is really hard for me, but after those conversations, i thought there was feeling between us, so i accepted.\n\nWe met in a bar. She was really beautiful irl, but not as perfect as in those IG pics, which i liked even more. At first, we were kinda nervous, but the beer made its effect and we talked for hours.It was getting late and she suggested me to pass the night in my house. Im naive, but i think i know what this kind of proposition means...Still it was a terrible idea, cos i live with my mom. Dont know how and why, i ended up accepting. Before arriving to my house, i thorowed up(cos i smoked, and that makes me sick most of the times). Once in my house, my mom woke up...Well, we ended up sleeping on the same bed, but nothing could have happened cos i was too wasted X_X. Surprisingly, she wanted to keep meeting with me, and we met one more time, a few months later.\n\nThe most remarkable about this one, is that we kissed. It was a really quick and cold experience, so i dont even consider it as i ever kissed. The fact that she kissed me (obv it was she who went for it) without passion, meant a lot for me. The next day, i told her to break up, because i was getting feelings, and she told me that she only was looking for friendship. She insisted in meeting again, but i rejected. That was the last time i had something with a girl, two years ago. And this is how i learned that u cant have social anxiety and 1k followers on IG by posting pics of your body. Ive cried a lot after that break up, and now im again on that numb state that everything is bad, but not enough to cry...\n\nHow do i know that i have body dysmorphia.\n\nSimple: because im the supreme textrovert. I feel very secure when it comes to written comunication (more on my native language). I consider myself good at flirting (i know how to tease) and i use to troll a lot (even whole groups of people), specially the people that cry about their situation or blame others. Everything is ok as long as they dont see a picture of me. One really strange thing is that, in videogames, i never been able to speak through a microphone, which is a requirement for doing a lot of fun stuff. So i ended up being a loner even in videogames. Add that to my completism (im obsessed with achieving everything that is achievable in the games (and irl too)).\n\nOverall, i think i have a really great body, specially because i practiced several sports for more than ten years, Im 1.85 height, 70kg with very lean muscles and long legs. My hair is of an amazing quality and my haircut now is an upgraded version of the mushroom style that i think began everything xD. It makes me look younger. I dont like a lot of things about my face, but i think it has some personality. And down there, im slightly over the average.\n\nOn the other hand, lets talk about what i dont like and what keeps me locked in this mental prison. I dont like my short arms, it makes me feel inferior in some sports (i feel like i have to be the best in everything). I actually started thinking that people with short arms are doomed, or something like that :/. I dont like my nose and how it looks when i smile (thats why i never smile in photos) I dont like how my hair looks when its wet, and the fordyce spots on my lips. I got the fordyce spots down there, too. They are harmless small white sebaceous bumps under the skin. Despite being well endowed, i focus more on the spots and the form of my D, which i dont like neither. Ive been watching porn for more than ten years, and it changes yourself physically and mentally. I cant stop comparing myself to the men that appear on the videos. \n\nI know almost everything about my conditions and my \u00b4\u00b4flaws\u00b4\u00b4, because ive been reading shit about them for too long. The conclusion is that there is no magical solution, u just have to accept yourself. I read a lot about spirituality, too. Thats why i know that my goal in this life is to trascend this extreme identification with the body. To kill the ego, to live in the moment...but God, its been more than ten years and i didnt perceive much progress...I even know the techniques (meditation, self love affirmations, etc), but i end up thinking about the bad things. I still have hope, tho, and dont even contemplate suicide, because i would have to learn the lesson on the next life.\n\nJesus, its tooking me the whole weekend to write this...with huge breaks, of course. Im such a perfectionist that i have to think a lot before before writing a line, then rewrite it...and i dont even like the final result.\n\nIf you made it here: congratulations, you really deserve a prize xD!\n\nHere is the summary of this bible.\n\nI feel that i have a lot of amazing attributes, Physically im very fit because ive been practicing differen sports for more than ten years. Ive got a strong personality and witty sense of humor, as people say. Im good at flirting, too.\n\nBut i just can show it. I isolate myself every time, reject invitations to social plans and let go a lot of chaces. I do this because im terrified of other peoples judgements, specially towards my body (in the supreme textrovert). Im very insecure sexually because of the classic fordyce spot issue.\n\nNow the real questions.\n\nDoes anyone identify to this? Did anyone overcome a similar situation or have any advices? Do anyone wanna share his story?\n\nThx 4 reading!",

We used to hangout together during the first month at school (September), we even met on weekends.\n\nTo be honest I\u2019m not the most confident person on earth and my social skills are near absolute zero, I\u2019m also suffering from social anxiety to some level, so needless to say that I was kinda happy to met such a cool and popular guy, we shared a lot of common interests.

Speaking of college, I have a bachelors degree in English (I know) I am currently unemployed and my last two jobs were in non profit academic advisory roles. I was pretty much a loner and hated school throughout life. I was taken to a therapist when i was 12, and they declared I was \"normal.\" I started questioning life in college and realized it was pretty useless and that it was school and work until you die. I drank liquor i would say the normal amount for a college student.\n\nAfter graduating, I took the two advisory jobs which I hated both jobs due to anxiety. I am not a people person in general and I would sweat profusely when talking to students or even in mildy hot temperatures. I sweat 10x more than others even in the winter. I would sweat in a crowded subway or platform or talking to new people. I spoke to a doctor and I was prescribed robinul and told I had hyperhydrosis. The robinul works so that part of my life is solved temporarily. In addition to this, no matter what allergy medicine I take or what dose, I drip water from my nose and eyes. If I go outside especially in the morning, and its sunny or windy, my eyes water. I get acid reflux and heartburn from tomato sauce, coffee and liquor (all things I love).\n\nI also find myself getting extremely angry at the simplest things (people walking slow in the city, etc, to the point where I think about attacking someone in my head.) When I began feeling suicidal at my first job after graduation, I spoke to a therapist again who once again told me I was \"normal\" a \"regular new yorker\". At this point I am at a wits end and speak to another doctor who prescribes me zoloft and other downers. I mix them with alcohol in a excessive amounts to cope with the job I hate. I stop taking the zoloft pretty because they didn't work for me. I was taking to a hospital where people told me i was a handsome man who had things to live for and sat next to a girl with 16 cut marks on her arm and a guy who wanted to start fires with his hands. I did my research before hand and I realized that they would probably give me shock therapy (I don't know how that would help) so I pretended to feel better.\n\nFast forward to today, I am unemployed living off my parent. I work out about three or four times a week, I am about 5'11 195. The only problem is I have little to no appetite daily and I am starting to develop a belly. I eat maybe twice a day (where i force myself to eat),I sweat like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter if I don't take robinul and i work out 4 times a week So this is unexplainable to me\n\nAnyway, I've had ultrasounds, endoscopy, colonscopy and the gastro doctor stated I was in perfect health and the only theory he has is ibs. As you can see, I've had a long series of issues in my body and doctors telling me everything is fine and blah blah etc. So I'm at a wit's end. I also have gynecomastia in both nipples and it's another obstacle that is annoying to deal with. I'm unemployed so I have no insurance to see any more doctors and i just think life is bullshit and I don't want to deal with it.\n\nI have a girlfriend, who helps me want to keep living, although she keeps alluding to marriage in kids which I'm vehemently against. The only people that stop me from slicing my wrist's are her, my mother, aunt, brother and 3 or 4 friends. I spend my days applying for jobs, jerking off and playing 2k in between the gym and my gf.",

I stopped talking to almost everyone I knew there. I\u2019ve been homeschooled ever since.\nFast forward to about March of last year. I get a text from one of the friends I had while I was there. I haven\u2019t talked to her in about seven or eight months, but she\u2019s very angry. Apparently, someone had started a rumor that I was planning on raping and killing her (or something along those lines, I\u2019m not really sure). I try to tell her that I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about, but she isn\u2019t having it. After about an hour of us texting, I finally block her number.\nI usually tell my mother everything, but I couldn\u2019t tell her this, because it would result in me outing myself as a lesbian to her. Anyways, I attend an anime convention close to my hometown every year (it\u2019s at the end of this month this time around). So does the group of students who started this rumor, as well as the girl the rumor involved. Here\u2019s where the anxiety factor comes in.\nA friend who currently attends the school has confirmed that they are still talking about this stupid rumor. It sounds dumb, but I am genuinely worried that they are going to try to do something stupid. I usually have such a fun time at this con, but I am getting anxious just thinking about what they might do if they see me there. What do I do?

Often because of a trigger which makes me spiral into anxious thoughts. Sometimes I think they only put up with me because I don't have other friends and they feel sorry for me, and they just lie to me when they say they like hanging out. Sometimes when it's really bad even as far as they think I'm actually a terrible person (sometimes that they think I'm and arsehole, or they just don't care about me because they think I'm a useless waste of space). I end up looking far to into every word that is said thinking they are secretly taking the piss out of me, when I'm like this I often think I'm the only one that can't tell that they are taking the piss because I have some kind of mental disorder that I don't know about but everyone else does. Sometimes I even think my own family hate spending time with me and don't really like me but are obliged to since I'm family. Then the next day my perception might change again. This goes back and forth to the point where I'm never sure what to believe. I think it plays a large part in my suicidal urges (though I'd never act on it as it would hurt family and you can overcome this eventually)\n\nThankfully I no longer get this, but about a year ago I used to scroll through instagram and think the posts (memes, jokes ect...) were actually insulting jokes about me as my brain would make some connection to my life, this would really freak me out. I thought a panel comedy show called 'mock the week' was actually a play on words for 'mock the weak' and the content show was actually taking the piss out of me and my brain would make connections to what they were saying to me or stuff that's happened my life. In this delusion the reason it wasn't so obvious that they were jokingly insulting me was because (again) I was mentally deficient and the people on the show were so much smarted they were able to make jokes that I would find funny but had a secret meaning underneath that would insult me which I was only just seeing a glimpse of every now and then. Definitely thought I was going insane, was an awful time in my life and I suffered it alone as I was far to afraid/incapable of speaking to someone about it, I didn't want everyone to think I was crazy. This was definitely a severe case and thankfully I am doing a lot better now, I was doing drugs like mdma and smoking a lot of weed in the period before this due to depression, which I think is what amplified it.\n\nDoes anyone else have similar experiences?

I hate doing things in front of people especially something I don\u2019t know how to do like hanging photos. So I printed all my photos out which took 3 hours, I was exhausted by the end because college exhausts me. The teacher said lay my work out and he would send the art assistant to help me put them up. When the art assistant got there he said he would do it for me, I thought great I don\u2019t want to do it, there\u2019s only 45 minutes left and I\u2019m exhausted. So after asking him if he didn\u2019t mind, I just said thanks and left. To be honest I didn\u2019t know what to say I felt like turning down such a nice offer would be rude.\n\nYesterday morning I got to college to see only 9 out of 27 photos were hung up. I couldn\u2019t find the rest so went to lesson. During the lesson I realised I had no money or food. I get really low blood sugar and knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to last 3 more hours at college. I went and took a quick look at the 9 photos and figured that was enough for show, at least some work is there. I then went home. I don\u2019t tend to tell people when I go home because well social anxiety.\n\nToday I still can\u2019t find the photos and pick up the courage to ask my teacher where they are.

It seems like the older I get the worse my anxiety becomes and staying at home actually makes me feel better for most of the time. \n\nBut of course it\u2019s far from normal and all I want is to be accepted also by my family who does not understand me what so ever. Due to my severe isolation i am becoming more and more anxious about ever leaving the house again I\u2019m afraid of people and my worst fear is to be looked at which makes it so much more difficult to enter society. I truly hate myself as a person because of this and I have made myself think that I\u2019m not worth being human. \n\nI\u2019m sorry there is not much point to this post, and I\u2019m sorry for the bad writing English is not my first language. I don\u2019t hope for anyone that they feel like me. ",

He's 17 and doesn't feel like he has any real life friends. He has people he speaks to but he feels like they're all fake and from what he's told me everybody is a big dickhead to him. He told me that he hates his apprenticeship but doesn't want to quit because he doesn't have anything to fall back on (his parents are low income). He struggles with the maths in his physics but he doesn't want to be 'that guy' apparently. He tells me that he has very low motivation to go out and do things he wants to and says that he has nobody to even do anything with. This all seems so strange to me. We met 3 years ago on an online game and last summer he came to the UK and stayed for a week with me and he just seemed like a normal, slightly introverted, guy. I am pretty sure he's very self conscious and doesn't want his peers to think badly of him which might also have ties with social anxiety (I don't know I'm not a therapist). I try to help him as much as possible by telling him to be a bit selfish and do things for himself, I tell him that I care about him and I always try to be there for him when he feels like shit which is a bit hard to do considering i'm half way across the continent.

        "original": " \n\nHello my name is Nick and I am a senior in high school, I have a rather unique problem that I have no idea how to solve and I am getting so tired of it. To give you some context I've struggled with social anxiety all of my life. Middle school was a very rough time for me, I was the painfully shy fat kid who had very few friends. This really messed me up because I had absolutely zero confidence in myself going into high school so I didn't really change much other than joining the football team because I thought I would make some friends and be \"cool\". This didn't work at all because I was still treated like an outcast on the team until I was an upperclassman. Basically my first two years of high school I was a ghost, no one knew me or cared to know me except the same few friends from middle school I mentioned earlier. Junior year I completely turned myself around, I lost a lot of weight, I hit the end puberty and actually became pretty handsome, and I got a nice looking haircut. For once I had a bit of confidence in myself, and one thing led to another and I got into a friend group outside of my school that had no connections to my past hermit self. I actually figured that I can be pretty charismatic and sociable when I have some confidence. This new friend group even led to an attractive girlfriend for a couple of months. \n\nI could go in further detail about my past but I don\u2019t want this to be a TLDR post so I\u2019ll get into the meat of my problem. This senior year I\u2019ve been slowly transferring my new social skills to my social life at school. I\u2019ve never had any counseling or even told anyone about my social anxiety so this has been a slow \u201clearn as I go\u201d process that I\u2019ve been doing solo, but to clarify my social anxiety is nowhere near gone, just way less of a factor in my life now. I was late to the party when it comes to making friends and forming friend groups, but I\u2019ve made a ton of new friends this year and to my knowledge, I\u2019m liked by everyone who knows me. I\u2019ve made friends with people in multiple friend groups (the school is kind of cliquey) I\u2019m even friends with most so-called \u201cpopular\u201d guys (I hate using the term popular but like it or not there is a social hierarchy in high school to an extent). But my main problem is that while I now have friends in school, I don\u2019t do anything with my new friends outside of school. I think explaining this with an example would be best. As I am writing this, I am at home on a Friday night, Mostly everyone goes to the basketball games and this night was no different. So I show up to the game as usual, and my friends are there. We have a fun time and I\u2019m fitting in with everyone, life is great. What sucks is when the game ends because then everyone makes plans on what they want to do after, and I am not included or invited to any of them, so I go home to solitude while everyone else has fun with there friends. From my understanding, they don\u2019t deliberately exclude me out of ill will, they just don\u2019t think to invite me or don\u2019t consider me close enough to hang out. This is agonizing because all these new people I\u2019ve become friends with are fun and interesting people that I want to spend time with. I also feel like I have come so close to finally having a normal healthy social life, but I just can\u2019t get over this last hump. I\u2019m not confident enough to just flat out ask if I can hang out with them, also I think that would be awkward and give off some bad vibes, but that's probably just the social anxiety speaking as all signs point to them more than welcoming me. I don\u2019t know what to do to finally make that plunge into these friend groups and become a regular, and I need your advice. \n\nI could see this being read as just some dumb high school kid venting about is minuscule problems, but I needed to get this off my chest, and I actually want some advice because every week I feel like I get closer to these people and when the week ends I think \u201cOk I\u2019m closer with them now, this weekend is the weekend I\u2019ll be finally included and my problems are over.\u201d but that thought never becomes a reality. I know this doesn\u2019t matter in the big picture at all, and when I go to college and beyond, I feel like my social skills have developed enough that if I was given a fresh start I wouldn\u2019t have any problems. But I\u2019m in the present and I want to solve this problem now. \n\nThanks for your time,\n\nNick",

I had absolutely zero anxiety about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently decided to spend some time alone as a hermit to hone in on a creative pursuit of mine. What was supposed to be a couple of months turned into a year of isolation off-grid. I knew I would experience a change in who I was, but I was not prepared for this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am now absolutely terrified of \"real\" life. I feel like a wild animal. A feral child entering the world for the first time. People look different to me. They all look like wild animals. Something in my brain has switched completely. Humans scare the SHIT out of me now. I have somewhat assimilated back into society, but I am now agoraphobic and have multiple panic attacks every day. If I interact with the outside world (aside from nature), I experience psychosomatic pain and panic. I'm fine around animals and nature though. I volunteer at a local animal shelter and explained my situation to them. They set me up with the kittens and other anxious animals and made sure I do not interact with any other people (as per request). I have zero anxiety in this situation. I also can go on hikes in nature n such and be perfectly fine. Any form of interaction with the world outside of nature and animals is impossible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLuckily, my normal, human-self prior to all of this had acquired a lot of money. I can live a comfortable life for at least the next ten years off my savings. At this time, however, I cannot hold any type of job or continue my businesses. I believe I am forced to sell them off (if I can even manage to do that), or risk their entire collapse. I do not do drugs and there is no history of this type of illness in my family. I am just so terrified, I can't even go to the doctor. I've purchased anti-anxiety drugs illegally through the deep web as I was too scared to get a prescription from a doctor. Unfortunately, none have worked so far.

        "original": "I\u2019ve been a ball of anxiety as long as I can remember. In elementary I would get so anxious in the mornings I would make myself sick. In high school I wouldn\u2019t get sick, but I\u2019d just have a panic attack while getting ready every morning. My parents were never really supportive over it and don\u2019t believe in anxiety or any mental illness. They\u2019d always say it was all in my head and I\u2019m fine or whatever else. My social anxiety sucks. I was popular in high school and I kind of am now, but it wasn\u2019t because I was outgoing. I was only popular because I was pretty and people would invite me to do stuff or sit with them and I would. The entire time I wouldn\u2019t talk. I\u2019d just listen or do my own thing and I don\u2019t know if it comes off as \u201ccool, quiet mysterious\u201d type or what, but I got nominated homecoming court two years in a row and was prom queen my senior year.. now that I\u2019m an adult I get invited out, 99.9% of the time I do not go, but when I do I\u2019m the same way. My friends now think it\u2019s because I\u2019m a \u201cbad bitch\u201d and I\u2019m just a huge bitch and don\u2019t talk because of that. I intimidate a lot of people and I hate that in itself. I don\u2019t want people to like me because they fear me or because I\u2019m pretty. I want to actually go out and feel comfortable and have conversations and be a normal person my age. My anxiety has gotten so much worse since I graduated and have became an adult. I don\u2019t go out and run errands and when I do I try to get it done as quickly as possible, so I can go home. I go out to the bar or to a party with my friends and I just hate it the whole time. I stand there at the edge of the group and I\u2019m just silent and I want to leave so bad, but nobody wants me to leave. Before I go out I get panic attacks so bad. I\u2019m not afraid of people not liking me I don\u2019t think, like strangers, but I am afraid that none of my \u201cfriends\u201d like me and they\u2019re just pretending. Or that I\u2019ll run into someone I went to school with and they\u2019ll want to talk and catch up and I have literally nothing new going on in my life when I should. I have no close friends. I have nobody to talk to about personal things or to come over just the two of us and hang out or go out to eat. I don\u2019t have a single person I can think of that I would call if I was having a bad day or whatever. Drinking doesn\u2019t help. I am not prescribed anything for my anxiety, but I think I might ask my doctor for something to help. It\u2019s getting so bad that I\u2019m afraid it will turn into agoraphobia and the isolation I put myself through is lonely and I\u2019m tired of it. I want to be like normal girls my age and go out and dance and be pretty and young and wild. I want to not feel lonely constantly and have pictures on my social media of me with all my friends having the greatest time, but I can\u2019t. And I\u2019m afraid I never will. My anxiety is so bad that I\u2019m afraid to tell my doctor how bad it is. I don\u2019t know why, but she really has no idea. She only kind of knows how bad it is. Posting this is making me anxious as we speak because I\u2019m afraid everyone here will think I\u2019m dumb for it. I\u2019m tired of skating through life on my looks. I want to show people the real me and be fun and have fun, but I\u2019m wasting away my 20\u2019s laying on the couch eating food and playing video games. I\u2019m going to be 27 this year and I want to fix this before it\u2019s too late. ",

So I am going to work parttime at my new job at that retail store and I am going to do self study  to get eventually a job in a field that I do like.  \n\n\nSo today I attended a course at the retail store about some products of the store, I was free to come if I would like. I thought it was a good idea to show my best side by attending. I was sincerely interessted in attending the course. I already didn't had a good start on my way to my new workplace, because my chain of my bike felt of. But I was still on time, I was there 5 min before the course should start but they already started. The group consistent of approximately 20 people.   \n\n\nI introduced myself in general to all of them and I felt pretty OK and confident. When the presenter was asking someone to volunteer tot test a bed that most of the group already had tested, I participated. So that the co-workers could see if the bed was right for me or not.   \n\n\nThings went pretty OK and not that awkward at all till then. But when the course ended, I had in my mind to introduce myself to my new co-workers I did not met before (met a few at my job interview). Most of them began to talk to eachother and some of them walked away, so it was harder for me to approach them I guess. But I approached a few of them and had some small talk about the work with them, I already began to feel awkward and my body language was showing that I think. Then most of them went to the canteen and started talking with eachother again (standing) I looked for people who I didn't introduced myself into. Then I asked two people who I already introduced myself into if I had introduced myself, I felt so stupid. It was due to nervousness that I forgot that I introduced myself to them, so I was kind of ashamed. Then I introduced myself to another co-worker and after that I was standing there alone in the middle, I began to talk to another co-worker from another district, that went OK, she already said before that she was from another district when I introduced myself in that other room before the canteen, but I asked the stupid question in which district she worked. After talking to her, I saw two persons whom didn't met me, but they were talking and I was kind of discouraged to meet them. So most of them went out and walking towards home and I walked with them and said \"have a nice day, guys, yo\" and left. Felt also really awkward about that.

I don't think things like, \u201cNo.. that's stupid. Don't say that,\u201d or \u201cYou're going to embarrass yourself.\u201d I don't think those things because I CAN'T THINK. I can't think unless I'm alone. I mean, that's gotta immediately rule out most, if not all, types of therapy from benefiting me much.

I've done plain old talk therapy, CBT, DBT, group therapy, art therapy, trauma-based therapy. I'm in an intensive outpatient program right now; I am there 15 hours a week, but the only thing it is really helping me with is giving me a reason to leave the house. I guess I'm posting about this because I'm hoping it isn't as uncommon as I've come to believe, and that someone might have an idea of where I should even go at this point.\n\nAlso: I am not against medication. The only thing I would prefer to stay away from, for now at least, are benzos. I was on Prozac, but that only made me feel worse. I was just prescribed Zoloft and Atarax, so we will see how that goes. Still, I firmly believe that all of this can only help me very minimally, and that I HAVE to get to the root of the problem somehow. I just don't know where to even start when it's ingrained so deeply within me. How can you change thoughts that you aren't consciously having?\n\nFor more context: I'm an 18 year old girl. I've been taking online classes for a while now. They haven't been working for me at all, but then again, neither did being in a traditional school. I failed my entire last semester, so I am going to have to stay at least an extra semester to make up for that, but since I'm currently failing this semester too, it's looking like it may be a full school year more (unless I get my GED, which I am now starting to consider). After high school, I have NO IDEA, and I mean no idea, what I want. I don't see myself ever being able to move out if I don't improve, even though living with my parents is taking even more of a toll on me. I had a job at an ice cream place, but it became absolute social anxiety HELL, and I actually ghosted my boss. If I don\u2019t get better, I can\u2019t even imagine trying to work again. I have ZERO friends. I am sincerely afraid for my future now, and I know that if something doesn't change, I will not be able to function as an adult.",

        "original": "I am a 16 year old male. I think of myself as a very boring person, and it is hard for me to make any meaningful connections with anyone because I have absolutely no interests or passions. I never open up to anybody about my personal life, not even my parents or other family members. In school, I don't really have any friends. I only have acquaintances in each of my classes.  I never talk to these people outside of school, and in school, almost everything that I talk to them about is school related. They're not real friends. Just people who I talk to to not be lonely, and in exchange we help each other with schoolwork. I don't talk to them during the summer, and I won't talk to them unless I have a class with them the next year.  I don't have social media and I would never give them my phone number because it seems weird, because I doubt that they actually consider me a friend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason why I'm such a boring person is that I have no interests or passions. I don't listen to music, watch movies, watch or play sports, etc. I literally come home, do my homework, and go on Reddit and YouTube. That's it. That's the reason I have no true friends - if I did, I would quickly run out of things to talk about. My only accomplishments are my good grades -- that's it. People who know me usually consider me extremely smart and a nice person, but my boring personality and social anxiety prevent me from making any meaningful connections with anybody. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like my boring personality and SA are keeping me from being a normal person. People around me are doing all sorts of normal things, like hanging out with friends, dating, learning how to drive, playing sports, etc. Meanwhile, I'm at home rotting away with my only friends -- my 2 dogs and cat. How am I ever going to get a job, get married, etc. if everyday social interactions, like asking for help with something, or asking for somebody's phone number, absolutely terrify me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like this post might be disorganized. However, I can feel myself spiraling into a depression. I've been depressed before- when my parents split up in 6th grade - and it sucked. That was probably the lowest point of my life. My boring personality and social anxiety are joining forces and it's killing me. How can I stop being such a boring person? The common sense answer is to get involved with my school and community and to make friends. However, my crippling social anxiety prevents that from happening. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "title": "A decade with social anxiety",
        "original": "So I just finished a therapy session today and realized it's been about ten years of trying to get better with social anxiety (general anxiety, panic attacks, and perfectionism as well). It started at the age of 14 and I'm turning 27 this year. Looking back, I'd say I changed a lot, and getting closer to where I want to be. I want to remind those who are struggling that things DO get better, and especially not feel alone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I first found out I had anxiety, I had no idea what that was. I had to look it up online and found an online forum where I felt like I belonged, and it was social anxiety. To anyone with a strange anxiety, mine was stomach anxiety. I would fear being in quiet classrooms because I was nervous my stomach would grumble or make noise. Now this came from me feeling like a bother to classmates during tests or something. I did the most strange things to try and stop my stomach grumbles. I would hide in bathrooms for an hour, I would wake up 3 hours earlier for school just to use the bathroom in case I was gassy, I would either skip breakfast or have a specific breakfast, do yoga, or go to a gastroenterologist for help. None of those helped by the way lol The anxiety got so intense, I almost didn't graduate highschool due to low attendance. I just couldn't sit through a class. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen college came around, I struggled harder. I dropped so many classes because either the classrooms looked too small, or crowded or the silence was unbearable. I would sneak in little snacks or candy to ease my stomach grumbles, but again, no help. I felt frustrated. My counselor at the time wasn't much help. I lost my financial aid and that's when I completely lost it. I felt like I was losing control over my life and was suicidal. I don't know how I got out of that...I just remember going hysterical in my house. I wanted an out so bad. My family life was horrible...and I wanted to be the good daughter that didn't cause any trouble. Money was always an issue so losing that aid made me shut down. After that...I tried so hard to still go to college. I was enrolled for three years, but I was still a freshman. That already shows how many times I dropped classes and kept trying to push through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy life story is a very long one. From 2010 - 2016, I spent it in isolation. I never left my home. I was in two toxic relationships. I never talked to anyone but my bfs. I was overweight. I couldn't make eye contact with people, just walking past people was awkward. I would hide my face and look down a lot. I spoke in a very soft voice. I never had a real job. I dropped out of school. I would have panic attacks anytime I was in a room of silence (I had jury duty once and I broke down in tears because the waiting room was so quiet.) I felt guilty towards my parents because I depended on them a lot, even though they were never in my life emotionally and physically. I wouldn't pick up phone calls (I had extreme phone anxiety). I would get angry whenever my parents made me call costumer service. I was suicidal. I let my bf emotionally abuse me just so I wouldn't be lonely. I was desperate for a connection. I spent a month never opening my mouth because I had literally no one to talk to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe turning point was at the end of 2016 when I met my current bf. He is everything I would love to be. Even though he can be shy sometimes, he's not afraid to be himself. He's the guy who brings all his friends together to just hang out. When he hasn't connected with someone in a long while, he would reach out to them and get a drink with them. Also, I had started CBT. My therapist was the role model and mother figure I needed in my life. She taught me things my parents never did. The most important thing I learned  was  that it was okay to feel uncomfortable. If I ever felt anxiety, I would sit through that feeling. I would stop trying to run away and avoid the problem. I also started medication which helped further. (I spent years with different therapists and medications but nothing stuck with me btw). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith my therapist and my bf as my only two support systems in my life, I had the courage to go back to school in 2017, and here I am, graduating from community college in two months and transferring to a four year college. This girl, who was so afraid of classrooms, always avoided school, spent years by herself....not only made it through all classes with perfect attendance, but had straight As every semester. You know what's even crazier? I don't even remember what it was like to have stomach anxiety! I connected with classmates, talked to professors, I participated in every class, I love to be the first person to present work, and I never realized that people...liked me. People telling me that I was actually a funny person...I never knew that about myself until I opened up. I went into school with a mindset for change. I wanted to grow up and be an adult for once. Nothing was perfect, I had downfalls. I still struggle with some anxiety but I can say it no longer rules my life. No matter what age you are in, everyone starts at their own pace. Don't rush, start slow. Start with the small things. Just start. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou didn't fail today, you just struggled. The most important thing to remember is that you try. You go out and do it. Just the act of doing something is something to be proud of. It's a long read, but I just wanted to share my experience. I didn't write down as much as I wanted to because I didn't want it to be too long .I hope someone out there doesn't feel alone and can relate with my story. \n\n&#x200B;",

        "title": "why would she have this relationship with me since I was a 14 year old boy",
        "original": "I was in high school as a younger boy. She was an older girl. She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We\u2019d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said \"Nobody else is as big as you\". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.\n\nAs I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.\n\nWell now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything.\n\nI am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI met a girl when I was younger she did stuff that's impossible to ignore to get my attention. She continued this stuff for years and flirts to the point it is uncomfortable and doesn't stop then has an issue when I get mad or uncomfortable and ignore her and she lashes out. She does things that are impossible to ignore and continues this into college. Showing up 30 minutes early to her class when I am in the class before, and walking by a lot and standing in the door, waiting outside;\n\nPS: I am autistic but on the high functioning end of the spectrum and not everyone knows and it isn't too obvious",

        "original": "Hey guys, my name is Anthony. I'm 27 and when I was 19 I was hospitalized for anorexia and anxiety. It took a few years for me to get to this point however when it all went wrong it really happened fast. I think I had my first bout of anxiety when I was around age 8, at least that was the time I had my first therapist. I saw various therapists over those years, with the earlier ones trying to work out why I was misbehaving rather than what my troubles actually were. I guess they figured they had another ADHD kid on their hands they could simply give a star chart too and encourage Mum to make sure they get their s\\*\\*\\* together.\n\nWhen I did finally go to hospital I was relieved. I was terrified of what was to become of me if I did not get urgent help. Although hospital was extremely difficult for me and forced me to overcome challenges I hadn't even imagined, I can now comfortably say it was one of the best things that ever happened to me. Upon gaining my weight back I left hospital medicated and on the real path to recovery. Over the next few years I started to develop a mindset which I constructed from the experiences of others that were just like mine but perhaps they were doing a little bit better. I often say that nobody has all the answers, if they did they would only ever be one self-help book but there's not there's thousands. so it's my belief that's the best thing you can do to overcome your mental health challenges is to open up to others and allow them to open up to you. By doing this we share information with each other that we would otherwise hide for fear of shame or ridicule. but it's my personal promise that if you trust in the natural gift of communication, and not just talk but listen, you can expand your own set of tools to deal with this ever-increasing challenging world. Perhaps the first person you speak to will not understand you and that's okay. Maybe the first 10 won't have a clue where you're coming from, but that's okay too. However, occasionally you will meet someone you are so aligned with that you will probably just burst into laughter at the similarity.\n\nThis is how we learn. We share information and learn from each other the same way as we do with all the other subjects that we are so far advanced in. Why does Moore's Law work for technology but not mental health? Maybe the reason is that we don't talk about it and we don't work together to get to the next level. I urge you, please, if you are going through something today to talk to somebody, because it might just turn out they're the person who is just like you. Maybe they're waiting for someone like you to talk to them too.\n\nI will be documenting more of my thoughts and my journey on my YouTube channel Another Point of View. I would love your support to reach as many people as possible with not only my message but interviews I will be conducting with others to tell their stories about how they overcame their challenges. If you would like to talk to me and perhaps be willing to open up in front of others to help them, get in touch. I would love to speak to you.\n\nI truly hope you're all having incredible day. Anthony.\n\nPart 1 of my anxiety series on Youtube - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QIrKFg32Q4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QIrKFg32Q4)",

        "original": "So, TL:DR, I am 17 years old high schooler who just cried over 30 min because of a bad haircut from someone who pretend to be male and female hairdresser and in reality is only feamale hairdresser, and because of that I am too afraid to go to school on monday because I fear my classmates will laugh at me. That's how bad my social anxiety is. And I ask for some advices.Long Story: maby let's start on thing I cried about I can remember, its only 3 things:- 8 years ago I hardly cried when my grampa who in this time was 1 of my few friends, and I cried only because I kinda forced myslef\n\n\\- When Phyra from RWBY died i lost 1 tear- When I was around 6 and cut half of my hand (between thumb and forefinger)So, ever 10 years of constantly bullying on me by my half of my classmates I didn't even cry becasue I learned to hold my feelings and let them go only when I let them, I can't control myself only when I am too angry.Because of that I never truly open to anyone, I hardly made any friends and to be honest I don't know if I want to.I have only 3 hobby in my life, ( I like to read, I like to watch anime/serials/ and play videogames).  But almost nobody know it. Because of bullying I always had problems with going to school, often got ache of literally everything.Unfortunetly because of my anxiety and having problems with bullying in primal school I started skpping days in school, and it get it me again in highschool because after getting happy about not having in my class any person who bulled me in primal school I got excited but didn't get any friends but hardly 2 mates who sometimes talk with me. Anyone other was just there cold and in their close groups, unfortunetly I didn't menage to have that group even after trying to get one, get noone. I didn't passed a year, and in my new class everyone is friendly open. There is no groups only one, and this is a whole class. Everyone is nice and I find out I can call almost half of them my friends, what's pretty good.But the problem start here. Year ago I decide I will have a longer hair, because why not, I will do a cosplay and maby longer hair will cover my slightly below avarage face. So after 5 or 6 months of getting angry because my hairs didn't manage to get a style finally from 2 cm I had long hairs and I was happy about it. My hair wasn't gorgeous, their were kinda wild because I didn't even cut my hair for 1 hear and 2 months. 2/3 months I get style I was happy about, it looked nice and cover my face. And I get even some words about looking better in longer hair than short. But my mother and sister wasn't so happy about it, I started to get comments to go to cut my hair, or from my sister I get know I look like a moron and other stuff. But I didn't care much about them, I was just happy about my hair and how it look because it wasn't like in the picture, but it was close enough to make me feel happy and good. In this week my mom decide I will go to hairdresser, I asked in 4 days 6 times if I could get money to go to male hairdresser in city (3 min from my school) but didn't get answear. Today I was taken to my local hairdresser in my village (sligtly about 2k people, smal city basicly but its still vilage to have lower taxes) I went to her usually, and when I last get my haircut (friend of my mom), I didn't cared about it much 1 year ago, but asked if she is male hairdresser, my mother answear was \"Yes\" but after 30 minuts I get to know its easy to call himself a male hairdress when only mens what want haircut want it to be 2 cm longs.I didn't get haircut from her but from heir employee but when I look at the mirror instead of my long and \"lion's mane\" ( I like to call it because it kinda looked like it) I saw angry typical feminist from TV who is trigerred because someone didn't said her gender right. Basicly, it look like a female hair and I lost half length of my hairs in awful way. I uncontrolly cried for 1 hour,because I am too afraid to go to school and listen to laugh about my hair from my classmates. It remind me of 11 years of bullying having bad days, and using everything what's possible to laugh of me, even my owns hobby.Its 11:30 Pm when I ended writing it, I started crying aroun 10 PM, after 1 hour and writing it, In the process I calmed myself enough to stop myself from crying, but its still want to come back and I feel rly bad becasue I lost only thing what I was happy about in my body and 6 months of growing hair while getting angry about growing them ( because when they were in the middle I could not get them together and it looked bad but still better than short)22D.02M.2019Y - Day when I broke for first time in my whole time becasue I am to affraid to get back to bad memories. What I should do ?Below picture what describe the best how my hair looked vs how I see myself in the mirror but with brown hairs I am not handsome like they guy below but it my hairs was close enough for me to get complements about looking much better in long hair than in short, and even by persons who didn't saw me in short I get some complements, what mean so much to me because my famili is no supportive and I can't get help from them in anything emocional or get a lot complements in my life from anyone. So it was a something to me.  And that's how my social life is with my anxiety,   \nIt get me a lof of situation when I feel depressed a lot of times,  had bad feelings, actually get depress almost diagnosed, hardly could communicate with other people If i didn't know them for at last a day. I started to overcome this, but now I think I just get a few steps back\n\nSorry for long post but I just had to write somewhere about it, ask for some help what to do. Its just feel generaly better when I trow out everything what I hold in myself for years, because I didn't had any person to talk about it.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/r4yh86zc77i21.jpg\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/3cry7aoe77i21.jpg",

I've been dealing with the onset of this awful duo since I was about 16, to the point where I eventually went full NEET and dropped out of society to hide in my room.\n\nIt's progressively gotten worse. Like, to the point that I just got out of the loony bin 2 weeks ago worse. I've lost all of my friends because despite my years of isolation, I've managed to periodically run off with junkies I met online and make several poor decisions that shined a new light on my bipolar disorder and alcoholism. Yep, it quadrupled!\n\nThis isn't about my poor decision making skills though, it's about how rejuvenated I feel after I got out of the hospital -- and how terrified I am that I am going to crash. It's been two weeks and I'm alone. I have watched people cringe at me or be confused by my personality and essence, and I've had several people walk away because my anxiety is \"too much\".\n\nI was given a hard reset and now I don't know what to do with it because despite my natural empathy and knack for conversing, I am absolutely terrified of the vulnerability that comes with socializing. And the rejection. I've watched too many shake their heads at me. I had someone describe me the other day in the words of, \"watching you in public is like watching an alien trying to be human.\"\n\nAnd while the side of me that has an interest in cryptozoology might find that slightly flattering, it's really quite embarrassing when your strange aura is noticeable! Sure, I laugh through the tears, but swallowing my pride is harder.\n\nI feel stuck. I feel chatty. I feel social. But there's no one to share it with, because it feels as if this part of my phobia scares them off or creates a disinterest in me. It feels as if me being afraid means I'm constantly disappointing the new people I'm trying to gather into my life.\n\nIs life really this hard? Am I just looking for love in the wrong places?

        "title": "Goal Of Post : Unloading and Receiving Myriads of Supportive Responses. Please Help Me Accomplish My Goal. Topic : Feelings of Inferiority",
        "original": "Summary of Inferiority I think about all of this everyday, deal with this too often and am reminded of it frequently because of \u201ctriggers\u201d. And I\u2019m tired of it. Trying to navigate them, understand them are just as stressful as the feelings and circumstances are themselves. I don\u2019t even know what a solution or coping looks like... Being Ugly and Feeling Ugly. When I look at myself in the mirror, I don\u2019t like what I see. I am ugly. I am ugly to myself and I am ugly to others, there\u2019s no other way around it. It devalues the rest of me in the eyes of others. I don\u2019t like living while being ugly. It only holds me back from things. Because I\u2019m this way, I\u2019m super limited for romance on top of being short/small framed. It makes me not desirable romantically ever ( knowing and thinking about that makes me feel bad) and it makes me inferior in the eyes of others. I don\u2019t like being associated with this ugly. I don\u2019t like being reminded by myself that I look this way. It\u2019s like going outside with your shirt inside out... but with a shirt can fix it, but being ugly is something that is forever. I\u2019m tired of being beneath others and not good enough. There are times when I don\u2019t even want to go outside because of the way I look. It\u2019s painful. Sometimes, I have to remind myself that I have to live my life and can\u2019t let being ugly take over. There\u2019s no solution to this. I just have to deal with it. Many people don\u2019t have to deal with this at all, so they don\u2019t have the solution for it or need a solution. I\u2019m tired of my therapists sugar coating things for example telling me I\u2019m not ugly. They only say that because there\u2019s nothing else they can do or say to people when they\u2019re ugly. And I envy the attractive population so much for it. Wanting to experience what it would be like to be with an attractive person and feeling love leads to viewing of pornography and the viewing of pornography leads to more envy and frustration (on top of all of the other bad things about pornography which is another problem I\u2019m dealing with - health problems). Being reminded of my looks by seeing myself, by seeing someone with better looks or with generally normal or good looks and by seeing people who are intimate irates me so much the same way the other things I'll say do. I wish I could take out all the feelings of anger and envy and inferiority on something. Before, I even wanted to take those feelings out in some of the most heinous ways possible but I suppressed those feelings by remembering that doing something unfairly doesn't solve the unfairness I've been dealt.\n\nI feel uncomfortable around attractive people. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don\u2019t have much experience socializing or getting to know an attractive person (since most don\u2019t want anything to do with ugly people since often times, ugly looks devalue us in society and functions almost like class). I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their good looks alone. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. I also feel down and angry upon seeing them, knowing that I\u2019ll never be good enough for them romantically or sometimes socially because of my looks (even though looks aren\u2019t the only thing that define me). And of course I envy them too. For their looks, for the privileges that come with looks (there are so many of them as looks and the idea of sex really baits people. Self confidence, status, being treated nicer, luxury of love and relationships and using their looks to advance in life to acquire wealth, more status/popularity, etc.) and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at finding love. I also feel hatred. I hate ones that use their looks to their advantage on purpose. I also hate ones that are really confident in their looks and kind of flaunt it or come off as conceited. It's like a mockery to me. Even seeing them smile sometimes feels like a mockery to me. It's rare that someone would actually mock me, but it just feels that way. Seeing these people is a trigger within itself. That gets me angry, on top of the hatred and sadness I have to deal with by looking the way I do and therefore not being good enough socially or romantically. I just hate the unfairness. It\u2019s also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks.\n\nI feel uncomfortable around white people who I also find attractive. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don\u2019t have much experience socializing or getting to know a white person since I grew up in a low income neighborhood where white people don\u2019t reside in, because I distance myself from white people infested areas because of this discomfort and because anything that\u2019s geared towards white people (places, hobbies, groups) is likely geared towards wealthy people or white people since here in New York the two are nearly interchangeable since most whites are middle class or wealthy (it\u2019s to the point where I don\u2019t know much about my city because I\u2019ve really sheltered myself because of this discomfort and can\u2019t tell what from what in the city. There probably are some places that are meant for everyone, but I won\u2019t find out anytime soon because of this cluelessness as a result of the discomfort and because of the discomfort) - both meaning the same thing to me as someone who grew up low income from immigrant parents (who don\u2019t speak english) with little understanding about the white and professional world. Not all white people are the same of course, but it\u2019s hard to truly understand that because of my lack of interaction with them. I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general because of the whole underlying white supremacy and class ties that runs the United States and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their color alone. Some of them look down on you by choice and/or look down on you because of the very same kind of conditioning that makes me feel beneath them. It would be fine and dandy and all if that was it, but on top of having to overcome these disadvantages, I also have to compete with these very people in order to earn freedom and successes, through education and job hunting, finding love etc. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. And of course I envy them too. For privileges that come with their skin, general looks and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at success. Many things are made by them and made for them. It\u2019s often why in commercials, the families that are portrayed are middle class or wealthy ones that live in homes of great quality. It\u2019s also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks and upbringing. I envy both the privileges that these two kinds of people have and also envy the things that they don\u2019t have to go through like the stress I have to go through dealing with and trying to navigate all of this as they get to just live life carefree. It\u2019s worse when they\u2019re ignorant to the problems of others and/or are conceited.\nIt\u2019s a little more than just white people though. It more has to do with socioeconomic status and popularity/fame more than anything (since like I mentioned before, most white people are wealthy and as a result acquire status easier and faster here, so at this point it boils down to that, however). I feel uncomfortable around people of higher socioeconomic status and people who are talented (white people because of privileges that make their lives easier and therefore give them the time, money, resources, connections and mental health to perform and advance... not to say that other races cannot become talented... it's just that we have less privileges) or have higher status in general because of their popularity or looks and the privileges that they have as a result and therefore feeling like. Also people who have done and experienced a lot in life are people who I feel beneath and uncomfortable around. Intelligent people too. People who have accomplished a lot, both quantity and quality. People who are ambitious and have a lot to show for their goals, life and ambitions. Upon seeing or reading about someone who is incredibly accomplished, I feel bad about myself (one example, browsing someone\u2019s linkedin account... I couldn\u2019t even dream to measure up to that person even within two lifetimes. Privileged or not, I\u2019m still behind.) I also feel pressured. I feel like I need to change who I am and try to be as ambitious and as accomplished as they are so that I can feel good enough and on par. It\u2019s impossible to be on par with some people. I\u2019m not good enough to be around those people and I also feel bad because I don\u2019t measure up whenever I'm around them. People in powerful positions have the power to dictate your worth in society. Job employers dictate if you\u2019re good enough for the job, rich white men created white supremacy, professionalism which describes how assimilated you\u2019ve become to white culture in the sense that you speak formally/properly like a white person and earn their respect (since all the people who are employers/in power are white people because their governing and taking over - killing off the native americans, but let\u2019s not go there) and beauty standards (which were created to benefit their women). Professionalism and white supremacy are two entities that are simply one in my eyes. Two societal barriers that make others look at me as inferior and not good enough and therefore make me feel inferior. I shouldn\u2019t have to change who I am in order to be accepted by others, but it looks like there\u2019s no other way out because the people in power dictate your worth and how you attain freedom. And there are some people of higher socioeconomic status that don\u2019t see others as inferior or beneath or not good enough for them, yet I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell at first glance of course because you can\u2019t see someone\u2019s true colors based on their looks alone. You would just have to find out by chance. So I\u2019ll still feel beneath them initially, unless I am of equal socioeconomic status or develop value through some skills or talents or something weird. And then all that\u2019s left are the things I can\u2019t change like my skin color, my height and my facial features.\n\nWhite people here in NYC are often attractive as well, so the discomfort is more - a direct correlation to how inferior I am to them. It\u2019s because generally speaking white people and light skin is found to be attractive. It\u2019s also because white people here and in general are wealthy and therefore have had access to healthier foods in their neighborhoods that they could afford, and likely have more time and more resources that aid in general life well being which reduces stress, likely are more fit because of the healthy foods and opportunities to play on sport teams etc. It also doesn\u2019t help that white people are seen as the most attractive, so even if I did have a chance to find love, there\u2019d be no point since white people are the most desired. I envy white men for being able to charm attractive women. Their facial structure could even be less attractive than mine, but their white skin is what saves them. Light skin is just attractive. Do you know how small I feel (especially as a man?)\nBeing Brown. Brown skinned men like myself are short and often times ugly. Our darker skin alone is not seen as attractive as light skin. Our facial structures are less attractive too. On average, we are on the shorter side, which makes us less manly and attractive. White men are seen as more attractive because of their light and I guess because of their socioeconomic status and because of white supremacy norms or in other words - because they pushed the idea that they were the best because they have it all and created it all - others consciously and/or subconsciously bought into it and are attracted to this power and associate it with those looks. After all, we are attracted to people who can provide. Also, negative stereotypes don\u2019t help people of my color. We\u2019re known for being short, weak, ugly, awkward, nerdy, smelly, unmanly and \u201cnice guys\u201d (not very assertive and submissive) and more things exclusive to the Indian or Middle Eastern nations\u2019 cultures. Brown people are really unattractive. A lot of our facial features aren't attractive, but it also has to do with racial conditioning/white supremacy/racism that\u2019s rooted in our subconsciousness that influence what we find attractive - by that I mean beauty standards being Eurocentric.\n\nBeing Short doesn\u2019t bother me all that much. It sucks. It only sucks a lot when coupled with the others - being a poor, brown, ugly minority. I guess it does suck because it\u2019s the main thing on top of being ugly that prevents me from having a chance with women. It also makes me feel small around people. Even the majority of women I feel are my height or taller, and the short ones don\u2019t want short men anyways.\nGrowing up poor under immigrant parents and having less resources not only has led me to this mental health dilemma, but has also put me in a position where I have a hard time even trying to express how I\u2019m feeling (bad verbal/written skills, also another insecurity - thing that makes me inferior and uncomfortable and also a thing that professionals and white people look down on)don\u2019t know of terminology - like social justice stuff that aids in my expression, understanding and self development when it comes to this stuff. I\u2019m tired of this. I\u2019m also tired of having to see mental health doctors for my problems (other problems too) and also dislike being around doctors in general, police officers, people in authority in general and having mental health problems because I\u2019m in a position where I\u2019m beneath others.\n\nI\u2019ve always had an identity crisis growing up because of feeling inferior to different people and being around different kinds of people. I felt inferior to the strong and tough african americans and latinos in my low income neighborhood, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. I felt inferior to the tall and attractive white people, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. Now I don\u2019t really know who I am, how people see me and who exactly I want to be or what things would make me feel on par with others/would make others see me as on par or what my personality would be or want to be seen as or whose opinions or views of me should matter.\n\nThis last part I just added recently. I feel kind of uncomfortable around or when I think about or read or hear about people who are kinda sexually forward or \"excessively promiscuous\" (wasn't allowed to use a certain word here) or when people are intimate with one another and I can see it or when I suspect that someone who I walk by in person who I feel could be an actress in adult films (unfortunately because of all of this stuff in general, I too have preconceived notions about people based on their appearances. I feel like in the society we live in, it\u2019s impossible to bypass that because stereotypes and whatever are everywhere.) I know that doesn\u2019t make sense because I\u2019ve been watching adult material, but I guess that\u2019s how I feel when I view it for what it is and not in an unconscious state for pleasure. The feeling is a strange one. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anger. It might be envy, but at the same time it doesn\u2019t feel that way. It\u2019s almost like a feeling of - this is wrong (even though sex and stuff are normal. Could it be that I feel inferior to someone who is promiscuous?). I wish I knew how to explain it better. It does stack on top of the envy I have for those people envy though there\u2019s a lot more than what meets the eye like how the industry treats them bad as well as the professional world. I can\u2019t just shake off the envy because... well what I envy about their situation is present and nothing more. Thoughts like these are almost a constant I feel because it\u2019s such a big issue coupled with my insecurities about my image, but also because I feel as though the bad sleep I\u2019m experiencing is making my mind a bit wonky. In class it was hard to concentrate because of these thoughts coming and going as well as the need to comprehend them and I guess come up with solutions.\n\nSummary\n\nI hate it all. (Not mentioned, but my home life and upbringing - verbal abuse, lack of resources, stupid parent, stupid single parent, underserved or nonexistent resources for low income neighborhood, no privacy, sadistic family members)(that I still have to be grateful and guilty because there are people who will look at me and think my problems are only a fraction of theirs), things I\u2019m not even allowed to mention, Other insecurities of mine like my voice, body, Being ugly, being short, being a minority, not being good enough for love and more and being beneath others according to existing societal standards, beauty standards, people pretending to be who they aren\u2019t, a superficial based society as a result of media brainwashing us that makes people alter themselves through lighting, makeup etc., white supremacy and its byproducts, professionalism (which is another way the elite separate themselves from the rest and define everyone else as inferior)(another way that forces people to become fake and superficial in order to please others. Resumes, speaking formally, dressing in clothing for interviews that has no value otherwise), the white, privileged and wealthy profiting off of the poor, ignorant minorities through business while putting on the facade of genuinely trying to help us while also making them look superior because it only emphasizes the class difference. (hate that I) envy those who have wealth, good looks that \u201caward\u201d them too many privileges one of which being the ability to earn money through modeling and adult films (even though the adult film industry isn\u2019t pretty and is a toxic and manipulative and fake and ugly on the inside), envy and privileged people and my identity crisis. I\u2019m tired of having been conditioned to feel inferior and to want to prove myself to others (when maybe I should be the one I should be proving things to.) Who do I want to be? What makes me feel good enough? What do I determine my value on without sugar coating things for myself in order to avoid feelings of inferiority altogether? How do I cope with my shitty circumstances for the rest of my life? How do I live with this anger and frustration?\n\nEdit : 2/23/19 So today, I volunteered to join an organization that was tabling (had a table up at a place in hopes of handing out fliers and information to promote events and whatnot). (You might wonder why I even did this upon finishing reading this. I want to volunteer because I genuinely want to help the less fortunate, give back to the community and to give back to nature. I wouldn\u2019t have put myself in such an uncomfortable position otherwise) It already started off as a bad day because I had gotten a shitty haircut. Another thing that gets in the way. No hair shape or style works on me on top of being ugly. Continuing on.. So the person I volunteer with is someone kinda extraordinary (I only know because I looked them up online, their linkedin account). They\u2019ve been involved in a myriad of extracurriculars, volunteering, internships, attended an amazing university, graduating with honors etc, speak 3 languages, supports themselves, isn\u2019t even going to settle for the career they have now (which shows ambition and that they\u2019re advancing and moving on in the future... this and this person in general is a good foil for me though in the sense that their existence highlights how little I do and am, how little I\u2019ve done and how much time is going by without me growing or making anything of it), once lived in one state and moved across the country to live in this state (showcases the ability to make a huge transition, plus showcases another experience/stage of life this person has undergone) is married, is under 25 years old, is a professional, is attractive, is kind, cares for the environment, is self aware, is ambitious, is talented... someone like that would be amazing to be around. It\u2019s a privilege to be around someone so lucky and amazing... but it also feels like a punishment. I\u2019m one hundred percent inferior to them no matter how I look at it. If I could live to be 200 I still would be inferior to them. A whole second lifetime and I wouldn\u2019t be able to measure up to them. (why does inferiority matter so much, I don\u2019t know. I suppose because we\u2019re conditioned to want to fit in to have friends/love, so our value and appearance matter. Humans need one another. Stuff like professionalism, status, looks, etc. matter when looking for work - which earns money which earns freedom/time.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m inferior to them, so I was uncomfortable around them. I was also uncomfortable because I didn\u2019t have much to say because I\u2019m not really cultured. I don\u2019t do much or know much because of my upbringing whereas she and the other people I was with are a couple of years older than me and are cultured, accomplished, have had a lot of experiences, are really making the most of their time/are situated (job, home, etc.) I was also uncomfortable because I was supposed to help out but I didn\u2019t really help out because I\u2019m not a very social person and I didn\u2019t have much to say because I don\u2019t know much about the organization. I felt stupid too. She was trying to simplify things for me, but that act from her part only made me feel more inferior. She was nice, it\u2019s just that on top of everything else, her knowing that I was uneasy made me feel even more small and inferior. In addition, there were many accomplished and/or white people who were coming to our table and were at the event which made me uncomfortable.\n\nI just snuck out midway through the event and sent an email to her because I wasn\u2019t going to further make myself look and feel inferior by explaining all of this to them, especially in person with my poor verbal skills. I\u2019m already ashamed enough and am considering breaking up communication with them even though they\u2019re helping me by inviting me to volunteer at events that would assist in furthering my college/career (especially since I\u2019m a lousy 20 year old student at community college) Feeling inferior makes me anxious and the inferiority and anxiety made me depressed. I just had to leave. And so I did. I can\u2019t change my circumstances, but I can work on myself to be on par with some people (though I\u2019ll never be on par with certain people). I can find ways to cope with stuff like this and everything else when I feel down because when it gets to the point of feeling depressed, it consumes me. I forget about the rest of the world and what\u2019s amazing about it and then I feel like my life is over because I can\u2019t have or be certain things. That\u2019s not to say that all of this isn\u2019t small in terms of the grand scheme of things. It\u2019s very big. However there is more going on in the world.\nThings not mentioned: Shitty sleep, other health complications.",

I tell them theyre beautiful and great and i get nothing back. i get so sad about this sometimes because i see all my friends making moves and stuff and im here alone and sad texting girls for months and whenever i do have a chance i dont ever get anywhere. im so annoying at school, dont fit in and my friends treat me like a black sheep so i just walk to mcdonalds sit alone in a corner and help others with their problems online or listen to music. i hate myself. my friends like me because im outgoing and \"nick is crazy and funny\". i make people cry tears of laughter yet i feel so empty and unsatisfied with anything when im alone. im not saying im depressed or anything because i do have good moments but everyday or other day i have this incredible weight pulling me down. where to start?",

        "original": "So I'm in my second semester at a big university and I still haven't met anyone. I just don't know what to do.\n\nI want to tell you a little about me. Throughout elementary, middle, and high school I've always been labeled the 'quiet kid.' I have terrible social anxiety. I never talked to anyone unless I already knew them or if they approached me first. I played Lacrosse in high school and was a top player so I gained some friendships through that. Other than that, I either played video games or worked out by myself and never went out to socialize.\n\nNow I'm in college and everything has changed. I'm extremely lonely and it's killing me. I literally have 0 friends. All my lacrosse buddies went to different schools.\n\n97% of students at my school live in the dorms, I don't. I feel that this puts me at a massive disadvantage for meeting new people. Everyone that I ask for help just says, 'hang out in the dorms.' My school is very strict about strangers in dorm halls. If you don't live in it, you can't enter without a paper signed by someone in that dorm. \n\nSo right now, here is an average day for me. Wake up at 7 a.m. Leave at 8 and drive to school. Finally get to class at 9. Class ends at 9:50. next class starts at 10 and ends at 10:50. At 10:50, I just go home because I don't know what else to do. I kind of just chill the rest of the day inside which I don't exactly like. I hate myself for doing this. But I've always done this, except when I had lacrosse practice/games. It all I know how to do. I want to change.\n\nI also want to get into dating. I think I look pretty good. I'm tall, fit, and I take very good care of myself. I still never meet anyone though.  Lmao, get this, I'm in nursing. So my classes are like 3% men. I guess I just sit there in my classes and hope someone will approach or talk to me at some point, which hasn't happened and probably isn't going to happen. People don't talk a lot in class. I also probably look unapproachable because I never smile and look sad all the time. I have had severe depression for years. I getting help for it though. I'm working on smiling more and looking like I'm a nice person.\n\nI recently tried dating apps. But when I started to make a profile, I realized that there are no pictures of me because I never go out and do anything. So I gave up on that.\n\nSo how can I change? How can I stop isolating my self? How can I socialize more instead of going home for the rest of the day after 2 hrs of classes. I've been a ghost my entire life. I guess you could off the grid. I don't have any social media either. I've just been that guy who is just kinda, there. No one know his name or who he is, he's just, there. And he never talks or interacts with anyone unless forced to. please help.",

My old classmates know that I have that fear, but my new classmates and even my teacher just look at me like Im... lets just say they look at me differently. I can hear their minds saying \"youre such a pussy\" \"she looks stupid\" at me. \n\nThe first time I \"played\" this school year, I just had a full on mental breakdown while standing in the court. I just couldnt do anything. I couldnt move because of the fear that Ill get hit. The moment when I see something thrown towards me, my mind and body just does not want to work anymore. I literally cant move my feet and it took me a moment to realize that my hands were full of scratches because I kept on scratching them while watching the ball go back and forth and even above me. Tried to act like I was fine, called a sub and before I walked out the court, I immediately tried to catch my breath. My hands were so sore from the scratching and my body felt like it was going to turn to stone. It was like deja vu. This was the exact same thing that happened in 2017 and 2015.\n\nThen I cried while trying to catch some air, hooray. Everyone saw it and I dont know if I should explain myself to them or not because I know fears can be overcome, Im not trying to get grades from just sitting in a p.e. class because I have an excuse that icantplaybecauseimscareduwu,\n\nI dont know I just want to die lmao\n\nMy teacher saw me hiding in the bathroom and I felt like he didnt understand when I told him that \"I dont know how to react\" because he kept on telling me that I dont need to be perfect when I play. He thought I was disappointed in myself for not scoring. I mean, yes I am disappointed but the ((main disappointment)) for me is that I literally cant play because Im scared of getting hit which leads to disappointment for not scoring.\n\nI dont know if its good that I promised to do better to my p.e. teacher because I am sure that Im going to freak out again.",

I did have a girlfriend a couple years ago, but I have no friends to show for all of the years of grade/high school I went through. Only talk to one guy online who I was acquaintances with in high school, but it seems like he has gotten tired of talking to me after almost three years and has been doing the \"progressively becoming more distant\" thing.\n\n\nMy coworkers at this job are actually really nice, but I just can't break out of my shell. It reminds me of high school a lot, and it honestly makes me want to quit the job, but I know I can't. It's hard to explain. It's like I want to be myself and show that I do actually have a personality, a pretty unique/weird/fun one at that (according to people who have actually gotten to know me), but I'm so fucking sensitive to how people judge me that I physically won't let myself act like *myself*. I feel stuck in my head and like I can barely speak out in public most of the time, usually obsessively thinking about what might go wrong. I hate it, but I don't know how to stop it. It's like the fight or flight part of my brain shuts the thinking/personality part down when I'm in a public space, and I don't know how to stop it.\n\n\nI guess it stems from my only two \"best friends\" I've had throughout my life (haven't been friends with them for years) always holding the fact that they could easily stop being friends with me/replace me with another friend or make new friends over my head and trying to make me feel lesser or some shit. Unfortunately, it was true at the time, and I went along with it since, like I said, I don't exactly come off as exciting to people because my public personality is so blank. When it's one on one hanging out, people think I'm fun and interesting to talk to. In a public space? Forget about it.\n\n\nIdk, this probably doesn't even make any sense, tbh.

I\u2019ve been thinking about moving out for a few months now, but within the span of two weeks, I\u2019ve been from happily living with my parents to now living in a barren apartment waiting for my furniture to arrive.\n\nI\u2019ve always been perfectly content living with my parents. It just feels like home. But now, when I go to the apartment, it feels like some alien place. It\u2019s about 15 minutes from my parents\u2019 home, but it feels so far away. It doesn\u2019t feel like home, and it feels wrong. I lived at a house, in a nice neighborhood with a yard with a nice porch to an apartment surrounded by people I don\u2019t know. It just feels like a mistake in some ways.\n\nMy dad and I really like to watch movies and TV together. Sometimes while downstairs, I would just holler up: \u201cHey dad, wanna watch a movie?\u201d He would always say yes and we\u2019d watch stuff. I loved being able to do that. I\u2019ve always suffered from anxiety, and knowing if there was something bugging me, being able to just walk up stairs and talk to them about it was always very comforting. I always felt safe there. It just feels like a downgrade on our relationship and on an emotional level to now live across town.\n\nI\u2019ve always resented change in my life, but this feels like i\u2019ve been completely uprooted. It\u2019s been hard on my parents too, as they are empty nesters now. I just think I\u2019ve made a mistake. My mom says she thinks this will be good for me, but I sure don\u2019t feel good now. I just feel so alone without them in the same house as me. I always kind of liked when I knew that they were going out of town for the weekend. Maybe it\u2019s because I was still in familiar territory, or because I knew they were coming back. Now, I feel like I\u2019m all alone in the great wide world.

I had the flu for a week and I honestly had no interest to text or talk to people on Instagram/Snapchat so I kinda just sat in my bed for a while and watched YouTube. I looked back on how my interactions were on my phone and I realized that I've had no stress or emotional problems nearly as much as I uses to all because I wasn't so ambitious about doing things... because I literally couldn't.

When I was in high school I loved socializing and making friends, I didn't think in 5 years I would be a shut-in who can barely make it through 4 items at Walmart.\n\nIt all started when I had to move away from my home city, Chattanooga, where I had spent my entire life. I had to move because I'm not rich and while Chattanooga is amazing- it's obvious that the Scenic City doesn't care about it's broke inhabitants. I didn't move too far away, but he difference is huge now living in Fort Payne.\n\n\nIts been 5 years since I moved and I've met under 25 people, none of which I talk to literally EVER despite my efforts unless I see them in public. Is this normal? Because I have nothing to compare my life to. The people I work with are the same people I've known forever and we never talk either unless we have to.\n\n\nThe only place I know people ever frequent is Walmart ffs. I go there and just pray I don't start sweating, but sure as hell.. as soon as I see theres 70 cars there and half of them are women my age I contemplate getting on the highway and getting into a wreck JUST so I don't have to sweat if I make eye contact with one of them. It's like I feel nothing but eyes on me, judging me at all times. \n\nI've tried to psyche myself out of it, \"Maybe I'm just attractive.\" \"Am I walking funny?\" \"Is the back of my shirt dirty?\"\nBut all it does is get me more worked up where as when I'm home I WANT to talk to people and make friends but as soon as I see anyone my \"confidence\" acts like a turtle. \n\n\nIf I sound self-centered I promise you I'm not.. I'm a \"people pleaser\" and I always have been. Theres nothing more that I like other than making others smile/happy, and when I can't do it I view myself as lessor-than. I'm starting to believe that I'm just not made for this town, like I'm at a disadvantage now that I don't know anyone and nobody knows me.\n\nCan anyone help me get my mind straight?

It'll make sense when you read my account\n\nSo I perform a lot. More specifically, I sing. I'm a nervous wreck around people, but on stage, I can forget about most of my troubles. I don't really have stage fright at all. Apparently except on open mic nights in college. I was really excited to sing one of my favorite songs (Frank Ocean - Self Control, give it a listen), but there were a few problems. First, the audience was small. Like, 30, 40 people max. Everyone was really close, something I'm not used to. Then the first two singers came on. It's not like either of them were amazing, but everyone in the small audience knew who they were. People cheered when they heard their name. They weren't amazing singers but they had a confidence that was infectious. People roared when they were done. \n\nI get called up. No one claps when they were my name. I walk onstage in awkward silence, and then the music starts. My version of this song is pretty quiet, and I understand if people don't love it. I heard some people talking and they said \"OMG he's so nervous!\" and they were right. I was shaking. I never shake in front of an audience. There was also this part of the song where I don't sing and the awkward tension was fucking killing me. After the song, I get off stage, I barely get any claps. Fucking demoralizing. \n\nWhat I think happened was that I completely misread \"open mic night\" and didn't realize a bunch of people attended and already knew each other. I basically accidentally inserted myself into a group I had little relation with. I really pride myself in my ability to perform, and I really don't want my social anxiety to take that away too. \n\nSorry if this is jumbled, my hands are still shaking and I can barely contain my thoughts.

And every time im the centre of attention of feel awkward the feeling comes back and takes over... \n\nExample; \"I was in a elevator and two asian women who were laughing came, I instantly looked to the ground awkwardly and genuinely believed they were laughing at me\"\n\nAt the time.. im literally incapable of acting in any other way, By looking down at the ground im trying to deal with situation and not make my embarrassment obvious.\n\nHowever its clear logically that nobody is laughing or looking at me and its all in my head.\n\nSo now im stuck in the situation that i can barely look people i dont know or feel comfortable around in the eye.. i feel viably awkward... go red and i guess idk if others can notice this but i honestly cant go on much longer like this\n\nWhen im in a prolonged anxiety inducing situation i cant speak... i sweat profoundly, fidget and cant think straight at all.\n\nIf it last long enough i feel like i cant breath and i could even end up having a panic attack...\n\nFeelings like this can happen to me as doing something as tedious as (Waiting in line at a shop, meeting my girlfriends friends etc)Once i was at my \"girlfriends\" house and i really needed to go to the toilet ... but her foreign roommates where in the room between me and the bathroom so i waited for 2 hours until they went to bed rather than awkwardly walk out and everyone look at me\n\nI have left 3 schools (or i guess colleges) because i couldnt deal with having to sit in the class or talk to anyone.. i was terrified\n\nHonestly the feeling mates me want to die, it makes me feel severely depressed  and no amount of logic in these situations can make me feel okay\n\nHowever its strange.... if i feel safe with the person or in the situation im perfectly fine.... ive heard people say that anxiety is the \"*fight or flight*\" reflex but broken and it begins to make more sense....\n\nBut i guess i want to know if anyone else out there feels the same... if im just a crazy complicated human or is this normal?

        "original": "So, I\u2019m currently part of my college\u2019s band on a scholarship. I help them do live sound. Now after having done it for two months, I\u2019m having serious doubts about whether or not this is right for me.\n\nI got in the band thinking I\u2019d love it because I love music, but I feel like I\u2019m starting to hate this experience.\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s really fucking loud. I love music, but I listen to it at a reasonable volume, and if I go to concerts, I wear earplugs. The band director must clearly be somewhat deaf, because he has the volume at very uncomfortable levels. I haven\u2019t measured the dbs, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was 100+ Not to mention that a good portion of the band is brass, so those shreaks and squeals make me wish I was dead.\n\nSecondly, because it\u2019s so loud, I can\u2019t hear people talking. This is a nightmare for me. I can\u2019t connect and make friends with the other people if I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying half the time. This is also really bad because I have to be receptive to other people\u2019s instructions. And with my band, we have to be quick about solving problems and getting shit done in real time. I have already fucked up a handful of times, because I couldn\u2019t understand what they were telling me to do.\n\nThirdly, I\u2019m busy as hell. This program eats a lot of time out of my week. Now we\u2019re getting so busy that we\u2019re are doing performances out of town like 5 times a week (sometimes even on weekends when I want to be home studying/relaxing!). \n\nFourthly, I haven\u2019t had the \u201cwarmest\u201d reaction from my peers there. Personally, I really struggle socially. I have social anxiety, but want to make friends and change it. Lemme tell you, it\u2019s so hard watching all these people behave like such social butterflies, while I have to muster up the courage to talk, and when I do, it\u2019s oft awkward and sometimes comes out as verbal spaghetti. \n\nOne of my peers supervises me and the others on the crew, and he\u2019s a fucking moody asshole towards me. One day he\u2019s hot, and the other he\u2019s cold. I work really hard, and I have made a few really fucking stressful mistakes, and I guess he has no patience for me anymore even though I\u2019m a noob. A few times, he\u2019s accused me of a mistake I didn\u2019t make, so I\u2019m kind of his scapegoat for things going wrong it feels like. You have no idea how this makes me feel. No one appreciates my effort. I did really well the other day, and he was still being an asshole.\n\nAnother one of the guys around me is a fucking douchebag. He tries to lord over me sometimes and gets me to do his work for him (I noticed this because he asked me to do something for him, and he went and sat down with some of the other band members) He has this air to him that he thinks he\u2019s gods gift to earth. I can\u2019t stand having to be around such a fucking tool all the time now. He also got drunk one night and was making fun of my outfit and I couldn\u2019t defend myself because I\u2019m such a pacifist. He seems to get a lot of female attention too, and this just makes me bitter. I\u2019m trying to make myself available, but no girls seem to be into me. \n\nI also feel like such an alien compared to the rest of them. Most of them smoke/vape get drunk and have tattoos. I can\u2019t relate to them on this, not judging, but I don\u2019t feel cut from the same cloth. \n\nFifthly, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m as talented. Everyone else seems to be on another level musically. I play guitar and thought I was good, but everyone else knows so much more than I do about this stuff, and it makes me feel like a fucking idiot sometimes.\n\nI could keep writing and writing, but you get the idea. I\u2019m really questioning whether this is a good fit for me. I feel stuck, because I can\u2019t drop the scholarship, I need the money to pay for school. \n\nNext semester, I\u2019m thinking about being a tutor, I\u2019m really good at math, and I think that scholarship might suit me better.\n\n",

        "title": "Reading Aloud and Social Anxiety - I will read aloud for 30 days and report back",
        "original": "Hello All.  I am a man in his 30s (34) living with social anxiety.  I developed social anxiety rather gradually as I entered my 30s and spent more time alone, and developing my business.  When I was younger, I used to go out more often, and worked in a traditional office environment.  Because I worked in an office, I was forced to interact with people on a daily basis.  I believe that this kept my social anxiety at bay, because interacting with others was seemingly routine.  I started my own business in my late 20s.  My only employee is an assistant who works remotely.  I only communicate with my assistant via email, and I spend most of my day alone and behind a computer screen.  I have a significant other, but we both work a lot and see each other after work and on weekends.  About a year after starting my own business, I began to notice that I felt awkward and uncomfortable in face to face interactions.  I first started noticing this at the grocery store, or whenever I had to interact with store clerks.  As I crept forward in line I would dread the face to face interaction that I knew was coming.  I also began to talk less on the phone to friends and began to anxiously anticipate going out with friends.  I would ruminate over what we were going to discuss, and how I was going to be perceived.  This made my face to face conversations with friends awkward.  I even began to feel awkward with my significant other when we were face to face.  To put an emphasis on how bad things got at one point, I began to feel second hand social anxiety when watching movies were people were having a quiet face to face conversation.  \n\nThe worst part of my social anxiety began when I started to form a speech impediment.  For some reason, I began slurring my words and mispronouncing certain words.  This would get worse when on the phone, or when I was  particularly anxious.  Whenever I had the opportunity to think, before hand, about what I was going to say, I was sure to mess it up.  Because I am anxious, I began to look up diagnoses for slurring of speech.  What comes up is scary (i.e. MS, Parkinsons, etc.)  I don't have any of the other mentioned symptoms so I am just chalking the speech issue up to stress.  I also had a brain MRI for migraines about 6 months ago and reported the speech issues to my doctor.  She did not seem concerned.  Because of the speech issues, I began becoming nervous about people hearing my speech issues and thinking that I was drunk or on drugs.  This caused me further anxiety and began to drive me into isolation.\n\nFortunately, about 3 months ago, I began to actively work on my speech.  I found a few youtube videos on speech articulation and began to practice occasionally.  I've only practiced a few days at a time, but I found that through practice I was able to get slightly better with my pronunciation, and in turn lessen my anxiety around others.  I found my self speaking more clearly and quickly.  Because I know that I sound clearer, my mind is free to focus more on the  interaction rather than how I sound. \n\nI recently read that reading aloud is a good exercise for speed and articulation.  It also gets you comfortable hearing your voice and practicing speaking to others.  I haven't been able to find any information on whether reading aloud over a period of time can help with social anxiety, so I will have to find out for myself.  I plan to read out loud each day for at least 30 minutes for the next 30 days.  I will read magazine articles mostly, but I will switch up my genre of reading from time to time to include novels dialogue etc. \n\nOne thing that has kept me from feeling defeated by my social anxiety is my understanding that the mind has the ability to change.  You can change everything about your mind, including stubborn personality traits like social anxiety.  I am willing to do the work, and will report on my progress.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "original": "Hey, doing a few posts tonight. Seem to be a good idea just to get these worries off my chest. The internet seems to be a great place for open communication I should really use it more! I don't actively avoid social situations, and I can challenge myself to do a lot of different things, but I struggle to relate to people at work. Sure this is a very normal problem, but I'm not very charismatic around people. No matter what I seem to do, my confidence remains quite low around groups of people. I'm becoming a little more accepting of the fact that i'll never be the most confident person, but it's frustrating because I'm quite ambitious and I would like to do a lot for mental health. I have done an MSc in psychology, and have a lot of ideas but I assume constantly I'm below everyone and shouldn't be putting myself forward. I have before at times, but it's that constant feeling of guilt or of being a fraud. Additionally, because I have no conversational skills my interactions always feel forced. I'm trying to find things outside work to do to bring my confidence up. I've done some open mic nights. One went well the other two quite badly. I wanted to vent some frustration because I wonder whether there is some light at the end of this tunnel, it feel like a constant slog to change any of these feelings, and actually trying to change them and force things seems to make things worse, and make you act less like yourself. I probably need to read some positive inspirational stories or about people who have found ways to work around these anxieties. Everything is fine but i'm constantly prone to shame, inferiority not really feeling like a man. Underdevelop child like syndrome. Anyway rant over, I probably should be looking at evidence based solutions for social anxiety as opposed to getting too caught up in complaining, but it's nice to know I'm not alone that other people are going through it. \n\nFor anybody reading this I wish you the best. It's bloody frustrating to feel self-conscious and ashamed of yourself all the time, but there is so much more to you than shame and humiliation. Behind that there is somebody capable of being funny, of being confident, of being interesting. Keep trying things, and always be kind to yourself.

It is impossible for me to connect with people outside my family because my self-confidence is extremly low. I always walk home from university with bad feelings and regrets and I cannot converse with people on parties. It is sad because I know I can socialise. My family are the only people in this world that I have a connection to, they are the reason why I live. I also have a friend that I have known for a pretty long time, but other than that I have nothing. People have always ignored me at school, well, some have tried to talk to me but I glare at them with this deep monotone voice and the conversation ends pretty quickly. Yes, that's right, my voice changes when I speak with people outside my family, my siblings have told me that I sound like a robot. You also gotta know that I am a very good-looking guy, I mean, all hot girls in school basically chased me and tried to speak with me, one even told me that she wanted to fuck me at a party. Now at university I fell in love with a girl I read the same course with. She was highly interested in me and I did something I would consider the most ball-shit thing I've ever done; ask her out. She said yes and we met, but she moved on after the date, not strangely because of my social anxiety. She said she wanted to be my friend but no more. Now I am here asking myself what the fuck I am doing with my life. I am in my 20s and should be in one of the most exciting years of my life, but I feel like I am in a 90 year old's body. Everybody ignores me, people find me awkward, school has gone bad because I cannot focus because of my regrets. I am not dumb, I had one of the best grades in my class at high school, but now at university I have failed miserably. My social anxiety didn't bother me when growing up because I had my family to socialise with. Now I live alone in an appartment with no one else but myself to talk with. I've realised that my lack of socialisation is driving me into a depression, I've realised how important socialising is now when I cannot speak with my family. I believe I need professional help in order to live the life I want. So what should I do, I really want to have friends in my life but I cannot get them. Is it worth speaking with a psychologist?

I'm a 24 year old gay guy from Bulgaria who's always been very nervous and shy in social situations. Part of it I think has been my bad time at school together with not very good experience with friends there, and growing up generally in a very homophobic environment, having to hide my sexuality the whole time. So the result is that I have very difficult time making friends and am very socially anxious. I'm planning on seeking therapy as soon as possible. \n\nAnyway, today I was walking alone around town where I live (Sofia) and while I was waiting to cross a street I noticed a nice looking guy who was also waiting. I looked at him for a bit longer and he looked back. Then we crossed and I managed to throw him a look which I thought came out pretty weird and long and then kept walking, and after a while suddenly realised he was walking next to me. My anxiety really kicked in then. I know most people would get slightly nervous and tingly in that kind of situation but I guess people here would know that the anxiety is different because it paralizes you. So we walked some more, then stood for a while next to a building sort of looking at our phones but looking at each other from time to time and after a while he started walking back. I did as well and he saw me and even stopped for a while but then got away and eventually I lost him. Throughout the whole time I sort of imagined that I might go and say hi at any moment but never managed, despite really, really wanting to. I kept thinking \"what if you're imagining this whole thing\" but since it was actually pretty obvious it was more \"what if you go and have nothing to say to him, what if he thinks you're boring as hell or the whole thing just crashes in very elaborate ways which will leave you scarred for life\" and even stupid stuff like \"you already told your sister you'll meet, how will you tell her you can't\" as if I couldn't just call her, but they were enough to make me even more anxious.\n\nThose things never fucking happen to me, which was why I felt so sad and angry for not doing anything about it. Most of the time I'm in school, studying, and fter that I go home (I live with my dad and sister), watch some youtube and go to bed. So yeah, not in a position to miss chances like that.

But this was always quickly overshadowed by physical and verbal abuse usually by my (I hesitate to say) dad.  \n\nTo my Aunty: remember that time you found me hiding in the backyard, drunk out of my mind, crying and cutting myself? I wouldn't be surprised if you'd forgotten; you never mentioned it once. Nor did you ever ask me if I was OK. \nYou greeted me now with a false smile on your face. You didn't let slip another word. You know I've finished uni and I don't have a job so there's nothing really else to say, is there? But you're very good at upholding the pretence of intimacy. We're family, after all. \n\nAnd my uncle: remember when my mum found out I was planning to take mushrooms? We had a tedious chat wherein you tried to edify me and set me straight. You were only doing a favour for my mum so I don't blame you for not wanting to be there or not knowing what to say. I told you how uncomfortable I was with my life and you dodged. \nAnd just now you didn't fake a smile-and I appreciate that-but in your facial expressions I saw fear. We fear that which we don't understand. \n\nBut at least you did what you could. You made some kind of sincere attempt at conversation and I respect that. For my Aunty I have nothing but resentment-for all her cowardice insultingly disguised as ignorance. What we don't see can't hurt us. \nAnd yet she acts as if she's fair and even magnanimous-offering me petty jobs in her yard for an hour at a time once every few months. She thinks $50 for an hour's work is generous too but really it's nothing to her and she's only doing it out of pity and some false sense of closeness implied by our being family. \n\nNow I'm an adult. A strewn and broken one. I'm selfish because all I think about is myself. I'll be even more selfish if I commit suicide. All my failures are overlooked... no, worse than that-they're tacitly acknowledged (even with some level of malicious humour) but it's dismissed as 'well what can you do?' and magically nobody is held accountable for their negligence. My accomplishments are met with faded enthusiasm and 'Oh really?'s \n\nAll in all it's very clear that all some people care about is themselves and they have no problem being negligent, cruel and heartless so long as they can tell themselves they aren't responsible. \n\nI know I don't matter. Really. The entire Earth is insignificant in the picture of the cosmos. It just hurts when others can't even pretend for your sake, but you're expected to validate them at every turn. \n\nSadly I'm an adult now so I'm digging up old trash here. Maybe I'm looking for someone to blame for my despondency. All I know is some broken things can't be fixed-or if they can it's too expensive and you may as well get a whole new one. I'm sure one of these things. If anyone reads this you should know I (believe I) don't want sympathy (then why am I posting it publicly?) What I'm looking for is very unclear to me. \n\nThe only certain thing I want is death and that is an unpredictable, spontaneous thing that may take a while. Also I'm only saying all this because of my mood. It's very insincere and misleading, I think. Once I take a drug, once I jump into the waves at the beach, once I start eating a nice meal-all of this misery will evaporate and another more comfortable mood will resume once more.

Have you overcame in anyway?\n\nI've struggled with anxiety and being afraid all of my life. Always been too afraid of what other people will think of me. Because of this I've escaped from the world and people with books and movies. I've never really had very many friends. I've had 4-5 very close friends but since graduating High School and moving 1000 miles away I've only had one and we have grown very distant over the last 2 years. \n\nI've realized that isolating is not good for my health or well being and want to make friends, yet I continue to isolate myself away from people even when I'm in public places. When I do talk with people, I find that because I do not have very many life experiences it's hard to relate to people and keep a conversation going. As a 28 male, most (yes I'm generalizing here) guys seem to talk about sports, girls, video games, movies, working out, etc and their life experiences. I don't watch or play sports. I love video games but haven't played in over 7 years because it was an addiction. I've mostly stopped watching tv shows and movies because it was also an addiction. I've dated/had sex with one girl since I graduated HS. I also don't drink anymore either because I was an alcoholic. \n\nI frequent a coffee shop/bar that has a \"quiet room\" to study for school and work on other things. Outside of that I stay at home apart from work and school. It's easier to talk to people at work but I wouldn't really say that any of them are friends. \n\nI tend to way over think everything which basically leads to the anxiety. Usually it's that I don't want to seem weird. I mean I am weird, like I do things that I feel others don't do, but from my experience people shy away from \"weird\" people unless they are there out of pity. \n\nHave any of you had a similar situation/life and overcame it in some ways? I yearn for companionship more than anything but at the same time I'm terrified of it. I don't know what to do about it. I've been in this isolating cycle for a really long time and it seems to have only gotten worse the more that time goes by. I now isolate even from my family. I don't want to be like this anymore. It's very lonely and I feel like if I stay like this for years to come I may actually go crazy. I have dreams of having a family one day but if I remain this way I don't see it happening and that depresses me tremendously. I'm already 28 and if I don't do something soon I will never have one most likely.",

I don\u2019t work because it\u2019s hard to find a job to accept me since I don\u2019t have any experience. I go to a community college where there are rarely any activities that would help me interact with other people plus there are barely any people in general that are interested in any interaction .  I was hoping I would\u2019ve been able to get into a university and by dorming there i\u2019d sort of be forced to interact with people and eventually get over my anxiety but that didn\u2019t happen because I couldn\u2019t afford college lol. For the most part I\u2019ve kind of shut myself off from my own friends so i\u2019ve just been dealing with this loneliness by myself. But it\u2019s not that I did it on purpose I just never really had a close relationship with them but that\u2019s because I never learned how to open myself up to them. I just never learned how to interact properly with another human being (lmao) . It\u2019s so bad that I can\u2019t even interact normally with my own siblings and cousins which I know is weird because they\u2019re my own family... I don\u2019t know why I find it so hard to form an actual conversation with them without being awkward  or tense. It\u2019s weirder how I feel more anxious when I\u2019m with my family because every time I leave a family gather I either feel great relief or like shit because i\u2019m thinking i might have made a fool of myself. I never really knew why I was like this but I just can\u2019t help it I have heard so many times that it\u2019s just all in my head(which I know is true) but I can\u2019t stop the feeling of being anxious around people and feeling like they\u2019re judging me.  It sucks how my friendships with people never evolve because I don\u2019t know how to get out if my shell. My two best friends are probably the only two people I feel most comfortable around but there are times when I hang out with just one of them and there\u2019s that awkward silence..which is my fault because I never what to say or how to lead a conversation. I hate the impression I leave to people when they meet me I hate how no matter how many times I tell myself that I\u2019m gonna change nothing happens I still feel the anxiety when I\u2019m around people. I hate that I can\u2019t properly hold a conversation. It bothers so much that this is going  to affect my future, I don\u2019t know how I will hold a job if I can\u2019t even interact with people. But at the same time I rarely worry about the future because at this point the thought of suicide has been circulating my head for a while, if I do go through that route most of my friends and family members won\u2019t be affected because we\u2019ve never had a close bond and I won\u2019t have to be a burden to anyone anymore. I probably sound dramatic I know but I guess also have my parents in mind, probably the only two people who do care about me, as long as they\u2019re alive I\u2019ll hold off on that idea for a while because I can\u2019t do something like to them. I guess I just need some advice? Or tips? Or if anyone can relate? Because right now I feel like i\u2019m probably the only one with this weird issue where I cant even communicate with ANY human beings including their own family members... yes i have strange issues lol.\n ",

I have friends that are gay and they are great people.\n\n I just got back from a night of clubbing and my story is about tonight.\nI can really enjoy a night of clubbing, met some new people and danced like there was no tomorrow. I couldn\u2019t help but notice tho, that a lot of guys came really close. At the end of the night a guy that was standing behind me even pinched my arm and was like feeling my skin sortoff. We didn\u2019t speak before and he was drunk as fuck. There was a girl near me watching and we looked at each other like wott??*\n\nI started panicking and started expanding my me bubble in front and behind me being parra when someone that wasnt a girl was dancing too close behind me. i hate to say this but i kinda started throwing stinky eyes around altho I reminded myself I didn\u2019t wanna look like a killjoy. Its not the first time this has happened too. I really dont want to become a homophobe but it seems my anxiety in clubs triggers fear of men. It all started when a girl on tinder asked me what I thought of the date and she answered with: I think u should have a think about ur sexual orientation when I said i had a pretty good time. Im pretty sure im 100%  straight. \n\nI like girls a lot but have have my fair share of troubles keeping them interested. Most \u201crelationships\u201d ive had ended in the girl breaking it of after 1-2 weeks. I don\u2019t think im ugly but i hate my awkward side. Once i have the attention of a girl i know the right things to do to draw her closer but at talking distance things start to go downhill.

        "original": " \n\nSo, I'm incredibly frustrated at my lack of social skills, or social anxiety, or both, or whatever it is that is holding me back. I'm 24, have pretty much only one friend that I see with any sort of regularity, and have never had sex or been in a relationship. For many years I have been shy, sometimes due to anxiety, but more recently because of this 'not knowing what to say' that just comes over me. I want to have a social circle, a relationship, and in general 'be better socially', or just be 'normal' in terms of socialising but have no idea how to do this.\n\nSome brief context. Throughout school up to my early-mid teens I wasn't exactly socially anxious or shy, what I would do though is have no gauge of what was or wasn't appropriate, and so would occasionally make a fool of myself by making sexual jokes, or just act like an idiot in general, perhaps trying to compensate for a lack of belief in myself and a need to 'big myself up'. Eventually I caught on that this didn't win friends and made me a laughing stock, so I kept quiet rather than risk being perceived negatively. To this day I have 'repressed extrovert' tendencies, notably whenever I drink this repressed personality comes out and I become loud and 'silly', not even needing to be very drunk to cause this, compared to other people who I've known who may be extremely drunk but whose personalities more or less stay the same. So I'm aware I have a filter that is too risk-averse when it comes to social interaction due to past experiences.\n\nIn the past my problem was definitely social anxiety. I would be afraid to talk to people because of the above, which led to a lack of friends and relationships for the opposite reason of being weird and acting foolish, rather I just kept my head down and went about unnoticed. Of course while this has kept me out of trouble, it has denied me other opportunities, and has time goes on the lack of actual experience of going out and being social has just reinforced the problem, catch-22. More recently with the small amount of experience I've had I would say I have 'grown out' of the social anxiety factor to a large degree (in the sense of adrenaline etc) the problem is more so not knowing what to say; wanting and being ready to connect with those around me but just not knowing how to proceed, probably due to a lack of experience. What is as natural as breathing to most other people because they have been immersed in it for their entire lives is just incomprehensible to me. I try to 'study' other people, particularly those at my place of work, to emulate how they start and continue conversations and build relationships, but in such cases they have often already built a solid rapport with each other.\n\nIt's not as though I don't have conversations or make small talk, I often do, it's just that the instances of being quiet and shy seem to outnumber the moments of 'social fluency', although they have slowly become more common over the years. For every instance of finding myself able to chat to a coworker or acquaintance, able to joke, feel a connection, these are outnumbered instances of awkward silence, as well as the ongoing 'end result' of having no friends and not being in a relationship, which is what all of this is a means toward. My social skills and confidence could be worse, as they were in years past, but at the end of the day when comparing myself to other people, I am far more quiet, don't have friends, and haven't got a girlfriend.\n\nWithin the past year or so, I've got annoyed at myself for letting this aspect of my life fall to pieces, so resolved to turn it around, setting for myself the goal of one day having a large circle of casual friends and a small circle of close friends within that, and of having romantic relationships. To try and get better I started working out and running to increase self esteem, joined various clubs to I would be around people more, and meditated to try and improve my mental state generally. Again, year on year I seem to be improving, but the pace is extremely slow and I'm still frustrated.\n\nThis relative quietness compared to other people is pretty much the main factor that I can see that contributes to not having friends or a girlfriend. And when I do talk there seems to be this underlying tension, this reluctance 'to let go'. I know I need to lower my filter of subject matter, banal conversation is ok etc, but still this doesn't help me to be able to come up with anything to say to connect with people when I find myself in a situation when I'm awkwardly silent.\n\nI've been reading various books about social skills and social anxiety, and so far the key takeaways are: 1. Just talk to people, push through the discomfort 2. Don't have such a high filter for what comes out of your mouth 3. Have warm intentions towards other people 4. Go out so you meet more people 5. Work on your self esteem and mental health generally... and yeah it's helped a little bit, but I'm not THERE yet. It doesn't help that a lot of advice out there is catered specifically for the context of trying to pick up women in clubs and bars but what I'm after is far more general and basic, and is something a lot of these people/programmes/books seem to just assume you already 'have'. Picking up random strangers seems levels above what I'm after. I just want to have friends, just to start off with a basic foundation of social skills/fluency that most people around me seemingly take for granted. What is it that other people know that I missed out on?\n\nAlthough I've been getting better, it's been at a glacial pace. When I compare my social confidence/competence to years ago there is a clear improvement. But when it comes to my overall objectives, having a social circle and being in a relationship, nothing has changed. If I were 18 or whatever I probably wouldn't make such a big deal about it, I'd probably think I've got plenty of time to play catch-up, but at 24 there's this urgency, I want to turn my life around completely, and fast, and this slow pace can't continue if it leaves me in more or less the same position in my 30s.\n\nFor people who think 'well there's nothing wrong with being an introvert', ok fine, but aren't I too much of introvert if at the end of the day I don't have friends or a girlfriend? Or am I barking up the wrong tree, is 'being quiet' even the problem I should be focused on?\n\nDo I just stick with the slow pace with the expectation that I will improve exponentially as each win leads to more experience which increases the frequency of future wins and so on? Or do you have any advice as to how I can get better at socialising fast? Or at all?\n\nSorry if this post is all a bit of a mess, I wrote it all in one go and can't be bother 'redrafting' it, and thank you if you read all of this.",

I've worked multiple jobs in the past but it's the same every time- just constantly being uncomfortable, sweating through all my clothes, stuttering, and my hands and legs shake so much it makes a lot of jobs very difficult.\n\nI've gone to multiple doctors and been prescribed so many medications I couldn't possibly list or remember them all.

I've gone to 3 separate therapists and they only seem to force me into a deep depression. In the past I've self medicated with xanax and other benzos, but I have an addictive and abusive personality with substances so I've forced myself off them.

It all starts when i was a kid (10-12yo i think). Wasn't a good eater since i was born but at this time i didn't want to eat so my parents sent me to  a psychologist. I really don't know the reason why i didn't eat. It wasn't because i feel fat or something like this. I think it hast something to do with the strict education from my father (\"you have to eat what is on your plate and you arent allowed the leave the place until you eat it\" and stuff like this). After 2 years my eating disorder disappeared. I didn't eat well especially when i was around strangers but it wasn't this bad.\n\nBut the last years (im 26 now and it started again when i was 21/22) it started to appear again but more in a social anxiety way. My baddest fear is to eat at strangers houses or in restaurants with strangers. And in this situation strangers are  people who aren't my parents or my best friend or friends from the university. \n\nIf i have an invitation from work colleagues in a restaurant or at their home i think about it the days before and really often im searching and finding an excuse so i don't have to go to the restaurant or their homes. I think the biggest problem is that i am afraid of the fear (i really don't know if this is the right way to describe it in english - it is like to be afraid of being afraid). So i am afraid before i am in the situation because i know that there is the possibility that i am to afraid to eat. And because this fear is like a self-fulfilling  prophecy. In some restaurants my \"trick\" is to eat salad. I dont know why but salad works everytime but in some situation you cant just eat salad (e.g. if you are invited to eat at people homes).\n\nNow my university master degree in Management and Marketing is coming close which means in the future will be a lot more situations where i have to eat with strangers in public places (like business lunch oder dinner with colleagues or customers) and furthermore i  have a new  girlfriend and the time will come where i have to meet  her parents (and most of the time it goes hand in hand with a dinner invitation)\n\nSo i think now is the time to fight my anxiety if i want to live a happy social and a successful professional life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf there is anyone with some advices who maybe suffered the  same way like me i would be very happy.\n\nThanks in advance \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "original": "M/22\nSo where do I begin, I was the odd one out since first grade because my skin color is a bit tanned and racism was okay for other kids I guess. I did not have the social skills other kids had because my parents did not send me to preschool, instead I was thought the bad impulsive and destructive behaviors of my parents which caused me to be a tantrum throwing kid who always felt entitled to what he wanted. \n\nWhen my parents started to notice the type of kid I have become they did a full 180 and tried to teach me to \u201cbe like other kids\u201d. That did not turn out well since by age 10 I was stealing, lying and manipulating others. By the age of 12 I found what I was looking for, weed.. or I would rather call it an escape from reality. I threw away every old friend and relationship I had and constantly hung out with new friends that I smoked weed and occasionally other drugs with all day everyday for the next 4 years.\n\nHigh school was rough for me, not many people liked or respected me. I was known as the junkie who would never show up for class. My parents would force me to go to school and at one point would drive me to the gate of the school because I was skipping so much. That didn\u2019t work since I would walk through the gate and as soon as they left I\u2019d do a 180 and walk straight back out. I couldn\u2019t go home most of the time since my mom was home so I would walk around by myself for hours smoking cigarettes until I could finally go home. I missed 60 percent of my last year of school and did crap in the final exams.\n\nMy social anxiety was manageable other than in school. Until one certain traumatic event that changed my life. I was pretty experienced with drugs, I have done ecstasy and LSD multiple times without problem. I was at my best friends brothers party, there was a lot of people but as far as I know I only had generalized anxiety rather than SA. We decided to do cocaine that night for the first time and while it was very fun at first, I went into my very first episode. I was told it\u2019s called \u201cthe freeze response\u201d. Basically I went into an internal monologue were I thought about all the fucked up shit in my life and how I am so guilty and deserve everything that has happened to me. Sounds simple but it went on for hours and thought everything negative about myself that I could imagine. During those hours I was literally sitting there not able to speak or move. Fight or flight? I didn\u2019t have either option so I chose the third and that was to hide.. but in plain sight. Everybody was looking at me the whole time and talking about me and I couldn\u2019t react one single bit. I heard words like \u201che lost it\u201d, \u201cthat kid is not normal\u201d, \u201che must have serious mental issues\u201d and \u201cyou have to stop hanging out with him he is a fucked up type of person\u201d. These guys were aged from 20 onwards and I was only 17. All I could think about after was that everyone finally knows how fucked up of a person I am.\n\nFast forward 5 years later to now, I am doing the same thing I have been doing ever since that night, which is just sitting at home and playing video games or watching Netflix. I don\u2019t go out other than work a few days a week where I am usually anxious and never feel in the moment. \nBut hey at least I am not abusing drugs anymore, I\u2019m using less harmful but still harmful ways to keep myself from a full blown depression.\n\nI\u2019m told to forgive myself for my past, that it wasn\u2019t my fault for how I was brought up. But the thought of forgiving myself makes me feel more guilty like I can just use an excuse for my wrongs in life. I want to go out and explore the world but how can I do that when I can\u2019t even speak without stuttering or walking straight or not constantly thinking about how others judge me, when it\u2019s me doing all the judging. How can I ever go out to a group of people or party again without thinking about that night.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, this has turned into a rant but in all honesty I just wanted to get some thoughts out. I hope you all have a wonderful day or night and stay safe,\nPeace.",

I never had any real friends, never had a girlfriend and deep down I want one. I been feeling so lonely the past week or so and just laying in bed on reddit & back on online dating sites when I'm home not busy doing projects, sometimes losing sleep over how lonely I am. And I know you don't need people to feel happy but still.\n\nIt's Spring Break now so I been feeling a bit worse. To me, it's like a seasonal thing where I feel worse like this. I guess this is the time for it? lol.\n\nI wish I had some friends to hang out with, but I really just wish I had a girlfriend to share experiences with and to love and hug. That'll probably never happen. I get frustrated sad deep down when I'm on the bus, at school, or out at the store, and I see cute looking girls all around and couples happy, hugging and holding hands, knowing I could never have one of those beautiful girls because I'm probably an ugly guy, awkward wreck that nobody wants. I have been on a date once 2 years ago that didn't go too well and I was catfished anyway, plus I had a 6 month Online female friend that rejected me kindly saying that she wanted me to wait, but then ghosted me after I became severely insecure and maybe stalkerish to her. It's been over a year since that and I'm feeling lonely again.\n\nI always struggled with anxiety since I was about 8 or 9 when my family (parents, brother, sister) and I moved to a different state. Because of that, I found it hard to make & maintain friends, I do not talk much (to prove that, I was even voted most shy in high school), I developed anger issues and can come across a bit rude to others (for example, when I'd receive even just a hello from a classmate, I would pretend I didn't hear them). I tend to push people away and am never really approached.\n\nI just overall became very socially awkward. I'm also always stuck in the past. It doesn't help that my (very limited) interests are weird and nerdy, I love retro gaming, computers and even fascinated by public transportation vehicles, buses and subways from where I lived as a kid. Plus other things that make me feel like I can't relate to people and I'm scared of sharing my interests anyway in fear that nobody will like me. I always had difficulty coming out of my shell and broadening my horizons. I am in a school club but don't attend much anymore due to moving far. I use social media a very little bit only when I need it. But I do make youtube videos on my channel often so I guess that counts? I can pm you my channel if you really want to see how \"ugly\" I really look?\n\nI mostly stay home if I dont have to go out, mainly because i have a minor disability that prevents me from driving. It also doesn't help that I'm too nervous to get a real job due to fear of being fired for lack of communication or something. I live off financial aid and flipping electronics on craigslist right now. Of course that can't go on too long especially after finishing school. Then I feel like I wont be hired anywhere due to not having any previous \"real\" work experience.\n\nIt's annoying and I could go on.

I\u2019ve been shy all my life. But that doesn\u2019t mean you need to announce to everyone that I\u2019m quiet. Why is it quiet people are thought of as so strange, yet people who never shut up are funny and outgoing? \n\nThis past week we had an all day staff meeting followed by awards for people celebrating 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 years at the company. You get brought up to the front of the room in front of about 100 people and the person talking has asked for input from other coworkers so they kind of roast you. Well I went up for mine and, of course, the person doing mine just had to say \u201cShe\u2019s quiet so many people may not know much about her\u201d. I wanted to strangle him for saying that! I\u2019m 47 years old and do good work for the company and have other aspects you could have brought up but you just had to reaffirm to everyone just how quiet I am. There are some people here who talk nonstop and you can\u2019t get a word in edgewise, but they don\u2019t say \u201cWell this person is known as a very chatty and gossipy person\u201d. Why is it only shyness needs to be brought up to others attention?\n\nI have had report cards since kindergarten saying just how quiet I was in class and didn\u2019t volunteer easily. Every year I would dread the report cards, not because of bad grades, but because I just knew there was going to be a note on there about my shyness. That continued right through high school. I\u2019m not sure my parents cared I was quiet because they were fairly quiet as well, but it was such a stigma to have that on there.\n\nTo the others out there who are shy, is being called out on your shyness one of your pet peeves?

I wanna let everybody know that I have not scolled at all on the posts of this sub (I wanted to post on confessions, ask Reddit, etc, but I didn't think it would quite fit (big channels, people thinking ur a karma whore, etc) and just searched keywords and found this sub). So I'm going out on a limb here by just throwing this out there. Also, I was the fat kid growing up (I'll bring that point back later in the story). I have really bad social anxiety, but only with complete strangers (not with coworkers, friends, etc.) I went out to the bar after work. I get done at 10:30pm (not a lot of time to drink, mingle, and go home with last call @ 1am), which is fine with me, but all my friends from school/growing up (I'm 29) live in different cities, so I'm outta my element socially. I was sitting at the bar just sipping my beer, and a guy that I sort of remember from high school (a grade ahead of me) invited me to shoot some pool with him and six of his friends (group of males and females). I was definitely surprised as I know that I never talked to him, and I just gave him the ol' \"thanks man, I might come over in a bit\" line. I was very flattered/excited that I got such an invite out of the blue, but the thought of having to make new connections with six other strangers scared the shit out of me (the idea of making small talk terrifies me). So, I stayed in my seat and continued to drink my beer (arguing with myself in my head the whole time about why it was good for me to take the invite and meet some new people, blah blah blah). About twenty minutes go by and this chick and her friend sit next to me at the bar, and the one chick I know from my day job at a gas station, (she comes in to our deli a couple times a week and gets a sub sandwich on her lunch break), and she says \"Hey you! What are you doing here?\" (I picked up a slight flirty tone). Again, I'm flattered by her acknowledgement, and I give her the ol' \"just getting a beer\" line. From the corner of my eye, she kept glancing at me and it seemed like she wanted the conversation to keep going (I'm married, so it would strictly be from a casual conversation angle). Her and her friend left the bar to throw some darts, and that point I realised that everyone in the bar (roughly thirty people), were interacting with one another, and I was the only one being a loner. At that moment I became extremely self conscious and panicky, so I chugged my beer and got the hell outta there. I just wanna add, and I'm trying not to sound conceded to any degree, that I'm not a terrible looking guy (tall, natural muscular build, healthy weight, my awesome wife reminds me of my positive attributes quite often), but I was the fat kid growing up, and I think that mindset from my early years has seriously fucked my current perception of myself.

This is my third year in uni, 2nd in my current study programme (I quit my first study on a different uni). I haven't really made any real friendships/connections from uni, although I often work with one person I can get along with very well. Outside of studying we don't really do anything outside of uni.In the first year at the other uni, I didn't have any friends except my cousin with whom I often play games via Discord and formerly Teamspeak.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I didn't have any friends. I tried to connect with other people, but I was too anxious. The 6 years I was in high school was definitely the worst time of my life. Especially in the lunch breaks I felt horrible, I often went home on my bicycle, even though it took up a large part of the break time. I did this because I did't know where to sit (our school was horribly crowded in the breaks, there weren't even enough tables). I also feared sitting with my classmates, this fear grew stronger in the later years.\n\nBack to my cousin, he plays an important role in my current social life. He was in a different high school, and I was 2 years ahead of him. Around 2014-15 we started gaming via Teamspeak, which was a big relief for me, as I didn't have any other way to socialize with people. After a while, a few classmates of his also joined, and ever since we still talk via Discord all the time. Currently it's my cousin, my brother (he was 2 grades lower at my high school, I will explain his role in the story below) and two friends of my cousin (classmates) which are in Discord all the time, and we are basically friends.\n\nWhen I quit my first year on uni halfway through, I started working at a supermarket for a while before starting my next study. While working there, I saw my cousin's classmates for the first time, which was a bit awkward, but nothing too bad. It was nice seeing them irl for the first time.\n\nNow my brother. He is 1 year younger than me, and was 2 grades below me. He did have some friends, but one best friend which he still is. Since around 2016, when I was in my last year, he went to the disco/club (not sure what to call it, it's basically an empty hall packed with people where dance/big room house is played by a DJ) with my cousin and some other friends, and he quickly made friends with those people (including the Teamspeak/Discord group). I forgot the order in which the connections grew, but it's not that important.\n\nBack to today, what it comes down to is that my brother, his friend, and the friend group of my cousin (and kinda me, limited to Discord) became one big friend group. For like 2 years now, they go the the club almost every Saturday or Friday night. And I? I never went to a club even once. I'm too socially anxious. In the beginning I was not interested in night-life, however, after a while I regret never going. It would have been a great way to get to know the friend group better.I feel like I'm too late at this point in time. Every time they go out, they send video's and pictures on our Snapchat group chat, and it makes me feel sick in the stomach to see them having fun, while I'm at home doing nothing. Aside from going to the club, they do a lot more fun things together like going on a vacation to Spain, and this year to Albufeira, or going to birthday parties or other random parties from people I don't even know. I feel horrible to be disconnected from those events, and the fact that they have many more friends than me. The problem I have is that I don't how to get involved in those social activities. I'm extremely anxious to go to the club with them, especially because they have done it a myriad of times, while I have never been to the club. A few times my cousin has asked me to join, but I said no because I was too anxious. I instantly regret it, but didn't do anything about it. After all this time I fear to go with them, I don't how to behave at the club, and them having all this 'experience' makes it even worse.The fact that my brother is involved in all these social events makes it extra hard for me, it makes me feel like an outcast. I've always portrayed myself to my brother as someone who doesn't like parties and that kind of stuff. I feel like I need to break this image of myself from my brother and my cousin. I feel like it would've been a lot easier if my brother wasn't involved in this group of friends.\n\nI would greatly appreciate if someone can help me break the status quo and get more connected with my friends. The greatest fear that I need to break is going to the club with them, which feels like a massive threshold.Maybe someone has been through something similar, and can share his or her experience.",

I don\u2019t have friends, not even loved ones. \n\nI used to be really popular in early high school as I was always happy. I\u2019d never get angry even though my day sucked. I used to play soccer and basketball for the school. Teammates are really supportive and friendly. I enjoyed my time being in the team. Also I loved volunteering and helping people in need such as charity walk, donating blood, food bank,etc.. I also served as a Scout for a really long time. People really liked me and I liked people.\n\nBut when I was 17, I moved to a big city and continued to complete my high school diploma. That\u2019s where the nightmare began.\n\nI got in a school that nobody really liked me. Even though I\u2019d been initiating conversation and I just felt like they were avoiding me. It\u2019s completely different to compare with the previous school. Classmates stared at me when I completed a presentation, while they applauded for the others. Nobody willing to talk to me even though we got similar interests. Some kept gossiping about me (And the sad thing is they seemed nice to me). Teachers and the school didn\u2019t really offer much help even though I seek for help. I started to hate going to school and making friends. People aren\u2019t as beautiful as you thought. I feel like I can\u2019t really fully trust anyone anymore. I can\u2019t tell anyone about this because I don\u2019t want anyone to know how broken I am. I literally cried everyday when I got back to home because I don\u2019t want to show people that I\u2019m weak. But the fact is, I\u2019m weak.\n\nBut fortunately I quit my school few months ago. I got a tutor that can offer me official credits and it\u2019s like a 1 on 1 tuition. I\u2019m working towards to become an engineer. I still don\u2019t have friends but actually it can be a good thing - no gossip and I don\u2019t have see much people so I\u2019ll just pretend people aren\u2019t avoiding me. So that I can focus on my academic and get into a university. I heard that university is way better than high school - better environment, perhaps better people.\n\nBut to be honest I can\u2019t really trust people anymore. I\u2019m always afraid of meeting new people. At this period of time I still cry sometimes when I feel lonely (it can\u2019t be held, but it usually occurs at home because I just can\u2019t forget how broken I was, wish I can forget everything happened in the school). But secretly, in washroom or bedroom. And I\u2019ll feel way better after crying a bit. Keep working and working so that I can get into university.\n\nSometimes I really feel like I\u2019m mentally sick. But I DON\u2019T want to be treated as a patient, or a problem. I just want to be treated as a normal individual. I want to have companies. Being loved by somebody is so warming. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I typed so many. I know this is like some sort of shitpost because some people would think that I haven\u2019t been working hard enough and looking for excuse. Well I\u2019m so sorry about that and I\u2019m working so hard in order to become an engineer recently, I can assure you that I WILL get an engineering degree eventually.

        "original": "Social anxiety is an awful mental health disorder. Having suffered from it since I was 15, I understand how debilitating it can be to just go outside and how the fear before just doing the simplest of tasks can make you feel. \n\nI am making this post because, although I know this subreddit tends to be mainly memes and jokes, and I love it for that, we do all share one common thing - we all suffer/have suffered* from social anxiety. And for many, this post will be useless, but when I first subscribed to this subreddit, I\u2019d never done anything significant to truly address and deal with my mental health. I had a feeling of hopelessness that I no longer have, and if I could go back in time and give these words to myself, I would. If this post can help just one person, then I\u2019ll be happy!\n\nBut right, in the last year, I met a girl. I struggle with going to University, but I need a future. She made me NEED to get better, and I wish I had the self control to make MYSELF force myself to take steps in getting better. I know for a fact there is someone reading this who hasn\u2019t taken these steps to try and improve their social anxiety, because the social anxiety itself prevents people from doing so. Getting help involves speaking to say, a doctor, or a therapist, and this can be a massive, scary deal.\n\nSo, with having social anxiety, it can be tremendously difficult to take the first steps to recovery. This is unique, in that suffering from a mental disorder such as OCD or depression doesn\u2019t necessarily restrict you seeking help in the sense of being unable to get yourself, on your own, to see a doctor or a therapist. \n\nHowever, you have to want to get better. You have to know that you deserve better, that social anxiety is NOT normal, is NOT something anyone should suffer with, and that it IS a strongly researched mental health disorder which is legitimate and known by every health professional. \n\nYou need to enforce this desire, and you have to make a doctors appointment. This will create a dialogue with your GP. You have to see what support is there for you. Your GP speaks to hundreds of people every week, with a whole host of different issues, both physical and mental. Mental health is a massive public health issue and is finally being treated as such.\n\nSEE. YOUR. DOCTOR! Doing this was the best thing I ever did, even though I was terrified when I had my first appointment. I am not ashamed to admit that I had some alcohol before going, thought about cancelling in the week leading up to the appointment and was just downright terrified of going. But I did, I said that I had anxiety, in social situations, and guess what - he understood. Doctors. Don\u2019t. Judge.\n\nI was put on a small dose of medication - was a bit weird for the first few days, as it made me lose my appetite and feel a bit weird, but it settled. You don\u2019t notice the affects of anxiety medication too much, it takes about 6 weeks for it to have any affect. It\u2019s likely you\u2019ll also have your dose increased after your body settles on it. It can feel like a long process, you just want to stop having these feelings of anxiety, of dread, of fear going somewhere and having the physical symptoms of your anxiety presenting themselves and embarrassing you. But it\u2019s just the first step to getting better - medication CAN work. Some say it doesn\u2019t work for them, but it definitely makes some difference for some, and I am living proof of that.\n\nNext - therapy. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do a single therapy session if it weren\u2019t for medication. Some will be able to, and if you are, great. Secondly, money. I live in the UK, and here the NHS offer therapy for free if the patient needs it, so I\u2019m lucky in that sense, although the waiting list was 3 months. I am aware that in many countries, therapy isn\u2019t cheap. However, even where money is tight, please realise that your mental state is so important, and is ABSOLUTELY worth spending money on in looking to improve it. Social anxiety is not normal, and is not something you should have to be subject to every day. You deserve to get professional help. For those who literally cannot afford therapy, I sincerely apologise and ask you to see if there is anything you can do to get the help you need.\n\nTherapy is scary, at first. But it\u2019s also the best thing I\u2019ve forced myself to do. You become familiar and comfortable with a therapist. They understand social anxiety, they put you at ease and remind you that this is their JOB, and that they deal with patients with social anxiety EVERY SINGLE DAY.\n\nThese are things you can do, that WILL make an improvement to your social anxiety. It will make your quality of life better, and it is absolutely worth doing. You only get one life on this earth, don\u2019t live yours in the shackles of social anxiety because you deserve better.\n\nSupport is out there!",

I had my energetic drive/spark online that I could never translate to real life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of my sophomore year I transferred to an alternative high-school, and my real life completely changed. For some reason everyone liked me. I met my closest friends there, I was hanging out with my group of friends outside of school almost every day. Since there were only 40 kids in the school, we were all really close. We tried pot together (we were clueless and that period was really fun and stupid), we went to a few parties, I lost 90 pounds working at an express gym with my teacher, and I helped my friend lose 60 lbs too. When graduating I decided I wanted to become a personal trainer, and my best friends dad hooked me up with a job shadow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I graduated I had my first extremely short fling with a girl, and I realized how awkward I really was. I didn't let that failure get me down though and would still drive around with my friends. Until my mom got sick. She has extremely bad bipolar disorder. When she got sick, I needed to take care of her (My dad left when I was real young). She would do things like open the window and scream for someone to call the police, it was real embarrassing. So I stopped talking to my friends. That laster for about a year...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn that time I honestly forgot about talking to my online friends. I was spending so much time managing the house, planning with my moms case manager, that I didn't realize how much time had passed. My mom ended up totaling my car right before she got better, and I didn't have the energy at that point to try reconnecting with my real friends. So I just sat in my house for about 3 more months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I've effectively been a hermit for a year and a half. When I try to talk to my real life friends, they say things like \"Don't kill yourself!\" jokingly, or express how I'm a different person now. I don't have any of the spark/drive that I used to. Even when I try to talk to my online friends, I have crazy social anxiety. I can maybe talk to one, but only because he's just as awkward as I am.

I'm 16, in high school, and I have been struggling with ADHD and social anxiety for most of my life. I have done and said many impulsive and inappropriate things in the past because of my ADHD, and was viciously bullied and harassed for it. I seem to have control of my actions and words now but I have very much retreated into my shell. Junior Prom is coming up, and I have told my friends I refuse to go because such an event would make me extremely anxious. One of them tried to set me up with a girl and I said no (although I did not like the girl at all tbf).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe friends I have I get along with fine in school. I would say I'm a fairly funny person as people often laugh at my jokes. In one on one conversations I keep good eye contact, manage the convo well, etc. During lunch with them and some other kids who I don't hang out with, I am almost always very quiet. I used to hang out with some of them a couple times freshman year, but not anymore. I'm not sure why they haven't invited me to things, added me to group chats, etc. I feel like if I open up to one of them about this they would see me as needy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am tall + very skinny and fairly ugly - my facial features are well proportioned, but the way my skull (especially my jaw which is quite long and a bit horsefaceish) looks is what makes it ugly. I hate having pictures taken of me because of how ugly I look, which happens repeatedly and has happened often in the past, where people just randomly send other people snapchats of me. This sinking feeling of ugliness makes me feel like I want to wear a paper bag over my head when I get home from school. I feel like I am a husk of the man I should be - in my head I can be strong willed but I know physically I will never be able to back myself up or be man enough to go on dates, protect myself, get respect from others, etc.  Because of my ugliness and weakness as a male, other guys are often extremely condescending and pitying to me and I receive little to no respect from peers - many of whom say very lewd and inappropriate comments to me to try and make me feel awkward. Some girls also do the same thing by giving thinly veiled sarcastic and condescending comments to me. I don't enjoy leaving the house because of how I look and often basic social interactions such as the thought of going to the gym and signing up scare me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am optimistic, because I know once college comes if I have been working out I will no longer be skinny and maybe testosterone will make me look less like an ugly 12 yr old girl (srs). I have been compared to 11 from Stranger Things (even with an unbiased look at it I definitely do not look like her. I'm not sure why people say that) which has made me depressed and angry at myself and my androgynous features. I also know that when that time comes I will never see anyone from high school again and nobody will judge me for my past actions. I just wish I could enjoy my next year and a half or so in high school. I would like to have a discussion with one of my friends about never being invited to anything and what happened and about how I feel but I have no clue how I would bring it up in normal conversation at school (which would be quite strange as others would overhear) and I wonder if texting them about it would be weird.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThx for the help in advance",

It's so unbelievably immersive. You can do so many things in so many different ways. You can be a thief. You can be a hero. You can be a thief who just kills anyone who gets in his way or one who carefully tip toes around the place, taking great care to not be seen. Although let's be honest, you'll probably just be a stealth archer. You're always constantly working towards something. That next cool set, double-enchantment, having three words of a shout you think is cool, getting Max one-handed, destruction, whatever. I can't put into words how much I loved Skyrim. That's the problem. I really, really loved Skyrim. I loved it so much, that whenever my friends called over I didn't answer. Why would I? Skyrim was better. I loved it so much, I didn't call over to them. We lost contact. I didn't care. The only time I left the house, was when I went to school. I talked to my friends there and all,but...well. In my country, the Summer holidays are absurdly long. About 2 months or so in primary school(I believe you filthy cheese-burger eating,crisp-crunching Americans call it Elementary School. My English ancestors call it primary school aswell, I think?). So anyway, after 2 months not talking to anyone, I went into secondary school looking like a vampire. I was about as pale as you could get. I still am. I had terrible social skills. But... Secondary school,as we Irish call it,forces you to talk to other people. They feck you into a class with people you don't know, and as I realised, it's fortunately easier to make friends then it feels. Because of this, I realised how much I missed talking to people. I realised how fun it was to play football with your friends, or fuck around for 2 hours in the sunshine. But now,I felt afraid about all that. Calling over to someone's house was a mammoth effort and I would always sweat buckets and stammer even more than usual. That makes it sound like I did still go to other people's houses. I didnt. I don't. That's what would happen if I somehow did. So...yeah. I fucked myself over, and now I feel like my house is a prison. I don't feel socially anxious in school anymore, though. I used to hate school soooo much because of how many people there were. I'm somewhat used to that now. Maybe I will be able to leave the house now. The problem is,I just don't know what is or isn't socially acceptable. Would I be seen as weird for asking to come over to someone's house? Would it be weird to ask someone if I could play a tennis match against them?(I do play tennis with the few friends I have,sometimes.My parents force me to do tennis training.)I'm not that awkward.

Suddenly it became very obvious that this group would naturally be a very social team dynamic. \n\nIn the first semester the group was just a small group of guys and even though I had my moments where i might act weird or be uncomfortable i could usually coast through it. Winter break came around and I huddled into my room at my mom's place for a straight month, lost my job because I couldn't wake up on time (been waking up super late since I was young). When the second semester started this time around suddenly we had a bunch of new students and I was in even worse shape than the semester before to start socializing. \n\nSo fast forward a few weeks, got new job, lost it because i wouldn't \"get with the program\" and be chipper, smile, and now i'm going to school most of my time. Unemployed I focused all my attention on getting better at the socializing part of my life instead of trying to move out of my mom's place. Paranoia set in and the thing is that I don't really wear headphones most of the time, so it felt like i heard people talking about me, and that the entire group largely disliked me. I don't know if i started to develop schizo from being alone all the time, but when I would walk by everyone the vibe just felt off. I'm pretty sure that people were going to talk to me about leaving the department or focusing on other things but I walked over and asked the editor to speak instead because they just looked at me quietly instead of saying anything.\n\n I told him I wanted to step down from my position because my social anxiety had finally hit peak levels and I couldn't handle the pressure I was putting on myself.He said he'd check in with me the next day, I was high at the time so i'm sure we could figure out exact details later, He seemed cool with it but he apparently was crying and went back into the newsroom to tell everyone and now i'm officially off the paper in a bittersweet fashion. I could never tell if the group was trying to be genuinely kind with me or facetious and the constant shit talking/playing, for someone with adhd or maybe autistic as me, felt like I couldn't feel fully comfortable. Worse than that I worry that they were teaching me to be friendly and social then in return I lashed out in a moment of craziness and ruined a good thing for myself. Or they're catty people and genuinely disliked me/found me weird and wanted me out anyway. \n\nAlso I think someone told them i'm also depressive and battling suicidal thoughts, because soon afterwards they started texting me saying nice things and they're here to help. But I think that's just them covering tracks for school reasons because the initial phone call i got after that conversation was basically being told, \"you got an A for the semester\" \"You don't have to come to class or into the newsroom anymore, \\*feels like they were saying fuck off\\*\" ",

He has a small group of friends but he rarely talks to them. My mother kicked him out at 18 because he wasn't doing anything so he ran away for a week and took a train to Toronto from BC. When he came back he stayed at my fathers. He worked at McDonalds but got fired because when the burgers need restocking the cooker would need to yell to get more from the freezer and he would never do that even when its busy as hell. He would just freeze and not talk. My dad got him a job at the McD's close to where he lives and on the first day he ran away again without saying nothing to Calgary with nothing but his phone and it was -40C. My dad did not force him to get a job or was aggressive which makes it so confusing.\n\nHe came back a week later and moved in with me and my mom and I promised to get him better. At home he says the bare minimum and now it has gotten to the point where he doesn't even say anything unless he gets yelled at which makes him snap back in return. He does not think anything is wrong with him. I tried to relate to him today, telling him I went through the same thing and tried to commit suicide and when I was about to tear up he laughed at me and said \"I'm not gonna kill myself are you stupid, leave me alone\". I am literally in tears because he believes its normal to play the computer all day and just eat and sleep. We are going to the doctor to get a psychiatrist referral because a week before he did open up to the family doctor when I told him I have AvPD and SAD and he told the doctor he thinks he has it as well.

My days are spent distracting myself until I fall asleep. And so it is with life. All I have to do is get through these stressful few minutes. All I have to do is survive a few hours until work is over. All I have to do is last these next few days until my day off. Minutes, hours, days; lives.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to hang out with people. I don\u2019t know how to hold an adult conversation. I don\u2019t know how to go on dates. I don\u2019t know how to be in a relationship. I don\u2019t know how to get to know my co-workers. I don\u2019t know how to open up to people or even find people who I want to open up to.\n\nWhat am I going to do, learn how to socialize as an almost 30-year-old? Go out and, as a self-supporting grown adult man, try and make small talk with strangers at a middle-school level until I get better at it? Finally learn, as an otherwise physically healthy and untraumatized independent human being, how to order at restaurants without mumbling and fucking up even though I rehearsed it thirty times in my head beforehand?  Go out and, as someone who other adults ostensibly no longer see as a kid or student but as their equal, condition myself to be able to get a haircut from someone else instead of buzzing it myself once a year and hating the way I look (even more so than usual) for two months? Learn to finally go to the grocery store without needing the entire rest of the day to recover? Learn to stop driving somewhere only to immediately go back home after trying to find a parking spot was too overbearing? Suddenly tell my parents and friends that there has been a writhing rat king in the pit of my stomach every single day for the past two decades and that I\u2019m not actually as quirkily forgetful as is the joke, but really that in most conversations I\u2019m not actually listening to the words people are saying to me because I\u2019m too busy focusing on how to stand and how to hold my arms and how long to hold eye contact for before breaking away and when to nod or shake my head and when to say \u201cmm-hmm\u201d and when to smile but not too much or too suddenly so as to not look like I have a tic, and that that\u2019s why I don\u2019t remember things, because I never knew them in the first place? After twenty-five years, am I going to learn to stop people-pleasing and focus on myself? After twenty-five years am I going to finally form an actual identify outside of people-pleasing to focus on?\n\nI\u2019d like those answers to be yes but at what point do I stop the delusions? At what point do I just accept that this is just how things are and how they will always be? Even if my social anxiety was to be magically cured tomorrow it doesn\u2019t change that I still don\u2019t know how to do any of those things. Anxiety stopped me from doing those things and from learning how to do those things and now I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever know how to do those things. I had 17 years of school\u2014in which I saw the same people every day for years\u2014to do these things and find friends and I didn\u2019t, I couldn't, and then I lost the few friends I had when I moved across the country 6 months ago. Am I going to magically make new friends now that I see no one outside of the same handful of people every day?\n\nAnyways, I don\u2019t really have a point to this. This is my first post here but I\u2019m not looking for anything. I know the solutions to all this: therapy and baby steps and all that. Making an effort. This is all more catharsis than anything. Writing was a good distraction; I called off sick to work tonight, and I\u2019m crippled with the anxiety of them thinking I\u2019m only skipping because it\u2019s a Saturday during a festival and our restaurant is going to be slammed. That\u2019s not why\u2014I texted my boss from my bathroom floor in between dry heaves\u2014but that doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s real. It only matters what other people think. That\u2019s all that matters. That\u2019s all my brain will let me care about. What other people think. Because I\u2019m home sick from work but my roommate is having people over, and in order to puke I will have to walk to the bathroom past them in the living room. Do I say hi and introduce myself?

Basically at 12, I was so traumatized I told myself to avoid other teens for the rest of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 14, under a very rushed diagnosis, the school physchologist gave me what was then called Asperger diagnosis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe school physchologist NEVER asked if I was shy, felt like low self esteem or felt anxious around people. I had also only slept 90 minutes on that day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe special needs teachers that I was then paired with, told me that I literally (apart from being anxious about people rejecting me, and horribly insecure) didn't show a single sign of even PPD-NOS.\n\nI also could not relate to any other people with a similar high-functioning diagnosis and seemed to be a world away from them, although they were very nice and friendly :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 16, I managed to slightly overcome my shyness and made normal group of close friends, again doing all the regular teenage stuff (parties, hanging out, sports, shopping, talking about girls, many emotional conversations about feelings).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Since that day, I have been to multiple doctors and done multiple tests.

        "original": "This happened last night and since then I have been reflecting on how much it affected me and why, and just wanted to share to get it out of my head. I'm M 21 btw.\n\nSo I get massive anxiety when going out and walking somewhere alone. I feel like everyone is watching me, and judging me, and knows I'm scared. Since high school (graduated \\~3 yrs ago), I've slowly overcome this fear and have been getting better at being alone. I have tried to accept the idea that no one cares I'm there, and that I'm just like everyone else. It's hard but I've been feeling better and better about it. \n\nLast night, I went to get some food alone on a pretty busy street. As I crossed the street, I noticed a group of guys coming the opposite way. They seemed to be late teens to early 20s. I instantly got nervous, as their clothes and voices reminded me of the kind of kids who would make fun of me in high school. As I passed them, one of them really quickly jumped out in front of me to scare me, got within inches of my face, then kept going, laughing. It scared the shit out of me. I immediately felt myself shutting down.\n\nMy first thought was \"why me?\" I was just walking. Then, it felt like everything I told myself was a lie; people DO know I'm scared walking down the street, and think it's fucking funny. Either that, or I just look weak, or stupid, or ugly.\n\nThis exact thing happened to me many times in high school. I'd see the bullies coming the other way, get nervous, and one of them would either pretend they were going to punch me or literally shove me into the lockers. I've been able to move past those experiences because I know I looked like a nerd in high school... I dressed bad, I looked bad, I was a quiet, easy target. But I thought I had changed since then, until last night. I felt like I was in high school again, which is a nightmare to me. I literally had a nightmare last night that I was in high school, probably because of this.\n\nI know there's a chance I saw them coming, got nervous, and my body language shifted to weak and fearful-- something I could work on in the future. But I can't help but wonder if it's just my face, or the way I am, that is permanently incapable of dealing with situations like this.\n\nI'm really going to try not to let this stop me from moving forward and trying to be alone more often... but I'm scared it will.

        "original": "Hello, I\u2019m a 16 yo male and this is (and probably will be) my only post on this Subreddit. Recently I discovered something great, and I want you to read this post because you\u2019re probably struggling with social anxiety dominating your life like it used to do mine.\n\nRemember that \u201eyou were born into\u201c a society. You were raised with patterns to follow. You are scared of breaking these patterns. Scared of breaking out of society. Scared of being rejected by it.\n\nNow I want you to differentiate between SOCIETY and HUMANITY.\nSociety is a theoretical construct. A mindset. Society is what has these rules that make you scared of being yourself(\u201edon\u2018t dress differently\u201c, \u201edon\u2018t run outside when others see you\u201c for example.).\nHumanity are people. Humanity are the people around you and the people you meet. The construct of society and these rules shall not apply for now.\n\nIn my school bus is always this guy. He enters as one of the last. He\u2018s probably as old as me. He wears plain black clothes and tries to avoid any eye contact at all. His eyes are dead. When he sits on his seat he doesn\u2018t even put off his bag from his back. He doesn\u2018t want to make noise and come off as annoying, even though the bag taking all his space clearly makes him uncomfortable and it bothers him.\nThis guy is affected by society. Not just affected, it\u2018s dominating all of his actions. Of course noone would give a f*ck if he would just put off his bag, but he still has his made-up rules carved into his mind. This applied to me aswell.\n\nPerhaps you may have seen by now that society cares, but humanity clearly doesn\u2019t. Now at one point in the last few days I found a point: \u201eWhat if I disconnected from all of this?\u201c, \u201eWhat if I didn\u2018t care?\u201c. Whenever I am in an anixious situation now, for example walking past a row of cars, I tell myself: \u201eThese rules don\u2018t apply for me now. I\u2018m free now.\u201c\n\nI\u2018d like to show you another example. When someone mocks you for being an idiot(let\u2018s say you just stumbled and fell) and you care about it, you may feel like an idiot. Even worse, you let the bully take control over your emotions. You let him take your soul.  Now what if you simply wouldn\u2018t care? He\u2018s the idiot now, He keeps mocking about you. But he keeps mocking a god. You are way out of his league now. You don\u2019t care about his existence and his words. Instead of actually feeling like an idiot and feeling he deserves the right to mock you because society says that, he\u2018s just being a rude child now and you don\u2018t have to worry about him at all.\nHe\u2018s still trapped in his little society cage, and you\u2018re a free and respectable human now.\n\nPerhaps maybe you may still think that ignoring society patterns may make you an outsider, and make you end up as a lonely old man/woman without having ever been loved. Think of the most confident man/woman you know. Think of someone harassing him/her. The confident person would never even let the harasser close to affecting its emotions. It doesn\u2018t have any emotional investment at all in the people around it because society doesn\u2018t have it caught in its chains.\n\nPerhaps maybe the average society-affected person will not like you now, but it will respect you. On the other hand, humanity will not only respect, but love you. Once you disconnect from society you will start to attract many great new people. And it\u2018s way better than being in the society hole where you have to show heavy commitment everyday in order to not be rejected.\n\nI want you to disconnect from society now. Break the patterns, break the barrier. Be comfortable and confident with yourself. This movement doesn\u2018t take any realistic commitment, I just needs a change in your mind. When you feel anxiety in your actions, don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want you to demonstrate that you don\u2019t care, I want you to not care. There\u2019s a big difference between showing and doing. You can still be a respectable person and respect other people while not giving a sh*t about the rules of society. \n\nI hope I have helped you with this. Keep going. Open your heart\n\nP.S. Since this is my only post here I\u2018d like to recommend you 2 great books which really helped me on my journey:\n- \u201eModels\u201c by Mark Manson (I originally bought this book to be more attractive to women but the book guides you through a internal development too. I highly recommend this book to women aswell)\n\n- \u201eCan\u2018t hurt me\u201c by David Goggins (This book changed my life)\n\nEDIT: Fixed grammar mistakes.",

Then that's the conversation over and that's how it's always been because I just don't know how to really interact with people very well, my social skills are horrendous! \n\nI currently live in a shared house with a couple, they pretty much have the run of the house because I try to avoid them, I never try to sit and have dinner with them and they have asked alot, I always look for an accuse why I can't do it, I literally wake up play my console games go to work, sleep that's my life, every other weekend I'll see my girlfriend and children, I value my time alone and I'm not sure why, like when my housemates go out I feel a sign of relief and freedom as strange as that may sound. I won't even talk on the microphone to people on the online games either, because I don't know what to say or how to say it, like my brain just won't function! It's like omg human interaction I have no idea what I should do now, then I just feel really awkward...\n\nPart of the reason I'm writing this is because yesterday a co-worker ive worked with for over a year sed to me you never talk do you? I replied \"I'm not really a people person, but more of a solitude type of guy\" but it got me thinking a year of working with the same people and I'm still not comfortable with them, surely that isn't right? It's like im scared to say the wrong thing or sound like a idiot but I just chose not to talk and just fully focus on my job. \n\nI do like being in my room on my own, I won't lie But I just don't understand why I can't be like everyone else and being able to socialise the way they do and not care or worry about it.\n\nI understand this is a very long post and I'm hoping to reach out to people going through the same thing as me or just give me some ideas on what to do or how to over come it.

Have been getting counselling over something that bothered me, since I had an empathetic ear over these incidents, I feel a lot better. I didn't realize this incident was causing me so much stress, anger, hatred, resentment, loneliness, alienation. Too bad I've wasted 11 years of my life friendles and in a room, messing up my education and having no social life. I was going to therapy as a kid, i never mentioned it, pushed too back of my head, and thought it was okay someone would do that, didnt want to cause trouble, no big deal. What bothers me is I wanted to talk to people before this happened, hated people afterwards. I was good looking back then, stopped taking care of myself when it happened, lost a tooth, bad hygeine. Now i've got acne scars on back, cellulite on ass and a bit of a hunch in my back. I've also only had sex twice, barely, technically, and it was terrible both times. I've spent my life turning away people who wanted to help me out of distrust. I've spent years daydreaming in my head like a stupid idiot. I had these thoughts I'd get obsessed about and fixate on. Got diagnosed as aspergers at 16, my whole life it was ignored by family, even though my brother was diagnosed as an infant.

I have also finished my postgraduate studyings. From my 19s till almost now (30s) i have skipped so many lessons and lectures because of agoraphobia and brutal social anxiety. Somehow, around a month before i took a life desicion to try my bests to overcome this shitty situation and live my life to my potential.

They are speaking in a scientific ways, like they have reached almost the level of a prof.

This fact make me feel shame and inferiority.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy profs claim that my papers are extremely nice.

I had a hard time with applying for it and getting called but still grabbed myself together and just go. As I walked inside the store I already felt my heart beating inside my throat... So I told one of the cashiers there that I had a job interview and she walked with me to another room. We sat down and she asked some questions about me and asked if I would be interested to become a cashier instead because they would have busy days. I said no I can't because I got no experience for that and I applied for something else, that's also not where my interests are... She asked why I was so insecure and didn't want to try. But with social anxiety that's pretty much a no go plus I don't have good money counting abilities and social skills. I already freak out a little inside if I have to pay, let alone being the cashier itself! So I was super stressed and as I was back home again I cried and felt so useless like I can't do anything... Not even a \"simple\" job. I'm afraid social anxiety will take over my life like I can't find a good job and I don't have many friends and barely any support from family as they don't really understand... It's a terrible feeling, I might have depression too as I got no motivation or anything really that interests me...\n\nToday I got an email and they pretty much rejected me because I didn't want to become a cashier and there were better people suited for the job. Probably has something to do with my insecurities too.\n\nAlso I wanted to start college next school year (there's a heavy pressure on me) but same problem... I've been rejected before at several ones so my confidence/self image is non-existent. Also because I've been rejected to what I found interesting I have no idea anymore which education to choose... At times I feel like my life is going nowhere. Does anyone have the same problem?\n\nA little backstory about me, I've been bullied alot throughout my whole high school years so when I graduated a few years ago that was like a weight of my shoulders because I got rid of the people there this way... It was hell. Also my home situation isn't exactly positive either so I've been through quite alot. It's so painful when people don't understand why you're acting a certain way... Also I'm a complete introvert so making friends and such is already a huge step for someone like me. Thanks for reading, needed to type my feelings out. :)",

In that job, I had the constant feeling of having something stuck in my throat, I was so anxious because a phone call could come at any moment. I could hear but not understand people on the other line and I would come home crying and cry before going to work each day.\n\n The agoraphobia, well, I developed that in high school. I dropped out, got my GED years later, had a  few semesters in college. At my worst, (before college) I would hide my shoes so I wouldn't have to go outside.\n\nI'm okay when I go out with my family, but I get really anxious when I have to go anywhere alone or some place new. I have to constantly check if someone is following me too.\n\nGetting this job was like going in the deep end, stupid maybe... I took a chance, it's just a 15 min bus ride from home. There was a limit of about 150 characters in the online job application, I made them count. I feel the tiniest bit proud that maybe my words counted for something.\n\nThe job interview was short, they got my information and asked about hours. I have no social life, hours were no problem and I don't ask for much. The area I live in is not the best and they just wanted someone who looked decent enough.\n\nBefore, I was just so frustrated with myself and my inability to interact with others and not helping my household. I find myself having to relearn social cues, it helps that the restaurant has a standard greeting. Learning the menu was a challenge, but I'm getting it. Having a list of tasks and knowing where things go really helps me feel more organized, efficient and in control of my situation. I try to be the same at home now.\n\nSometimes it gets so busy that I feel like crying. I try to cheer myself up by thinking of something funny. People can also be so mean, but I remind myself that they just got out of work and are grumpy because they're hungry and tired. My managers were so annoyed with me at first because I kept messing up. I try to learn from my mistakes. I'm not fast at cleaning but I'm trying to be.\n\nOther coworkers complain about the work, I'm just glad I found something. Any time that I feel like quitting, I remind myself that a few days is not enough to list in a resume.\n\nI have some goals, maybe I could do something. I want to go out with my family. We always say we'll do something for the summer and never do. We should. I would also like to go back to school and get my associate's degrees at least.\n\nIt's not the best story, but I hope someone can relate or that it can bring someone hope.\n\nEdit:\nTldr: Got my 2nd job after years of agoraphobia and social anxiety.

        "original": "Hi, I'm Jason. I'm a recovering Heroin addict. I have pretty bad social anxiety and severe glossophobia. When I speak in front of people I have a near panic attack. My legal issues have landed me in an intensive outpatient program that I have to attend for 3 hours, 3 days a week. I am having a *incredibly* hard time adjusting to the program. Each time we go around the room elaborating on a subject, I get increasingly nervous as it gets closer to my time to speak. All the symptoms of anxiety/panic set in, racing heart, sweaty hands, uncontrolled shaking and fidgeting, shortness of breath, urge to run out of the room ... Then my turn comes and the freak show begins. I'm so noticeably nervous when speaking that I can see I'm making everyone else uncomfortable; my voice is shaky, I teeter between talking too fast and taking long pauses, I forget words and entire parts of sentences. I end up cutting my speech very short.\n\nI had thought in the beginning that my fear would ease through exposure and practice. In the beginning I saw this as a chance to get over my social anxiety and finally live a fulfilling life. This has **not** been the case, in fact the opposite has been true. These horribly humiliating experiences that have me wanting to curl up in a ball and die after each session have only reinforced my fear of speaking in front of people. My glossophobia has gotten worse, fast. I can make small talk among the group with not too much anxiety when we're talking about a subject that I'm familiar with or confident in, but it's a whole different story when i have to reflect, explain or elaborate on something and all eyes are on me.\n\nAs part of the program I'm seeing a counselor who I'm going to be doing cognitive behavioral therapy with, but I just have a feeling that this won't work. Besides I'm only seeing her briefly, once a week. I don't know what to do. I'm almost positive my doctor won't prescribe me a benzo for the anxiety due to my drug history. Quitting this group would entail almost certain felony conviction and subsequent loss of my career, probable drug court and possible prison time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anybody ever, in any way, been through something similar?

Walking past people can be stressful, \u201cdo i say hi?\u201d  \u201cWhen they said that thing last week was it about me and do they not like me?\u201d This stuff runs through my head all the time. \n\nThe part that hurts most:\nSeeing the uncomfortableness in other people simply because your present. Crossing arms, scattered eye contact, scratching/holding neck, looking away very quickly when making eye contact with you, walking past you without acknowledging you, people leaving the room when you enter, every conversation ends very abruptly.\n\nYou\u2019d think I was the grim reaper or some shit. These are the scenarios that constantly run through my head and keep me from doing things like concentrating, doing my homework, being in the moment, sleeping.\n\nSocial Anxiety is a heavy sack to carry around your whole life and I wish I had an answer to help others overcome it but the best advice I can give is stay as relaxed as possible(trust me i know this can seem impossible sometimes) and be yourself. This is hard when you don\u2019t know who you are, think about what makes you happy. Ask yourself, what would make tomorrow a perfect day? Then take baby steps towards making it happen.\n\nWhen I\u2019m really coming off the rails and start to consider skipping work i know I need to take a step back and try and chill. My dogs/cats offer me a ton of happiness, playing guitar helps me relax, i love working on computers/mechanical things and that gets my mind off things. My gf makes me happy and supports me. Your list will probably be different, but latch on to things you love and it really does take away some pain. \u201cLearn from the past but don\u2019t dwell on it\u201d\n\u201cMoving fast doesn\u2019t mean your getting ahead\u201d\n\u201cTreat everyone kindly\u201d\n\u201cDont sweat the little shit\u201d\nThese are some things i try to live by that also help. \n\nAll in all social anxiety will be very hard to deal with in adult life. Ive stopped analyzing why I\u2019m like this and just try to understand what sets me off and what i can do to make the pain as little as possible without drinking/other destructive behavior. I think people with true social anxiety are very nice but just don\u2019t know how to show it. Social anxiety is something I\u2019ve accepted I have and probably will have for years to come. Dam I want to write more but my hands are starting to get tired. I hope some find this helpful. \n\nFeel free to ask questions/offer advice. \n\n-Nate\n\n\n",

This anxiety manifests in panic attacks and self-imposed isolation, especially from age 17 onwards. Although he has seen therapists and taken various medications, including lithium, Prozac, and Xanax, progress has been slow. Nate's social anxiety makes it difficult to initiate conversations and creates stress in everyday interactions due to his physical appearance and perceived demeanor. This difficulty impacts his concentration, productivity, and ability to engage in normal activities. He finds some relief from playing guitar, working on computers and mechanical things, and spending time with his pets and girlfriend. Despite accepting that SA is a long-term struggle, it continues to cause significant pain and challenges in his life.",

And yes, crippling, many other students have bullied me saying things like: \"she's probably mentally disabled\" or \"she's a fucking mute\" which damaged my already low confidence and self-esteem. I try to look people in the eyes, no success. I try to act as normal as possible, no success.\n\nStory of my school career basically: **I used to get teased by boys who made bets on who could make me say a word. People walked all over me, but I was too scared and anxious to defend myself.**\n\nAnyway: We were on the bus talking about metal bands and I kept looking away because of how awkward I felt. And I was so scared and intimidated because of how handsome and funny he was to me. He looked like some kind of angel. Every single second, I felt self-conscious and uncomfortable. He must have thought I was bored or uninterested.... I feel like crying. I'm so angry at myself. I keep doing this. The few times I try to make a friend I just end up fucking up.  Plus I keep thinking everyone on the bus is looking at me.\n\nHell I may even have Asperger's. The teachers and lunch ladies always tell me to \"cheer up\" and ask why \"I look so sad.\" And people say I'm eerily quiet. I recently started going back to my highschool campus to try again after doing online school, after I had a panic attack in class at the beginning of the year... There's no hope. I tried medicine, therapy, even daily prayer to a God that I don't even know exists. And a guy actually likes me for some reason, yet my brain is to primitive to even follow proper conversation etiquette.\n\nAnd the worst part: I tried my hardest. I really did. I asked him questions, kept eye contact longer than my usual, and complemented his taste, yet he still just.... I dunno. I just sensed that at the end, he was kind of disappointed. To be honest, I hate myself. I'm disgusting. I'm a 16 year old girl with no social skills, even though I try to practice frequently with my twin brother and teachers. I can't even begin a relationship with another teenager because I've never talked to other people like this, so I don't know the slang or inside jokes.\n\n**PART 2**\n\nThere's no hope. I tried for 16 years. But people at school just bully, stare, and call me disgusting things, both to my face and behind my back. And when I do gain a tiny bit of confidence, I'm pushed back down. I've tried my **hardest.** Medicine, years of therapy, religious prayer, CBD, hobbies, clubs, self-help, yet I can't change myself. Maybe I was born to be a \"mute\" like everyone at school says. Maybe it's my nature. I was born to be the kid at school that people say it going to shoot it up, the people call a \"satanist\" for simply being a metalhead, for being unlike the other kids of my race, for being so inferior to everyone else that I never gotten a partner to work with on assignments all year.\n\nI hate myself. I'm crying now. I can't keep doing this shit. I've tried my damn hardest. I've put blood, sweat, and tears into coping with this disgusting horrible, disorder, only to see no results. I don't want to end up alone, with no one to share my life with. I've been a reject all my life, and a guy finally sees something in me, but I fucked up again. I am pathetic.\n\nI remember when my mom woke me up and called me pathetic and that i'll go nowhere in life, must be true. Imagine being such a disgrace to your own parents who sacrificed everything to come to the U.S. Anyone would expect their kids to have friends in highschool, or at least talk to one person... I don't even have anyone. Not like I have any family, my mom moved from France to the U.S. 20 years ago to raise me here, so all of my relatives live there. And friends? Lol I've had one friend in elementary and middle, out of pity. I'm rotting in highschool, when I'm supposed to be experiencing life with people like everyone else at school. I never even went to anyone's house.  I just want someone, one person is fine, to appreciate and feel appreciated with. I want to talk to someone like me, someone who has similar opinions, views, and ideologies. Living life with nobody by your side is hellish. There's no point.\n\nI've never even held a guy's hand. Meanwhile I see all these couples at school literally eating each other's faces in the hallway. I'm missing out on vital experiences. Every adult, even my mom, brings up their nostalgia of their highschool days: their first kiss, their first time drinking or smoking weed, skipping school to go on adventures in town. **I haven't been living.**\n\nMy mom told me I was always a quiet, timid, anxious kid. There's no hope for me. I can't change my genetics, my biology. I've tried so hard. I feel like calling out to God, and asking why? Why do I have to fight myself to participate in society? I can barely look at my brother or mom without sweating and shaking.\n\nEveryone's right. I'm a failure. But I just want someone. My heart hurts. I feel a blackness inside of me from all these years of dealing with the same shit. I feel sick and disgusting, like someone messed with my brain. I feel cold whenever I'm around people. I feel like I'm not even fully human. Just some deformed genetic abomination. Like a subhuman idiot masquerading as a person.\n\nEveryone tells you that to achieve your goals \"just keep trying.\" Well, I've used all my strength and energy to try to cope with my social anxiety. Maybe there's a point where we've reach our limits. I feel like there's nothing more I can give. I'm a mess at 16. I can't even talk to a guy who's somehow interested in me. Maybe there's a point where people should give up and accept it. I can't take this anymore. My chest feels like a black hole.",

I've had it all my life and as a result, i've always been (or felt) like the weird kid at school. I often move schools, and i mean often, so i think that is one reason my social anxiety has gotten worse. So the so few friends that i made and grew to be comfortable with are gone due to how much i move. So now i am a junior in highschool, have no friends except for one guy (who i feel is more of an acquaintance.) I go by my daily routine every day of the week, wake up, go to school, sit there all day not speaking except for saying \"Here\" which i have to practice in my mind multiple times and usually is a tense moment for me as i feel i will be judged by the way my voice sounds, which i don't have a weird or abnormal voice but, well you know, if you have social anxiety you would understand. And its just gotten to the point where i just have my earbuds in all day, watching youtube, and looking at the ground with my hands in my pocket, because i feel i will be judged by the way i walk, this only occurs at school, i don't know why... so as you could guess, i've never had a girlfriend. I am not even a bad looking guy, i am just short so thats just another problem, its just my fucking social anxiety. I think i have a few girls that like me at school but once again, my social anxiety saves the day (sarcasm). It has also gotten to the point where i don't even like making eye contact with anyone at all, i pretend like i am doing something important on my phone, which i am not, i am just scrolling through my playlist. I just feel like it's getting worse and worse. It has just gotten to the point of depression and lost of hope. I am also fairly poor so it does not help my situation at all. I look at snapchat stories and see kids my age getting new cars, hanging out with their friends and girlfriends almost everyday. And what i do is go home, go in my room and watch youtube, movies, or play videogames. I stated smoking weed at the age of 14 and it has helped with the loneliness alot, but i had recently stopped because of my mom. So now i just feel alone and lonely, mostly sad and depressed but i try and hide it best i can when i'm around family. I just feel like it will effect my life drastically in the future. I don't like talking about my emotions to others because i feel as if they don't really care, and which i can understand because everyone has their own problems. But not to get off topic but it has also affected relationships with some of my family, like my brother and half sister. I use to be very close to them when i was around them fairly often. But i have since moved away from the city most of my family lives at. So im just not really comfortable around them anymore and i feel like i cant really conversate with them like i use to, so now it's like i dont even know them anymore, same with other family members. It's just really fucking my life up and i have no idea what to do, sometimes i have suicidal thoughts. I just feel like i am not going to be able to make it in life due to this. Can anybody relate?",

It was about 10 years ago around christmas when I was shopping. I am male, single, 23 back then. I was at the supermarket and when I walked in, I recognized this asian lady (late 20 I assume) dealing with her daughter (2-3f). She looked like she had a hard time making her staying with her, because the little kid was overly interested in the sweets which were stacked up at the side.\n\nI mind my own business and bought the stuff I needed and headed to the register to pay when I heard a very frightened female voice yelling a name again and again, sounding more and more desperate, and I saw that asian woman, looking in every aisle, obviously looking for her daugher. \n\nWell, I lived in a quite \"civilized\" area back then, means very low crime and quite wealthy. I thought about \"oh well, maybe she's (the little girl) at the sweets, with big eyes and packing up chocolate and went on. I paid my stuff, which took me less than a minute, and headed to the exit, still hearing that lady looking for her daughter. \n\nAnd then I saw her. \n\nThat little girl was at the exit, looking at some riding-toy where parents could make their kids sit on while it moves, and looked like she's lost. \n\nAnd this is where my... incapability of doing anything kicked in. I was about to walk over to that girl, grab her and and bring her back to her mom, but I couldn't move towards her. My legs just refused to make any step into her direction and all which was running through my head was \"If you go over to that kid, everyone will accuse you of trying to kidnap her. Or they will look at you like a child molester, a pedophile! How will that look like? YOU an adult, single man, approaching a little GIRL which is seperated from her mom!\"\n\nI really wanted to help that little girl, but I just couldnt. But I also couldn't leave. What if I leave any anyone takes advantage of this situation? You read it in the newspapers, missing kids, found abused and dead. Of course this only happens elsewhere, far far away, not in my hometown, but... you never know. \n\nI walked to the info point while not allowing my eyes to lose focus on the doorway with the little girl and said to the woman behind the desk to get the mom, her kid is at the doorway. - Which she instantly did. She walked into the supermarket, waving her hands to get the attention of the lady and told her to come outside. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, nothing happend, no harm done, mom and daughter united again, and she thanked me for finding her, but still. I had (and still have) no Idea on how to react if such a situation would come up again.\n\nShould I approach the kid, talk to him and tell him his mom is in the store? What if I talk to the kid and while I do, the mom sees me and accuses me of trying to kidnap her? \n\nWhat would you do? ",

Ill give a little information on things I go through, think, feel and hopefully I can get some answers here.\n\nSo I think I have bad social anxiety.. big gatherings where I know the people can start making me feel anxious to the point that I don't want to even go, even family parties. Now mostly this is due to the fact I feel like people think Im weird so they look at me differently although my gf tells me nobody does. So I try and avoid alot of social gatherings like that but on the flip side if its a strangers I don't feel nearly as anxious and im ok doing things like being in public places, parks, events etc which Is why I want to move away, to get away from everyone I know who thinks im strange. Firstly I am a pretty handsome guy so I have confidence in that but when people see me i feel like they don't like my personality because im too anxious to reveal the true me and im just constantly thinking thats what they're thinking of, which is why online dating I was so successful at because texting and talking on the phone was mostly a breeze for me. Even at work if my manager comes in I get a little anxious, or another co worker who i normally don't see often starts chatting up with the co worker I do work with a lot I feel like they're talking about me someway lol sucks but yeah..anyway when its just me and the co worker or two Im used to working with I feel fine.\n\nA little about my behaviors which makes me wonder if its just social anxiety or bi polar disorder.\n\nI do get in moods where I tell my gf to clean up her shit and organize it, better herself, but my stuff is alwayss clean and organized so idk.\n\nI do try getting on track working out and eating right(for the most part I do eat right but never to the level I want and do it consistently) for instace Ill work out for a week, take my dog for a walk every morning for a few days then just get lazy and not keep up with it.\n\nI enjoy tech stuff like games and tv's so I recently splurged and bought a 1500 tv, I do like to buy new shirts every so often never more than like 70$ or so at a time so im not sure if i have impulse spending, but in the past I have spent a few hundred on mobile in game apps.\n\nOn my days off i do like feeling productive and getting my chores out of the way and errands, try to do something nice with my gf like go to the movies or whatever, sometimes stop at the petstore and get my dogs some new toys or treats.\n\nI have a habit of playing video games late into the night around 2 am sometimes but never past 1ish if i have work the next morning but i do chain smoke about a pack if im playing xbox for about 5 hours, if i dont get around 8 hours of sleep i feel shitty the next morning, i never felt fine if i get just a few hours.\n\nI have had times where im horny and sexted women nonstop for days then stopped cause it felt wrong and dirty, but during those times I take care of myself better and try to put on the best me to obtain the girl im talking to.\n\nI barely drink but when I do if im having a good time and they're is music playing I dont like to leave until the place closes and I also buy alot of drinks even for others im with and sometimes even strangers I met and spoke to while having a good time..do smoke cigs alot(I want to quit badly I feel like its a detriment to my health even mentally so im pretty hard on myself when I quit for a few days and go back.. also I suck at grammar so sorry for the messy post!\n\nIf there is any questions you could ask me I would answer them honestly to help determine if I have bipolar disorder, thank you everyone.",

Ever since I was a kid, I've struggled with it. As a result, I don't have much friends, I find it hard to socialize with people, and I'm pretty awkward. Because of this, I've been putting off/failed/dropped most classes that involve doing presentations or any 'social' related assignments/projects. As a result, I have about a total of 7 F's in my transcript and will probably get another 3 more after this semester is over. Although I calculated that I might still avoid being on academic suspension if I get at least an A and C or B and B for the 2 remaining classes I'm enrolled this semester. Overall I'm just tired of this shit I've put myself into.\n\n7 classes that I need are group/presentation based. I'm taking 2 presentation/group biased classes this summer. One of them is a speech class which obviously requires me to talk in front of others in order to pass. The other is a group/presentation based class. I've took this speech class twice, dropped it the first time and failed the second time, and the other class once (failed it). At this point, if I can't pass these 2 classes during the summer, I'd rather just dropout out completely since I'll end up in academic suspension. \n\nSo yeah, overall I need some sort of advice/help. I'm planning to drink a bit of alcohol to ease my nerves for the presentation. I'm not sure if that's a good idea since I've never tried it. Illegal drugs isn't an option since I don't want to get caught and go to jail or end up expelled. \n\nGoing to a therapist or something like that isn't an option since I can't afford it at this moment and I'm not sure what my parents will think about this. They don't 'approve' mental health. \n\nAny advice/tips will be appreciated. I'm also willing to provide more info about myself/situation since I'm not sure what else to add.\n\nThanks.",

In this period of time i sweated profusely and had this rash all around my mouth that i couldn't hide whatsoever. This made my anxiety even worse and i was immensely tired when i got home. Therefore i did absolutely nothing and snacked on junk food a lot. It made me hate my life and really sad, maybe even depressed. Then i decided i needed to make a change to cut the chain. So i joined a gym, started eating healthier and trying to be more social to people, with baby steps ofcourse. Now i'm here. I try to go to the gym 6 times a week, i eat really healthy and went to therapy. My social anxiety was as good as cured... i thought. This year i decided to do the last year of high school again to study diffrent topics and therefore i knew noone from my class. This got me extremely out of my comfort zone and was a good thing to do i think.  But now i still sweat a lot when im around other people. Is this still due to my social anxiety? Also this rash around my mouth (and eyes) come back (a little) and stuck around for months now. Its not as bad as a year ago but still very visible. Ive tried a lot of things to help it. Creams, oils, apple cider vinegar. Nothing seems to work. So im thinking maybe it is stress, and maybe that is due to social anxiety. But i hardly ever feel physical stress.

My children are fluent and attend school in German. Everything here is German. And I feel so locked into myself here. I cannot make small talk in German or think on my feet or be myself in German. My social anxiety, which has been under control for many years, has made an intense comeback since we moved here.  I am anxious about every phone call, every casual encounter with the neighbour, every school run... and this is just the day to day stuff. I am supposed to find a job here (in German), since this is where I live now, but find even buying a bus ticket stressful so it seems impossible. I spend my days avoiding people and when I encounter them I freeze mentally and can't come up with anything to say. This is very frustrating as I am 40 and all the progress I made over the past 20 years in terms of my Social Anxiety has been wiped out. I feel ashamed, isolated, intimidated by everyone and barely remembering who I was only 3 years ago when I could say what I meant, laugh, be me. I see other expats arriving and speaking terrible German unselfconsciously and enjoying life here, the fresh air of the Alps, but I just can't. Due to personal circumstances I don't think it's possible to move away anytime soon. I need to overcome this and make a life here. But instead I feel as if I'm disappearing, dissolving, going under. I've lived in several countries by the way, but could get by in English in all the others, and always adapted within a year or two.

I had just graduated and didn't have a job for those months, just pretty much living in my room at my parents house smoking pot and playing computer games. It totally destroyed my self confidence.

When this fear comes over I have trouble comprehending what people are saying. I start to focus on the sounds of the words they're saying. Then when I realize it's happening, I try to focus on the substance of what they're saying, but for some reason my mind just can't grasp it.\n\nIt's really one of the worst pains in the world.

Got some insight to be there early otherwise it gets packed real fast.\n\nSo I dressed up in my best. Dress shirt, sweater vest, tie, nice khakis. An advisor seen me and told me I would be walking away with a job with how sharp I looked. A friend said \"you get cleaned up pretty good\". So both of them raised my spirits and got me feeling good about myself.

He recognized my name on my resume. Honestly, I forgot I applied, but I acted like \"yes sir, I applied a couple weeks ago, look forward to hearing from you.\" shook his hand and walked away.

I met with all the employers who were looking for CIT grads tho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, just to figure out how to interview and then work with this burden on social anxiety. It's crippling. I often cry in stressful situations and like Help Desk IS stressful. I'm looking forward to it because I want to work again. Then, I'm not looking forward to it because I'm afraid I can't do it and then my husband and family will be disappointed in me. So I have lots of people counting on me, not only myself. And plus, I want my Jeep Wrangler, only way I can get one is to get a job. So....gonna need some Xanax for a while. lol\n\n\nTL;DR : Just wanted to share how I overcame social anxiety today for just a little while.\n\nEdit: thanks y\u2019all. My husband said he was proud of me. So did my advisor and counselor. I\u2019m pretty proud of myself. ",

        "title": "Yet another \"I did it\" post? Not at all...",
        "original": "After a long time lurking around on reddit, I decided to post again, because I think I might provide you with some wise words. \n\nAs said in the title, I don't want to post another \"I did it\"-story, nor do I hunger for compliments or else. But I want to tell you the short story of my last 3 years:\n\nOver the last three years I got really sick because of my social anxiety. You all know that life is extremly struggeling with this type of \"disorder\". So I was at the point, where social anxiety led to depression and even to suicidal thoughts. I was clever enough to get professional help over these years and I finaly still here, despite of all thoughts. \nBut things changed, and probably because I changed. 10 years ago, when started studying, I thought it would be a good idea, to start training karate... which was more an attempt to get into social interaction than to learn anything about karate or martial arts. I was just trying stuff out...\nDespite of my social anxiety I stayed in training and three years ago, when things in my life started to collapse (study failed, was forced to move to another city, got unemployed and even my GF left me) it affected one of my karate belt test... and as everyone here can imagin, I quit. I quit karate, I quit all the stuff I loved. Or I thought though.\nAfter a few weeks I started to \"train\" again, only for me, and only at home, doing some easy karate stuff. And I realized I can't live without it. Another few weeks later, I returned to regular training, although I thought everyone would laught or bully me because I failed the belt test. But nothing happened and I was confused because I didn't understand what happenend. And for the first time in my life I was directly able to intervene this over-selfcritical thinking spiral which leads to anxiety.\n\nAfter all this stuff what happened to me I had become what I was looking for when I started with karate: a real warrior, a warrior in the way which the old samurai called bushido. I nearly immediatly started to learn anything of the philosophy of budo, bushido, zen etc. and I tried to understand what these guys thought and felt this times.\n\nLong story short (I know it's probably to late at this point) I managed to get my life back on track nearly a half year ago. I got an extremly interesting job, this month I got permanetly employed and in about 20 days I'll have my black belt test in karate.\nSeems paradisely but isn't, my social anxiety was and is always there, with every step I did on this long way I sh*** my pants (not literally) because I could say or do something wrong, talk to \"potential harmful\" people or be in any awkward situation. But I've grown up, with every step I did.\n\nThe only advice I can give to you is: Just go on. We, here at /r/socialanxiety, are NOT insane, mad or so. We are humans. We are not different to the guy or girl in the bus next to you. We are not different to the dumb guy who crosses the road despite of a red light. We are just like anyone else. \nThe only thing which makes us feel uncomfortable in this world is this stupid \"brain mill\" which causes us to think and overthink.   \n\nBut the \"ancient\" masters taught me something. Be happy with your mistakes, because they make you a person, but don't use your mistakes as an excuse to not become a better person. \nEveryone of us here on /r/socialanxiety has a different background, a different story and different symptomes, but I feel pretty sure that everyone can get calm mind when you do what ever pleases yourself. In my point of view this is a state of meditaion, emptiness in your mind. Your thoughts get silent, because you're in this moment with your whole mind, body and personality. \nIn budo this is called zanshin (\u6b8b\u5fc3), a state of inner harmony and high attention. Next time your social anxiety \"kicks in\" try thinking about this. Your feelings, your reaction, your panic... this is YOU. And this is was makes you to yourself. So smile and be proud of it, and dont blame a god, a spaghetti monster or anything else for what you are. Just be... \n\nFor further readings to understand what I tried to say, I recommend you two books, the Hagakure by Tsunetomo Yamamoto and the gorin no sho (Book of five Rings) by Miyamoto Musashi. The philosophy easier to understand than you might think. But in any case of questions, always ask yourself if it fits your heart and logic. Don't eat it from the plate. \n\nI don't wish all of you the best, because the best is what happens to everyone everyday. I wish you to have the wisdom to recognize that it happens. This is what makes a real warrior. \n\nPS: I'm not a native speaker, so please forgive me some stupid words/sentence",

        "original": "Hi all,\n\nBrand new to Reddit but a long time lurker. I've decided to try and take some action over an ongoing situation that's stretched out these past few weeks, and maybe you guys might be able to help me? From what I gather, the people here seem decent and some of the advice I've seen dished out over the years is excellent, so I might as well give it a go.\nJust to start off with, I'll give you some basic information on what's up. I'm 20, a shiny new uni student in her first year, first semester and living with some pretty intense social anxiety and depression that's been ongoing since I was about 11. \nMy teenage years were chaotic and everything that could've gone wrong went wrong. I'd just moved schools, had no friends because I was way too shy and depressed, I watched a relative die slowly from cancer, I'd made up my mind that I wouldn't live past 18, starved myself, the whole works. I had zero self esteem and couldn't relate to anyone, and at the time, those years were the worst years of my life up until two years ago when my anxiety reached it's peak. \nI'd dropped out of uni because it had gotten to a point when I no longer gave a fuck about anything, or so I thought. Turns out my anxiety had manifested into panic disorder, and I'm talking agoraphobia, fear of being harmed or killed by strangers, panic attacks from the moment I woke up until I managed to finally put myself to sleep. Pure unbridled fear, and I lost a shit ton of weight too because I physically couldn't bring myself to eat. It was so bad I lived in constant fear of going insane and ending up in a madhouse, had an intense fear of meds and was convinced I'd kill myself, whether accidentally or not. \nLast year I somehow managed to pull myself out of the shit, drug free and without any outside help, aside from my best friend and my Mum. (Please don't do this, get help) I studied and worked the hardest I've ever worked to get back to uni (because I failed so many units last time, it was hard slog), and having achieved what should've been an impossible task through the most perseverance I'd had in years, I got back into my dream school, studying what I really love and got accepted to live at a residential college that's super hard to get into because it's so popular.\nThe first two months of uni I was happier than I'd ever been. Talking to people, going to classes, trying new things, I'd never felt so confident. But out of everything I did, talking to this boy was one of the best things I ever did. This was day one, ONE hour into my uni journey. I sit down at this table as it fills up and I'm chatting away with almost every one. I couldn't believe how well I was doing. This guy sits next to me and eats his dinner, not saying a word. An hour later, every one eventually  finishes and leaves and it's just me and this guy. Just as I'm sitting there wondering if it'd be strange to say hello so late, he reaches out his hand and introduces himself to me. I laugh and tell him I was just stewing over whether or not to say hi and we immediately hit it off. He's kind of quiet, but well spoken, and everything we talk about just seems to come naturally. An hour later, we exchange details and I'm overjoyed. Finally, a nice cruisey guy I can make buds with!\nOr so I thought. \nFlash forward seven weeks and I have a massive crush on this guy. The first few weeks it was all kosher, he invites me around campus to do stuff, I invite him in return, and even though we don't see each other very often (two very different majors), he's unbelievably easy to talk to and just a really nice guy. \nThen I realise I have a crush on him.\nAt first I thought it was anxiety, because I've never had a crush before. \nBut man.\nThis is a crush. \nEvery time I see him it's like a gut punch, and I feel so winded. It's not just the fact that he's mega cute, but his personality is absolutely amazing. We also share a lot of common interests so we have heaps to talk about, which definitely helps in the developing-a-crush-department.\nI really like this dude, but I'm so lost. I feel like we're friends but at the same time I don't really know him at all. We've talked for hours over several occasions but seven weeks isn't nearly enough time to get to know someone right? \nSo how am I already crushing on this guy so hard? \nThe thing is that it's hard to say if it's one sided, but maybe it's because of how badly I want to pursue this, despite how scared shitless I am, and that I really want it to work out. He's not much of a texter and rarely gets back to me when we text, (but considering his major, completely understandable). He's not inviting me places at the moment and sometimes I wonder if he's trying to create some distance between us. The thing is when we do catch up and talk, it's super comfortable and natural and I don't feel unwelcome at all. The other day we spent 2 and a half hours talking after lunch, then at dinner (we'd both well and truly finished before I approached him, by the way) another 1 and a half, and even then as we walked out of the dining hall he encouraged me to continue. \nThe overarching issue is that while my first few weeks here were spent on an immeasurable high, the past 3 weeks I've seen some pretty low lows. I've become super self conscious and next to had a nervous break down. As a result, I isolated myself from my friends and stopped saying hi to people, and he was one of them, because I didn't want to burden him. It has nothing to do with other people, but often when I feel like this I have this idea in my head that I annoy people, and I worry constantly about annoying him, even though I find it hard to imagine him getting annoyed at anyone.\nEven though I know for a fact this guy is single, I feel like I'm not good enough and annoying and being too pushy. I'm dropping so many hints, so surely he'd get them by now, right? But then again, dropping hints is so medicore and I can't expect something to be obvious to him because its obvious to me. But then again, maybe he's just not interested and too polite to say so. I have no idea.\nThe thing is that I think he's like me, especially with things he's said before. He's the quiet type, and sometimes I wonder if he worries about the same things I do too. But he also rarely ever says hi to me, even when he passes me directly on the way to class (and I know for a fact he sees me), but maybe I've brought this on myself during those two weeks where I retreated back into my shell.\nHe takes up so much space in my head and I wonder sometimes if this is just anxiety running it's course. I doubt I take up any space in his, but I am a chronic overthinker, and this has bothered me for weeks. \nHe told me he's only staying here a year before moving out and now I feel like I need to say something at least once or l'll regret it. But I don't have a lot of self confidence and I honestly believe he's way out of my league. \nIs it really fair that I expect him to date someone with a history like mine, especially with all my personal problems? I don't want to pass that onto him.  It sucks ass, and I like him too much to want to ever do that.\nAs it stands, I believe I have a few options. \n1) Stop giving a fuck and obsessing over this (aka, live in the moment) and focus on building our friendship before anything else (I like this one and am already pursuing this one, but yet again, am I being too pushy?)\n2) Let it go, even knowing he's single, and regret it for the next few years or possibly forever. \n\nHe also has Tindr, so should I swipe right? We live so close together though, and if this goes pear shaped I don't want it to be awkward between us.\n\nThis is long as shit but I need some serious help. I've talked to my Mum and friends about this but sometimes an outside perspective can really help with these kinds of things. You'd seriously make my year.\n\nIts my first time posting so I just wanna finish by saying that I hope you guys are doing well in your endeavours. If you needed to hear it today, I'm proud of each and every one of you. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your replies soon.\n\nTdlr; I have a crush. \n\nHelp.",

My computer recently broke a few months ago and idk but i think thats the best thing which has ever happened to me even though i loved it. i used to play video games literally everyday after school with no contact with my friends. Now i hardly play a game for a hour a day, im always out with my girlfriend i hang out after college with my mates. Im still a introverted person when im out but i talk more and im actually outside.\n\n**Two**, interacting with humans. i know thats your worse fear but you have to do it, when having a conversation you have to make yourself talk more even know you may be shy to or not bothered to, as well starting conversations, trust me i hated doing it myself but i learned and i still am and it really is helping me. Its coming to a point where i feel more confident than the person im talking to.\n\n**Three,**  Think positively dont let past experiences hold you back because every situation is different. I used to not go out in a group with my friends because i hated talking in a group incase i said something and no one answered and it came really awkward, now im going out with friends i dont even know half of because it brings you so much more joy than being inside, trust me it may be scary at the start but after a while it all changes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo overall social anxiety will disappear if you work on it, dont let, your inside hobbies such as gaming take over your life and keep you from your friends, just be more social and the change will come trust me. As well do not take shit from others, ik social anxiety can make you cower down in controversial situations but dont let that happen fight back or it becomes worse.",

Skip to the second paragraph because thats whats making me crazy right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My annoying rant (just skip it)**: Soo I'm 18f, and I've had social anxiety probably since I started high school. I think around age 15 - 16 it started to really affect my mental health though. I couldn't make friends, I was lonely, and I didn't want to tell my parents (still haven't - don't understand how they don't know ?!). I desperately scoured the internet for some cure to social anxiety, but what i read only made me feel more hopeless (I wanted a quick and easy fix, I didn't want to admit I had a real problem). I thought I had a terrible, boring personality, which, combined with social anxiety, was why no one wanted to be my friend. This was the beginning of a deep deep hole dug for myself and consequently fell into. I came up with the brilliant idea that if I was skinny and pretty, people would like me. So I began making myself throw up. It happened in waves - sometimes I'd do it multiple times a day every day of the week. Sometimes I'd do it a few times a week. I became obsessed with my appearance, weighing myself all the time, and feeling terrible about how I looked. I then began to binge-eat and then purge. Almost every day. I gained weight (not stacks - i wouldn't say I'm \"fat\" but I'm not skinny) and this made things worse. I still have this obsession with food and my appearance to this day. On top of this, I started to feel really depressed and just completely hopeless. I had convinced myself that I would never have a boyfriend, would probably be a virgin for life and may as well join a nunnery (and I'm not even religious), and that I'll probably die of loneliness (as in kill myself because I'll be an old, fat, ugly, lonely, virgin). I'm still convinced of this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Present day:** I'm in my second year of uni. I'm living in student accomodation, which consists of an apartment with 2 other flat mates, both female. I can't make friends with them, because I'm too socially weird. But our walls are thin, and i can always hear them laughing and talking outside (i can hear every word) and it is making me crazy. It makes me feel so inadequate, that I can't talk and laugh. They must think I'm am such an awkward weirdo. I never want to go out and face them. Every time I talk to them I say something really weird. I feel anxious 24-7. It makes my anxiety so much worse because it makes me realise what I'm missing out on. It makes me feel depressed. And the worse part - I'm stuck listening to their talking and laughing (i can hear every word outside my door). Hours and hours. I wish I culd just go out and join in and be normal. But i'm stuck on the other side of the door, going crazy. I can't sleep anymore because every time I hear them talking my mind starts going in circles. I sometimes stand by the door and listen to what they are saying because I think they are talking about me. I am actually going crazy. I can't escape their voices. It's like, someone flaunting in your face what is wrong with you for hours a day. I don't know if this makes sense, but I just had to tell someone I feel like i'm going crazy in my room. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's like they say, with mental illnesses, its like, buy one, get seven free.

Writing at work.\n\nFirst some background to help you understand why I'm so confused about this issue: I'm a 24 year old financial professional. I work out almost every day. I try to eat as healthy as possible. This includes taking Super greens recently to make sure I'm getting plenty of good vitamins. All of this came on very suddenly about a year ago and the symptoms seems to come and go as they please. So far I haven't found much that specifically triggers the worst symptoms\n\nI currently suffer from what doctors/specialists think is **functional dyspepsia** and/or GERD. I have yet to sit down with a psychologist. Being that I'm only 24 years old its hard to believe that its as bad as it appears to be by itself. I'm not totally sure how common this form of GERD or acid reflux is at my age but I can't imagine it's THIS serious in most cases. I have also struggled with social anxiety my entire life. However, I'm kind of at a cross roads where I'm leaning toward the anxiety rather than stomach issues or maybe a combination of both being the cause of my problems. \n\n**My main symptoms or I guess issues are**   \n\n\u00b7 Nausea (This one is by far the worst)\n\n\u00b7 Constipation\n\n\u00b7 Cold sweats (Usually happens when I'm nauseous)\n\n\u00b7 Fatigue\n\n\u00b7 Lack of energy\n\n\u00b7 Exhaustion\n\n\u00b7 Trouble sleeping (Trouble falling asleep, Waking up at night, getting up in the morning)\n\n\u00b7 Little to no appetite when other symptoms are present (Which is basically all morning/afternoon)\n\n\u00b7 Upset stomach/nausea after a meal (Not right after but usually within an hour)\n\n\u00b7 Gas/Bloating\n\n\u00b7 Headaches\n\n\u00b7 Pressure/fuzziness in ears almost like when you\u2019re sick or when you\u2019re on a plane (Happens both with and without the nausea and whatnot)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent most of last summer in and out of the doctors office without making any real progress with them. I've given their medication and treatments more than enough time to have a chance at fixing me to no avail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm desperate for answers or any kind of information that can put my mind at ease with this shit show. I'm getting to the point where I'm losing a lot of drive to do basic things and I feel like I'm going down a hole with these problems.\n\n**TL:DR I'm desperate for answers or to hear any similar experiences with these symptoms and what I should do about them.**  \n\n**ALSO I APOLOGIZE IF THIS DOESN'T DIRECTLY RELATE TO SOCIAL ANXIETY.

I don't know 3 years later I'm just in my room isolated hating life wasting life.  It all started when I failed school miserably and I had to quit because my grades weren't enough so I went into a depression I guess and after that things escalated quickly into worse things\n\nI used to hate myself for wasting time wasting my life, today I don't know if I care about living or just being alive, I just hate myself for doing nothing, it's just stuck in my mind can't get out without feeling shit crap or I can't talk to people anymore. I used to have a friend a good life until my brain stopped functioning. I have never talked to people about my issues especially not to my family they would never understand trust me.

        "original": "Hello Friends,\n\nI've (24 M) been a lurkin' for a few months now and I'd like to start my first post with some words of appreciation. I really like how people from all over the world choose to support eachother through some hard times of loneliness and estrangement! You guys are awesome and thanks for taking the time to help each other out!\n\nSo now my tales.\n\nI think I\u2019ve been struggling with some level of social anxiety for most of my life. For most of my life I\u2019ve had the feeling of having too little to say and just being a boring person in general. I\u2019ve had a few things I have been able to bond over with people. First music, than skateboarding and later smoking weed and drinking. So that kind of became my identity. The party-guy who was always up for a night out and getting shitfaced. Through this identity it became relatively easy to connect to people and maintain friendships and such. \n\nFast forward to today. I haven\u2019t smoked weed in years and hardly drink at all, because I value my mental and physical health over the bursts of joy during the night. Therefore, I\u2019m not too sad about losing drinking in my life. However, finding new means of connection has been rough and I sometimes feel like my anxiety has been increasing with every week that I don\u2019t go out partying. I feel I\u2019ve lost a part of my identity and replaced it with a sort of bitterness.\n\nWhen I do go out to parties I notice that I\u2019m very self-conscious and can\u2019t really get beyond smalltalk with people. When we do get to a more serious subject I\u2019m often very confrontational about \u2018the climate\u2019 and \u2018the consumerist lifestyle\u2019. So if you\u2019re wondering \u2018You must be fun at parties?\u2019.. Well not so much :P\n\nI also feel that I could force myself to go back to a certain \u2018mask\u2019 of being loud and jokey and outgoing, but it would feel very ingenuine and almost sort of manipulative. \n\nI really long for a sense of connection and friendship, and also for romantic connection at some point, but I simply don\u2019t know how to bond with people without putting up this \u2018party-persona\u2019 that I myself don\u2019t really like. \n\nThen there\u2019s an entirely different thing that I\u2019ve been noticing. Whenever I do go to parties or other large social gatherings, I\u2019ve noticed that within the first ten minutes my brain scans the room for the most attractive girl (to me ofcourse) in the room. I then start obsessing over how this person would see me and how I should talk to her, but don\u2019t dare too and it becomes a battle in my mind.

He feels self-conscious at parties, struggles with small talk, and often becomes confrontational about serious topics. Additionally, he frequently obsesses over the most attractive girl in the room at social gatherings, which exacerbates his anxiety and hinders positive interactions.",

However, I\u2019m planning to transfer courses + unis and I really want to be able to make friends but I usually make friends through other friends and now I will be starting from scratch again with no friends and my shyness and anxiety has increased sharply in the past few years due to certain events so I don\u2019t know how to approach being the first one to approach people and initiate conversation and I\u2019m also way too scared to do so :,)\n\nI do like being alone but it does really have an effect on me mentally when I am always alone....

Google helped me find a parking garage. It's scary going to lawyer offices and eventually court. And i had a take a trip to the IRS around this time for a separate issue. \n\nOn top of all this, i had to move out of my home and move back with my mother, sister and my mothers partner who is the biggest pain you have ever seen (i'm getting to that).\nI went from living alone to not having much freedom. But with free rent and food i can't complain. \n\nMy mother can be a pain as well, but i can put up with it. But boy is she a pain out in public. She can push my anxiety. But unfortunately she is not the kind of person i can talk about my anxiety to. She would never understand. So i don't bother. \n\nBut her partner is one of the most rude and nasty people i have ever met. I don't why my mother has stayed with him so long. All they do is argue at each other. But they been doing that for over 20 years now. It's so weird. She even knows how vile he is. He's rude, racist and a pain. He's one of those people who worked hard growing up and expects it out of everyone else. He triggers my anxiety like you can't believe. He is one of the main reasons i moved away a long time ago. But i have to just put up with it for now until i get back on my feet. Luckily i don't see him much. He has a daily routine and i work around that. He usually just talks about me behind my back to my mother. She don't care but it still bothers me. She always takes my side, but he's the person who loves running his mouth just to hear himself talk. \n\nI'm a 45 year old man and i'm hiding from people. :(\n\nI don't know what the future has in store for me. i work from home so i hide in my room most of the time. I should be happy doing that but it's not easy to relax with all that goes on.

        "original": "\n   I have a crush on a boy, and a really big one. I'm shy, and just barely starting to be able to speak to boys. The boy I like is quiet, kinda nerdy and really not my type. I usually like the more outgoing popular guys, ones pretty much exact opposite of me. My friends are the popular girls, and I'm just the quiet kid who just sits there and says something once in a blue moon. His friends are (no offence..) The weirdos who play Pokemon during class. He doesn't do it himself, but that's weird. We have two opposite friend groups, so if we did date it would be hard for me to not be mean to his friends. \n   I've known him since elementary, but only liked him recently. I sat at the same table with him in English. We sat with another girl who I hate and I would only talk to him. We mainly only spoke about our work, but at times we would joke around. We talked a lot when the other girl was absent, and somtimes when I completed a group assignment before him he would jokingly say that he could take it home and copy it. I only saw him as a friend then. \n    Our teacher changed our seats as she usually does every so often, and I was moved away from him. I never noticed how great that table was until I left it. I still didn't like him yet, but did miss him. I got next to the teachers pet who became one of my friends, but left to sit someone by the teacher. I was left with another Pokemon player. Great. \n    One day in class we played a game where 5 people were picked to be aliens and tried to kill all the normal people. When I got out by that girl at my old table, I got to see who the aliens were. It was him. It shocked me and when he saw my face he laughed. I don't know why but I felt intensely in love with him at that moment. I don't know why. I only saw him as a friend, now I want him to be much more. I think I fell for his personality, which is pretty common for me. It never has felt like this before. Now everyday in class I can't help but worry that hes looking at me, so I uncomfortably try to improve my posture and pick my shoulders up from the table. I start blushing and smiling uncontrollably when I see his face, and start smiling when I think of him. I've only one other time had a crush on somebody who gets to my head like this, and that I know well personally. The last boy I liked liked me back, and we were best friends but never dated. \n    I think be might possibly like me because he knows me better than most in the class, and he'll stop to talk to me in the  hall. I don't have much other than he picked up my pencil pouch after some boy dropped it on purpose just to annoy me (would have beat him up or cussed him out but my crush was there and if I get detention before field day I can't go). \n  The problem is that I can't make a move and I doubt he will since he doesn't know me well enough yet, but we can't know eachother well enough because our only class together is English, where we sit across the room from one another. We only have 5 weeks of school left, and idk if he has a phone so we might not even be able to text over the summer. Also the possibilities. He might be gay, have a girlfriend, strict parents, or just not like me. I've never had a boyfriend or asked anyone out. I've had people ask me out, I know I'm not ugly, I'm fat, but it all really goes to my butt and I'm well proportioned. I don't have a fat face or stomach. I don't have ratty hair. Don't have bad acne. Not a terrible personality as long as nobody says anything mean to me. Get new clothes every week, shoes every 2-4 months, and don't smell bad. Guys do have diffrent tastes though.  \n    I can't even ask about what he's interested in either, because I have no way to talk to him without getting in trouble. I'm pretty sure I'll have to wait until next school year and pray that we have classes together. I don't even know how I can make it through summer. I barely made it through spring break. \n   I really wanna be with him even though I know it'll be over in a year, but I really feel like I love him. I know you can't fall in love with someone you talk to once a week, but it can't be infatuation. I don't care how he looks as long as he isn't garbage. Even then I don't think I'd complain. He wears the same vans everyday but I couldn't care less. I just want to be with him.\n  How do I try to see him more if my parents wouldn't allow me to? And if he might not have a phone. I can find ways to talk to him at school, but I would need to get an excuse to talk to him. I'm too shy. Help please.",

        "original": "I am 17 years old and I've always been introverted ( I enjoy going out with people and socializing and I open myself to everyone but there is nobody that cares for me and that wants to talk with me  ). I only had 3 friends my whole life even though I get along well with almost everybody. I used to spend all my time alone ( studying, reading, gaming, listening to music, doing sports, etc ) but I always wanted to talk to people and to be popular. I also went through a \"darker\" period of my life, developing an eating disorder ( I know that is pretty anormal for a male but I guess I just had bad luck ) which caused me to lose a lot of weight ( I am still skinny but I managed to partially overcome my disorder and now I go to gym and I try to have a balanced diet ). I had crushes before but I was afraid of talking with girls in general. Until I met someone special. We would talk on whatsapp for hour and hours about everything each night. I knew from the way she was acting around me that she liked me ( which was very strange given the fact that I wasn't popular or special at all ). She was very responsive, she was initiating conversations, she wanted to go out with me and do all sort of things together. She was in love with me but I didn't feel anything special for her yet ( I became having feelings for her at the end of our relationship ). One day I asked her to be my girlfriend and she happily accepted. Although we were talking a lot through text messages ( on whatsapp ), we didn't go out that often because I live far from the city and because I am involved in Model United Nations and public speaking which means that I travel a lot. Everything was wonderful but due to my lack of experience in relationships I wasn't that good at expressing my feelings for her and at showing her my affection ( I later found out that this was making her upset and consuming her ). She even bought me an expensive present for my birthday. I was falling in love with her. One night when I was talking with her about life and about being introverted I said something like \"... sometimes I feel like there is nobody with whom I can talk about all my problems\" ( I know, I was an idiot for I saying that but I didn't think that much about it then ), she suddenly disconnected. I couldn't get in touch with her for 3 days straigh but her friends told me that was deeply hurt by what I said and that she cried a lot that night. I wrote her an appology and she forgave me. But things weren't the same anymore. She wasn't that responsive, she would find excuses for not going out with me, she wouldn't initiate conversations anymore and when I asked her if everything was alright she became angry. I tried seeking for help and speaking to her friends ( who hated me for being with her ) but they made everything worse. One day, she told me she wants to break up with me ( which surprised me a lot ) but because I begged her, she said she was going to give me another chance. But she didn't. She ignored me for 1 whole month and then finally broke up with me. I was devastated. I couldn't believe that the girl who was so happy around me and who loved me that much would give up so easily and get over me in such a short time, but I knew that it was all my fault. I knew that if I wouldn't have sent that text and if I wouldn't have went to her friends for help, we would have still been together. I also found out thay one of my only friends ( who was also a close friend of hers ) was talking me behind my back and sabotaging my relationship. She now hates me ( blocked me on whatsapp and on instagram and ignores me when we meet ) but I still love her and I can't stop thinking about her and about how perfect and beautifull she is.I've tried focusing on school and on my hobbies but it didn't help. I now don't have anyone besides me, no one I can talk to, no one I can love. I feel sad and alone. It's been 1 month since she left me and I still go to bed crying every night. Sorry for the very long post and for venting and crying out on Reddit but I just can't take it anymore. What should I do now to get over her and to be happy again ? Also what can I do to make some friends and maybe find someone else ? I am open to any sugestions and opinions. Thanks",

It\u2019s like a sort of \u201cpressure\u201d feeling. And I don\u2019t even know if the girls there in the Target that I work at like me or not but they always play with their hair when I\u2019m around them, but I don\u2019t notice to much because I\u2019m timid and also don\u2019t want to appear creepy in these situations, anyways I kept telling myself for the past few weeks \u201cOk you know what fuck this shy retarded bullshit and approach anyway\u201d but in fact this for some reason made it even worse and now I became even more self conscious after attempting that foolish idea, and most of the time they are serious or I guess they have as some will call it a \u201cResting bitch face\u201d when I get near them, and that obviously makes it more intimidating for me. \n\nSo how do I gain courage the correct way and approach them and get it over with? I\u2019ve heard the quote saying \u201cThe best way to eliminate fear is to go through it and not around it\u201d and I\u2019m trying so hard to go through but I just can\u2019t do it, I have scenarios in my head about making my move and getting over with it, but in the moment of the moment all of that becomes completely useless and I become awkward once again, and trust me I\u2019m trying my absolute hardest to overcome this extreme shyness but to no avail. so yea just any advice to over come this obstacle because I do have interest in one and if I keep up this foolish behavior they will think I\u2019m weird or something and move on. \n\nAny advice to my situation will be helpful, thanks!",

Edit: I'm a male.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo start off, today I cancelled an Interview/Meeting with a recruitment agency, we were supposed to go through some contractual job openings that I could be a fit for, I feel like I messed up a dozen opportunities right there all in one flash all because I felt like throwing up 3 hours before my interview. The one thing I got down now though are phone interviews/phone calls even though I still shake (including my voice a little bit). I cancelled the interview 2.5 hours before the scheduled time, made up the usual emergency excuse and apologized a lot, trying to make it seem like I had no choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You can stop reading here if you want to, the part below is a wall of text and is something I want to share as an outlet and also to confirm if I really do have Social anxiety or am I just scared, lacking confidence and experience or just plain lazy. feel free to voice even your harshest opinions if you manage to read through. TL;DR at bottom.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt took a long time for me to graduate college, Couldn't finish in 5 years so, the biggest reason had to be the Final Thesis Defense in front a panel of professors, I chickened out twice on this. I decided to stop and work for a startup in my home country as a Web Developer which I was extremely mediocre at. This was the only real Job interview I ever had to experience in life and the only reason I got the job was because a good friend of mine works there, the setup was also really chill and I was interviewing along with another friend so I was calmer than usual but I knew if it was any other big corporate company I would have made excuses not to take it. About a year later the company was struggling with our monthly paychecks so about another half a year later I left and since I didn't have a degree at the time If I ever tried applying for another job my resume goes straight into the bin (My home country really puts an emphasis into only hiring college graduates except for Call centers and I hate talking to people). So I go back to college now with a bit more experience in me and being a bit more responsible, I finally graduate after another year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow after graduating I still felt like I was never going to be good enough for a company, I always thought I was destined to fail so I never applied for anything afterwards. I was just a NEET with a diploma. After awhile since I thought I was never gonna be good enough for any kind of office job, I asked my parents to bring me into Japan, my fathers japanese so it was easy, here I decided to just get into labor work while i learn japanese. Now why wouldnt I just work labor in my home country you ask? because the average salary for entry level jobs back home is 300 dollars a month. Working labor in japan while I would only pay a portion to help out in the household seems like a way better option in life especially if I decided to save up and come back home. A part of me tried to convince myself that this is a step forward out of my comfort zone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm here now, after 8 months of waiting (yep). Decided to try my luck with a couple English only companies. There wasn't alot that I could cater to with my current skillset and since Im not N2 level japanese yet (business level), my options are limited. As I forced myself to apply for about 10 companies, a recruiter reaches out to me for a career opportunity. This got me excited but also super anxious because he wanted to talk to me over the phone the next day. I stare at my laptop trying to google dozens of email templates so I was sure I wasn't gonna say something stupid. Something as basic as an email makes me nervous and It would take me an hour and a half to muster something up. I get the phone call the next day, this would be my very first ever official phone interview and Im shaking as hell. It went okay as to me a phone call isn't as bad as a face to face interview but afterwards it still left me exhausted even though we only talked for 30minutes, I just wanted to go to bed for like 18 hours after . Anyway, recruiter sends me the details for the job, It wasnt what I was expecting and it seemed like the traditional Japanese company that required you to work long hours for little pay (yes, those are real). Even though I know I needed this and was in no position to get picky, the recruiter emphasized alot of my short comings in our conversation too, Like my resume wasn't looking too good, which I agree it wasn't for my current track record but I still rejected it simply because I was scared. I move on and tell myself, the next one for sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDays pass, and I get a phone call from one of the companies I specifically applied to, got through the phone interview, even though out of nervousness I forgot answers to questions I knew answers to. Days later I am faced with a new challenge an online coding test that had the companies CTO looking over my code as I work, and no surprise I freeze for awhile, answer the first problem through numerous errors, while mumbling im sorry and just blank on the second one and I had to solve as many as I can within 45 minutes, I honestly knew how to solve it if I was left alone to my own resources but having another person breathing down on me as I work really messed me up, this was also an issue back in my first job when my senior would look at my screen when I work. This was my only chance and I completely choked. I felt so frustrated at myself after this that I started working on my coding and totally put learning japanese aside. Around this point I semi-give up and applied for a meat factory and a vegetable cutting factory for airline food. Don't get me wrong I still got nervous for the interviews but I knew I couldn't screw these up as bad as technical interviews with big companies so I went through forcefully no problem. I would get nervous enough to forget asking key details like is there a night shift, how much of the transportation fee is covered etc etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple days after, another recruitment agency contacts me over a job I applied for that sadly I wasn't a fit for but they wanted to talk over some contractual positions I might be interested in but required me to go to their office which I agreed at first but then bailed out 2.5 hours before. This one messed with my head even more. They asked questions why I was unemployed for so long and why it took me a long time to graduate, and the simple answer to that would have been because I was a slacker But I wasn't going to say that. I tried my best at saying nothing too personal and just went with something akin to \"I was struggling\", honestly couldn't make up a lie on the spot like family or monetary problems, but then again what do I tell them if they ask why I was unemployed for so long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor now, I'm probably just accepting factory work while I enroll to some Japanese classes.\n\nI think a lot of my social anxiety stem from lack of confidence. I weight 93kg with 5'5 ft Height, considered obese, I always look so stupid and dumpy with formal clothes on and Hate going out in them, I don't have a big portfolio or an impressive resume to show off to get work on top of the big gaping hole that is my time of unemployment and my long time in college. Working abroad was never going to be easy, but I'm making things more complicated than it needs to be. Maybe if I worked on these, things will look up, but honestly I just feel unmotivated and hopeless. Japan also has to be the worst place to suffer from mental health problems compared to anywhere else in the world. I was thinking if I could afford it, see a specialist and maybe get proper meds that could help with whatever im going through. Things were way worse when I was younger though, only through time and being forced to act like an adult do I get to do what I do today. Up until college though I could never order fast food alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**-Graduated college very late due to fear of speaking in front people (Thesis Defense).**\n\n**-Unemployed over fear of interviews. I keep cancelling.**\n\n**-Went abroad to push myself only for things to get worse.**\n\n**-Fail coding tests because of anxiety.**\n\n**-Personally, I think alot of my fears stem from personal appearance and lack of accomplishments.**\n\n**-Wanting to do better but lacking any motivation to do so.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese last two years have been the worst part of my life, I wanna do something about it so bad but Im becoming my worst enemy. worst case scenario, Im either back home doing nothing again or tough it out and be a factory worker forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nto anyone who reads this, **thank you.**",

        "original": " \n\nFirst time post on this subreddit. I've tried on other subreddits, but didnt get as many responses, but I hope I get some suggestions from this one.\n\nSo I am a 17 male in year 12 who thinks that my life is a failure. Since i was in year 7 i was bullied because of things which i couldn't fix, such as my voice, my ugly head, and my name. when i get introduced to younger people in my school they even think that I am autistic because of the way i talk and look. When year 9 came, it started to be daily, and it was so bad that i just gave up and just accepted the fact that I was a failure. I mean, i thought there was literally nothing i could do. My marks from assignments and exams fell from 80s to 60s, and then to 50s and sometimes even to 40s and 30s. I feel like those fucking assholes (10-20 people) in my school took 6 years away from my life.\n\nNot everyone was mean to me, but i could see from pretty much everyone's facial expression that they either doesn't like me, doesn't want to be with me because they don't want to be in a group with someone who gets bullied by other people. People were only my 'friends', because they felt sorry for me but in reality, every single one of them hated me, and i could see it. I was always left out in groups, always the last person to do things, always the last person to be picked in sport. Sometimes I pretended that I would 'hang out' with people and tell my mum that I was going out with friends, but I just went to some place by myself. Because of those fucking bullied, I never got to experience things like 'normal' people do, such as hanging out with friends, going to parties, going to each others houses, playing games, watching movies together, all that stuff. While other people were doing those things, I was alone, in my room, being a loner, just playing video games and watching TV. I never wanted this, but those fucking people turned my life into shit. Sure i could talk to my principle and make him expel all those people, but i was scared that he might make some kind of announcement talking about it and everyone would look at me. Even if i did do it somehow, it wouldn't change anything about me. Maybe the bullying will stop, at least for a while, but i will still be the same ugly shit.\n\nBeing bullied for 6 years changed me. Before I started high school in year 7 I was actually a pretty talkative guy, I had friends who actually liked me being around them, and actually liked talking to me. But everything changed when they found out about these things. The friends that i had before all turned on me and they became friends with the people who i hated the most. I have social anxiety every time I go outside, and I cant talk to girls for shit, god, i don't think I've had an actual conversation to a girl around my age since i was 10. I feel like I've missed out so much over these last 6 years but i couldn't do those things because of my social anxiety and bullying. I feel so fucking behind everyone else and i don't know what I'm supposed to do to improve myself. So many of the guys in my grade have a job, have female friends, and many of them even have girlfriends, but i have none of that. For the past year and a half everyday I have been playing the same goddamn movie in my head of what i could have been, if i wasn't ugly, didn't have anxiety or wasn't this fat. I could have done so much more. I just wish that i could have time traveled to my 10 year old body, but with my 17 year old soul. I could have changed so much. I've been thinking of going to therapy or speech therapy for a few weeks now, but I've been holding back ever since, because I'm scared and have social anxiety to even go there. Yes i know it could be the best decision that i make to start improving myself but because of my anxiety i haven'e been able to go.\n\nHopefully after writing this i can improve my life, thanks guys",

I'm 31 year old, female, very sensitive by nature , currently living in Florida and originally from Europe. I moved to US exactly 5 years ago and was excited to what my future holds..dreaming about job, money, experience, traveling.But it hasn't been that great,  as I am experiencing what is now the lowest point of my life. I am still single, I don't have many friends and even though I do very well at my job and hobbies, I do not seem to get ahead. I've been at my current job for 4 years, I am the top performer at work when it comes to sales, but sometimes I don't seem to be liked by my co workers and I don't know why. I wish I could say I did something wrong, but I'm very careful not to do or say anything wrong, I'm always nice, maybe a little quiet sometimes, but sometimes when I wanna talk, people just seem annoyed and uninterested.  People that suck up to my boss even though not so good at theor job, get ahead quicker, get invited to all the outings(which I'm never invited to), get promotions., I was never offered promotion after being 4 years loyal to company and best performer in sales. I just don't get it.  It makes me think there's something seriously wrong with me.  Coworker I used to be very close and worked together for 3 years, doesn't talk much to me anymore, he's nice and says hi, but kinda ignores me after that. Never had a fight, or anything like that. \n\nIt's even worse because I don't have any family and friends here (everyone is home), no support system, so when I get close to someone it really REALLY hurts when they all the sudden they distance themselves. I spent many time thinking and crying over it only makes things worse. \n\nMy roommate became my close friend the last few months we've been living together..She was a person I was happy to find because she would listen , and she would vent to me about her stuff too and we work at same job.. Became close fast after meeting, talking long every night. But funny enough, everytime I would ask her to go out/ beach / anywhere she would say no. Few weeks ago she started becoming a real bitch, started even blaming me for her breakup, cause I gave her \"wrong advice\" (she never even liked the guy and was cheating on him)- she would nit -pick all the things I say or she doesn't like about me, like \"how can you not like strawberry ice cream\" , she even attacked me for giving her an advice about work, and started to say \"no wonder people dont like you, you always have to be right\" when all I did was giving her advice..using things I vent to her about- against me!! \n\n I have never done anything to this girl, helped her with so many things, .. She didn't know where to go when I took her in,..took her suitcases,tried to get her job position in my department.. and now she is spitting all over me. For no reason! I feel like either I' m too nice, or I'm crazy or is everyone around me crazy??\n\nI m just very lost and confused, feeling insecure about my looks and getting past 30 doesnt help. have had few failed relationship-  most guys I fall for don't like me back or person that likes me- I don't like. I just broke up with a man who was in love with me, but I just wasn't and of course I felt guilty. \n\nI wanna have family but I don't know where to start when it comes to meeting a guy.

I just turned 25 literally  today and am uneemployed and to top it off I rarely ever leave my house, I am terrified of going into stores, etc. and am fearful of social interaction-I avoid it at all costs. With me turning 25 it made me think of what  caused me to get to this point. I want to start by saying that I accept responsibility for  getting myself into this mess, and not seeking professional help sooner. But at the same time, every single day is a struggle just to get up in the morning. I think what started my anxiety/ social anxiety/depression is that I was severely bullied in high school. I'm talking every single day non stop. What's even worse is the worst bullying came from my \"best friend\" who I had known since elementary school. Pair with this the fact that I have such repression with the fact that I'm gay, and never really accepted it until I  turned 23 ( and came out to my close family/ friends). I think being gay put a whole other layer on my anxiety, because I never know if people are going to accept it, be hostile towards me, laugh, or be okay with it. I was just tired of hiding my true self. I hate having to constantly worry about what others think of me but it\u2019s how my brain works. Now that I'm looking for jobs again and set an appointment to see a therapist, I'm terrified that I will never get hired for any job and that it\u2019s to late for me. The only experience I have is 2 years of cashiering from when I was 18 to 20. I literally don't care what the job  is, I'll wash dishes. But my anxiety makes me believe I don't even deserve that. I have an associates degree  that I did online and am going online for my bachelor's in a worthless field but it interests me. You would think (at least I think) I should be able to get a dishwasher job, but I honestly don't feel like anyone will hire me. I\u2019m just a fat ugly piece of shit  when it comes down to it all. I also realize there are people who have it a lot worse than me and are a lot more courageous than myself, but I don\u2019t see any pathway out of this cycle. It\u2019s hell and ik I\u2019m just a weak person who probably will one day just end it all. I can\u2019t keep living like this anymore, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense to.",

Guilt trip, if I did something wrong in school, it was constant.\n\nSo I started school. And I immediately hated it. The school would treat me like a fucking bubble boy. One day I drank out of the water fountain in first grade and the gym teacher grabbed my arm and yanked me back and screamed at me in front of all the other kids. \n\nI went to school with a bunch of asshole kids. They were the most critical, judgemental, snobby, up to do fuck wads you could ever meet. I felt like every little thing I said or did was scrutinized. If I got up and blew my nose. Everyone would stop the class and comment on it, make a big scene. I found myself faking sick a lot just so I wouldn't be there.\n\nIn the third grade I left that school and moved to a different town. I liked everyone. I had a lot of good friends. The teachers were Nazis. Our 4th grade teacher was this miserable old lesbian.. all the teachers would scream at you and berrate you in class. I was 10-11years old and I was having severe anxiety attacks, developing nervous ticks. I couldn't function and I didn't understand why. I was absolutely loaded up with homework in this shit hole school. And knowing I had to come home everyday and do two hours of homework every night was just dreadful. My mom would guilt trip and force me into doing it. I never felt relaxed.. finally I spoke to a doctor and my parents recognised it was school doing this to me..\n\nDown the road we had a disagreement with our landlord and moved to a new town.. fresh start. \nIt was the worst of both worlds. I had a terrible teacher who would scream at everyone. And I couldn't make any friends.. everyone was an asshole. They always made me feel like I was doing something wrong.. I went to school with these people from middle school to highschool and they all treated me like an outcast.. I certainly felt like it.. \n\nI had severe anxiety, depressed, virtually no self esteem.  Dad worked a lot. Mom was miserable. My siblings all had their own lives. \nThe few friends I did have never wanted to do anything. I've always been outdoorsy. They would knock on my door and want to hangout. But I'd never let them inside because they'd see my huge video game collection and hound me the entire time to play. We would go ride bikes and they would just beg and hound me the entire time to go back home and play video games. I didn't feel like any of them really even liked me. \n\nIn highschool I moved to a city. It was a big school. I made some solid friends, met a girl, came out of my shell. Life was good. My over-possessive, worry wart of a mother died. And my quality of life improved. I love and miss her. But she had problems. Wouldn't let my friends spend the night because she was worried they'd steal. She'd have me check on her in the middle of the night to \"make sure\" she was still there. It fucked with me.. when she died. I realized she was the cause of so much of my stress and anxiety.. \n\nI'm 27 now. And I'm still an anxious, nervous wreck.

I didn't always have social anxiety, although I had the signs from kindergarten it wasn't that bad, but I was also a cringy child. In middle school, was when my social anxiety got so bad and I think it was because of bullies, I couldn't speak to new people. Literally, I tried but couldn't say anything at all. And then if I got used to someone or I liked someone I'd open up, but that's when I'd be cringy AF and say something stupid, act stupid, or anything cringy. And now a days I curse myself under my breath or the worse I've done, literally slap myself.\n      To make matters worse, I saw my 3 year old try to slap herself so she has seen me do it and now thinks it's normal. The social awkwardness followed me into adulthood, and I remember when I was a hostess at a restaurant I'd get stuck randomly and probably look extremely uncomfortable or pained, like I was about to seat some people that came in right after this other group of people before I sat the first group and then I just stood there, looking extremely confused and my vision was going fuzzy before I decided to quit being an idiot and seat the people I was seating already. Other times I'd get mad randomly and show it through major attitude to the customers, and not on purpose. Didn't help that at that time I was also pregnant.\n      Thankfully I'm a stay at home mom now. I don't want my kids to be like me. I also don't know exactly what to do to prevent them from being socially awkward. I try to make play dates and all but I even had friends as a kid, it didn't stop me from being like this. I guess if I could change anything, it wouldn't exactly be my past, it'd just be how I act now. I don't know how to stop kicking myself for things I can't change.",

        "original": "This is my first post - I apologize in advance if I screw up the format or anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSocial anxiety disorder, depression and agoraphobia took over my life for several years. They stole everything bright and brave and hopeful about me, replaced by constant, malicious fear and shame. I completely lost everything that made me, me.  I'm in the process of taking my life back, and finding the pieces of my personality that have been beaten down and overshadowed by anxiety for so long. I have made so much progress, and I hope that by sharing some of my story and what I've overcome, someone reading this might find some hope, or solace, or just identify with the journey and remember they're not alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're here, you likely know how crippling this anxiety can be, and the toll it can take on your life. Here is, quite condensed, the toll it took on mine:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I didn't have a job for over a decade. I have never had a driver's license. I didn't drive a car for years, because for some reason it terrifies me. I drifted away from all of my friends. Couldn't answer the phone, even when family members called, without being seized with dread. I was basically holed up in my house, specifically my room, for about three years. The negative impact that all of this had on me, my feelings, and behavior, plus the tremendous load of responsibilities he had to shoulder, became too much for the father of my children & husband of 13 years to bear, and we are currently separated. The fracturing of my family unit, and realizing the role my anxiety played in it, sent me to rock bottom. With nothing left to lose, that's when I decided to begin the climb out of my hole. And it was a hell of a hole, you guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for the good stuff! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemembering the girl I was before all this took hold, and that she wasn't one to fuck around, I pretended I was her for a while and made a huge leap. I attacked one of the biggest and longest running sources of my anxiety and shame: being jobless. I had been looking through available job postings for months, and that would send me spiraling in itself - the jobs were ones I wasn't qualified for, couldn't face the challenge of becoming qualified for, or, most challenging of all -  involved dealing with customers, public, or teams of co-workers. Things I just wasn't, and still am not, up for yet. So I gathered my wits and channeled my previous self to compose an email (of course I was too scared to propose such a thing face to face with a person I'd never met before) offering my services to the property manager of my apartment complex, cleaning and prepping apartments after tenants vacate.  I agonized over every word and nuance in that email. Took me several sessions, starting and stopping, doubting myself, thinking it was a stupid idea and I was only going to embarrass myself. I'm sure you've got a copy of that broken record. It took weeks to work up the courage to hit send.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I didn't hear anything back after four or five days, of course I put that record on repeat, just beating the shit out of myself. When, lo and behold! I get an email back from the manager, and holy nuts, he's intrigued and wants to meet me. I was elated and horrified at the same time - Holy shit, it worked! - Holy shit, I have to actually talk to him! It was the scariest thing I'd done in a long, long time. I don't remember much from that interview, except getting the job. Think my brain was too overloaded to bother storing memories of that meeting, haha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA while after I started, I also became their porter, or groundskeeper - picking up trash all around the property and parking lot, emptying the dog waste baskets. (Ew.) A week ago, they asked me to help them throw a last minute Easter egg hunt for the kids in the apartment complex.  I woke up the following morning filled with panic thinking of all the residents and their kids that would be swarming around me. I wanted to make up an excuse, say I had a headache, anything to not go. But that's not what the old me would have done. WWOMD? She'd go turn that fuckin' Easter egg hunt up to eleven, kids wouldn't know WHAT hit em! That was a little ambitious, but I kept the dial at about a solid eight. Not too shabby. I interacted with people, got involved, even had a little fun.  On Monday, I was given a project of my own - I'm now the gardener as well. They didn't have any experience, and so they gave me the reins. All the garden beds and flower pots around the property needed to be emptied of the dead annuals and replanted. A big job. All on me. The boss man took me with him to the local garden center and had me pick out all the plants. I spent the next two days in the dirt, and everything looks amazing. I've gotten to know the two guys I work with - the first real social interaction with new people in I can't even remember how long. I'm starting to feel comfortable around them, and talk is coming more freely and easily. Friendships are forming. I can't describe how big a deal this is for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving killed it in the employment department, I started to gain some confidence and felt strong enough to do something I've known I needed for a long time.  I made an appointment with a therapist. I decided it was finally time to confront and learn to cope with the past traumas that have been weighing me down and stealing my damn sunshine. I've been to my first appointment. It wasn't as scary or difficult as I feared, and after leaving, I knew I had made the right decision, and that I was on the right track. I go back soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel so empowered. I'm learning to distinguish between when the \"voice in my head\" is actually mine, and when it's the anxiety talking. I'm learning to defy the latter. It is so hard, and scary. I have to fight for every inch of traction I get. But I'm doing it. Feeling proud of myself was something I had forgotten. It's a helluva drug. I'm working on my driver's license next. Wish me luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're still reading, I believe in you.

        "original": "I (22M) have been lurking on this subreddit for at least a year. Reading every single post, relating to all the troubles you guys face every day. I used to think that I am introverted and shy, never seen it as a serious problem. I was expecting to get out of it as I grow up, but apparently things only got worse. \n\nI have always been super anxious about my appearance. Looking much younger than my peers, not being attractive at all and being the smallest kid out there. I struggled to communicate with people and always thought everyone was constantly judging me. This had a serious impact on my confidence and is probably the reason why I have never been kissed by a girl. \n\nAnyway, I am so fortunate with the family I have, but apart from that, I have never had a real friend till high school. The friend I would share everything with, someone for whom I would always be there. This changed on college. I was so incredibly lucky that this one girl literally adopted me, despite her being super shy.\n\nDuring those 3 year, we slowly got to know each other and my comfort zone expanded. We have been texting about our lives on daily basis and I have been open to her with everything (even my SA). She made me feel that someone interested in people like us actually exist and I finally experienced how beautiful it is. It gave me so much motivation to work on myself and was the reason I decided to change everything in my life. \n\nI started doing activities I enjoy, eating more healthy and doing exercises. I also stopped caring about what others think, while slowly facing all the fears of every day life. After some time I noticed to feel better, see some progress and chances of being a little normal suddenly became more real. Eventually, I got to the point when I felt like I should express my feelings to her. Feelings I had since we met. It was killing me to keep it secret, even though I suspected she was partly aware of it.\n\nIt took so much courage and I ended up texting her like a coward. Nevertheless, she replied with such a beautiful message, explaining why we should stay as friends. I cried, literally, but despite she basically rejected me, I did not perceive it as a failure at all. I was kind of expecting it and only wanted to be fully honest with her. I felt so much relief, thinking we can stay friends without need to hide it anymore. \n\nAt first, she seemed to be OK with it, but as time passed, I started to notice differences in her behavior. Since then, we haven't talked about any deeper topic and it seems that I annoy her with things we used to normally talk about. If we happen to meet, she is on full ignore mode and doing her best to avoid me. She also admitted that all the attention I require makes her uncomfortable and currently stopped texting with me completely.\n\nIt has been weird online relationship since the beginning, but weird in a good way. Even though I really enjoy her company, we barely meet in real life. I did not actually see any problem with that as reading her messages always made me feel like she is close to me. It is also much easier to open to others, while having as much time as I need for my replies. It seemed very appealing, but now I am having doubts about it being healthy long term relationship. \n\nI don't think she even realizes how much she has helped me and how deeply I care for her. Also, I feel like this whole situation makes suffer both of us, and I truly want to stop it. The problem is she closed up to me entirely. I have tried to do something with it by myself, showing her my interest in talking with her, but it always backfired. It made me feel pretty much empty, I have zero confidence again and I don't want to talk with other people anymore. I feel like I am slowly reversing to the old me, while not being able to prevent it. \n\nIf you are actually reading this up until now, I have few questions for you. I really need your advice as I have nobody else to ask apart from her. \n\nDo you think it was a mistake telling her what I feel? \n\nIs it a normal way girls react to such situation, or is she most likely embarrassed, that someone like me could be interested in her?\n\nWhat should I do now, should I just wait and give her a time, or should I actively do something about it? \n\nAlso, do you think it is really just temporary phase, or our relationship is close to its end and I should get over it? \n\n\nAll of these don't let me sleep and despite you answering them, I really appreciate that you spent your time reading this. Writing down all these thoughts helped me a lot and my mind is slowly losing incentives to keep thinking about it. \n\nThank you guys and cheers!",

I don't go to family gatherings anymore out of shame for not being able to hold down a decent job and I feel like a failure.\n\nMy logical brain understands most people are good and I'm a good person as well, and that I'm only hurting myself  by enabling this years-long isolation and depression but I see the world with a dark film over my eyes and ears that alienates me and holds me hostage from any sort of progress. I can barely hold down a job that I work at only one to two days a week because I'm so damn terrified of talking to people... My confidence and self worth are a solid 0.

I drink too much to try to cope and it just makes things worse and I do things that I regret to try to feel normal. I'm getting suicidal thoughts on the daily.

I *always* push myself deeper into the hole. This isn't how I wanted my life to be, I was always such a happy bright girl. I saw myself going to college and getting a good job, falling in love some day.....being able to take care of my mom in her old age. Now I'm a shell of who I was meant to be and it terrifies me to no end. I don't know who I am anymore. I don't know what I'm supposed to be living for. 99% of my life is lived in fear.

Then I judge myself and tell myself I should get over my social anxiety so that I can really use my time traveling doing things like meeting new people in different cultures, I honestly do want to do that but just being realistic I don't think I will be very up for doing that seeing as I have a hard time meeting people in my hometown. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen there's also the thought that I just want to do those solo things because of my social anxiety and that's not who I REALLY am and if I got over my social anxiety I would be doing something else.

Man, 30yrs old.\n\nI just wanted to give you some hope. \n\nSo, a year before my life was a living hell because of social anxiety, depression, depersonalization and maybe paranoia. Nowdays things are getting better day by day. I have a job after 10 years of unemployment(and unbearable shame)!!!In some months I will have my first publication in a book. I talk relatively calm during the class. I socialize more and more. My body has transformed fairly nice because of the gym. I have some money to spent. I feel more like an adult than before. I wake up at 7 in the morning and sleeping around 11 at the night. \n\nsome months before i had zero money. I was a parasite of my parents. I was avoiding to go to the class( MBA). I found it extremely difficult to talk with the people. I spent my days alone and inside. I slept at 5 in the midnight, waked up in 13:00. \n\nSo, I dont say that my life has transformed into a miracle. No, not even! But I feel some hope again. I feel more man than before. I feel stronger. I dont feel shame of my unemployment anymore( this caused 30% of my SAD..I was avoiding to talk to the people that I know because of this shame). I have money to spent for my education and my appereance. \n\nWhat worked for me was the progressive desensitization of the fears. It needs much courage, persistence, willingness and especially PATIENCE to work well. Much much PATIENCE.\n\nWhat I did was that: I started as almost a hermit. Then I decided to spent time outside alone. Daily. Only that, nothing else. It was the most miserable part of my life. It lasted about 4-5 months. Alone, walking in the town, sitting here and there, drink coffee in the cafes ALONE, reading in the library..(what a living nightmare it was!) \n\nAfter that I went to the gym. I made a commitment to myself. I looked in the mirror and told to myself\" you have two opinions mother f****er,accepting yourself as he is, or try to change his appearance. It will take time, but if you do not do something you ll never change. Now or never\".\nSo I add gym to my everyday life.\n\n The next step was to reduce internet usage and concentrate more to the reading in order to improve my dictionary and social skills. After some weeks I decided to go back to the class in order to finish my MBA. First day was very hard. But I opened my god damn mouth. I spell some words. After some minutes I spoke again in front of all my classmates. Then again and again. I was almost out of air. I felt so much anxious but I keep thinking: it is now or never. When you will decide to talk? When you will be dead??\"\n\nA year had been passed and I felt better. My body was in better shape, I went out daily, I was speaking in the class(with much effort is the truth)..BUT no I was not feel really better..inside of me I felt like almost like a shit. I was economically dependent to my parents. I knew what was missing from my life. But how the hell do I supposed to work after 10 years of unemployment, because of SAD? Then one day I took the big decision: facing my GREATEST fear or dying one day as a homeless man. And I choose the first choice. Three weekends have passed and I am working. It is a really hard job with constant social interaction. I work as a deliver man in a Cafe, full time. Everytime that I return back to the home I feel EXHAUSTED but I will not give up. I have a plan. I will save as much money as I can and after 4-5 months I will rent my own house. \n\nI am not even near where I want to be. But do you know something? YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR SITUATION IN A DAY OR A MONTH. NOT EVEN IN A YEAR. It will take more time!  I have accept this fact. 10 years of destroying my life cannot be changed in a night. \n\nI would be happy to talk with anynody of you guys and girls.\n\nP.s. you can check my oldest posts if you want to convince yourselves how bad I felt before some months. I am not lying. :)\n\nThanks.",

Luckily a pretty normal guy from my class saw what i was going through, and helped me.\n\nNow I had friends from the normal and the nerd. \n\nBut it was too late. my anxiety and insecurity were growing everyday, idk why.\n\nIve already been to a psychologist before due to my fathers death a when I was 2 yo (He was a pilot, but thats not the story.)\n\nSo here I am, anxious and nervous, keeping most of my secrets from anyone.

I like her so I help her out by standing at the door checking tickets, doing wristbands, etc. I can handle the momentary social aspect of the interaction, because I only have to talk to the person for a moment. Last night we had an event and it was really well attended. The check in part was over and it was ok for us to mingle and I couldn't. I mean, the thought of having to talk to anyone was terrifying. I KNOW people won't like me, I KNOW it will be an awkward exchange, why would I put myself through that voluntarily? Nope. I left. Once I was in the car I had this big sigh and I realized it was exhausting. I mean, physically, mentally, emotionally exhausting. Sometimes I attribute it to age, but I'm only in my forties. I know it's social anxiety. I don't need to be reminded constantly that people don't like being around me, it happens every day, all day at my job. People leave the room when I walk in, they exit conversations if I contribute. I'm not imagining this. They all go out to lunch in their little cliques. Not once has anyone asked me to go.

        "original": "Before I start I want to say I am currently a 31 years old  virgin, not by choice. I have never done anything with a female or even had a kiss or a job. I currently and still live with my 76 year old diabetic dad who lost one of his legs and toe and my 55 year old mom who is working along with my two sisters on my mom's side. I am from my mom's side awell and I am the only boy on my mom's side. I do have other brothers and sisters on my dad's side. I also constantly hide from people when they visit. I hide in my room just on my sister's old phone. I have no friends. I can be easily used. I remember in the 12th grade a girl who didn't like me ask me for 50 cent. I had brought a paper from our English teacher. He charged us 50 cent because he had to pay for the copies. My friend at the time asked me for my change because I had given our teacher a dollar. The girl saw this and ask me. I blushed and I was hyper happy. I gave her the 50 cent and she give it to the guy next to her. She had alot of money. Like 20 dollars or more. I was the smelly kid in school. Now as a adult. I do take baths once a day. I don't think I bath probably. I am very sweaty. Anyways. I don't know if I have social anxiety or depression or both. I think I have other problems as well. I have been having horrible mode swings since 7 to 8 grade. It has gotten worse and violent to the point of me almost killing my sister. I always put my hands on her when we get in constant arguments because I get irrated very quickly and easily. I would be either very happy hyper. When that happens I do things because I am happy. Example when I was school I brought a game by saving my launch money. I was happy that day and some guy who bullied me ask me for a dollar and I gave it to him. And I was also be very negative everyday. I think about sucide alot. I think the only reason why I never did it is because I am scared to die. I feel lazy and tried and lack of energy everyday. When I was younger and got hyper happy I would this burst of energy but not anymore. I have to force myself to bath, wash my clothes and other things. I have hard time understanding things even simple things. Example. In the 9 the grade social studies teacher tried to teach me about something I did get it once but didn't understand. I kept asking is this right. My dad tried to teach me to nailwhen I was young and I still can't do it. I would ask him is this right. I remember in 4 the grade still not understanding subtracting with zeros or short or long division. If I tried to understand it or thought about it for a long period my head would hurt. I let people bully and use me and I still do. I am shy and quiet when I go with my dad to the hospital or house but at home I am horrible. I don't go out. Even if I tried I would get lost. Even kids don't take me seriously or laugh at me. Everywhere I go people make fun of me of the way I look. I even had moments online where I liked about a picture saying that was never and then I felt guilty and showed them my real face and they stopped talking to me. Even online people find me boring. I hate chatting even online. If someone starts talking to me online like by private m.essage I have deleted accounts because of that. I talk to myself and alot. Especially with my dad who clearly hates it. I have lazy eyes, terrible teeth from sucking my two middle fingers. I still do it. It's they only way I can sleep or masturbate. When teeth are keep upwards and when I smile my mouth is twist. I am very fat. I made the decision to not go places when I was younger. This women would make fun of me and she worked in this shop where I lived. I loved going places with my mom when I was younger. And the other main reason why I decided to not go places was my first day in 7 the grade. All my classmates laughing and pointed at me calling me cock eye (another name they use for lazy eye) that day was also the day I notice my eye in the mirror. I allowed male, female and kids to bully me. Yet I was bully to my sister. I been called ugly, monkey etc. I walk with my head bent down everyday. I was tried of people staring at me I even had people go up to me and stare at me. Seriously. I hate going and pushing my dad. I suck at pushing him, bucking up to things. I can't even find my way around the hospital or clinic to help my dad. Or go on a line to register him. My mom has to carry to to a Barbara. I have go two years without a haircut and I barely comb it or wash it. My parents brought our house. My mom and dad saved money to buy it. I am living of my parents. Whenever I have to go with go places my stomach feels sick and I have to poop and pee serveral times. I don't know what I have but many things. I never knew or heard about social anxiety until a couple years ago. My parents just kept saying that I have to break out of my shyness. I thought I was mentally challenged. I remember hearing the word anxiety online and googling it. Found a mental forum and read some stories that reminded me of me. I did share my story on that site but was told to get help. How can I get help? I don't know anyone like me beside my other sister who I live with and I think my dad's sister son. My dad told me a story saying he was just like me hiding in his room. Said he started acting like that after surgery on his heart. He goes out now. I am close with any other of my family. I don't have  know them like that. I usually hide in my room. Like I said even if I tried to go out I would get lost.I am not innocent and have do alot of things. I haven't mentioned social anxiety to my parents. To scared. Like I said I nor them have heard or know anyone like e besides the people I have mentioned like my sister etc. And even if I did. I don't think my mom would want to take me and my dad is not able. Is there any cheap I can get my parents to buy over the counter drugs to help? Sorry for the long jumple stories and what else do you think I have. I hate been like this. I just want to die.I wish I never made this decision. Thank you for listening. I also have constant thoughts in my head. Bad, negative thoughts. I constantly think about all those horrible moments in my life and cringe. I constantly smile, laugh and blush. I have even did things that I thought in my mind that worked in my mind. Example.

        "original": "Hi, my name is Fran, I'm a psychology student and I want to use all the knowkledge I've learned all this years in college to help you.\n\nFirst of all I've to say that english is not my main language so I'll do my best to be understood.\n\nI've had social anxiety since I was 14, now I'm 20, but thanks all my effort and learning what the social anxiety basis are I could overcome my social anxiety that ruined my life for 6 years; now I'm able to make good relationships with people without fear of losing them for my anxiety, although I've to say that I've been 2 years in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT that is the most effective method to overcome social anxiety) with my psychologist but it didn't help me at all.\n\nFirst, I'll explain very briefly what social anxiety consists on: Imagine being sit at your classroom, there are people sit next to you and u want to talk to them and make new friends but, without knowing why, u feel an extremely high levels of anxiety and u think that if u talk to them with that nervousness they will see you like that and feel so awkward and think u're weird, so fearing that situation comes true u don't dare to talk to them and decide to stay there in silence, feeling a lack of control of your own life.\n\nSecond, I'll explain what are the social anxiety basis so u can understand where the root of the problem is: Our thoughts generate our emotions and our emotions influence our behaviour. So having that in mind, where you have to take action is in your thoughts, people with social anxiety ALWAYS tend to anticipate what could happen in a social situation, their main fear is being embarrassed and judged and rejected for that. Their most common thought is \"If I do this they will think I look stupid, I'll feel embarrased and they will see me nervous and they will feel awkward and think I'm weird\" and even before doing the thing they fear to do they feel already nervous because they have had that negative thought that made anxiety arise, then they realize they are already nervous so their next thought is \"ok, I'm already nervous, the situation I fear will happen because they will see me like this and feel awkward and think I'm weird and I will feel even more anxious\" and having these thoughts just make your fear come true. If you didn't have these thoughts you wouldn't have social anxiety. These thoughts are so automatic, and sometimes unconcious, that people tend to report a \"lack of control\" of their own life.\n\nThird, I'll explain you why this happens: In psychology this is called \"self fulfilling prophecy\", this occurs when a belief leads people to act in ways that confirm that belief, so if u think u will look stupid and feel embarrased that thought will make u nervous making that belief to come true. This is the thoughts process:                                                      If I do this they'd think I look stupid and I'll get embarrassed -> \\*Anxiety increases\\* -> \\*They realize they are already nervous\\* -> Ok, I'm nervous and what I fear will happen -> \\*The situation they fear becomes true\\*.\n\nFourth, I'll explain what this fear is based on: The thing I used to fear was what others would think about me and being embarrassed for that, I'm pretty sure that many of u tend to think \"what if that person is thinking \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ about me?\" the doubt and uncertainty of not knowing what they would think about you and the possibility of being judged and embarrassed coming true are the main reasons of your anxiety response, remember that anxiety is the feeling of danger that prepares you to face the worst situation (fly or flight). Having all of this in mind, the first key to overcome social anxiety is that u have to know and accept that u can't control what other people think about you, U JUST CAN'T, it's impossible to know what others think about you nor control them.\n\nFourth, so many of you'd think \"Fran now I understand the social anxiety reasons, but where's the solution?\": The moment that changed my life is when I realized that my problem was not having these negative thoughts of being embarrassed and judged, the problem was my response to them. Let me explain it, of course it's normal to fear looking nervous in front of people and being judged and rejected for that, who wouldn't fear that? I realized that I couldn't control what other people would think about me, the only thing I could control was my reaction to what they MAYBE think about my nervousness, and this was the first moment after 6 years that I felt that I had the control of my behaviour and my own life. Since then my thoughts were \"I look nervous and people could see me like this? ok, I can't control what they'd think about me but I can control my reaction to what they MAYBE think about my nervousness\" and thinking that way literally made my anxiety disappear completely.  I didn't fear what others would think of me because I knew I couldn't control what they think about me, I knew that no matter what they think I won't be embarrassed because I knew the only thing I could control was my reaction to what they maybe think; this is the second key.\n\nFifth, many of you'd say \"Yo Fran, it's easier to said than done...\": Yeah, that's what I always used to think when I was reading other guides of how to overcome social anxiety. But the difference between my guide from others guides is that I don't deny the thing u fear from happening (being judged negatively), I just prepare you, in case it happens, to face it with no anxiety (so u won't feel embarrassed) because remember that u don't know what others think about u nor control it, but u can control your reaction to what they maybe think. CBT says that the solution is not having these negatives thoughts and have others more positive and realistic instead, but in some cases trying not to have some thoughts like \"They will think I'm weird and I'll get embarrassed\" it's worse, trying to not have a thought just make that thought stronger and more powerful. Sometimes CBT doesn't work because your brain notices when ur trying to convince yourself about something that u don't really know if it's true like \"that person doesn't think I'm weird, he thinks I'm funny\" thinking that just doesn't work because your brain doesn't have the certainty if it's actually true because u don't know what others think.\n\n**Sixth and most important part**, many of you would say \"Fran this doesn't work for me, I can't still control my reaction\": That happens because u still fear being nervous and judged for that, and the only thing to stop that is not fearing to be nervous, but now u'd say \"As I told you I can't control my reaction\" yeah I know but it's like a vicious circle: You fear being nervous -> \\*u get nervous\\* -> the situation u fear becomes true. Now my thought process is this:  \\*I'm nervous\\*-> they maybe think I'm weird-> I can't control they think about me but I can control my reaction to what they maybe think about my nervousness-> \\*Anxiety softens\\* ->\\*I don't feel nervous anymore\\* -> They don't think I'm weird.\n\nAn important TIP that is the third key:  When I started to practice this new way of thinking it was hard in the beginning because I was like \"ok, I can only control my reaction so I just don't have to get nervous and they won't judge me negatively\" and that thought just made my anxiety arise so hard because my thought was \"If I don't get nervous they won't judge me, Fran don't get nervous, don't get nervous, don't! or they will judge me!\" and that way of thinking just made my anxiety arise even more.  My wrong thought was \"**If I don't get nervous they won't judge me**\" **the correct one was** **\"If I get nervous I can't control what they think about me, I can control my reaction to what they think about my nervousness\" and \\*anxiety diminishes\\*** in that way **u don't fear to get nervous either, that is the key.**\n\nI hope this helps to people with social anxiety and who CBT didn't work for. I've searching a solution to overcome this problem but literally nobody could help me. And I think this new way of thinking of knowing u can't control what others think about you but u can control your reaction to what they maybe think could help people to overcome social anxiety disorder. You can ask me anything and I'll be glad to help u all they ways I could :). Thank you so much for reading.",

        "original": "So I have made huge improvements with my social anxiety over the past decade. I'm in my early 30s and I'd had it basically completely under control for about 5 years, but recently I'm noticing some stuff creep back in that I can't get control of. It's trivial stuff really but I'm worried it might get out of control. \n\nI've thought about it and I thin I've reasoned out what's happening, and it makes sense but it's not quite sinking in and I think I just need to hear whether it makes sense from someone else. So currently I'm unemployed, single, no friends nearby, living in a small town. All of these things can get on top of people, and with social anxiety especially living in a small town makes me feel watched and judged because everyone pays more attention to each other.  Little things like going to the shop are starting to feel stressful for no real reason. The good news is I have qualifications and experience so I'm pretty sure I will be able to get a job, move back to somewhere a little bigger and make new friends. So even if my anxiety does get a bit worse at the moment it's probably pretty normal and something I should consider a temporary blip that I'll get through if I keep focussing on what I need to do, rather than worrying it will backfire and this is the start of all my hard work unravelling? Even typing it out makes me feel it's obvious it's the first and the second is just me worrying because I'm remembering how hard things used to be before I'd learned to manage better.\n\nOne smaller example of this that is particularly bothering me is there is a guy I've kind of got to know a bit from seeing each other walk our dogs. He's pretty rough looking and kind of stands out in the town I live in, but he's a nice enough bloke. If I bump into him at the local shop he'll walk around and chat with me for a bit. This normally wouldn't bother me however recently I find myself hoping I don't see him and getting anxious about it when I do. I can't work out why except thinking that people in the shop, who I barely know, are somehow judging me for talking to someone who looks rough in their shop regularly. This is weird especially for me because this isn't part of my anxiety before. I feel stupid and guilty for wanting to avoid a person who is nothing but friendly to me because some  people who work in a supermarket, in a town I won't even be living in next year, \\*might\\* slightly look down on me? What is up with that?! \n\nAnd I shouldn't worry about what random people who aren't even my friends think anyway, if they even are giving me a second though because they see me regularly?\n\nI hope this doesn't sound too trivial or stupid but sometimes just telling yourself something doesn't seem to work as well as saying it out loud to someone else. \n\nThanks guys.\n\nTL;DR Unemployed, single, small town, no social life. Is it normal for social anxiety symptoms to start creeping back in a situation like that? I should worry more about getting a job and back to the situation where I was more relaxed and happy rather than worrying I've gone back to square one with my anxiety right?",

        "original": "It was my usual stiff and uncomfortable, lonesome trek to the grocery store just across from the apartments where I live. I only convinced myself to go out of wanting energy drinks to try to help ward off today's no Adderall lethargy.\n\nI walked into the store, kept my mind as focused on getting what I needed as possible, even though the thoughts of how my roommate wants me to get a job at this very store kept swooping in and laying turds of doubt in my brain. That only made me sweat a little. But I thought to myself: man, can you really see yourself working here like an average functioning human being for hours everyday? \n\nAfter a short exchange with a worker who was sticking energy drinks and feeling myself slowly but surely becoming more and more inwardly paralyzed by my anxiety and sweaty face, I knew the answer was \"NO\". I can barely fake it and hold myself together long enough in a damn grocery store to buy what I need. And this is as good as it gets. This was a GOOD trip compared to most.\n\nSo as I walk back across the street, legs tired, body unnecessarily sweaty, it occurred to me that these feelings are as good as it's ever going to get. Just deep discomfort and feeling completely alone out there among people who I wish could see me, but am too paranoid of their judgment to engage with them beyond short awkward conversation.\n\nSame shit for the last 10 years, no matter how hard I try to overcome it. And now, back in my little bedroom, I live with the isolation my social anxiety has earned me. A mostly empty, ghost of a life. I know this is as good as it will ever get. I'm 31 so it's only likely to get more pitiful in the future. With this in mind I am ready to expire.

I was the only one available to work from this project today so when the interviews cancelled I had to book an extra interview ( on top of the 6 that I already booked) to help our project make goal. I am happy to do so but with the anxiety and everything its high pressure high stress and I was able to get that last interview thankfully but I was really still anxious as hell. My boss kept high fiving me and telling me i saved the project. I really do not like being complimented as I just thought I was doing my job but also because getting complimented really makes me anxious.\n\nWe went into a team meeting right after to discuss other projects, and they kept praising me for how i am early to work and have interviews booked early. Which i think is part of a job that pays a good mount of money but they were being really nice.\n\nI had a training session with my boss afterwords but he had to push it back an hour to finish some other tasks. I did not mind. But when we began our training session I noticed my anxiety starting to flare. My back tightens, stomach feels like its about to burst, I am sweating like hell and fidgeting all over the place. I excuse myself from the meeting but I came back and was still freaking out. My boss noticed it and said \"I hope you feel better.\" and I apologized.\n\nI am really embarrassed right now because when I have a one on one with my boss that is the last place I want to have an anxiety attack.

        "original": "In January 2018, I first received a diagnosis for Social Anxiety after I got to the point where I couldn't go to a lecture if I was 5 minutes late because I was convinced everyone would look at me and judge me. I couldn't go out without makeup, I couldn't eat in public, asking for help in a store was unthinkable, and most days the thought of leaving the house made me sick to my stomach. I was paranoid and self-critical, convinced everyone I knew secretly couldn't stand me. \n\nLuckily, I was referred to a triage anxiety clinic in my area and was set up with my fantastic case manager. She got me into their group therapy for social anxiety, and the first session I was terrified and didn't say a word the entire time. But little by little, I started to open up and engage in the coping mechanisms they were teaching us. At the end of that group therapy course, I stood up in front of 10 people while I was being videoed and talked about something without using any conversation prompts. I was sweating the whole time, and my stomach was sitting in my kneecaps the entire time but I did it. \n\nI was discharged in December 2018, continued with self-therapy, and here I am. I can make phone calls, I can go to school without makeup on, I have a job, I can even go up to complete strangers and compliment them without breaking a sweat. I celebrated my 19th birthday in January this year, I invited 8 friends and none of them showed up. I was weirdly happy, because for the first time in a long time my reaction wasn't self-critical. I just thought to myself \"If they're not here for a good reason, then that's okay. If they don't have a good reason to ditch my birthday party, then that's okay too because if I'm not a priority for them, they shouldn't be a priority for me.\"\n\nToday I looked through this subreddit, and for the first time I couldn't relate my present self to the experiences people were sharing. I take it as a sign to move forward. I guess I'm hoping that sharing my progress here might encourage people to not give up on recovery, because I know it's tiring and frustrating and sometimes it feels like things are never going to be different.

        "original": "I've been feeling good about myself lately. Lost 10 pounds, going to school, been doing nofap's hard mode, and trying to be more friendly and talkative to girls. The guy I mentioned at work has always tried to belittle me in front of others before, but has ramped it up more recently (I think it's due to how I'm coming off as a little more confident). \n\nIt started about a week ago, when he tried to make a joke to a girl I know he likes. Long story short, she ended up not laughing, and there was a kinda awkward silence. I then followed up with a joke of mine, and she laughed and talked with me a little, then walked away to continue her own work. As soon as she left he tells me with a stern face, and a disapproving head shake, \"You killed it, you shouldn't have said anything. It's better if you just stayed quiet.\" He then went on to make fun of me to another co-worker. I felt my face turning red as a turnip needless to say! \n\nFast forward to last night. I was feeling good about myself, and brought up how I lost ten pounds! I then made a joke, and said, \"You guys thought I was good looking before, I guess I'm gorgeous now!\" He got a little angry about it, and said, \"Yeah right man, let's see if you are actually good looking.\" He then proceeded to call a female co-worker, and ask her in front of me if she thought I was handsome. She stood there awkwardly, and didn't want to look at me. Luckily I've been trying to be more friendly with the girls there, so she changed the subject, and deflected with a joke. I never knew my face could feel so numb! \n\nI later that night found out from my sister who works with me, that one of the girls that Mr. Embarrasser likes, might have a crush on me! So that helped me recover a bit more, and also explains a little why he has probably ramped up his public embarrassment tactics! I kept almost slipping back into my usual old habits last night, but fought to stay positive! \n\n\n\nTLDR: Been having a good streak, guy at work didn't like that he made he made a joke that landed flat with the girl he liked, and she laughed at mine at few seconds later, and tried to embarrass me in front of another girl by asking if she thought I was easy on the eyes. I turn red as a Odogoron that just walked in on his parents, and some guy at my work thought it was funny to yell out spoilers to Avengers: End Game, the night before I'm going to see the movie (just wanted to throw that bit in there for funnsies!

I talked with three other employees privately and they all said that they didn't get a proper training and that there were too few employees at the workfloor when they started and they couldn't ask them for help all the time. I worked everywhere, most of the workers have a specific department, I didn't walked a day with another employee in the beginning to learn from them. One employee said that he learned it all by himself, me as well. It is quite a lot that you have to know in that store and the intranet and orders is quite complicated. They also track a record of mean of the sales per cashier (which is totally useless, because the cashier ladies don't have any influence on those sales). In the canteen there is a top with the cashiers with the highest sales per week. There are other things they track about the workteam were we don't have any influence on, for example why some days are busier than others or the satisfaction of customers (employees don't have any influence on delivery, or the quality of the products).\n\nI noticed that how my collegues communicated was disfunctional, new employees get snubbed at when they ask things twice or when they do something wrong most of the time. This new employee (20/m) said that he didn't like it and that he got snubbed at in the first working day, he said that he already was looking for another job. Furtermore, they talk behinds each others back. Example: the floormanager (45/m) asked me the second week what my thougts were about an older collegue and the way she communicated. I told him that she reapeted herself often, which I also told that person. He agreed and ranted about her, how she could not communicate, and that that person in question had applied for his job but she didn't got it. And how she is always angry at him and how he handles that and that gets her more and more frustrated. He let me read texts messages of her and explained that how she communicated was not right. He told me that a person left due to her. He as wel described that persons private life and that he understood it why she is like this. The floormanager also said some degrading things about woman, like you have to be an asshole towards woman. And how he walks at festivals with a shirt \"All woman have borderline\".  \nWhen I ask a question or collegues, it is not always received well by other collegues and the higest manager always reflects questions. Example: I asked a collegue for help, because I couldn't get a skrew out with the drilling machine nor with the skrewdriver, two collegues didn't know how I could get the stuck srew out. So I decided to try it again and again also with different materials, eventually the higest manager (44/m) passed by and I asked him the question. He said that it didn't had to took that long and he said that he could do it in three seconds. He fixed it and walked away. I asked him to hold on and explain it to me, so I did something wrong with the drilling machine I said, and then he explained it to me.\n\nSo today I got fired by the highest manager which was quite out of the blue. He explained that he didn't saw progress in me. That I had to be more assertive and that I am insecure around customers. I think he caught me at moments that I was insecure around customers or other collegues might told him. I got a lot of compliments of happy customers that I helped them and I think I am not shy or insecure around them.  \nHe also said that they told me things twice sometimes and I didn't learn that fast. It is true that I made a lot of mistakes and I asked things twice. For example I asked questions today that I should not have asked he said, and he asked me if it was out of insecurity that I asked those. For example: today I asked my collegue if we had a half hour break or a 15 min break. It is true, I could have known that, but I asked. Apparently that collegue that I asked about the break told that to others, because the highest manager knew about it and told me that I should have known it by now. Others had this as well, I talked about this with some employees and they said it was just too much information. I also didn't worked at one department, so I had to learn from everything a bit. This week I saw that my fellow employee which also started at the same time as me couldn't help a customer, I tried to help him but I couldn't help them either. So the floormanager came and he couldn't help them either, we had to wait till an older employee came over to help us. So the floormanager decided to make a consession with the customers. My collegue and I could help them now and I saw that my collegue was nervous about the situation because it took so long and it was akward. I aksed him about it and he admitted it and we talked about it.\n\nI am writing my thesis as wel right now and I think I can't find work in the field I am studying in right now. So I need to find another job soon. But this experience did not gave my self confidence a boost.\n\nTL:DR: Got fired today at my retail job of 2 months because the higest manager didn't saw any progress in me. I should have known a lot of things by now and I didn't according to him. He said and thought that I was insecure around customers, which I am not. Now I need to find another job, besides that I am writing my thesis and am almost graduated but can't find a job in that working field I think.\n\nThank you for reading this and your time.",

        "original": "Hey all, New to the sub.  Sorry in advance for being long winded. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL/DR : I feel I know that I am worth much more to my company than my salary indicates but my social anxiety is preventing me from even bringing the subject up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI  am seeing a psychologist for my social anxiety. So far I have gone from being unable to even attend family functions to being able to get through them without running away madly.  The strange thing is, at work I am nearly fully functional.  This is because I know data and I know I am good at what I do.  I am happy to get a request for data/a report and can build it without fail. I can also design, document and improve processes.  Just don't ask me to train.  I have also sunk myself into the systems that we have in place and have become the SME for them.  My problem is interacting with humans.  For over 30 years I have taken jobs, gotten increases but never actually negotiated my own salary.  For new jobs I just gave a number that I wanted and either took or refused the offer given.  No negotiation.  I am now at a job 10 years and other than 1 departmental adjustment, I just took my annual increase which was just above cost of living each year and kept on going.  Here is my problem.  I know I am worth more.  The company is at a point of embarking on some major projects that I know for a fact would be nearly impossible without my expertise.   No one is irreplaceable and they would get it done without me but it will be magnitudes easier based on my knowledge of both the legacy and new systems.  I am a unique unicorn in this case.  In addition to this I have also been given more and more responsibility day to day and am rolling with the punches.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is my problem.  My required expenses have continued to increase faster than my annual increases.  I am also getting ready to have a much needed procedure that will end up costing me a good deal out of pocket.  Basically I need more income.    I know what the market would demand for a replacement for me without the knowledge I have and that is more than I make.  I know what people coming in with 0 experience in lesser jobs in my department are coming in starting salary and that is almost where I currently am.  I have a strong suspicion that if I got an offer for what I believe I should be paid (according to the average of 3 job sites) that my company would match it without question.   I know all of this. Every day when I go home I think about how to approach my boss and present this information to him.  But that is where it breaks down.  What if I am just full of myself?  What if I am delusional and I am the one under performing?  What if he agrees and still says no?  I don't want to start over with a new company.  I believe I am too old to become as valuable as I need to be.  I have started to say something several times but I start getting emotional, tear up and am unable to pull the trigger to even start the conversation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas this happened to anyone else and how did you overcome it if at all?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading/listening.",

        "original": "Hi, long time lurker, first time poster\n\nSo I have my college graduation coming up soon and they recently split the graduation into two events, a general commencement with all the graduating students and a college specific one with students from your respective college. I had only planned on going to the general commencement one because there is no walking on stage, where you simply sit in a row and stand when your college is announced. Now the college specific one happens next day at night (7pm) and this ceremony has you walk up on stage where your name is announced and you're recorded on the jumbotron. If it were up to me, I wouldn't want to go to either, however, my parents are driving 5 hours to be there with me and I feel bad telling them I don't want to go. I lied about not being able to attend the college specific one because I never got my ring sized (engineering ring ceremony) and they persisted that I go talk to the dean of the college and tried to get that issue resolved so I could walk. I told them that even if I were able to get that done, I still wouldn't want to go. My mom seemed really disappointed and I could tell she wanted to go to both ceremonies. With that said, I just don't feel comfortable in a setting with a large group of people...Especially having to go up on stage with all eyes on you and being called out, I get major anxiety thinking about it. \n\nNo one is going to clap for me if I do walk. I've never felt lonelier in my life than I have in the last 4 years at my college. I haven't really made any friends, except for 2 people and that only happened in the last two semesters. To emphasize how lonely I was, for one of my classes, the professor allowed us to create our own groups for a project. I didn't have anyone I could be grouped with because I'm too shy and afraid to speak to people so I had to email the professor about not having a group. I was actually called out in front of a class of 80 people for being the only person without a group, where they asked if any group wanted to take me in. Additionally, this happened again for another class the semester after. \n\nMy parents have already booked a hotel room for the general ceremony, but I was wondering if you guys think I should go to the other ceremony as well? I felt bad about lying, so I was able to get my ring sized after talking to my advisor about it and I am eligible to attend the college specific one after all. The ceremony is this Saturday and Sunday, so I don't know if it's worth it. I know I wouldn't enjoy it if I go, but at the same time, I'm scared I'll regret it. My parents have booked a hotel for Friday but not Saturday and I know that because the Sunday ceremony is at night, they'll have to book a hotel room for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. To me, this makes it seem like an even bigger waste of time and money since hotels aren't cheap during graduation week. My 2 friends have asked me why I don't want to go and I've been covering it up by saying that I don't want my parents to waste more money and that one of my siblings that are also coming has to work on Monday (the ceremony is Sunday night and they're not going to drive back home Sunday night), but in reality, I feel I like might have a panic attack during the walking ceremony. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr HELP!

        "title": "Been handling SA really well lately and am super happy about it!",
        "original": "This is going to be an uber long one but TL;DR at the bottom :)\n\nJust a disclaimer that this isn't intended to sound patronising/shun anyone with SA in any way, but more meant to reassure anyone that's maybe having a really bad day with it or losing hope of it ever getting better that it's okay to have those days but to also celebrate the little victories as well. Also obligatory throwaway account because a few people irl know my main and I'd rather just shout this into the void of the internet.\n\nI've suffered from SA for the better part of 8 years now and the end of 2013 was probably my lowest point for me. I got bullied really bad in high school to the point where I'd do everything possible to avoid interacting with anyone who wasn't in my small group of friends - I'd take the most convoluted route around school just to avoid the most number of people, I never spoke up in class, refused to eat unless it was indoors somewhere hidden away from everyone else, never answered the phone or made calls, made excuses to get out of social outings even if it just a girl's night at home with my really close friends, etc. Basically, it was crippling.\n\nWhen I began university I started seeing a psych and things did get a little bit better. I made friends a lot easier than I ever did in school but I was still really shy/introverted, still tried to avoid people around campus, still couldn't make phone calls/eat outside etc. But I was just that tiny little bit more confident and I considered that a win.\n\nThen a few years ago I decided to change degrees and move states which was huge for me because it was the first time I'd be living away from my family. Admittedly the move was largely to be with my then boyfriend which didn't work out, but I'm so so glad I made the move regardless because where I'm at right now has felt more like home than where I used to live ever did.\n\nWhen I first moved it took me a few months but I eventually landed what was basically my dream retail job. I was still really shy though and panicked whenever I had to answer the phone/make calls/got into a situation with a frustrated customer which I could tell irked my manager. Thankfully soon after though that manager left and got replaced by the loveliest gentle giant you'll ever meet - I'm pretty sure he knew immediately what the issue was with me and did everything he could to make things easier. He'd answer the phone so I wouldn't have to and put me on stock duties to minimise the amount of time I'd have to spend interacting with customers. I know it sounds stupid, especially working in a retail job and that I should've known what I was getting into and all that, but this honestly helped so much. I began to trust him and felt safe when I was working shifts with him, and eventually I started feeling confident enough to answer the phone and even make calls when he was around which was *huge* because that's always been such a terrifying thing for me.\n\nBecause I started getting closer with him, I started forming proper friendships with the rest of the store team as well. I began speaking up more in our work chat (another small win) and over the rest of last year I became so much more confident than I think I'd ever been. I remember at one point my old manager came into visit and remarked at how much more bubbly I was than I had been a few months earlier and I don't know why but that just made me really happy because I was doing something that he thought I couldn't do.\n\nFast forward to the Christmas period last year and not only was I now really close with my own store's team, but a few of the people who worked at a store opposite us (our stores are owned by the same company so we use the same systems/have a similar customer base + general customer service horror stories). To counter the hell that was working retail during Christmas, I created a group chat for everyone from both stores so we could organise nights out throughout the month as stress relief. It was just meant to be a bit of a fun thing, but everyone from both stores quickly became closer than ever and it was *fantastic*. I looked forward to the nights out more than anything, and in all of that I ended up meeting my now partner who works at the other store. We'd known each other for more than a year but never really talked, and months later everyone is super close and still gets together to do things. I still can't believe that in less than a year I went from someone who barely spoke to someone who literally changed the relationship dynamic between so many people.\n\nMost recently, and perhaps the biggest win for me yet, has been getting through several social gatherings where I knew no one save for maybe one or two people. It turns out that said guy I'm dating has a very large friendship circle outside of work (like, my god it's massive), and so the past few months have involved getting to know a lot more people than I'd ordinarily care to. And yeah, the first party I went to where I knew virtually no one absolutely sucked and I spent the majority of the time avoiding people and feeling awkward af. But now that I've slowly got to know most of these people I've actually begun to enjoy these parties, and a few weeks ago I spent almost the entire night interacting with people other than my partner which was huge for me because a few months ago I either stuck to him like glue or just hid somewhere.\n\nHow far I've come has been a bit of luck meeting the right people who are understanding and a bit of being thrown in the deep end and facing my fears head on, but I'm really proud of how far I've come. Me two years ago wouldn't recognise me at all.\n\nIf you've made it this far, first of all massive kudos haha, but also as cliched as it sounds, SA can get better. It won't happen overnight and it may not ever totally go away, but it doesn't always have to be as bad as it is. Take baby steps - even if it's just making a call to order pizza instead of ordering online or taking the busier path to get from A to B, celebrate the little wins and build off them. You can do it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Used to suffer from crippling SA. Over the past few years I've managed to slowly work through my fears, been thrown into some terrifying social situations but come out the other end alive with heaps of friends and am now really hopeful that one day it'll be a virtually non existent issue. It does get better! Baby steps.",

        "original": "For background, I'm an 18 year old guy going into college next year. I've struggled with severe anxiety and depression all my life so I was pretty socially inept when I first entered high school. I've torn down and rebuilt my personality over and over the past 4 years trying to a better, less awkward person. I've gotten way more capable over the past year or two and I'm trying to make a final push to break out of my weird, sometimes creepy shell and just be a normal, likable guy.\n\nBelow are some things I do that I'm unsure about in terms of normality. If y'all could read through them and tell me what's fine and what I should change it'd be really helpful.\n\n#1. I tend to bounce my legs when I'm sat down for a while.\n\n#2. I send out a selfie with something like \"How was your day? :)\" to everyone on my snapchat every afternoon. (This is mostly because I don't think people will text me on their own if I don't)\n\n#3. I tend to be very self conscious and open up about my issues to people shortly after meeting them.\n\n#4. When I begin talking to a girl who I like, I flirt with her, but get nervous I've made her uncomfortable and apologize for it. This leads to me commiting #3.\n\n#5. I laugh really hard sometimes when people tell jokes.\n\n#6. If someone leaves me on read I say sorry and ask them if I made them uncomfortable. (This happens pretty often)\n\n#7. If I open up the idea of sexting with someone and they refuse, I immediately feel extremely guilty and apologize profusely, regardless of their insistence it's fine.\n\n#8. Sometimes, if I feel depressed, I'll send a mass text to people asking them if I've made them uncomfortable or hurt them or if I should leave them alone, then feel anxious that I'm most likely making things worse.\n\n#9. My Facebook profile pic is a mirror selfie of me with a college T shirt on.\n\n#10. If someone seems like they don't want to talk, I immediately jump to the conclusion something's wrong and ask them if they're okay. This often leads to them being confused as they feel totally fine.\n\n#11. My texts when I first introduce myself to someone are very peppy, for example, \"Hey! I saw you're going to (the college i committed to) what made you decide?\".\n\n#12. I try to ask people questions about their interests and ask for details if they're vague, or go into more depth about why they like it.\n\n#13. I try to act chill even though I'm a pretty energetic person because I feel like my energy is a turn-off to girls.\n\n#14. I apologize for my anxiety a lot. This also loops back to #3.\n\n#15. If I tell a girl she's pretty and it's well received, I sometimes send a snap back asking how I look or something. I also tend to compliment people or get sexual too early. I don't send unsolicited pics or anything but I have a hard time waiting (even though I know logically it's better to just gently flirt for a month or two before making any moves).\n\n#16. I double-text a lot because I get sad when people open my dm's without responding. I try to wait a few hours after they open but still.\n\nThat's the gist of everything that bothers me, but I'm also going to include some things I like about myself too so y'all get a fuller idea of who I am.\n\n#1. I'm generally quite attractive. I have a symmetrical face, dimples, bright hazel eyes, etc. Even though I hate on myself a lot, I know I'm pretty good looking.\n\n#2. I'm 5'8, 220lbs so I'm definitely overweight but I'm down from 245 and aiming to reach 170 by September, so I guess I'm proud of that.\n\n#3. I'm passionate about a lot of things, so I have a lot to talk about (even if I haven't *done* too much yet in life).\n\n#4. I'm a good listener, and genuinely love to talk to people (I mostly talk to girls because I'm a single 18 year old but I'll talk to anyone, really).\n\n#5. I try to help people even if I don't know them too well, which leads to a lot of friendships.\n\n#6. I used to be a really terrible person (imagine a 16 year old manipulative neckbeard) but I've changed a lot in the past year and my main focuw now is just becoming more normal and sociable.\n\n#7. I'm pretty confident most of the time, but depression hits me like a truck for a few hours sometimes and I revert back to being a perverted, anxious wreck.\n\n#8. I recognize that I have issues in my personality but want to fix them, regardless of how hard it might be.\n\n#9. I try to roll with the punches and realize not everyone is going to like me all the time.\n\n#10. I've come this far in fixing myself, and I know I can finish the job.\n\nI'm sorry this was so longwinded, but I really wanted to put this all in writing and hopefully get some advice. Thank you for taking the time to read this and help me.\n\nTL;DR: I've come a long way in self-improvement but I still have a few deep-seated issues that I want to review and solve.",

Figuring this out is a bit too different for my primitive brain to handle, as I'm much more of a \"make things work by any means necessary\" kind of guy, whereas this needs a bit more tact to areas I haven't thought of. I'm hoping the fine folks on here who have found themselves in a similar position might be able to offer some ideas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA bit about them. Female. 30's. Not a ton of work experience, but a enough to not automatically get counted off as unemployable or whatever. University educated but in a highly specific field that hasn't panned out, so far including it on resumes may have hurt more than helped, seeing as the resumes are for more entry level positions. While the person is more capable than they believe they are and are fairly good at adapting and learning, they don't have any defined skill set that would lend itself to a particular job (such as being good at sewing and becoming a seamstress, I don't know).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey've been a stock associate and that worked really well for a while. Late nights, no general public, small consistent team. But over a long enough period of time the work itself got too much, as it was physically more than they could handle day to day for injury reasons. But something in the same vein but not as body breaking might be a great fit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe biggest hindrance is their social anxiety. Which is obviously why I'm here. They're often afraid of entering new territory, even starting at a new job before having to do anything it becomes a hurdle that has to be crossed, let alone things like dealing with a new field or new people and potentially awkward/stressed situations. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe live in a major city. And while that's beneficial for the sheer number of rotating jobs, it's also terrible for someone with anxiety. Even something like a simple retail position does inevitably get its fair share of crazies, simply by chance that there are SO MANY PEOPLE. I used to work security and I've seen a lot of shit here and I'm used to it. But for shy people this city is FUCKED. Whether it's just serving coffee or getting on the train or walking down the street, there is a not insignificant chance of having alien interactions with people. They are from a small town, and just the amount of randoms that might walk in off the street in most jobs creates a lot of anxiety in and of itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo. We're looking to locate either an entry level type of job that would allow her to spend either most of her time alone or with a small group of people, predominately away from the casual public for obvious reasons. There isn't a ton of money available, but in the near future, if there is a particular type of field that she could go back to school for that is only a year or two course that's not a ton in tuition and fits the bill, she might consider that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've thought of certain things like book store clerk or library page, 'cause at least those typical crowds aren't the rowdy, boisterous types (though big city public libraries have their own nutsos). And we're sending out resumes for that type of stuff, but we're running out of ideas. So I'm calling on the truly introverted of Reddit...what does she do? What do you do for work? There has to be a ton of jobs behind the scenes that we just aren't seeing...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help.",

It's Combination of the ideas expressed in this sub (antiwork original), exteme unhappiness with what I do (general labor factory and wareheouse work which occasionally has branched off into non general labor duties but warehouse and factory none the less), undiagnosed and untreated sometimes crippling mental illness ......and a lack of transportation. \n\nAnyways, I have stuff I have to take care of legally and financially so I must go back to work. I'm waiting to start at an Amazon sortation center around May 8 but then also got a call for a machine operation job which I am starting tonight on C-Shift. Other than outpatient meetings I had to go to for a DWI (said legal and financial stuff) and the occasional trip to the store with my wife and kids or a walk for excercise I honestly never leave the house.\n\nTonight I'm going to have to be thrust back into the fake world of a manufacturing job where it's just you and the 20-100 other people who are also stuck in the alternate universe called a molding plant and I'm honestly doubting whether I can even do this or not. I have absolutely no desire to be around anybody, suck up or become friends with person ABC and pretend I give a fuck about manufacturing for 8 hours of my life. I feel like my bad attitude is going to show right through and I'll be sent home or something and I don't even know what to do.\n\nI do have a background in factory and warehouse but when you start a job like this through a temp agency...nobody cares. I'm so beyond sick of having to prove my self over and over and over again. \n\nAny suggestions and or advice for getting through this night? I have social anxiety disorder and some sort of paranoia disorder ....... untreated. I don't do small talk well and the little social things most people do effortlessly. Even when I have overcame it for a period of time and managed to make friends/associates at jobs it usually never lasts and dies with the job. To this day I've never had a friend I met through work whom I actually hung out with out side of it. \n\nOh and furthermore I was barley given a job description and only know what the place does because of the name. It's injection molding. I don't know if they think I know anything about that but I don't. I really don't care to learn either. Im not interested by this stuff. My resume makes it seem like I am though which is a ridiculous cycle I can't seem to escape even though I've been straight up trying to explain it to different agencies and employer's lately that I'd like to try other things. They just don't care and ignore it. It's like I'm doomed to this warehouse/manufacturing hell.\n\nThe Amazon job is actually only part time compared to this one but pays more and honestly not much is expected of you other than to show up and move your arms. They hire people who can't speak English and require no interview and could careless if you don't want to show up tomorrow. Legit. I don't know why but that makes me feel better about these useless jobs, that they're so take it or leave it, come as you are with it. So barring I'm completely wrong about this job and it's wonderful (ha!) I'm probably going to Amazon anyways, but I can't shake this terrible feeling about being thrust back into this fake ass workplace shit tonight and how it's all going to go badly.

        "original": "Also posted this on a dating subreddit but really feel like this post belongs here. Sorry for the tl;dr, i feel like there are a lot of specific details that i need to throw in.\n\nBeen a nerdy guy for my entire life, and the two relationships i've had only happened because the girls took the first move. Never had something of a self-esteem, but now that i am 27 i am feeling like i am taking control of my life.\n\nI've known this girl for quite some time trough a group of friends. Back then she dated someone who was in the same social circle, but it's been a couple of years that they split up and he moved to another part of the country. There was one time that i could swear that she was hitting on me, but she was still in that \"ending relationship\" phase, and i did not want to get in his way. Good thing i did that, as i saw him with her a couple of weeks later. They were together but fighting. afaik it did not last long after that. Me and this guy were just acquaintances, not really friends.\n\nWell, i've had forgotten about this girl until i went to the birthday of another friend of ours a couple of weeks ago, and after years with a beard, i had finally shaved it of. The first thing she said when she saw my new face was how good looking i was with a clean face. That was the first thing to light the fire, but as a ball-less man i am, i just kept looking for more signals until the party ended and went back home alone.\n\nShe lives with a another girl that i've worked with in some projects. Her flatmate and i have similar aesthetics taste, and she's the only person i know who practices some kinks i am into. But i've always felt some red flags around her, and even though i find her attractive, never felt for her. She is funny around me, and sometimes stares at me but i honestly don't know if she is into me or is afraid of me falling for her and making a mess.\n\nWell, back to the story, there was another reunion on the birthday friend's place, and it was my first time weed-free for 5+ years. Well, it is one of the details that i need to tell, as even a month after quitting daily weed use, i feel my life had changed upside down. Even got a better job, first time it is a REAL job after moving away from the city due to the financial chaos my life had become. The long commute is killing me but i am not feeling down for the first time in a long time.\n\nIn this event, i sat by the window to smoke my cigs, even though most of the people in the place were smokers and no one gave a shit and smoked in the middle of the living room. She sat near me with another friend of ours for her smoke, and i talked to her about how i was feeling with the now weed-free mind, new job and stuff. it's been a REAL long time i did not open myself like this to a girl, and being able to comfortably show my vulnerable side like this, and she supporting me in my new journey was the thing that glued her inside my mind. We talked for some time, but i did not feel any real flirty signs from her. I even told her how i am a pussy, afraid of doing things, afraid of putting my wishes above other's because of \"harmony\", and she encouraged me to take risks (\"fuck harmony\"). I wanted to kiss her then, but again, too much of a coward. She spent quite some time near me, but eventually she fled to the other side of the room, to not talk to me again, and i interpreted it as \"oh shit he's into me let me get away before things get worse for everyone\".\n\nOne thing that got stuck in my mind was how i opened up, when i actually did not know her much. And i really wanted to know her now.\n\nI tried to forget it but i could not, and for the first time in a real long time, i asked her out. Sent a message asking if she wanted to go out for a drink later the day. Geez, i was shaking the entire evening. When i was about to give up thinking she would just ghost me, she responded that the not only she would like to, but already had some friends coming over her place later, and said that i should join them. At the same time i felt happy, i was afraid that she just did not want me to feel bad for being rejected and tried to be nice. There was only one way of knowing, and it was going there. When my job was over i headed to her place. Grabbed some beers along the way, and was the first to arrive. Actually met her in front of her apartment, and was she struggling carrying a 12-pack of beer cans. Though it was odd as i usually see her drinking wine or those fruity drinks. We were alone for a couple of hours before her friends arrived, and to my surprise they were big friends of mine. My low self-esteem just made me think \"heck, full friends meeting, if she did not want me around i am just here because she did not want to make me upset as i asked her out\". But in those hours we talked a lot, about a lot of things, and she even put some music i love in her stereo, things i did not know she liked. But i did not saw any of the signs i got from any of the girls i've had something with in the past. She even kept some distance. So i kept to myself.\n\nAfter the first two friends got in, she did not give me any \"special\" attention. So i took it as a no from her.\n\nHer flatmate was at another of our friend's place. A guy whom i always have some projects with, and they were supposed to come together after their work thing. He called asking if she did not want to move the party to his place, as both of them were already there, but there were already more people in her place so he said they were coming. Well, only her flatmate came, and she did not want to stay in the room drinking with us. She was visibly down and wanted to be left alone in her room. I tried to not overthink it, and kept drinking and enjoying my friends company.\n\nA time came when it would get hard for me to go back to my place (said earlier, living far now), and well, as i did not think it was going anywhere, i announced my departure. She then said that i should stay because there was still plenty of drinks in the fridge. Well, i could crash at one of the other friends place, so i decided to stay. I rarely have free time after i got this new job, so i though that i shouldn't just run away from a fun night just because the girl i wanted was not into me.\n\nKept drinking till 4a.m. when my friend who would lend me a couch announced his departure, and even heard she and another girl there talking about some misfortune with guys. She even said i could have her couch if it was too hard for me to get to my place.\n\nWell, one side of my brain keeps telling me to stop wasting time thinking about her and move on, as she only sees me as a friend and did not want to make me sad by saying no to my invitation. The other side of it is just saying that i am a pussy and she's into me but afraid of showing, and that i should try harder and be more of a man and take the risks.\n\nWell, sorry for the long post, but i needed to take this out of my mind, and really need some outside view on this.

It was interesting but i was a kid and math makes me tired. So i unknowingly dozed off. Suddenly I\u2019m woken up by my teacher at the end of the play. So apparently while i was asleep, I snored so loud it echoed through the theater. Mind you even the actors on stage were interrupted by the sound of one boy snoring, so i was interrupting the play. And the best part. No one woke me up. They just let it happen for who knows how long.\n\n I\u2019ve never felt so embarrassed in my life. On the bus ride home i.was.tormented. Kids were poking me in the head, pretending to sleep and snore extra loudly and then look at me and laugh, and etc( At this time i was a little bi boy with his first crush on a guy, and he was one of the main tormentors that day, that was scaring). Mind you at this point in time i didn\u2019t have any friends because i was bullied real bad around this time for having a bigger than average head and i use to skip(it felt faster than walking and less serious than running) a lot when i was a kid and was heavy.(just everything stacked against me honestly) \n\nSo i just remember going home and telling my mom i didn\u2019t want to go to school the next day.

        "original": "So let me preface this by saying that I\u2019ve suffered from SA for many years now. It was extremely bad during my teenage years to the point where I literally had no friends for a period of probably 2-3 years. Since then, I\u2019ve been out of my comfort zone enough times that it\u2019s improved substantially but unfortunately there are still very particular things that scare the shit out of me.\n\nLong story short, I graduated from college last year and currently work a part time job in a field that I enjoy but which doesn't pay me very well atm. I\u2019ve been looking for another job on the side for a couple months now and after failing to find anything else in my field I decided to apply for a cashier job at a local grocery store on a whim. Shockingly, I was actually hired despite having no customer service experience and I had my first day yesterday. I spent about 4 out of 5 hours there restocking shelves, which was fine since I didn\u2019t really have to interact with anyone. Then the terrifying part came. The manager decided to teach me how to use the register (which was going to be my primary duty) and gave me brief rundown before letting me take over for the last hour.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt more stupid in my life. I fumbled around with the register and the change while customers looked at me like I was retarded. I could hardly bag the items way the customers and manager wanted. The manager even got all pissy at me when I made a simple mistake and also asked me to chase after someone I thought had underpaid by 2 cents (which it turns out was only because I had counted the change wrong).\n\nI\u2019m 23 years old I fully admit that the moment I got home I just burst into tears. To be completely honest, I didn\u2019t expect the day to end like this because after all these years dealing with SA I thought I could finally handle it but I guess I was wrong. That same night I decided that I wasn\u2019t going in the next day and today I sent a letter to the manager telling him that I\u2019ve decided to resign. \n\nI admit that I still have mixed feelings about it now and I know some of you will tell me that it would have gotten easier and part of me is saying the same thing. Maybe you\u2019re right, but even if you are, I simply don\u2019t think that this job was worth the emotional stress it would have caused, and if any job is going to do that to me I\u2019d rather it be one on a career path I\u2019m actually interested in taking.\n\nI am very lucky to be in a position that I didn\u2019t need this job in order to survive and I honestly don\u2019t know what I would do if I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t really have any words of wisdom to share but I hope this community will understand my decision more than anyone.",

She drifted off with another guy, who is a bit narcissistic. I didn't talk to her since then. Now I've found someone else I'm looking into.)\n\nThere's a girl I'm interested in at high school. She seems to also be interested in me. In the lunch room, before spring break, when I was walking by her to a lunch line, she made a kissing sound, but I was too afraid to look and see if she was doing it to me. After lunch, she found me in the hallway and asked me to hold a lanyard for her. I start thinking she's interested in me, so I look for more clues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Monday after spring break, I sat at her table and her friends started talking to me and asking me if I like her. They told me not to worry because \"she can't hear you, because...she's got a tumor that's blocking her ears.\" I responded to the question, \"I don't know, yet.\" They said, \"What do you mean by 'yet'?\" I replied, \"I wanna find out.\" This was a definite sign that she has told them about me, which is good. She was sitting, her head down because she was sick earlier. A few minutes later they say, \"She's not moving, maybe she's dead.\" I know they are pulling my leg, but I check her pulse anyways. One of her friends says \"Oh, you're a doctor now?\" Nah, I just checked her pulse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI start sitting next to her in the auditorium, but shortly after, that narc guy arrives and interrupts while I'm showing her a Weird Al parody. Me being socially anxious, I don't rebuke him like I should have. I notice them walking in the hallway later, but not holding hands. They must be friends. She still says hey to me when I say hi to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see 3 possible reasons of why she's doing this:\n\n1. She is interested in me, but wants to make me jealous so I'd compete for her.\n2. She might be playing me for social status.\n3. She's simply not interested in me that way, but is giving the wrong signals.\n\nI'd say that option 1 is the most likely, because her friends giggled when she was around while I was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's nearing prom, but I don't realize it until it's too late. I've just heard talk of this guy going to prom with her. I didn't know when prom is, and I wouldn't have the courage to ask her out if I did know. It's on a Saturday, but I'll be away this weekend! I can't make it to prom! If I had futuristic technology, I would troll this guy, teleport him out of the car before he can get closer, or pick his car up with a tractor beam, but such technology doesn't exist yet. Maybe I should just let it play out and hopefully she'll find out that he just wants to have sex (I overheard that too).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe told that guy and I that her mom changed her Snapchat password so she can't get on.

        "original": "So, hi, I'm a 21F. I have a past quite full of bullying and disappointments with \"friends\". This happened in highschool. Highschool was by far the worst time of my life so far. It all eventually pushed me into depression and many, many panic attacks. A couple of years of psychiatry and escitalopram later and I feel a lot better, pretty much normal, thank god. I think my past left some scars, though. When I finally left highschool and came to college, I left all of the bad people behind, went to a city on the other side of the country, and met amazing people. AMAZING people! Whom I'm very lucky to call my friends. We're a pretty close group of 7 very different individuals and at this point I don't know how to live without them. Everything seems great, but the problem is I'm paranoid. If they organize something and end up not inviting me for some reason I feel so bad. I have had panic attacks over things like that (had one two days ago). And I know the problem is not them at all. I don't want to be this kind of person, that gets mad and acts passive aggressive. I don't want to get mad at people I care about so much. It's really not their fault. I don't have the right to create such uncomfortable situations for everyone. But I always feel like I'm not enough. My self esteem has always been pretty much non existant. Every little tiny situation makes my anxiety peak. The most ridiculous insignificant things about them. I feel like, deep down, they don't really like me. I'm constantly feeling ignored. I care a lot, about every little thing and everyone, and all my life I felt like I gave way more to people than what they gave me. But I think I'm just a bit above average on the caring spectrum, it's not them that don't actually care. I try too hard. I'm always worried I'm being annoying, always worried I'll do something wrong and they will stop hanging out with me. I never really talked to them about this. They have no idea. It's been 4 years of friendship and nothing has changed. I don't know what I can do about it, what to do to get better. I just wanted to be genuinely happy about them having fun, weather I'm there or not, and I just can't. I just get overwhelmingly anxious. Does anyone have any advice? Any tips or tricks? How do I overcome this? I don't want to live under this much pressure, like I need to prove myself every second.   \n\n\ntl;dr: Bullied to depression in highschool. Found an amazing group of friends in college, whom I love very much and have been with for more than 4 years. I'm very paranoid that they don't actually like me and take anything they do as proof of so. The most insignificant things make me very anxious and have had panic attacks over things like not being invited for something. Advice?",

        "original": "Today I went on my first date with a girl I know from school and the whole time I was there, I can think of only 3 times when I was up in my head. It's great progress from when I was sitting with a bunch of people and just thinking. Not talking, not listening, not having fun. Just up in my head because the truth was too hard to bear : I didn't know how to do this. I for one am a person who needs to know how to do something. Like I need guidelines. Or I thought I did. Because today, I went in without a plan, without pre-rehearsed lines that I could use when things got silent for even a second and no jokes at all. I went in knowing that it would be hard to pull it off, I wanted nothing from her, I just wanted myself to have a good time and do everything in my power to do it. In doing so, I'd used the Stoic principle of outcome independence meaning that you must not, in any way give heed to what the result of something outside your powers is.  I knew that if she wasn't attracted to me, things won't go well, or if she didn't find my sense of humour funny, there's nothing I could do. So I tried to have fun, and I did. \n\nIn fact, there was a very good 'moment' that was made when we were sitting all alone on a bench with her warm skin touching my legs and my arms feeling the softness of her skin. I wasn't in my head and I was just looking at how beautiful her dark eyes were and how adorable her rabbity teeth were. I could see that she was leaning in closer and looking at my lips quite a few times but my resolution this year has been to 1. Lose 10 kg- that I've accomplished and 2. to be honest. So I was honest with her and told her the truth. I wasn't really attracted to her. Yeah sure, the idea of getting my first kiss was exciting but I wasn't really aroused be the idea of her. I was aroused be the fact that she had a female body. So following through with my resolution, I pushed back a little and I think she understood. But afterwards, while I was sitting in a cab, I got a text from her, thanking me for not pursuing her for lust sake and she told me that she'd had a pretty devastating experience with someone else who basically used,physically, her knowing what she wanted from him.\n\nAnd that is what I want you to take from it. They say that honesty is the best policy. It's hackneyed too much. But I can't tell you how much of a boulder has been lifted from my shoulders since I've begun being honest.  Oh and honesty does not mean never lying. Honest means not pretending. And that means -\n\n1. Not pretending with others about how you feel about them(positive or negative opinions, if it's not extremely rude or harsh or inconsequential) \n2. And this is the most important one : Not pretending with yourself about how and what you're feeling. If you're feeling anxious, you need not deflect it or pretend it isnt' there. You've just got to accept what you're feeling and feeling it completely to the point where that feeling doesn't exist anymore.\n\nFake it till you make it works not because you can pretend who and what you are, but because you can get to see what being in that kind of a mindset and then changing your mindset, bit by bit so that extra efforts need not be put in the achieve the desired goals.",

I'm a 20 year old guy from the UK and just want to get this out.\n\nDealing with PSSD (post SSRI sexual dysfunction) on top of my social anxiety disorder is a joke, I took 3 pills of Sertraline when I was 18 and lost most of my sexual functioning and feelings and feel very empty which is still the case almost two years later. I've had social anxiety since I was young and I went through school and sixth form without any close relationships, debilitating anxiety and even drank alcohol before going into sixth form because it was the only thing I knew of to stop the intense anxiety I was feeling. Then when I turned 18 I took Sertraline which was one of my biggest mistakes and now I have even more to worry about. I would love to have a relationship since I've never been in one before but my social anxiety always made that more than difficult and now PSSD makes me feel as if that's not even an option anymore.\n\nOnce the daily torture of school was over at 18 I tried to get a part time job but had to quit after the first day because of my social anxiety and now two years later at 20 I've managed to hold a part time job. It's a real struggle but it's something I suppose even though sometimes I wonder why I bother putting myself though it.\n\nI have plans on what I'm going to do now to help myself but it's just so fucking overwhelming. I need to go to CBT which I've actually been to before when I was 17 but looking back I think the place I went to was really poor so I'll try it again. I need to admit to my family I have social anxiety disorder so they can understand me better but it's really hard because I just freak out over the idea of telling them and and I can't bring myself to admit it out of embarrassment I suppose. And then for PSSD, the PSSD forum has been great, very supportive and provided a lot of information. There's a well known protocol for people with PSSD and another condition called PFS (Post finasteride syndrome) which is the CD Nuts protocol and I want to learn it and follow it even though it seems insanely difficult.

You could say I should not think too much about what other people think but it doesn't seem to be as easy as just shrugging off. I have never met a therapist and talked about my problems. And it is simply out of the question because it is very expensive around here. And it is also difficult to find a proper, qualified therapist even for a massive price. Which is why I don't necessarily understand what exactly is wrong with me.\n\nI am not, and have not, been able to communicate comfortably with people in social situations. I thought this was just a part of my personality and that I would be able to cope with it with more exposure to social situations, but it has been a crippling problem. I have had friends when I was in school. And a handful at college, but never anyone that I could call a best friend or anyone I properly connected with. I have explored the social game as wide as possible. I have visited clubs and hung out in corners not being able to approach people. I don't even like clubs, but I went that far.\n\nI tried volunteering with a mental health institute but I was still not able to communicate properly. From where I come from, people tend to say \"You don't talk much\" more often than initiating conversation and trying to start a topic to at least talk about. I have never had a Girlfriend because I have never been able to talk to a girl for long enough before embarrassing myself. I'm not gonna say I'm not attractive at all because, I seriously don't know. I have never been complimented in my entire life by any girl or friend about how I look let alone been given feedback. I try, I really do. Not to impress people. But to at least be a part of social life. I did have a girl who I thought was my best friend. She got really worried once when I said I was thinking about ending my life. This was when I wasn't in my best of times and she somewhat helped stop me from doing it. I don't really have suicidal thoughts anymore. But you never know right? She has very carefully ghosted me ever since. I probably scared her off.\n\nI have never talked about this with anyone but I have been sexually abused when I was 10. I didn't even know it was sexual abuse back then. But I feel like....I don't how to express what I feel like in words when I think about it now. Again I don't understand whether this has anything to do with what I am like now. And there has been a lot of fights between my parents when I was a child. My mother tried to commit suicide. I barely remember that one. And my grandmother was the worst and most devious human being I have ever met. Childhood was pretty shit, but my parents managed to stitch things together and haven't caused too much of a ruckus after we grew up. We as in me and my Sister. I can't really talk to my Sister because a) she is abroad attending University and is very busy with a bunch of her own problems and b) I can't really listen to her cry right now over this, it's the last thing I need.\n\nI also have this problem of feeling invisible when I do manage to talk. It's almost as if I'm not heard. I mean I understand that they must have heard me. But it seems as if they choose not to hear. I know this sounds stupid and It's obviously something wrong with me. I want to understand how to cope with this better. There was a time when I would have gladly just swallowed a bunch of pills. But I want to understand if there is a way to live with this. Is there a way to improve connections with people?\n\nI am very sorry about this extremely long post and I completely understand if you skip it. But if you have time to stop by and read it thank you very much. And if you took the time reply thank you so much.

        "original": "This will likely be a bit long and rant-y so apologies in advance. Any advice is welcome. \n\nSo I\u2019m 19F and I was diagnosed with social anxiety and depression when I was 14 but have suffered since early childhood. I finished high school last year and I\u2019m now doing my first year of university. I had a bad habit of skipping classes in high school due to my anxiety and I told myself I wouldn\u2019t continue that habit in uni, but low and behold, here I am, so many absences I\u2019ve lost count. \n\nThe only time I leave my house is to go to uni or to go to my dad\u2019s house. I\u2019m close with my siblings (I have 6), so I have a lot of social interaction with them, but not really with anyone else. I still keep contact with my friends from high school via text/social media, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone in a while. My plan was to make friends at uni but I don\u2019t go regularly enough to build them up from acquaintances to friends. I know the simple answer to my problems is to push through and keep going to uni and build friendships, but I\u2019m at a point where I JUST CANT. I know that sounds like a cop out, but so be it if it is. I\u2019m just exhausted. \nI\u2019ve never had a job, and my mum is pushing me to get one (she has bpd so discussions about this topic become explosive very quickly and she has 0 understand or empathy on this issue). I really really want to, honestly - but I know what I am like. I can\u2019t even attend uni classes regularly, how am I to expect an employer to put up with me? As much as I may tell myself I will attend every shift, I know myself, I know that I avoid things when they get hard. \n\nUltimately, I know I need to get back into therapy. I saw a therapist from age 14 - 16 but I stopped because something my therapist said hurt my feelings (stupid, I know). I went to a few others, but I didnt find anyone I was comfortable with so I stopped looking. I honestly don\u2019t know if therapy even works for me. During the two years I saw my therapist, my social anxiety made me feel the need to not let her down. I would lie to her and pretend that I was getting better because I didn\u2019t want her to be disappointed in me. Logically, I know that\u2019s not how therapists think, but I just can\u2019t stop myself from being like this. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know if I want to get better. I just want to give up. I feel like I have reached a point in my life where this is the furthest I was meant to go. I look into the future and I see nothing for me. I want to get married and I want to have kids but that brings forth a whole new wave of problems (having to meet my husbands family, having to stand in front of a crowd on my wedding day, having to socialise with other mums at school, having to socialise with parents when my children have play dates etc.). I just don\u2019t feel like the reward is worth all the suffering. Many will look at me and call me weak, and that\u2019s okay, because maybe I am. I\u2019m happy to be called anything, I don\u2019t care anymore, I just want this pain to end.",

Yes, let me dispel that myth for you, bully does occur past highschool and it can be a real problem.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlong with that, I try to go to meetups every couple weeks.  I find random meetups on meetup and go.  Every two weeks.  I try to talk to everyone there, and you'd think considering the entire purpose of these gatherings is to socialize and make friends, it would be simple.  It is not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhenever I attempt to talk about this to my therapist, she says something along the lines of \"You have to learn to be okay with your situation before you can get out of it.\" and honestly that sounds like being asked to saw my arm off.  How can you learn to be okay with something that actively hurts you.  The few times I've found myself \"learning to be okay with it\" were when I started to put in as little effort as possible, limiting my chances even further.  It feels like someone is telling me \"Hey, I know you're asking when you're going to get out of this prison cell, but...  You'll be fine, as soon as you're okay with being trapped and completely isolated in prison, only then will you \\*maybe\\* start to see opportunities to get out of prison.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has been in a situation similar to mine, how did you manage to get out of it?

        "original": "  Sorry in advance if this post gets too long, I tend to have a bad habit of rambling on.  Anyways to start I've been going to therapy for social anxiety to a about 5 years on and off at a clinic, I've seen a total of 4 different psychologists 2 of which I enjoyed working with and thought we were making progress.  Then they were offered promotions and handed off their patients to new psychologists.  The newest one I've seen recommended I go to a different clinic where they specialize in SA, this was during our first session.  All of this has made me feel like trash and doesn't help my situation with my anxiety, being seemingly constantly transferred to other therapists then after years going to this one clinic being told I should go somewhere else.  They were all nice in all these situations but it still feels bad.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I decided to look for another therapist, and it has been a pain in the ass finding one that accepts my insurance.  I finally did find a couple that I thought looked good, gave them a call after mulling over calling them for days they took my info and said they would get back to me in a couple of days.  Never happened and it's been a week.  I want to call them back, I assume they are busy and a lot of stuff is going on.  I feel incredibly anxious about calling back and asking if they are still taking in new patients again and if they had missed / forgotten to get back to me.  Not having any therapy has felt real bad, while it's not always useful it's nice to be able to talk to a therapist one of the very few people who I feel semi comfortable talking with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo top it all off I've been working with DVR for a few months now, and I have an interview tomorrow.  I worked with someone to go over the interview questions and what to expect a few hours ago, and I already forgot most of it.  Now I fear about going to an interview and making a fool of myself.  The question \"tell me about yourself\"  terrifies me.  I have no previous work experience, I don't know what they will want me to say about myself.  I fear I'll ramble on and talk about irrelevant topics.  It would be my first job, oh yeah I'm also 26 y/o.  That also makes me feel awful.  I've done odd jobs with and for my family but I've never had a steady job before.

        "title": "How I Got Rid of my Social Anxiety (Not a Panacea, but things that helped me)",
        "original": "First of all, I know this post is long, bear with me. I took 2 hours to write this all out because I really think it will help someone out there. This anxiety thing isn't simple, and took me a long time to understand. I really value your time and have only written what I think is important to pass on.\n\nI\u2019m writing this post to be the message I wish I could\u2019ve read 2 years ago. If I had understood then what I understand now, I could\u2019ve saved myself so much pain, embarrassment, and loneliness. I hope his helps someone out there. Even if your experience is somewhat different, I guarantee there is something in what I\u2019ve been through that might help make sense of it all.\n\n**TLDR**: I went from fully socially comfortable, surrounded by friends, outgoing and friendly, to depressed, thinking anxious thoughts all time, desperately uncomfortable around other people. At that point, I did everything I could to figure out what went wrong, and how I could fix this terrible problem. The two main factors in the development of my social anxiety were an addiction to my phone/computer/Netflix/Reddit/Youtube, and increasing isolation from other people.\n\n**How my Social Anxiety Developed**\n\nA little background about my life. When I was young, basically up until high school, I never had a problem with anxiety. I spent tons of time with my friends, perfectly fine social skills, played sports, no problems with depression or anything like that. I\u2019m 22 years old now, just finished four years of college. I think kids growing up today are dealt a much harder hand than I had. Internet addiction and compulsive smartphone usage played a huge role in my becoming isolated, anxious and depressed, and I imagine there are lots of kids out there who are maybe going through something similar, but without the foundation of a normal social childhood/early years.\n\n\nI started to develop anxiety around other people in high school. I had friends in school, through classes and sports, but didn\u2019t spend much time with them outside of school. At the end of the day I would usually go home and spend time on Reddit, Youtube, Netflix or watch pirated movies and TV shows. My family had some serious problems, so I didn\u2019t like to spend time with them. I would just go into my room alone, and try and take my mind off my problems with entertainment. My family was pretty poor, so I\u2019d be hungry often, not have a lot of energy, and just want to unwind in bed with my laptop. I spent a lot of time doing that, especially over the summers.\n\n\nI went off to college and everything turned around for me. I was lucky enough to live in a college dorm with some great, kind, wonderful people, and I became good friends with many of them. I made an active effort to spend time with my friends, and I had social interaction every day. It became so easy for me to spend time with people. I was the happiest I\u2019d ever been, and figured I\u2019d grown from my awkward high school days and I was cured. I didn\u2019t realize it could ever be like that again.\n\n\nMy senior year things became worse for me than they\u2019d ever been. I\u2019m not proud of how I responded to a difficult year, but I honestly did not understand what was wrong with me, or how to fix it. I was swamped with difficult classes on top of working 20hrs a week at a job I hated. I had a bad habit of procrastinating until the last minute, and it caught up with me. I became constantly sleep deprived, was close to broke all the time so I started barely eating, just trying to will my way through the work I had to get done. I started finding it incredibly difficult to focus on reading technical research articles, having to go back and reread paragraphs over and over again. I became terribly uncomfortable just answering questions in class. When I started missing assignments and classes, I avoided my friends so I wouldn\u2019t have to explain. My mind started to become uncomfortable, even alone. I numbed the pain and constant anxiety by going on reddit, youtube, Netflix, mindlessly browsing looking for something to make me smile or laugh, just something bright in what became a daily experience of feeling depressed, sad, anxious, all the time. I would be on my phone or listening to music almost constantly. I would constantly be thinking about how I was missing work, letting down my family and friends. I didn\u2019t want to open up to anyone. I was incredibly ashamed. I ended up failing two classes, attended my graduation since grades weren\u2019t out yet, and just lied to family and friends. I told no one that I had failed, just held it inside. I moved back home with my parents, took an easy job where I figured I could take time to figure out what went wrong, and go back to finish my degree after a semester or two off. It\u2019s been just about a year now since I failed, and I\u2019m going back in the fall to finish.\n\n\n**Symptoms of Social Anxiety, How it Played Out in my Life**\n\n\nOnce I moved back home, I took a job where I had infrequent social interaction, and I spent very little time with my family. Problems with social anxiety became worse than they had ever been. I would feel anxious when people walked up to me, I would feel anxious just doing something as simple as ordering coffee or walking through a grocery store. In conversations, I would try to make normal, comfortable eye contact, but lose track of what the other person was saying because my attention was on eye contact. I almost definitely came across as dumb or unfriendly. And that\u2019s not me being too harsh on myself; I\u2019ve spent most of my life friendly and pleasant to be around, I understand how I was coming across, I just couldn\u2019t figure out how to be socially comfortable again. I was literally losing track of simple conversations, or my responses would become simple and short. This was very embarrassing for me. I became uncomfortable just being with other people, so I isolated myself more. Every day just kind of sucked, I was always worrying about how I came across to others, always worried in general. I became very depressed and lonely. Started smoking weed frequently, playing video games, watching movies, just looking for something good after a day of awkward interactions, of being judged, of feeling alone. Almost all of my friends from college lived far away, so I saw them very infrequently. \n\n\n**How I Got Rid of the Anxiety, Became Socially Comfortable Again**\n\n\nA big part of trying to get better was keeping track of how I was spending my time. I started writing an hour-by-hour log every day of what I was doing. Then at the end of the week, I\u2019d review how the week had been, what areas I needed to focus on, what mistakes I kept making. At the end of the month, I\u2019d do the same process. I started bringing a small notebook with me everywhere I went, and took down quick notes on any ideas or experiences that I wanted to be sure to remember later. I wrote in a journal, infrequently at first, then more regularly. I recommend doing something to keep track of life, it makes it easier to identify trends and progress.\n\n\nI stopped compulsively using my phone, and I cut back the time I was spending online, on reddit, watching youtube. All the time I would spend flicking my attention from link to link on reddit, always taking in content, never producing my own thoughts, was hurting my attention span and genuinely hurting my mind. I found it harder to become engrossed in books and long form content than it was when I was younger. This was a real problem for me my senior year, and I am sure that my constant use of reddit and social media was a factor in my difficulty concentrating and getting work done. All that time on the internet was hurting my attention and putting my mind in an anxious state of staccato, quick thoughts. I am 100% sure that my overuse of the internet, specifically reddit and youtube, was having an adverse affect on my mind. It was taking the place of the natural human state of mind; longform, uninterrupted production and operation of thought. \n\n\nI started a habit of meditation every day. Essentially you sit quietly, and pay attention to sensations, emotions, and thoughts as they arise. I can\u2019t overstate how important this has been to me. It is a peaceful 10 minutes at the start of the day, where I can relax, don\u2019t have to worry about all the real problems that follow me around all day, and begin to understand the operation of my mind. I use the Waking Up app, highly recommend it, it is exceptionally well made. If you can\u2019t afford the monthly subscription, like me, the creator Sam Harris offers a free yearly subscription, you just have to email the address in the app description, no questions asked. \n\n\nI started spending more time with people who I loved, who wouldn\u2019t judge me. And I did it consistently, over and over. This is the most important part. I was always anxious to talk with people, because I wasn\u2019t doing it very often. And when I did talk to people at work, they were strangers who didn\u2019t know me, so if I came off as shifty or nervous they would pick up on that, and the interaction was often uncomfortable. My mind would then associate interaction with that unpleasant experience of being judged, of making people uncomfortable. Some of my good friends lived an hour or so away, but I knew I needed more social interaction, so I made the drive, over and over. There were periods where I would begin to feel socially comfortable, then become isolated for a few weeks, and it was like I had to start the whole process over. So it has to be consistent. After I spent an hour or so with my good friends, I would start to feel relaxed, and was more able to get into the conversations, without thinking about eye contact, being self conscious about everything I said, etc. The key to feeling like my old social self was in large part this right here. Spend more time with friends, or at least with someone who won't judge you, who you can let your guard down around, and whose company you enjoy. That last part is important, because you want your mind to instantly associate human interaction with positive emotion, not fear and awkward discomfort. I was lucky in that I had friends out there who loved me. I know some people don\u2019t have anyone, and when you are awkward and anxious it is very hard to make those connections. Don\u2019t give up. There has to be a way to make those connections.\n\n\nI started stretching and exercising every day. For me, anxiety and depression went hand in hand, and moving my body everyday had a huge impact on my depression. Obviously exercise alone won\u2019t fix all your problems. For more information on depression I recommend the book \u201cLost Connections\u201d by Johann Hari. It helped me a ton. Or for a quick runthrough of the book, listen to his interview on Joe Rogan or Sam Harris\u2019 podcast. Exercise and stretching (look up beginner yoga routines on youtube to follow along with) helped me correct my posture. After going through four intense years of study, often sitting hunched over a desk, or looking down at my phone, or just lounging on the couch, living a sedentary lifestyle in general, my posture was becoming a serious problem. Mind and Body are fundamentally linked, so if you want to feel comfortable in mind, it helps to feel comfortable in your body. Start off slow if you need to, go for a short walk at least. Even on my worst days, getting out of the house and walking the dog helped a little.\n\n\nI started eating more healthy food. I switched to a regular diet of mostly eggs, meat, fish, vegetables, fruit. I figured stick to the foods that our species has evolved to consume. I\u2019m not a nutrition expert, but eating like that, and getting enough to eat, meant I had a stable baseline of energy throughout the day, instead of being tired all the time.\n\n\n**Tips for Social Interaction**\n\n\nWhen I started spending more time with people, I was very rusty. I felt as if I had forgotten a bunch of the fundamentals. Here are a few things I find helpful to keep in mind.\n\n\n*Eye Contact*. I made so many mistakes when I was trying to get back to my normal social self, particularly around eye contact. Our species has evolved to convey and understand information through facial expressions and where we look. So it is important. Where you look says a lot. In general, when someone is talking to you, by looking at them you give the message \u201cI am listening to you, I\u2019m interested in what you\u2019re saying, you are heard.\u201d One mistake I was making was I would think \u201calright, be friendly, make eye contact\u201d. But I would be so uncomfortable and unused to the experience, I would think about it too much, I would focus intensely on the eyes, and would be so focused on eye contact I wouldn\u2019t even process what they said. So I\u2019d give off a message that\u2019s very off, too intense, and if I wasn\u2019t listening to what was said I had to look away and kind of process after the fact. \n\n\nYou basically want to get to a point where you aren\u2019t thinking about eye contact. That\u2019s only going to come from repeatedly going into social interactions, and eventually getting to a place where it doesn\u2019t make you uncomfortable, and you can just intuitively use your eyes to convey meaning. Thinking about eye contact while in conversation is like thinking about the shape of each letter as you write a sentance. When you were first learning to write, that was necessary. But if your attention is on the shape of each letter, that means your attention can't be directed where it belongs; on the content of the sentence. Similar situation with eye contact. As a general rule, try and be relaxed, be friendly, and look at the person that\u2019s talking to you. You don\u2019t have to stare them down, just relax your gaze so you\u2019re not pinpoint focused on only the eyes. You want your attention fully on what the person is saying to you, not on eye contact. You don\u2019t have to force eye contact. If you aren\u2019t too comfortable with it, that\u2019s alright. As long as you pay full attention to what\u2019s being said, you\u2019re alright. If you come off a little shy because you\u2019re not making a lot of eye contact, that\u2019s ok. It gets easier the more time you spend with people. For an idea of where people generally look while in conversation, watch a youtube video of an interview with someone you respect or admire, and see what they do. Or just pay attention to how the people around you make eye contact. People tend to comfortably look at the other person while listening, and while speaking people tend to look away often while thinking, kind of checking in with their eyes every once in a while. There\u2019s not one right way to do it, just do what is comfortable and effective for you.\n\n\n*What to say*. A lot of my anxiety around being with people was from not having much to talk about. Part of that was I was wasting so much time online, I really didn\u2019t have many interests or recent experiences that were engaging to discuss. In any case, it\u2019s always a good idea to try and talk in terms of the other person\u2019s interests, if you want them to be engaged in the conversation. When you are just getting to know someone, ask questions about their life that you are curious about. Again, the more you do it the easier it gets. Ask about their life, what they do, what they like, what they dislike. Try and find out what they are really interested and passionate about. For example, if they keep bringing up Basketball, take note of that. Ask about their favorite team, did they play the sport in high school, whatever comes to mind. Or talk about whatever\u2019s in the environment, or coming up at work or school. \n\n\nThis post has gotten a bit too long, hope this helps someone out there, if you have any questions please post, I\u2019ll respond when I can.",

        "original": "Hello. I'm 17F.\n\nI'm not sure if I want to post it but I need to vent something (and I have experience that when I something post on net I'm really scared of reaction. Once I post one story I wrote. I thought it was good but then I started feel anxious. This feeling grew up and I started think about how stupid and bad it was so I deleted it)\n\nNow the real reason I decided to write there.\n\nMy aunt is going to have a birthday party tomorrow. She invited whole family and some people who she knows. It's sounds like fun but not for me. But her friends (for me strangers) aren't my biggest problem. I will just ignore them and I hope they will ignore me too.\nMy problem is that I'm not able to talk with most of my own family. Always when we visited aunt and uncle I was in my cousins' room and usually stay there for hours (also it was when grandma lives so when I wasn't with cousins I was with here.. *they lived in one big house*) But then granda died and one of cousins got married and the second moved so I had to be with aunt, uncle, mother and her bf (basically my stepfather but I stopped talk with him too.. I don't know when. I don't know how. I don't know why. It has just happened).\nNow when we visit aunt and uncle (I always try to avoid it) I usually sit in another room and watch TV or do something on phone while everybody talk in other room. I don't want to join into their conversation because their usually talk about people I don't know or about think I don't care about. Sometimes they start smalltalk with me because they want to ask about school or boyfriend(I don't have bf and tbh I don't want anybody. And everybody ask me about relationship and when I'll find someone. It's annoying. When we visit relatives and I'm bored and text with friends they automatically ask on boyfriend. Even if I say I don't have bf and it's only friend they ignore that answer. I really hate this.)\n\nWith my brother I have similar problem with communication. Eight/seven years ago he had to moved (because of our mother's boyfriend) so he lived with father. At first I was happy because of sibling's fights but then I just didn't care. He didn't live far away from me and mother but even so we didn't talk very much (greeting when we met and sometimes short conversation what he started. Only per year).\nWhen he graduated he was standing in front of our house and was talking with mother about it. When I arrived from school they told me this news. I didn't know what to say (I didn't care tbh) so I only said 'congrats' and went to my room.\nLast year he found gf and few months ago they moved because of work (circa 6-7 hours traveling by car from there).\nOnce I visited him (to be honest, I was scared what he thinks about me 'cause I twice refused visiting him and my mother wanted me to go too). Our whole conversation was a few sentences. We were alone in house and if he didn't start asking me about school there would be silence.\nAnd... When we were talking I was nervous. I wasn't able to talk with him without fast heartbeat. As if I was talking with some stranger. And maybe he is stranger. I realised that I know nothing about him.\nThe rest of this visit I was quiet. I listened them six hours with few sentences I replied when someone asked me on something. But I didn't feel bored(like when I have to visit aunt). I just felt ok when I could listen them and I always was nervous when they were quiet(I was scared that they start asking me).\n\nBut I would like to talk with them like normal people again (at least with my brother 'cause aunt said me few things that force me to feel hatred toward her. Toward her and others family members.. And because of my anxiety. I don't think they know about it because I avoid meeting them. But they did some nice things too.)\nI don't know how to start a conversation with them. I don't know what should I say. I know nothing about them.\nTo be honest brother and his gf arrived two days ago and now they are at father's house. I come there almost every day so I was there when they arrived. But I didn't say welcome or something else. I was in my room and I hoped that they don't come there.\nAnd yesterday too. When I came there I sneaked to my room and I was happy because I didn't meet them on hallway. (They saw my shoes in front of my door but they didn't knock on door. I don't know what they think about me, what makes me feel little anxious, but they don't have a need to start conversation with me, neither).\n\nEven if I would be probably glad for tips how to fix this, I'm not sure if I would be able to realise it. I can say to myself 'do this, do that' but do it is sometimes really hard and I just give up and let anxiety win.\n\nThanks for read this and sorry for my imperfect English.\nI'm curious if tomorrow I will be able to say them something more than hi/hello.",

It's exhausting, I just want to sleep to forget about every potentially embarrasing moment after i get back from literally any social interaction.\n\nI'm 21 and I've been on benefits since I left school pretty much, it's sad for me to say but other than programming I'm progressing nowhere in life in any way. Programming is how I try to improve myself and I hope to get employed in the programming field one day. I'm not great at it, but I wouldn't call myself a beginner. I've been writing code on and off since 2016 struggling with motivation (however I do enjoy it).\n\nI don't know what to do now, I have savings because I predicted I would be in a financial mess one day due to my anxiety, I barely spend anything except rent/food. I'm not yet in a position where I can try to find a programming job unfortunately, I need a little more time to build my portfolio etc. I live close to a very small town with an asda, aldi, some small stores and pubs -- I can't think of a job here with not much social interaction.
