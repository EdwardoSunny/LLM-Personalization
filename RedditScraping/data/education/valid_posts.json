            "content": "For anyone needing a little motivation or people thinking they're in the same boat as I am, this is my experience.\nI've been a full-time student, since May 2018, taking anywhere from 4-6 classes per semester trying to finish my BS in IT Management. I work full time in my career field as a System Administrator and have 2 kids, both under 3 years old. It might sound like a lot (and it is), but the best way to get through it is Time Management.\n\nThis is exactly how my week goes:\nMonday - Friday I wake up at 5:15 am to get ready for work, I leave by 6:00am and commute 1 1/2 hours to work to get there at 7:30am, I work until 4:30pm, commute back home 1 1/2ish hours to get home at 6-6:30pm. I cook/feed my kids dinner (while my wife works) and then feed myself. Between 7-7:30pm, I start studying and doing my homework (depending how much homework I have, I try to complete 2-3 assignments a day). I try to finish my homework by 11:00pm the latest then take a shower and go to sleep by 12:00am. Then I do it again at 5:15am.\nOn Saturday I wake up early and use half the day to finish any homework I have left then the second half of the day and all of Sunday, I spend with my family. Now it doesn't always work that way, but 80% of the time it does. I've maintained a 3.80GPA so far and should graduate by the end of this year.\n\nI don't think it's hard, but when I tell people my situation, they are surprised that I haven't gone crazy yet haha.\n\nBenefits I have:\n- Most of the assignments I have is something I've seen before since I have prior experience, so it's not too hard for me other than the programming classes.\n- My wife supports me when I need no distractions with my kids.\n- Online classes gives a lot of flexibility with my schedule.\n- I think being prior military by dealing with worse situations, helps me get through it relatively easy.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- I don't like school pretty much at all and I can't wait to finish, but I know it will make me more marketable, make me more money, and it will be a good accomplishment.\n- I only have a day and a half to myself out of the week at most.\n- I don't watch TV at all, but I really want to catch up on all my TV shows eventually :/",

            "content": "I hope this is the right place for this, if there's anywhere better to post, just let me know. \n\n\n\nSo, I've had a complicated life so far, and it would take forever to really sum it all up, but basically I've been on my own, homeless since I was 15. Took awhile but I got that fixed, and now I'm ready to actually start moving forward. \n\nBut I have no clue where to start down my path, I've decided I'm going to med school, one way or another, but I don't have the slightest idea how to start. I got my high school diploma, I work in the OR as a surgical processing tech, I'm an emt and a firefighter, but I decided this is what I want to do. First it was going to be a paramedic, then instead I was going to go for nursing to be a higher level care provider, but I've since decided that I would rather go even higher. I'm dead set on it, eventually I'll make my way through med school and become a doctor, preferably specializing in emergency medicine. \n\nWhere do I start? \n\n\nI tried community College once but I had no clue what to do, I couldn't fill out my fafsa because I haven't had contact with my parents since I was 15, and apparently the stupidest thing in existence is the requirement of parents tax information, I tried everything to get around it but no dice. Now that I'm 24, I can finally fill out the fafsa on my own.... But really I don't know where to start.\n\nI have no idea what to do, or how to apply for college, or just anything really. I didn't go to high school, although I did get my diploma, long story, went to a charter school and finished all my classes in two months, Yea it's a fully accredited, legitimate high school diploma, but I missed all the valuable experience in high school that everyone else got, I'm honestly going in blind.\n\nCan somebody just, I don't know, help point me in the right direction? Where do I even begin? Do I just call up a colleges admissions department and start asking questions? I can't afford college, so loans and, maybe scholarships? I know literally nothing about scholarships. I'm going to be a full time student, so I'm probably just going to either work part time, or just stop working entirely to focus on school and live off loans, but I don't even know how feasible that it, or how to do it.\n\n\nI'm just lost, and any help, or direction would be appreciated, just knowing where to even start might be enough. I've spent so much time on Google looking for answers on how to start, but it's kind of overwhelming, everything I read has this assumption that you already know what needs to be done, or who to talk to, and the truth is I honestly don't even know what is really involved with college at all. Any help, or direction, or encouragement is appreciated. ",

There's not really anything I can do assist her financially, but I thought that information on alternative funding sources might be useful.\n\nI've been out of school for quite a while, so I'm not familiar with seeking out/applying for financial aid, but I would think that her status as a low-income female studying public health would qualify her for some form of grant/scholarship.\n\nAny ideas?

She never goes to class and doesn\u2019t have a car or job so she is in the room 24/7 almost. She is not paying the school any money because FAFSA denied her since she failed last semester and is failing this one. It makes me so upset she is here. I am a nursing student and I work up to 35 hours a week as a nurse\u2019s assistant. I have lots of late nights and early mornings and sometimes I do not sleep for over 24 hours because I work two part time jobs. My sleep is so important to me. She is constantly going in and out of the room from 10pm - 4 am. She has had multiple boys over in the room without warning me and I feel very uncomfortable because they come in at 2 am when I\u2019m asleep and I get woken up by them. I often sleep in a nightshirt and I can\u2019t even get up to go to the bathroom because I don\u2019t want the guy to see my in my nightshirt, maybe I am just bashful I don\u2019t know. She sleeps with the TV very loud on after I asked her to turn it down and I physically went over and turned it down because she\u2019s not even watching it I thought she was asleep. She often leaves the door unlocked and does not take her keys and asks me to leave it unlocked. A few nights ago, in the middle of the night, a girl came into the room without knocking because my roommate had asked me to leave it unlocked and she was gone for over two hours. Her friend rummaged around looking for food. I cannot sleep here. I\u2019m sorry if this post is a mess but I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel as if she is not going to change and it\u2019s not fair I\u2019m paying to live here and I feel awkward and honestly a bit unsafe. I feel trapped and I want to start sleeping in my car. ",

So....these waters I\u2019m traveling, I\u2019m traveling them alone without a buoy or floaters.\n\nI\u2019m having the worst case of depression I\u2019ve had in a long while. My brother passed away of an overdose when he was 19, and I was 17. Causing me to fail school by half a credit. Finally went back and got my GED last year and immediately applied to college. As that\u2019s always been a dream of mine. Did great my first semester and got a 3.8 GPA.\n\nAnyway, my estranged father passed away this year in January. I hadn\u2019t spoken to him since I was 2, but regardless of that I think it\u2019s triggered a bad depressive episode. I\u2019ve struggled with depression for years and have been going to therapy. But recently my state funded medical insurance got cut because I was working two jobs and \u201cmaking too much,\u201d for me to still receive benefits. I was also taking anti-depressants but I feel those aren\u2019t helping either. I just have no motivation, I constantly think about suicide. \n\nSo, I spoke to my academic advisor and I managed to work something out with my professors but I\u2019m still worried as we still have a couple months of this semester left. If I don\u2019t pass with a 2.0 my financial aide gets cut, I don\u2019t even want to deal with that.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m asking is, what motivates y\u2019all? What keeps you going even when things get really bad? What are some healthy habits I can curate for a better life? I really need to get out of this rut. Thank you all so much in advance. ",

I really dont care about the research or theory section of psych I only really like the clinical and abnormal psych section and the diagnosing, im very interested in drug addiction and brain injury, eating disorders, OCD etc.\n\nI gave my life to uni in first year and I am continuing to do so in 2nd year I study 6-8 hours a day on top of classes in uni term and holidays or exam period its about 11-15 hours a day, i skip lunch most days and get 6 hours sleep and I barely socialise, I was also suicidal on and off last year because of uni.

Anyway here's a little bit of backstory:  \n\nI'm 15 years old, I live in Utah,  and I'm in  my last semester of 9th grade, if I continue getting all A's I'll end this semester with a 4.0 and have a cumulative GPA of 3.05 for my freshman year.  I've always have been a relative 4.0 student and I plan to try and continue that in my last few years before graduation.  I'm currently taking and plan on taking multiple AP classes and I'm passing them with relatively flying colors.  I'm quite talented and absolutely adore art and wish to pursue it; now onto my question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo seeing I want to pursue an art career, preferably in storyboarding, animation, or mixed media, I've decided to get an associates degree in art before I decide to get a BFA in digital art and animation.  That way I'm able to get a taste of studying art and have just that slight higher chance of getting into an art school so I can pursue that BFA.  Anyway I've been researching and came up with an AA in Art and Weber State University and I'm honestly slightly confused.  I don't know if it's because it's worded/formatted weird or what.  Anyway, I'm confused on the requirements to graduate with this degree.  Just for example there doesn't seem to be any admission requirements but the way the degree requirements are formatted, it reads really weird for me.  I could just be stupid and I'm reading it wrong but I'm still slightly confused and it would really help if someone sort of explained them to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I'm young to be worrying about this stuff but time flies and I'd honestly rather be prepared than not, especially when I'm hit in the face with all the costs.  Also I know this is something probably really stupid to be confused on, and it could hundred percent just be from me reading it wrong and not understanding.   I'm hoping someone can help me understand exactly what the degree requirements are.

And the other school is OIT which is a school in the state that I live in and tuition is ~$8k a year. \n\nMy dilemma/options are these\n\n1) do I attended my dream college and continue to look for scholarships during my time but risk $200k debts\n\n2) go to Hawaii\n\n3) Stay in state\n\n4) attend UW and search for scholarships, but if I can\u2019t find substantial money, transfer back instate or to Hawaii\n\n5) other options\n\nI\u2019ll be going to college for Medical/Clinical Lab Science with the hopes of getting into a Forensics career. I\u2019d also love to live out of state for a few years. \n\nNote: if there\u2019s any confusing information or if you need clarification for anything, feel free to let me know. I know the solution seems like an easy one, but as someone who is very connected to UW, I am having a hard mental battle. ",

Its been a field I\u2019ve always wanted to pursue since I was 5, but to get a job in the field, you must either have a lot of internships, or a master\u2019s degree.\n\nSince the fall, all the stuff we\u2019re learning is extremely interesting and I love combining the calculus and physics to get the answers to stuff I\u2019ve been reading about for nearly 2 decades. But while I like learning it, I can\u2019t study it correctly. I constantly have the lowest grades in my class of 24 (there\u2019s only 42 total undergrads in the dept) and they all ask questions about detailed stuff, while I don\u2019t know what/how to ask the questions I have. Im still passing, but everyone else does research, interships, honors college, etc while Im struggling with just classes getting C's and B's.\n\nAlso, I transferred as a Junior, so I only had 1 summer/year to apply for internships, and I didn\u2019t get any. I don\u2019t know any of the professors well enough to ask for letters, and my GPA is probably the lowest of all the applicants they got. I also definitely don\u2019t have the grades or brains (or time) to go to grad school.\n\n**So, my question: How do/did you convince yourself dropping out/staying is the right choice when its obvious it wont work out.** I commute to school, still live with my parents, and been paying for school out of pocket after working overnight grocery for 7 years until last August (quit to focus on school). I've gained 20lbs since then, lost health insurance, and just less happiness from no income (wasn't happy beforehand either). My brothers say to drop out and work in the kitchen they work ($32k/year dishwasher), my parents say to stay in school because \u201cI've got to believe in myself\u201d (although I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re saying this to keep me at home).\n\nI know I probably won\u2019t be getting a job in this field, but I still love learning it and hearing about the jobs in the field gives me that slight hope/optimism; being in school is keeping me from getting an income, but there\u2019s that tiny chance it could slightly improve my income. All I want right now is to move out on my own, and focus on my own health/life, instead of the school/work/sleep for the last 8 years. I don\u2019t even know/talk to anyone outside my 2 siblings and parents the last 8 years. I have no problem getting 2-3 jobs at a warehouse + cashier + pizza delivery or something basic, but I\u2019ve regretted most everything in my life, and I\u2019m trying to think if this would just be the final straw in that regard. If I complete my final year (If I pass those classes), Ill lose a full year of income and a year to socialize/make friends. I\u2019m already a decade behind everyone my age in life, I'm not getting any happier and I can\u2019t afford to lose any more time in life.\n\ntl;dr : Im finishing Junior year and I know I will probably never land a job in the field but still love attending class and learning the material, how do I convince myself I wont regret either dropping out with a year left, or possibly wasting a year of my life?",

            "content": "I am transferring to Eastern New Mexico University online this fall/summer. I graduate with my A.S. in May from TN with no debt. I will have 24 classes (~72 credit hours) left to take at ENMU. \n\nI currently have ~$4600 total in savings. I will also be getting $1000 for four semesters starting this fall (it will be fall and spring only). I also plan to work full time or at least close to it if manageable. \n\nFor fall and spring semesters, ENMU has a block tuition system where you can take 12-18 credit hours and it\u2019ll be the same price (~4100, which is fees and tuition, not books). So whether I take 4 classes or 6, it\u2019ll be the same price (except books which will vary slightly of course). \n\nBut for any given semester, if you take less than 12 credit hours, you\u2019re charged by the hour. The rate for this is ~$355 per credit hour which includes tuition and misc fees, again except books. So if I took 6 hours in the summer, it would be ~$2300 for this summer semester if i round up a bit for books. \n\nMy two options are (which do not include the above mentioned scholarship or any federal financial aid which I hope to get at least some of. I have no clue how much to expect though: \n\n(1) 18 credits /6 classes each spring and fall semester for a rough total of $16,400\n\nor \n\n(2) 15 credits / 5 classes each spring and fall and 6 credits / 2 classes for two summers for a rough total of $21,000. \n\nFinancially, option (1) is obviously the way to go, but I am worried that taking 18 credit hours will be a lot. I know it\u2019s possible but GPA is very important in my field (Communicative Disorders/Speech Language Pathology). \n\nIt makes financial sense to do (1) because it\u2019s almost $5000 cheaper even though I\u2019m taking the same amount of classes. \n\nIf anyone has any advice with online school or help with any of this please give it to me. \n\nIf it\u2019s relevant I am also married but did not put that on my FAFSA because I got married just recently, so it was after I submitted it. And it asked for my marital status the date I filed the FAFSA. I also will be living with my husband at Camp Pendleton in CA, so rent/utilities isn\u2019t a huge issues financially. \n\nThank you in advance.

I'm not failing or anything, cause I made a B on exam 1 and a high C on exam 2, but I'm an A student and I think she knows I can do a lot better.\n\nThe thing is, I know the reason I'm not doing as well is because I'm not studying enough. I've resorted to studying  last minute because this semester has been stressful.\n\nI'm taking calculus, biochem, and organic 2 + lab together along with working to publish my chemistry research paper so it's a work-heavy combo to begin with. But on top of that, my entire organic class (literally *everyone* except one person) has been failing so everyone's been prioritizing that class above our others. \n\nIn calculus I have an A, but my professor for that class is also quite rude. During our first exam, in front of everyone, he announced to me that I needed to go back to elementary school. His behavior and his remarks have increased my anxiety.\n\nI bring up the anxiety because I do have pre-existing anxiety issues from an abusive childhood, which I also don't like to talk about because I feel like a lot of people like to claim they have anxiety to avoid taking responsibility and I don't want to be seen that way. So I try to quietly deal with it, but it has been debilitating at times.\n\nOn top of that, I also have to work full time and I can't cut my hours so that takes out a lot of studying time.\n\nOn top of *that* my husband is going through immigration processes and there is a very likely chance he could be deported due to mishandling by our previous lawyer.\n\nSooo....it's just been extremely difficult. I've seen the results physically because I've suddenly acquired adult acne that I didn't have, and my hair has been falling out in clumps in the shower.\n\nAnd I feel like whenever you look up information on mental health, doctors and writers always emphasize how extreme stress could impact other areas of your life. But I feel like when you explain these things to a supervisor or a professor, they just interpret it as being whiny and making excuses.\n\nThe professor whose class everyone is failing had a student drop last semester because his son got extremely sick and he had to miss lecture to care for him. Then HE got sick, then had to miss more classes because his brother got into a severe accident that put him in the ICU where he almost died. And you know what that professor said? \"I think he's using his age and his situation to make excuses for why he's not performing well\"\n\nSo...I mean...if \"my sibling almost died, my kid got hospitalized, and I got sick too\" is seen as just an excuse to this professor, I don't see how \"My life is just really busy and my stress levels are through the roof\" is going to be acceptable to another professor.",

Please keep the TV to a minimum/off after 10pm\n2. Asking before having guests over\n3. No male guests from 12-5am \n4. Always bring keys and locking the door \n\nShe made an excuse for every single one of these rules. She said she only has the TV on so loud to drown out my snoring, which I do not snore, and even implied I might have a sleeping condition. I have a boyfriend who I regularly visit and spend the night with and he says I do not snore and he can\u2019t even hear anything sleeping right next to me. She said she does not need to ask before having guests over, period. She said she goes over to her FWB\u2019s most of the time anyway so that rule doesn\u2019t matter. She claimed she doesn\u2019t bring the keys only when she\u2019s leaving for a \u201cminute\u201d. This is giant lie! She is gone for 2-3 hours during the night and DOES NOT lock the door hence the girl coming to the room in the middle of the night without knocking and barging in. I talked to my RA and she said we will have to fill out a roommate agreement which she does not want to follow the rules. My RA said if things do not change, she will make arrangements. I have a month and a couple weeks maybe of the semester left I\u2019m not sure if this fight is worth it. The biggest thing that bothers me is SHE ISN\u2019T PAYING TO GO HERE. FAFSA has denied her (since she has  failed so many semesters and this one) and the school has yet to give her an ultimatum. So technically she\u2019s living in MY room for free!

            "content": "I posted this in r/findapath as well...I'm 24 (female), and finishing my last year of college (I took time off to work and finish my local CC and got scholarships to finish the rest free at a good state school here in NY.)\n\nI also got my license for cosmetology in the last few years completed (hair, makeup, etc.)\n\nI have 75 credits and have anywhere from 2-4 semesters left depending on what I choose to pursue, which has to be chosen by this Saturday (2 days from this post.) Of course I could take longer but being that I took an extra few years, I'm kind of seeing this as my final chance to finish school or at least my BA.\n\nI know that school is not always connected to the path we choose in life even in terms of career, and for me it probably is not. But I did want to post just to see what input I may get back, any and all is very much appreciated!\n\nAlong with being accepted and given scholarships to attend for free...I also am being refunded a certain amount of money per semester to use for books, transportation, etc...So I definitely want to take advantage of this and do an extra semester for a minor as it could only help me at this point in terms of knowledge and finances.\n\nI wanted to quickly talk about some of my passions; some are very general and others very specific but all about equal.\n\nI loved music and learning music theory on piano and guitar my whole life growing up, but haven't played for years and would probably not get into the music program at this school even so (though I considered minoring in it to just further my education and get back on track with learning music again.)\n\nI loved learning French in elementary, middle, and high school. I was proficient enough to write essays and hold conversations but definitely had a lot more to learn. I haven't practiced in several years, but really want to minor in this in college for the same reason as before- I just enjoy it, I could become more proficient which may be useful for a resume or future job (probably not but you never know), and really just for my enjoyment.\n\nI loved Theatre/Music tech/design. I was doing this at my original college and really was drawn to it. I always have been fascinated with behind the scenes type work for music videos/live performances, plays, movies, shows, etc. I saw it as a way to stay in touch with music and the arts without actually needing to perfect any 1 art or music theory. I was able to work around it and within it and be comfortable basically. I did well with it, but the job outlook on this would be tricky I've found out. >I also thought about combining makeup/hair here, as I am oddly great at hair dressing though I have no passion for it. But doing hair or makeup for plays/movies/tvs/commercials, etc. seemed fascinating to me, in terms of being part of the contribution of making it happen.<\n\nI loved stop motion animation as well. This, I know I cannot find a career with, but still loved it very much. I saw Jan Svankmajer and The Brothers Quay and on a philosophical and artistic level just connected immediately. I always wanted to make sets, large or miniature, or be involved in design, from finding them onwards.\n\nPhilosophy has always been a broad area of interest for me. I'm not sure it would lead to any one thing for me post-grad if I choose it, but ever since middle school on, I fell in love with Nietzsche and Camus, and a plethora of other common philosophers. I love reading and writing, and anything that requires critical thinking/analysis. So I'm imagining this could branch out to other applicable areas.\n\nI'm slightly interested in psychology, and only about 1 semester away from that degree completion, but I have absolutely no passion for any career connected to it. I am very interested in the subject, but having worked and interned in several places for this area of interest, it just isn't for me.\n\nI am thrilled by quantum physics and astronomy also, which the school offers. But I always excelled in English/History/Arts, and not so much Science/Maths. I just cannot see myself exceeding in this in a college unfortunately. I don't think I would grasp Chemistry enough to pass, though Calc I have done well in, just not as well as the other subjects.\n\nI love European History and History in general as well. I took a few classes AP in high school, did great, and loved the subject matter. But I don't plan to go the Education route, so wouldn't be too sure what to do with it as a degree either.\n\nI obviously have said quite a lot. (Sorry if I bored you.) I am open to graduate school, but have no specific need for it as I don't want to go into education, business, or law, etc. I know that 1 major won't always have a clear career path and that now especially, many are open-ended and one can benefit simply from having the degree completed.\n\nIf it helps you get a sense of my personality, I know I am INTJ, as the type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading, and please share your experiences too!\n\nEDIT: Not sure if it is relevant, but I also loved being a body piercer and (outside of finishing my degree) would definitely try to work even part time on the side in that again one day. That being said, I also am covered in tattoos (arms and legs mainly, all the rest I can hide and do hide), which definitely can deter me from jobs (really just 1 on my chest and small ones on each hand that are seen normally). I'm sure there are some careers that I would struggle to enter because of how I look, so I just wanted to be honest about that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; In general I just have a passion for knowledge itself, critical thinking, and art, all in all.\n\nIn terms of college that include music, french, history, psychology, philosophy, astronomy, art history, theatre tech,etc.\n\nAny suggestion or advice really would mean so much to me this week as I'm trying to decide.",

            "content": "I posted this to r/advice aswell, but I am also posting it here because I am really in need of help.\n\nI guess I should start this by saying I've always been pretty indecisive. I've never really known who I was. Up until a year ago, I spent most of my days on my computer playing New Vegas or Skyrim instead of going out and having any experiences that would shape me as a person. But the time came that I had to go off to college. It was really a win win for me, I wanted a fresh start for my social life, and my parents wanted me out of the house (not because of any negative reason). But I didn't really know what I wanted to do. I must've picked at least 5 different majors when touring schools, ranging from bio chem to English. Eventually I decided to just settle upon history, since that was the one thing I was consistently good at in high school, and had more than a passing interest in.\n\nOver the past year, since I've left for college, I've changed so much as a person. I'm almost completely independent, I have friends, a job, I've picked up playing an instrument, and I've even been close to getting a gf. I even spent a month studying in another country. And on top of all of that, I've also been trying to get into the education program at my school. Which means if everything goes to plan, I'll have my education certificate after I get my master, meaning I'll be able to become a teacher.\n\nWith all that in mind, I should be happy. But, alas, I'm not. It's not like I don't enjoy history or anything. My professors are great, and I have pretty good grades. I just don't feel like I'm gaining anything while doing it, there's no enjoyment. It's hard to explain, it's not like I expected to be happy while cramming an essay the day before it's due, but it just doesn't feel fulfilling. I don't get the sense of \"yeah, this is what I want to do with the rest of my life!\". The workload also doesn't help. I absolutely love having a week to read an entire book and write a minimum 5 page essay on it /s. Honestly classes I get the greatest sense of fulfillment out of are my education classes. But you cant really teach without a subject.\n\nSo that brings us to today, and the whole entire point of this post. After much deliberation I've come to terms with ths fact that the profression I actually want to pursue is one in film. Specifically, I want to be an editor (atleast professionally, I'd still like to direct personal projects). When I was young (before the mind numbing depression took over my brain and I confined myself to a bed and screen all day) filmmaking was a pretty big hobby of mine. I was inspired by youtubers at the time, who were able to make some pretty great stuff without much in the way of a budget. Even nowadays I still like to spend some of my very, very sparse freetime editing meme videos (some of which actually got pretty popular). And all I watch anymore besides movies are videos about movies. I swear to God 90% of my YouTube history is RLM, video essays about filmmaking, or short films (the other 10% are memes). Even in class, when we're watching films, I find myself trying to pick up on the filmmaking techniques used over what is actually being talked about in the movie. I realize I sound very pretentious, but I just want to drive the point home that I know this is something I want to do.\n\nHowever filmmaking does have some obvious caveats and drawbacks when compared to being a teacher. The most obvious one I can think of is Job availability. It's no secret film is a much, much harder industry to get into over teaching. And honestly, being homeless doesn't sound very fulfilling, so I'd actually like to have a job. There's also the fact that I'd have to give everything up that I have now to go to a film school (which is what I would do since I already have credits so why not). My friends, and even my job, since I work for the school. And the college I go to right now is pretty great, and has really nice accommodations. But then I think about my life I pursue and succeed in film, and I'm am so much more infinitely happier. If my school offered film programs, I would take it in a heartbeat. I'm just not ready to give up everything, but my major is dragging me down. And that's not even mentioning the scholarships and government aid I received which I may lose if I transfer schools.\n\nSo I bring this to you guys. What the absolute fuck do I do? I'm so rucking desperate for some advice right now.\n\n(Sorry if any of this is kinda incoherent, I'm writing this pretty late at night and I'm tired af)\n",

Would do extra experiments outside of class (both in the school lab with my professor and on my own at home).  Culminated in a summer research internship and a program with NASA.  All good things.\n\nFast forward to today.  I\u2019ve been getting less and less motivated to do classwork.  My brain just feels like it\u2019s in rebellion.  I\u2019ve been taking math classes one after the other since I started school.  Trig, then pre-cal, then Cal. I, now Cal. II.  Then my science classes - Gen Chem II was killer, then O Chem (interesting, but a LOT of studying), now Physics (more math.  Yay.  -_- I hate physics if you can\u2019t tell.)  It\u2019s just been so much memorization and learning lots of information pretty quickly.  My brain is tired.  I started taking violin lessons just to have something for myself and artistic expression.  It literally feels like my brain is saying, \u201cStop!  No more!  I\u2019m too full!\u201d\n\nOn top of all this, I have to work to support myself.  Trying to make enough money to pay rent while still having time for school is a stress in and of itself.  Money has just been a big stress since last year.  I\u2019m sure that\u2019s probably taken a toll on me.  Right now I\u2019m working two jobs.  One is at a biology lab, and the other is in the chemistry department at my school as an assistant to the lab manager.  The first one I already had.  The second was offered to me by my school because their assistant lab manager was on indefinite medical leave, and I was the only student they had confidence in to help in that capacity.  (The lab manager said I came \u201chighly recommended.\u201d).  It was very much an honor, and I love the lab, so I jumped at the chance.\n\nSuffice it to say, I\u2019ve had a lot of accomplishments over the last couple of years.  I\u2019ve worked really hard, and when I think about all these things I\u2019m really proud of myself.  In my head I don\u2019t really want to give up.  I have really big dreams for myself and know I have what it takes.  But I\u2019m still in a human body, and I feel depleted.  Sometimes I just want to quit.  \n\nI think emotionally it\u2019s been hard as well because all my busyness and being on a student budget all the time has caused me to not be able to spend a lot of time with people outside of school or work.  I love my co-workers, but I need to see other friends for my own well-being.  I\u2019m the kind of person who craves a lot of social interaction, and labs tend to attract people who like to be alone.  I\u2019ve drawn all of them out at this point, and we all are friends at work now, but it\u2019s not nearly the kind of social atmosphere you\u2019d get at working at Starbucks.  (That\u2019s where I worked before - paid less, but I was constantly talking and interacting with people, so I was able to fill that social \u201cbucket\u201d a lot better.)\n\nThe icing on the cake is that the same professor who inspired me to get into my subject who I absolutely adored and had a special relationship with - he asked me out after I was no longer in his class (remember I\u2019m a little older, so there\u2019s no creepy teacher situation here).  That\u2019s fine, except for I decided I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that, and after a few events, I stopped talking to him for like a whole semester.  Now he is my direct supervisor in the chem department, so it\u2019s been a tad awkward.  I\u2019d really like things to go back to how they used to be, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible.  It makes me sad because that whole department used to feel like my little oasis in this desert that can be school and life.  I wish I could have that back.  (I used to study in that suite but haven\u2019t been since the previously mentioned events happened.)\n\nAll this to say, I feel pretty overwhelmed this week and am having a hard time pressing on.  I try to find ways to take breaks and take care of my body, but the other things are eating at me.  So....thanks internet for letting me send this \u201cmessage in a bottle\u201d lol.  \n\nGood luck to everyone in their classes right now.  <3\n\n",

Skipped classes, didn\u2019t do well in school in general, found out I had ADD when I was 18 (wish I would of caught that sooner \ud83d\ude44) so my high school career isn\u2019t the best looking thing on paper. I graduated! But that\u2019s about all I have to show for it lol.\n\nI\u2019ve always been the \u201ccollege isn\u2019t right. It\u2019s a scam.\u201d But my Facebook friends that went to school seem to be doing okay for themselves while I\u2019m here struggling. Dead end job to dead end job isn\u2019t getting me anywhere. \n\nSo I\u2019ve decided to take a leap of faith and look into my local hometown college. I have an appointment set up Friday to talk to an admissions counselor for adults looking to return to school.\n\nThe thing that has held me back all these years is the money. Spending (borrowing) all this money scares the pants off of me. So I want to make sure I\u2019m not spending too much. If any other education majors out there can tell me if i found a decently priced program, I\u2019d be happy :)\n\nNow... I do live about 45mins from the college. I just recently moved before deciding to look into this. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to manage a part time job, but with all the driving, going to school full time, I definitely won\u2019t have a full time job. So I do also need some money for my living expenses.\n\nAll my bills are about $950 a month. I honestly figure I can live comfortably on $1500 a month so I\u2019m hoping maybe I can make half that at my part time job? \n\nSo that\u2019s $9,000 right there.\nLuckily my tuition isn\u2019t too bad. \nWith books, new student fees, and parking, my actual school fees would be $8,315 a year. \n\n\nGuys, I haven\u2019t been to school in like 7 years now. I don\u2019t remember a single thing about college so I have no idea if I\u2019m doing this right, thinking about this the right way or anything. Any help is greatly appreciated! \n\nTl:dr- is $8,315 per year too much for a BS in Education (elementary)? And $17,315 to include living expenses?",

I don't want to stop at an associates and plan on continuing my education and going after my bachelors degree in sciences of IT. \n\nI am 1 year away from being done with my first degree and have begun the process of figuring out the next steps. Right now I am considered a \"dependent\" and since my mother and fathers income is completely based off disability I qualify for financial aid and certain other help with school. Currently, I pay nothing for school and the only things I am required to pay back are the student loans that I take out to help ease the stress of rent and other small financial needs that may occur through each semester.\n\nMy concern once I transfer to a university is not only the skyrocket in price, but also the cost of everything else included. I plan on living off-campus in either a shared location or finding a roomate online, which will really help out with the cost of living. I also plan on getting a serving job, which I currently do now and live semi-comfortably so that will cover extra curricular / any other expenses that will be thrown at me. However I do have concerns when it comes to covering the full cost of tuition through out the school year. \n\nI've read that students are able to take out loans and repay them through the semester, this would be okay if my finances were stable enough to support bills/food/anything else and I had money left over. I've also looked into Parent PLUS loans but unfortunately as previously stated my parents definitely would not be qualified for that sort of thing..\n\nSo my question is, are there programs where I am able to take out loans to cover the full cost of my schooling? My credit is not exactly what I would refer to as amicable and I don't think I would qualify for anything that requires a credit check. However this is an investment in my future and I am willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that this is something I am able to see through. Obviously I will be applying for as many scholarships and grants that I possibly can as well once I finally pick a college that is best suited for my needs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it helps, I will be 24 in august and by time I finally get into a University I will be 25. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks so much for reading through this!",

            "title": "My Experience as a Music Major",
            "content": "Hello! I thought it would be interesting to share my experience as a music major for anyone interested. I apologize in advance, this post may be lengthy. \n\nCurrently, I am in my senior year of undergrad at a small four-year university. \nI attended a low-income, high-poverty high school with a limited budget for the arts. Despite my small, struggling school, I had a great experience (or so I thought) with the band program. I started clarinet in 5th grade. I enjoyed making music with my friends so much I decided to pursue a degree in it - Instrumental Music Education. What I discovered was how big of a challenge majoring in music would be coming from a smaller school with limited opportunities. I had no music theory or vocal experience. My clarinet skills were extremely lacking. I was unaware of the need for a private instructor, and my band director was primarily a brass player, which didn\u2019t help my case. I never made all-state. I never even made all-region. This later became problematic in college.\n\nMy transition was rough. I didn\u2019t live on campus, so I missed out on a lot of the ice breaker events where everyone met each other. By the first week, everyone seemed to have friends, and I didn\u2019t.  I came to school for classes and practice. My social life took a hit when I started college. I spent a lot of time sitting in my car during breaks between classes and crying. In some way, I didn\u2019t feel deserving of the friendships of my peers due to their advanced musicianship, so I pushed them away and didn\u2019t bother. I was embarrassed by how far behind I was. I had developed this silly mindset that I was there to get my degree and leave. The only thing that did was make me miserable. I was anxious about every social interaction in that building. It took me the first two years to feel comfortable around my peers and to open up and make friends in the music building. My advice to anyone entering college: Go to social events. Make friends. Talk to your peers. Chances are, they may be experiencing similar things. \n\nYour first couple of years, you take four semesters of Music Theory, Sight-Singing/Ear Training, and Class Piano. These classes are essential to developing good fundamental music skills. A professor once told me their purpose was to weed out the weaklings. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s entirely true, but I can tell you my first semester of Music Theory had around 30 people, and my fourth semester had 8. You also take private lessons from your primary instrument\u2019s professor, in addition to other music classes over the course of four years. \n\nAll music majors are required to take a fun little class called Recital Attendance every semester of their undergrad. It is a 0-credit, Pass or Fail class. In this class, the 1:00 hour every Friday is devoted to putting on a student recital. 5-10 students perform for the department faculty, staff, and student body. Every music student must perform a piece some point during the semester. In addition, there are these things called \u201crecital credits\u201d that must be fulfilled by the end of the semester. For every \u201ccredit\u201d you must attend a nighttime recital and bring a program back to turn into the music office. Our university requires us to complete 8 of these during a semester. That number may vary depending on the university. \n\nThe education classes on the other side of the degree are something else. The music educators are looked at as aliens in the education building. Much of the content we are required to learn is not applicable to the band or choir room. We took Intro to Education, Educational Psychology, Classroom Management, Diverse Populations, Practicums, and Internship. The field experience in the Practicums and Internship are the most valuable experiences the Education Dept. has to offer. With Practicum, you are placed with a mentor teacher in a public school and required to complete 40 hours of observations, teach a lesson observed by your professor, and various other assignments. In Internship, you are placed with a mentor teacher in a public school for the entirety of your final semester. You are observed by a professor 3 times. After completion of Internship, you may graduate. \n\nAs a music major, the schedule is rough. We have the second busiest schedule, right behind the nursing program. Every semester is jam-packed with events, concerts, practice time, education hours, and classes. The set degree plan for music education at my university consists of 130 hours total, around 15+ hours/semester plus some summer classes, in addition to extra hours for all the ensembles you are required to be in if you\u2019re on a scholarship. Most generally finish in 4 1/2 years.\n\nSomething that stands out from the past few years is the pros and cons of living off-campus. I still live with my parents, so I get free, home-cooked meals, which are nice. I get to help plan vacations and trips because I\u2019m home all the time. However, it\u2019s particularly frustrating to live off-campus due to all the nighttime events and concerts you are required to attend. You can\u2019t just hitch a ride with a friend like other students do. You either spend your entire day on campus and eat dinner after recitals at 10 pm, or drive home, eat dinner, and drive back and put more miles/gas money on your vehicle. In addition, it\u2019s particularly hard to find quiet time if you live with other people off-campus - not optimal for studying. Living off-campus is great for some people. But for music majors, it\u2019s an absolute nightmare. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, it\u2019s been a rough four years. However, through all the challenges, all the struggles, all the difficulties, at the end of the day, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. For every frustrating moment that has made me want to quit, there is an inspiring moment that makes me remember why I did this in the first place. Those moments mean everything to me. I experience them in performances. Practice sessions. Eating lunch with my fellow music majors. Getting to know our amazing faculty. They make this thing worthwhile. \n\nFor anyone wanting to major in music: take any and every opportunity you have to develop as a musician. You will thank yourself later. Get a private instructor that specializes in your instrument/voice. Try out for all-region/all-district. Aim to make all-state band. Work on chamber music. PRACTICE. The only way you can learn and grow is by practicing and developing the skills you need to practice well. \n\nBeing a music major is not for everyone. It will make you angry. It will make you cry. It will frustrate you to no end. But if you stick through it, it will be the most rewarding experience you could ever hope to have. \n\nCurrently, I am in my last semester of classes. I\u2019ve finished all my music and education courses, I just am completing the gen eds I need for my degree. I plan to do my student teaching next semester, and graduate in December. I love what I do! I\u2019ve worked hard in college, and I am proud of my accomplishments. It may be difficult sometimes, but it brings me a sense of pride and joy I don\u2019t experience anywhere else.",

I have interned, and worked at a couple of upscale restaurants as a line cook, as well as hosted a catering event for a cancer retreat.\n\nSo far I've been pursuing my associates in business at my comm college, and also have been studying Japanese on the side both in highschool and in college as my grandmother is Japanese but never taught us as kids.

(Which I don't feel as likely happening, but hey, burnout and becoming uninterested in the things you are once passionate in can happen). Because of this thought process, I've felt that pursuing a business degree will help me in the culinary world, more specifically, pursuing a business admin/management degree.\n\nSo far I've been looking into majoring with a business admin/management degree and possible minoring, or double majoring in Japanese.

What other degrees could benefit me in this field?\n4. What would be some colleges that would be a right fit for this type of thing.\n5. Did any of you have an experience similar to this, how has your degree helped you in the culinary field or any field related to food?",

            "content": "Hello,\n\nThis is a repost from r/financialaid.\n\nI am in dire need of advice. Some background: I am an extremely low-income, independent undergrad student. I am independent by dependency override due to abuse & abandonment. This means I get 0 help financially from my parents--I support myself in all facets. I spent my first 2 years of college at a community college & transferred this year, as a junior, to an ivy league institution across the coast.\n\nI technically get a full-ride, but this doesn't include any living expenses outside of dorm housing. So, I don't actually see any of the money I'm getting. I am currently working as many hours as possible.\n\nMy predicament: because of moving expenses and living expenses (I live in a VERY expensive city), I have maxed out my credit card at this point. Secondly, some of my financial aid is reported as income on my taxes, so now I owe about $800 in taxes. I tried taking out a student loan to help with this for the Spring semester, but found that I was ineligible because my \"budget\" for the academic year was maxed out, meaning no more aid. I was told that I could get aid if I go on a summer program, as my school doesn't provide grants for summer, but they do provide loans.\n\nSo, I signed up for a summer program that was very expensive, but I was able to get the entirety of the program costs covered by scholarships. My plan was to take out a loan to cover the expenses previously mentioned, as well as pay for my plane ticket back to school after summer. I also have to pay for storage of my dorm stuff over summer. Also medical expenses from a recent hospitalization. \n\nI felt secure in my plan until today. When I went to the financial aid office to confirm my loans, they told me that they won't disburse any summer student loans until July. That's far too late: I won't be able to get by the summer with the costs previously mentioned. I would cancel my summer program, but it wouldn't even help me as I have no way to pay for the things previously mentioned and will likely be unemployed over the summer as I doubt I will be able to find short term employment where I live. Staying in the city where my school is is not an option as I will be homeless.\n\nI applied for a private student loan and was approved, but when looking more into the \"certification\" process by my school I'm fairly certain it won't get certified because my cost of attendance is already maxed out by the aid they give me. Or, they won't disburse it until July. I don't know what to do and my financial aid office was incredibly unhelpful. I'm so scared, I really don't want to be homeless again, and I don't know how I'm going to get through the summer and get back to school for the Fall.\n\nI'm sorry if this is super confusing (this entire situation/process is for me) and frantic. This has completely sent me into crisis mode and I don't know what to do. Do I have any options? The only thing I can think of doing if my student loan gets denied is taking out another credit card and accruing more debt that way, but I'm honestly not sure that I'll be approved...I've been applying for scholarships but that's not reliable enough funding (as I do not know that I'll get them). Should I take out a private non-student loan? Can I even do that? I really don't have anyone/anything to fall back on and transferring to this school has left me destitute.\n\nAny help would be so appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: I'm afraid my private student loan will be denied because my COA is maxed out. What funding options, if any, do I have?",

In one day, my teacher doesn't believe I can manage the main function, welding. The dean is so happily here, maybe there's other classes you could go to, to at least get some of the certifications that this course offered. (Forklift, OSHA, etc)....oh...your uncle, who pushed you to do this...he's the one who got the ball rolling. He'd called the school, raised concerns, a bit of fear for my safety (sleep/burns/cuts). I had my own feelings of rising failure (Though I kept a \\[desperately\\] hopeful face), then not only teacher and dean, but my uncle in one swoop. Felt ganged up on big time, plus my own feelings and fears...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe teacher 'passes me forward' to a different weld position when I hadn't completed a single one...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo winter break.

(Tools, two welding hoods, I paid a bit in hope, experimentation because I liked (by this point?) welding became something I wanted to do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nActually, back from break my welding is beginning to less look like silly string and more like something worthwhile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI buy a welding helmet while spendy, let me see the puddle in a way I knew what I was doing. I wish I had jumped on that option a month before...(There's always reasons, stories...)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's snow days, osha, forklift...so we lose more weld time. The instructor only seemed to suggest ideas or 'help' (for me) when there was somewhere under 8 weeks left. (Sadly 3-4 months of the same unassisted welding previous was ok. Why is it an issue now?) Glasses, one eye shut, drawing on paper, a weight to help me manage a better travel speed. I guess he may have felt a rush, too late, to get a student graduated? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of these other classes and snow days enabled 3 + days where I didn't weld. When I came back, I was 'just' a little better able to weld. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSad the only people (customers, yet) who weren't close in any way, seemed a little supportive, I begin telling that I have a snowball's chance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week. I complete a test for the most basic, weld position (no results yet). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWalking away would just be the easiest...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe didn't get every credit paid for, the instructor dropped the ball (1st aid, fall, manlift) unscheduled. \n\nFrom the time I began improving, if I could have had a reset (or at least time and attention), maybe things would have ended differently. I should have stood for myself.  Shouldn't the teacher cared, the dean at least? Instead of how can we make this struggle an accomplishment, the only option given me was 'move on, quit'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel some anger that I was given one chance to talk to the Dean over that area of the school, and her not being very cooperative, then I gave up? Does being one of those who fall through the cracks mean...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know if or how to resume with the Dean, go over her head to the president. Either or, I don't have arguments (or not many). What I mostly have is emotion, feeling of not important, worth time. But, I can't imagine anything that I might say would change or alter anything, or get me the time (if that's what it takes) to actually learn what I could have been taught.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was a specialized course focusing on shipbuilding. 6 months. This was thankfully funded through food stamps/ebt. But I make just enough to not qualify for any other college assistance through that agency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt does mean something to me, but I'm struggling a lot and that is the big part of it.",

The professors in my program have won renowned awards like the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work, the  Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and etc. Many students have also want on and received the same awards. Needless to say, I am excited to be given the opportunity to learn from these professors. However, after specking with some of the current students in the major, I'm becoming nervous. One student said that the program is rigorous and I'll have to live reading and writing, but all and all it's a wonderful program with passionate professors. I don't have a problem with this as it was what I was expecting. However, another student commented and said that some of the upper level classes requires the student to send in copies of their work prior to being admitted into the class. Those that aren't good enough couldn't take the class and in some cases had to change their majors. This is what scares me. I have change my major a couple of times before I landed on English, so I would hate to change it again. I also have a little more credits then the average 60. The school is in-state therefore, I qualify for in-state tuition, but my state also have the excess credit hour law. The law states that if a student surpass, I believe, 132 credit hours then they are required to pay out-of-state fees regardless of residency. I already know that I'm going to pass this limited, but based on my calculations it will only be one semester. I'm very fortunate enough to be able to get through college without debt, so I have the money to handle one semester out-of-state just not anymore. It also doesn't help when the university requires every student to take a computer literacy course and for me to have a minor. \n\nBecause I do want to place my academics above everything else, I fear that I won't be able to make any friends. To be honest, I haven't really had a good friend that I hang out outside of the classroom since elementary school. Most of the time I end up making acquaintances. I do have some family that has attended the university and live in the town but they either graduated and moved or are about to graduate. I worry that I won't be able to make any friends and become lonely and depressed which has happened in the past. I don't know what my housing situation is yet, so I don't know if I'm living on or off campus. I don't enjoy parties or drinking in public (I prefer to do it in my own house). I know a lot of people say join clubs, but I don't know how well I will be able to manage that and my rigorous course load. If you have any tips or have done both feel free to share them. \n\nI don't know maybe I'm psyching myself out before I even get there.",

But socially is where I fall behind. I\u2019m an introvert and like to spend most of my time by myself and get mentally exhausted pretty quickly if I\u2019m hanging out with friends. The thing is, I have a shitload of free time, even tho I work and such, but I choose to do activities, both at home or out and about by myself. \n\nTherefore I don\u2019t have much friends to do something with on the rare times I would. I\u2019m not in any relationships and have tried to rely on tinder/bumble so much for it (I deleted them on the 3rd). Sometimes that makes me kinda sad and wish I put more time and effort into meeting people. \n\nLast year when I started college I joined my college\u2019s anime club. Made a lot of friends, had a great time that year and loved it. But the college itself was super expensive for out of state students, so I went back in state. Last semester I just went through it without putting in any effort of meeting people and just spent almost all time with myself and I\u2019d go to my job that was 2 hours away (20 minutes from my house). I drove all that distance because it paid nice and I enjoy being there. I\u2019m an assistant Teacher at a Montessori school with great kids and awesome coworkers, so I was lucky I made all my classes MWF so I could spend my Tuesdays and Thursdays there. \n\nThis semester however, all my classes are T Th, so I cancelled the housing and I just commute about 1:45 each way twice a week since I have MWF free to work. So socially, I\u2019m not doing myself any favors. I\u2019m doing great with grades and money, but I wish I was more social. And also last year I went to an SEC school so Greek life was huge. Except I was always one of those who just talked shit about frats without at least rushing to see if I like it. I wish I did, but at this point for me it\u2019s a bit too late. \u201cBut you\u2019re a junior, you still have time!\u201d \n\nI\u2019m actually going to study abroad in Strasbourg, France for the academic year September-May, and when I come back I\u2019ll only have one semester left. I\u2019m really committed to French and wanting to experience French and other cultures abroad, so I hope to step out of my comfort zone and put the extra effort into meeting people. It would be to improve both my language skills, and social skills in general. I plan to travel a lot while abroad and I know I\u2019ll be by myself most of the time when doing it, but I\u2019ll at least try to go to a nightclub or do some other people-oriented things. \n\n\nSo in short, i wish I had joined a frat, and I wish I\u2019d put more effort into meeting people in general instead of being a hermit and spending all my time by myself. Don\u2019t get me wrong, going to the movies, amusement parks, restaurants, etc alone is awesome. But then I miss out on things such as relationships and it sucks.\n\nOh well, if you got through this block of text, thanks for reading! Feel free to discuss.",

It wasn't until recently in my sophomore year that I fell in love with NY and made a group a friends instantly- something I haven't been able to do now. I haven't been happy living here after I  had to move back due to personal reasons.

So here\u2019s the deal...\nI am an artist. A very good one. It\u2019s not a brag, it\u2019s just a statement. I have ALWAYS wanted to go to college for a masters degree in animation or illustration. I\u2019ve always wanted to see my art take me somewhere.\n\nIt\u2019s my dream to just be a creator. I want to make digital art professionally.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. I live in the Midwest. There\u2019s no careers here for me. So I wanted to go to college out of state. Somewhere with a reputation! And I got accepted into an incredible art school. My dream school.\n\nBut this college is insanely expensive. $45,000 a year expensive. Even with the scholarships I\u2019ve got.\nI\u2019m beginning to dread my future. My parents want me to work two jobs, which I\u2019ve already been doing. I work 8-9 hours every single day with my primary job and sometimes I do overtime as well. With my second job that\u2019s on and off, that\u2019s an extra 3-4 hours during a day. I work so so much. I\u2019m exhausted! I\u2019m working so hard. My youth has passed me by. My summers are always spent working, working, working. Last year I don\u2019t think I got to go outside one bit.\n\nRecently this year I went through an incredibly detrimental and traumatic event. It has taken its toll on my mental health. I lost an entire (bad) friend group & had to start seeing a therapist because of this event in my life. I feel like I have no social life because all I do is work.\n\nI just am so afraid.

It got better as time went on and sometimes I enjoy it here a lot. But other times I get really upset with this school and wonder if I can last 4 years here.

We didn't pick our schools for each other but the coincidence that our schools are an affordable train ride away makes it easier to be here (However, our relationship is very strong and I think if I was farther away it would still work out for us)\n\nCons;\n\n1)  While the department is good, it is also not what I am looking for. I'm a film major and my school's department is a bit too contemporary and less narrative than I like\n2) While my school does have internship opportunities that are good for film, the school also lacks a lot because it is so rural\n3) School life can also be very isolating since its so rural\n4) I am very far from home, which I thought I wanted but sometimes I regret it\n5) The requirements to even major in what you want to do is a lot and you have essentially \"prove\" you want to be in your major by doing a lot of extra essays and projects \n\nI know this is a decision I will ultimately make myself, I wanted other people's feedback.",

I have pretty significant health issues that are well documented through my college's disability services and while I had been coping very well at the beginning of the semester, as I approach the last 3 weeks...I'm barely functioning.

Up until two weeks ago, I had an A in the course, had only missed one lecture (due to illness) and had never missed an assignment.

I really dont have anything other than a marketing/community outreach work study and lots of diverse volunteer experience on my resume. Many of my psych friends skipped the internships / bachelor level jobs and went right into masters and some then went right into PHD programs. I'd like to take an internship this summer for the \"expierince\" but worry its gonna pull down my grades with taking full time course load also over summer. I could live at my moms for free which would save me money, but I also already have plenty of student loans and car payments. I run an online poshmark reselling business which saved me tons on tuition and made dent in the car payment, it's far more lucrative than any summer job I could get. Should I try for an internship or just buckle down on classes and keep selling stuff? I make more money selling out of state then at home with mom, but moms house would save me money too. The lady in the interview seemed fake nice and not really impressed that I didn't have \"past work experience\" for an HR internship. I couldnt get jobs other than grocery stores and work study because I'm \"not qualified\".

            "content": "Hey everyone so some background info about me. I'm a 20yo Male and I graduated High School in 2017. Besides working in retail for a while I haven't been in school or worked anywhere else. I quit my job in retail about 8 months ago because of terrible management and unbearable boredom. \n\nMy parents and the rest of my family really want me to start school this year yet I can't for the life of me figure about what I want to take in College. I've looked at hundreds of options but very few interest me. Not to mention I took the easiest classes in High School and got average grades so I would need to start at Community College if I wanted to actually major in something. The one field that does interest me a little is Computer Science because I've been into computer programming on and off for the last 5 years. I know that doing that stuff for fun is way different than as a job so there's not way to know if I'll like it in College or as a career. Plus it's one of the hardest majors and it's also very math heavy and I've always struggled with even basic math. \n\nWould it be best to go back to working full time? I have a great resume and some decent work experience which means getting an entry level job shouldn't be to difficult. Working in a warehouse or in landscaping would probably be better than retail. I'm still really undecided because no matter what choice I make it will have big drawbacks and everyone I know is pressuring me to start school again. I'm lost and I need help!\n\ntl;dr - I just turned 20 and I'm both unemployed and out of school. My parents are pressuring me to go back to school but I'm having a lot of trouble choosing a major and even if I do I'm worried about the barriers that will stand in the way. Should I go back to working full time and ignore my families wishes or choose a path for school even if it doesn't interest me?",

            "content": "I'm on my 2nd year in Physics, and I sort of like it so far, but in every single class I've done the bare minimum to pass, and sometimes not even that. Skipped a lot of classes, failed tests (not actually caring that I failed them) and retaken entire courses. In almost three years of college, I've only actually advanced one and a half academic years in my major. Education is free\\* in here so it's only time I've wasted (not that time isn't valuable, but you get what I'm saying). On the other hand, I've always felt really drawn towards Philosophy and literature in general, and more than once I've seriously considered leaving Physics and start studying Philosophy from scratch in a different college, but I'm scared that it'll be the same thing as it is now: apathy and just not feeling like studying and preparing for tests. I started getting therapy/counseling and I've been told that I need to decide on one thing, be it continuing Physics or dropping it and starting Philosophy, and put my **entire** effort and mind to it, since there's no use in just half-doing either of them. I've also been told that no matter what I choose, I **must** work on building discipline, since I don't have a lot of it at the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMajor factor: And, as the title says, I'm from Venezuela. No need to get into political stuff, just keep in mind that things are continually getting worse in here (inflation of over 1.000.000%, insecurity, lack of food and medicine, power outages, etc.), and I've also considered just leaving the country and start a new life somewhere else, where I can actually have a higher quality of life, whereas starting Philosophy would mean *at least* five years more in this place (I'm currently 20 years old). But I'm having trouble deciding. What do you think would be the smartest choice:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A) Finish your Physics major (somehow). Suck it up three more years and then leave the country with a degree in your hands. Also, a Physics degree opens more doors than a Philosophy one. Be smart about your financial future.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**B) Start with Philosophy. There's no use in constantly wondering \"what if..\" when you can actually give it a try and see for yourself. You'll never graduate in Physics at this rate, your attitude shows that you clearly want to drop it.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**C) Leave the country. Get a basic job, build some discipline for two or three years and then see which major is best for you. Leaving a third world starving country is a no brainer, so pack up and leave first. Then you'll  see what to do.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**D) \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks! I'll appreciate any feedback you guys can give me. I'd love to see this situation from an outer perspective and maybe get some insight that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*  Public education is free in theory, paid by the state, but most good profs have already left the country in search of better quality of life, and colleges are given 1/10th of the budget they need to function properly. Labs and tech equipment are a joke. Work conditions are terrible, and strikes are very common. So, free but bad, and getting worse.",

            "content": "Hi everyone. It's been a really long semester, and I have around 2.5 weeks left until the end. I've gone through a really rough time. A relationship I was in was put to an end (which, while it destroyed me, it was extremely toxic and was literally making me sick). I've also spent an unhealthy amount of time studying; 8-10 hours of nothing but school work a day. The only extra free time I had went to my then-girlfriend. I stopped doing what I loved most, like playing video games and going out with friends. I even cut my hours down at work to just the weekends so that I could concentrate on school. And honestly, coming as a huge shock to me, I'm still failing. After putting in **so** many hours, spending so much time in my teacher's office, doing all I can to stay afloat... I'm still failing. I've become incredibly depressed the last few weeks.\n\nI've figured out exactly what the problem is, and I've known about it for a few years, since my senior year of high school. I'm suffering from *extreme* test anxiety. I know the material. I make perfect grades on all the homework and projects. But when it comes to the tests, I fail severely. \n\nI usually study a week, sometimes two weeks before I know I have to take the test. I study incredibly hard, and I feel pretty decent by the day before the test. And then I get the test and... I panic. I start to sweat, and then I think about anything and everything else that isn't the test. For example: I recently had a test a little over a week ago. I spent literally a whole entire week studying, spending 8-10 hours a day looking over work and past projects, and spending two days in my teacher's office asking questions. I felt okay by the day of the test. The test came, I got the test, and it was like I had never been to the class in my life. We had around 75 minutes to take the test; it took me 25 minutes just to calm myself down and start on the first question.\n\nI ended up making around a 60 on the test. I have a 62 average on both my exam grades. I emailed my teacher, and I need an 80 or higher on the final to pass the class with a C (the class is part of my major so I need a C average to move onto the next class).\n\nI guess my question is, for those of you who suffer from extreme anxiety, whether that be from every day life, or specifically from tests. How do you deal with it? I **really** want to pass this semester. I'm so close to finishing my degree, and I just want to be done with it. I have around two weeks to put everything I have into this. And I know I can, but I can't perform on the tests due to my extremely high anxiety. I've tried talking to people; my parents, my teacher, friends. They all think that I'm using test anxiety as an excuse for doing poorly. But honestly, I've suffered from it for around 5 years now, and it's getting to the point where it's starting to ruin my life. I just need some help, and no one will really listen to me.",

I'm a 16 year old  California community college student who skipped my junior and senior years of highschool because I thought I knew what I wanted to do. I entered as a computer science major and my grades have been fine, but with my new CS class i'm really starting to hate the subject and I'm growing a strong liking for Math. I really enjoy my linear algebra class, and my professor was nice enough to invite me to his abstract algebra seminar, which i also really enjoy. However, i absolutely despise my CS course, but I don't know if this will be temporary or permanent. My CS course is very early in the morning (7 AM) and my professor gives these weekly 5 point quizzes which drive me insane as they're always given at random times and are worth enough of your grade to warrant studying for, but the questions are very tricky. I want to drop my CS class and become a Math major, but I don't want a W to ruin my transcript as I feel it'll kill my chances at some of my dream schools and im worried i'll never be able to find a job that pays well enough as a math major, because the major would be too broad. In my dreams, I'd be able to get a PhD in math and do research, but I don't think anyone's willing to pay a guy to prove there are infinite twin primes for example. I can't go back to high school either, as I've technically graduated. Can i get some advice?",

It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do. I applied and got accepted for a computer systems program at a college. I lived with shitty roommates for the first 2 semesters and made a friend + had another from highschool to help me out. I passed my core classes without issue. I failed both my communcation and general education classes. I decided to do 2nd semester without those. I was able to pass. 3rd semester during September was supposed to be co-op, but I was unable to find one, so I returned home for a semester. Right before new years, my old brother suddenly passed away. This was right at the time I met my girlfriend. I was heartbroken, but decided I would go to school anyways. I distracted my mental anguish by seeing my new gf every day. I ended up failing 2 of my core classes and a gned that semester. In my 4th semester, I failed every class. I was told I could not apply to a co-op. After meeting with the dean and telling them my sob story, I was cleared to apply with the agreement that I pass all my courses after my co-op, if not I would be unable to return to the college for 8 months. I found a co-op and my parents helped me buy a car. I made it through my co-op and found myself frequently late. We come back to this semester where I returned and here I am again. I am certain I failed one of my core classes, barely passed a gned and if my professor doesn't bump my grade, I will have failed my other gned. My girlfriend and I have a wonderful relationship, but she told me that if I didn't pass my classes, she would break up with me. I feel so shameful. I know that it's my fault. I made the wrong decisions. I can't live with myself. I am 1 semester and 1 co-op away from finishing, getting my paper and joining all my friends with jobs. I don't know what to do. I can't face my parents or my gf or my friends. I don't even want to meet with the Dean again because I have no excuse for my screw up. I am literally on the verge of tears and mental breakdown.

It was my only elective class at the time. I'd gone to his office, during his office hours and kindly asked to drop his class, he wasn't happy about it to say the least, I walked away and out of his office just for him to follow me out and push me from behind, I yelled at him over it and another professor came from his office and took the professors side on it even though my friend was there with me and witnessed the whole thing. I didn't come back to school that semester after this. \n\nThe second semester, I had to reapply and went on academic probation for the semester before. I was doing really good until I lost my car because I couldn't afford the payments/insurance on it. I started taking the bus, no big deal. But, then my mother needed me, because I was the only available adult at the time, to get my brother off the school bus at a certain hour. This conflicted entirely with my schedule at school and I ended up not being able to attend anymore because I had real world responsibilities I had to manage. I ended up going back to a regular job and doing what was needed of me at home. \n\nMy question is, how will all of this affect me going back to school again? I know I've failed numerous classes and passed very few. I want to try and take online courses whenever I do go back so that I can finally get something more than factory jobs. I can't imagine that fafsa will take me back off the bat and I may need to pay out of pocket for a semester or two. Will they ever take me back and let me use fafsa again? I no longer have the responsibilities to my mother as we no longer live together. I still don't have a car because I was indebted because I returned the other one year's ago and somehow still had to pay for it anyway, that debts finally gone. \n\nI'm 24 and just worried that I've ruined my life and any help or guidance would be very much appreciated.

I can't take more than 3 classes at a time, but it's really more like 2 because taking 3 makes my performance in one of them suffer every single time. A lifelong learning disability and long-time depression have made things kind of hellish.\n\nI was initially going to transfer to a university or possibly art school, but if just this is so difficult, I don't think I'm cut out for it, and if getting money is tough now, it's going to be even harder then. So after a lot of thought, I abandoned my major and transfer program in favor of an Associate's of General Studies. I should graduate at some point next year, and hopefully get a small job downtown.\n\nI feel a bit less stressed now, but my dad seems to think I've basically given up, asking me if I'm only going to school to \"warm a seat\". Like he thinks that for all I'm invested in my schooling right now, I might as well not be going at all. It's true that I don't do any extracurriculars, don't go out with any friends, and don't really care about taking classes that are interesting or challenging (I'm just trying to get everything that's mandatory done, preferably as easy as possible), but even the bare minimum is still really tough, to me.\n\nI think that's kind of easy for him to say, given he went to a state university where he had the luxury of being able to experiment with what he wanted to learn and how.

So I'd rather play it 100% safe and get out of college as fast as I possibly can, and get a local 9-5 job for the foreseeable future. \n\nTLDR Dad is disappointed in my \"streamlined\" method of surviving community college, but I thought I was practicing good self preservation. Am I being realistic, or just lazy?",

On top of that, there tends to be a bit of drama in my life at home. Hence I thought from time to time about transferring. This, however, changed when I was diagnosed with clinical depression in January 2018. 6 months and 50 mg of Zoloft later, I recovered. However, I balked at leaving home for another school due to it.\n\nNow the dilemma I\u2019m in: I\u2019ll be entering my junior year this fall, so this is really my last time to transfer. I really want to do it, but I understand that statistics say that 50% of people who have a depressive episode have a second. I\u2019m scarred shitless that it might happen again. My dream school is University of Cincinnati, which is on the other side of the state (I\u2019m from Cleveland). Hence, it scares me to an extent to be away from my support system. Especially since I\u2019m pre-law, I can\u2019t afford a bad semester (despite one bad semester during my depressive episode, I still have decent grades at this point).\n\nStill, part of me doesn\u2019t want to give depression that power over my life. I realize that life lived in fear of what might happen is a life not lived well. I have a lot of regrets from high school and early college, and despite any risks that may come with transferring, I don\u2019t want to have any more regrets.",

Overall, I have been really blessed in life and have had great opportunities, but I feel that I have been squandering all that. I am a bio major, but I have lost all passion for the subject and I now plan on going to law school. I originally wanted to go to med school and lost my drive to get in. Now I am stuck in these higher level (jr-sr) science courses and they are bringing my gpa down.  I used to consistently be above a 3.5 and I'm down to a 3.3. I know that this is my fault and I keep making dumb mistakes that bring my gpa down. Missed assignments and test scores that are lower than they should be. I am really worried about being able to get into the law school that I want to go too.\n\nHonestly, I am really worried about everything on a day to day basis. My anxiety decided to pop into high gear and its been kicking my ass. I am fairly ADD and I usually take adderall to help deal with that. Well, I have had to stop because its been a huge part of my anxiety. Now, my ADD is messing with me more than usual. It has been a battle to get assignments done and get acceptable grades. My motivation has taken a huge hit and I just feel really dumb to be honest. A lot of my friends succeed in school really easily or have super impressive abilities to grind. (Quick side note: I am happy for my friends and I really hope they all do well because they are the best). Being around them does make me feel ashamed of my grades and level of success so far. Part of it is my pettiness, but it still kills me at times.\n\nI am getting this feeling of dread as well. I just look at the future and worry that I will not be successful or able to provide enough for my future family. I have a really serious girlfriend and she comes from a well off, successful family. She will love me no matter how much I makes, but I want to live up to or exceed the standards that she sets for me. I want to feel good about myself and my accomplishments too. Lately, I have not been acting motivated or diligently enough to reach my goals. I need to makes changes but it has been hard. Somedays, I just want to call my parents and all the people that have supported me along the way to tell them sorry for being such a god damn mess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for any errors in spelling, grammar, and organization.",

            "content": "**TL;DR: mediocre freshman fall, HORRIBLE freshman spring, chronic illness and depression/anxiety/grief issues. I'm at a loss, scared, and need a new start.**\n\nI'm at a very prestigious university on a full academic scholarship, and I screwed up my freshman year *badly*. I didn't really have a good work ethic in high school, but I put effort in when it was needed and I got high enough grades/test scores to get in here, although honestly I don't understand how I did (I wasn't at the tippy top of my class and didn't really have leadership or do anything super impressive, but for some reason they chose me over people with objectively better credentials). I got here in late August and immediately started falling behind/having trouble in one specific class, although it was extremely hard because I had never been exposed to the material before and most of my classmates had been. I ended up withdrawing from that course, and got a B average (3.1) in my remaining three classes, even though I could have easily gotten an A average if I had put in the effort.\n\nOver winter break I started experiencing inexplicable neurological symptoms, and a few days after New Year's I went to the ER and was diagnosed with aural migraines. I was terrified that I had a brain tumor or MS (my mom passed away from a brain tumor 4 years ago), but migraine medication helped and a few days after being hospitalized my symptoms began to subside. After I got out, my two best friends and I made this entire game plan for our freshman spring, since we'd all had a less than ideal freshman fall. I really thought this was the turning point.\n\nThe first couple of weeks I stayed mostly on top of things, although I was beginning to realize that five classes, a \"leadership\" position, two publications and a work-study job was a lot of responsibility. Two weeks in, the neurological symptoms came back, but worse. Again I was terrified that I was terminally ill, and ended up missing a whole bunch of classes that week. There's one course in particular that requires consistent attendance and doing the assignments over an extended period of time, so of course I fell behind. I had to go home for an MRI and was back in the ER, but the MRI came back normal and I was given a stronger prescription and was back at school the next day. \n\nI don't really know how it got *so* bad from that point on, and it's 99% my own fault for being lazy. My sleep schedule was DESTROYED, so after being sick I kept not being able to sleep until 4 AM and then sleeping through class. I think missing classes that week sort of normalized in my head that it was okay to miss \"a few lectures\". It's not like I haven't been going to any, but I've missed or been 20+ minutes late to at least one class a week, especially that aforementioned course. I kept meeting with that professor and she was understanding because I'd been sick, but I just kept falling further and further behind to the point that I started ignoring the problem, which obviously made it worse. My friends and I spent most weeknights saying we were \"going to actually do work\" and then staying up chatting or talking on our phones until 3 AM, then sleeping through class after accomplishing absolutely nothing. About two weeks after I was hospitalized, we all got into relationship drama the same week, and the fallout from that took up WAY too much of my emotional energy from that point until... basically now. I also basically slept through my entire spring break.\n\nNow here I am. I tried to make a last-ditch effort to do all the work for \"that course\" at the last minute, but my professor did the math and told me that, between me barely turning in work all semester, not showing up to 25% of the classes, and missing pieces that count towards my final grade that I can't make up, I have no choice but to fail. I can retake it in the fall, but obviously at the cost of one of my other courses. I have to meet with my advisor on Monday, but she's made it clear that I have to receive a grade in this course at this point. I'm not doing great in my other courses either- I'm missing major assignments in two, and basically all of the ones I have turned in have been B's and C's. To make matters worse, my friend who I was supposed to room with next year was basically failing everything and is now taking a leave of absence and will be graduating with the incoming freshman class, assuming he ever comes back.\n\nEvery couple of minutes I feel like bursting into tears. I can't believe I've done this to myself and I'm so scared that I'll end up failing another class or my financial aid won't go through and I won't be able to be back next year. My mom ended up having to transfer schools after her freshman year of college was a dumpster fire, which has been hanging over me the entire year. I can't believe she warned me and now the same thing is happening to me, except I have no excuse. I'm going to have to start all over, and even then I don't know if I'll recover.",

I wanted to share my college story with you guys and get some insight and different views from you all.\n\nI graduated high school in 2011 at the age of 16. I applied and got accepted to the university in my area (I could not move out of state to live in a dorm because of my age), and was not advised about community colleges. Like, nobody told me about them at all. So, I started at the university in the fall full time (was taking 5 or 6 classes I think). I was also working a part time job. I had my license but had to share my car with my parents and rode my bike to and from school. I got a scholarship and a couple grants and had to take out 2 loans (my parents could not help me pay for school).\n\nThe first semester there was rough. My parents hadn't gone to college and weren't very supportive (they accepted what I was doing but didn't realize I needed help with homework and whatnot still). Because of this, I started not sharing anything with them and skipping classes. I think I passed maybe one of my classes. I was working and babysitting and was having a hard time doing my homework.\n\nSecond semester started and it was worse than the first. I felt very isolated and kept skipping classes. Without telling my parents, in late February, I withdrew from all of my classes and dropped out completely. I lied to my parents and kept going to campus and spending all day sleeping in the rec room (they would be furious with me). I then got a full time job elsewhere and told them that I had dropped out, and like I expected, they were furious.\n\nSo, I have spent the last few years working terrible dead end jobs. Cashier, caregiver, security guard. Hated all of them and realized that I wouldn't be able to do what I wanted without a degree.\n\nAnd here I am. Two years ago, I successfully completed one semester of 3 classes (I don't remember how many credit hours) at the community college. I was working a full time job that allowed me to do homework and even leave for classes when needed. That job has since been made obsolete (site got closed), and I moved on with a new job. I've now been working full time for a little over a year in a dead end job that I absolutely loathe. I am unable to do homework here. I am taking two online classes right now. One of them, I'm doing alright in, the other one, I have no chance of passing.\n\nSo my dilemma is that I really want to go to school full time and not work full time. I am fortunate and able to do that. I have found some independent contractor work, and will work this crappy job until the fall semester starts. The community college that I'm going to is horrible with communication. They don't respond to my questions and concerns and it's annoying.\n\nI want to go back to the university in my area. I owe them some money (I think a couple grand) from dropping out prematurely (I owe back the grant money). The loans are paid off. I have not received financial aid for the community college.\n\nI know what you're thinking. Why would I want to go back to the expensive old university when the CC is so much cheaper? Because the university has good programs for my major, and the CC doesn't have a good equivalent transfer program (I want to do environmental science, and the CC doesn't offer that as a transfer program). I'm worried that if I do the transfer program (general science) the credits won't all transfer over or will not be useful and I'll have to retake a lot of credits at the university. \n\nWhat would you do? Would you work out a deal with the university and try to go back in the fall? Or would you pay it off incrementally and go to the CC until you get your associates and hope that it can transfer?",

I know it\u2019s not as simple but whenever I find something I really enjoy I always strive to be the best at it. I\u2019ve done it with football, video games, math classes in the past. \n\n\nIn all honesty, I\u2019m just scared if I will make the right move or not. I\u2019m afraid of what my family will think. \nI\u2019m most afraid of switching majors and ending up back in this same spot I am right now. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if my ADHD can compliment my change to a Psychologically major because I\u2019m sure if I will be stimulated enough. \n\nI know many of you have been through something like this and I just need to let it out because I can\u2019t talk to anyone about it yet ( I\u2019ve emailed my advisor for an appointment but i don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll be ).",

My high school never offered me or even mentioned SAT testing when I was younger so I\u2019ve never taken an SAT. When I was growing up college was never in the works for me as my family did not make enough money to put me through &  after a few illnesses in the family during my senior year of HS I made the hard choice of sacrificing my own enrichment in education for my family. I don\u2019t ever regret it. But recently after working a lot as a Service Industry employee Specifically Bartending at night and Delivery Driving for a catering company I\u2019ve had it. And it\u2019s frustrating for me since I really don\u2019t have the opportunity to seek this help in my immediate area as I live in a very Rural little town in Upstate NY. Where my internet is still coming through a Satellite. I\u2019m assuming I should start out with FASFA first, but then how should I go on about applying to schools? Do they generally have people in Admissions that help out with these sorts of situations? Am I at a loss? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late for me, and I\u2019d love nothing more than to atleast get  a Bachelors in either Spanish Language or I.T.

            "title": "I got a 4.0 while taking 20 credits and didn\u2019t hate my life. Here\u2019s how.",
            "content": " \n\nThis is a story about how this spring semester, I got straight A\u2019s in 20 credits worth of classes while also working part time, volunteering, securing a summer internship, trying not to neglect my relationships, exercising daily, and getting 8 hours of sleep. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot trying to \u201cflex\u201d \\*hello fellow kids\\*, but I see a lot of people asking for advice, especially new students, wondering if their credit load will overwhelm them.  I hope this helps someone.  \\*\\*\\*TDLR at the bottom\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A Brief History:**\n\nI am a 25 yo female who just finished my \u201cJunior\u201d year of undergrad. \u201cJunior\u201d because it was my fourth year of college and I have a ton of credits, but I still have a full academic year before I graduate. After high school, I dragged ass and essentially failed out after two years of an unrelated degree (art), took three years off, then went back two years ago for my current degree.\n\nWhen I left school, I was absolutely convinced that I was dropping out of college, not taking a break. I had anxiety attacks before attending class, felt extremely lost, could barely pay attention in lecture, and struggled with substance abuse. I finished my last semester with a semester GPA of 1.9 and a total GPA of 2.5. Yikes. \n\nIn high school, I was one of those \u201cgifted\u201d but burnt out kids. My teachers always said I was smart, but it was such a shame that I refused *apply* myself. After taking a break from school and doing some soul searching, I decided: I\u2019m a fucking adult, I\u2019m going back to college, for real this time. I\u2019m going to apply my goddamn self. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**About my degree:**\n\nI\u2019m studying public health. To me, my degree is the perfect mix of \u201chard science\u201d classes and humanities classes. I take classes in the realm of microbiology, A&P, epidemiology, anthropology, sociology, and ethics. The mix of memorization-style studying and critical thinking, writing essays and discussion style work makes it so that I\u2019m never bored. (I go to a large state school in the northwest U.S. if that matters to you). \n\nThis is the part where someone butts in and says you could never do this with a STEM degree. Sure. Probably not. I\u2019m not saying that every person regardless of major should take my advice, just trying to share what I have learned. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Decision:**\n\nI do a little mental checklist before I assemble a semester\u2019s worth of classes (because advisors are useless- you already *know*). This particular semester, it just somehow worked out that I wasn\u2019t going to be taking any classes that required large amounts of difficult studying. I don\u2019t mean work, but *studying.* That is not to say that I didn\u2019t do any work. I still had shit to do. Readings to skim, essays to write, research to do, the works. But I didn\u2019t really *study*, which takes up a lot more abstract time than *doing.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Classes:** \n\nI took 4 three credit courses and 2 four credit courses. All but two of my courses were 400 level classes with a significant amount of work. (If you\u2019re curious: 3 credit 200 level medical anthropology and a 3 credit 100 level earth science class- my last core requirement)\n\nI like to breakdown my classes at the beginning of the semester based on how difficult I deem them to be. You can usually figure this out by the first couple weeks of class, or after the first graded assignment. How much work will this require time-wise and brain-power-wise, and how big of a hardass grader is the prof? THIS is a big deal. Once I figured this out, college seemed so much more like a game. I would highly recommend doing this, you can reassess throughout the semester and as you learn more about your own grade in the class. I typically write my courses on a sticky note in order of priority and slap it in my planner. Speaking of which:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Planner set up:**\n\nI need a paper planner. It\u2019s absolutely non-negotiable. I could not survive college without one, and you shouldn\u2019t try to. I bring it everywhere. I\u2019ve tried bullet journaling, keeping a to-do list in a notebook, google calendar- none of them compare to the ease of use and accuracy of a paper planner. A typical week in mine looks like [this!](https://imgur.com/a/r5qhd0i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the beginning of the semester, I write the time every class takes place in my weekly spread A4 Target planner. Then, I go through the syllabus and enter every single thing next to when it is due. For each week of the semester, I have two sticky notes on the page. I do this because inevitably things get moved around. In my photo, you can see that the smaller yellow note is for readings, and the large pink one is my ongoing to-do list. The readings being separate is important because otherwise everything gets clogged up, and I can see at a glance what I need to read (or skim, or pretend to have read). I organize my to-do list by class, and have a section for \u201clife\u201d. The first thing I do every morning is look at my planner, and it\u2019s one of the last things I look at before I go to bed. As soon as I sit down in class, I open it up. When making plans with a friend, I open it up. I can\u2019t overstate this enough. Get a planner and use the shit out of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Work:** \n\nI had the unique situation of not having to work that much this semester. I received a federal grant that paid for most of my tuition, scholarships paid for the rest, and my family helps me out with part of my living expenses. This is obviously not everyone\u2019s reality.\n\nThe last three semesters, I have worked up to 30 hours each week, and it really is fucking hard. Working takes up a lot of your time and energy, and I wouldn\u2019t recommend working while taking this heavy of a course load. \n\nThat being said, I did still work. I like working. I like having money, I like the structure and I like having something productive besides school to do. In the past, I was an assistant teacher at a private preschool. This semester, I was lucky enough to be able to substitute teach at least one 6 hour shift each week because of my school schedule (Fridays off, Thursdays half off). I also babysat a couple of nights each week pretty consistently. This ended up being about 10-15 hours a week of work- an easy couple hundred bucks in my pocket for rent and nights out. The best part about this situation is that if I was really swamped, I could just completely opt out of work or not schedule anything. When I wasn\u2019t busy with school, I could put in a 20 hour workweek. It put me in control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Volunteering:**\n\nI taught adaptive skiing on Sundays. I ski with an 8-year-old girl with Down syndrome, and it is exhausting, but rewarding. Our days consisted of me chasing after her, singing songs, managing tantrums, and hoisting her up off the snow. I laughed a lot. Despite thinking that I might over-stretch myself at the beginning, this experience was additive to my life. I felt refreshed, motivated, and happy because I had this kind of volunteering in my schedule. I include this not to brag, but to recommend some type of meaningful volunteering or work if you can. If you think you\u2019re too busy to do good things in the world, you\u2019re not. Promise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Relationships:**\n\nYou know the triangle. Choose one: sleep, get A\u2019s, or have a social life.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m 25. Sort-of non-traditional, but I\u2019m still in my twenties. I still have friends who like to go out, still go to shows, stay up too late, etc. But, my friends are also adults. None of my friends who are nurses, teachers, or baristas want to go out until midnight on a Thursday anymore. None of my non-student friends are free in the middle of the day to go fuck around or distract me. When I tell my friends I can\u2019t come out because I\u2019m studying, they\u2019re not giving me shit for it. \n\nI still made a point to set aside time on Saturday\u2019s to spend time with my friends. Typically we would ski, go out for coffee, or make each other breakfast.  \n\nAnother factor in this realm is my boyfriend. Boyfriend works 9-5, so my motivation to not do any schoolwork after dinner was intensified in order to hang out with my person. Boyfriend makes me dinner on nights that I have class until 8pm. Boyfriend gets toilet paper at the store because I\u2019m stuck in the library.  Boyfriend wakes me up with coffee telling me he is proud of me. Can you tell that my love language is acts of service?\n\nI\u2019m not telling you to ignore your friends if they\u2019re distracting and get a partner who does stuff for you, but to consider which relationships in your life are additive and which are less so. It\u2019s fine to have fun and make memories; you\u2019re in college. But if you say yes to every single opportunity, you will find yourself out of balance.\n\nMy point here with relationships is this: make sure the people who love you know what is going on with you. Let them know that you want to hang out, but you\u2019re reaching for your goals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Work Ethic:**\n\nFor me, relying on motivation alone has never helped me. I need to \u201chack\u201d my environment in order to do what I need to do. \n\nI woke up at 6:30 every single day, including weekends. On weekdays, I would arrive on campus around 7:45 and either go to class or go to the library. The quiet floor or the law library are clutch. No coffee shops, no cafeteria, no house. If there is any ambient noise or people having conversations around me, I cannot function. I am there to do work and focus. If you\u2019re only half-working, you\u2019re spending twice the amount of time on work. I straight up didn\u2019t have the time to only half-work.\n\nIn a typical day, I will sit down at a desk, open up my planner and my laptop, decide which item on my to-do list is the perfect combination of \u201cfinishability\u201d and time-urgency.  My phone is on grey-scale and I deleted my social media apps this January and haven't looked back. I listen to 432 Hz white noise music in noise-cancelling earbuds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m very bad at time. My brain does not conceptualize it passing. I wear a watch religiously, and set timers for everything- Otherwise I get sucked into the hyper-focus wormhole. I set a ten minute timer to get set up and decide what to do, otherwise I will agonize about what the \u201cperfect\u201d thing to do is. Then, I set a timer for 30 minutes, and lean into whatever I have decided to do. After this, I take a break, walk around, take my earbuds out, get some water or coffee, but do not turn my phone back on. And repeat. Before I know it, my work is done or it is time to go to class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I don\u2019t have anything to do, but it is still \u201cwork\u201d time, I will research grad programs, apply for internships, go to professors office hours, or read about work that people I admire do. This paid off in the end of the semester, as a professor casually mentioned that I would get along well with another professor in a different department. I meet up with Prof #2, she was impressed that I had already read about her work and offered me a paid summer internship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Exercise:** \n\nExercise is another non-negotiable in my life. I have border-collie level energy. I need to exercise. If I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed, tired, or stuck, a run almost always helps. I lift weights 4 days a week, my routine usually takes about an hour. I either Nordic or downhill ski with my friends on Saturdays, volunteer on Sundays, and have two hours of yoga a week built into my schedule. No exercise = poor sleep = too tired to workout = eat like crap = I can\u2019t focus= I get overwhelmed= whole system falls apart. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What I did that actually helped me succeed.** \n\n* Campus library is my \u201coffice\u201d from 8-5 every single weekday. \n* Paper planner is your BIBLE.\n* Delete social media. Turn off your phone. Really.\n* Work in chunks. For my brain, 30 minutes with a timer and then a small break is ideal. \n* Prioritize, prioritize prioritize. You\u2019re going to have to bullshit some assignments and toil over others. Make your efforts count.\n* If you don\u2019t think you have any school work to do at any given time, you\u2019re wrong. You can always work ahead. \n* Habits trump motivation every time. Motivation wanes, but if you\u2019re in the groove, you\u2019re way less likely to fall behind. \n* Never. Ever. Ever. Skip. Class. \n* This seems obvious, but do every single assignment and every single extra credit opportunity, no matter how minuscule or annoying. \n* Support system. Tell your friends & family what you\u2019re trying to achieve and let them know how they can *help* you.\n* Don\u2019t forget to feed yourself and exercise.\n* Set aside intentional time for non-school. Ideally a full day on the weekend. \n* Say no. Say NO. Explain yourself, be kind, but say fucking no. \n* Nobody is productive every single hour of every day. It\u2019s ok. Perfect is truly the enemy of the good. \n* Have an end goal. Visualize walking at graduation. See your GPA climb.\n* If you\u2019re a non-traditional age considering going back to school- do it. School is infinitely easier with an adult brain, adult friends, and adult priorities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, if you fucked up this semester, its ok. It really is. I\u2019ve been there. My sophomore year, I ended the spring semester with one D, two Cs, an F and a W. It doesn\u2019t feel good. Just remember that it doesn\u2019t say anything about your worth as a person. Beating yourself up about it isn't going to help in the long run. You are not forever the person who fucked up, and you can use what you did wrong to learn and grow and change. \n\nAlso, remember that succeeding and trying your best doesn\u2019t have to be miserable. You can still enjoy the things that bring meaning to your life while trying to do something difficult. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I got a 4.0 while being busy. It didn\u2019t suck because I had a perfect storm of mindset, abilities, organization, and circumstance.",

As the title says, I'll be coming up on my third year of community college. I took last semester off because I was depressed and having suicidal thoughts. This is my first semester back since last Spring and I'm not even going to be able to finish strong. I'm currently enrolled in five classes, one of those is online. I went to class every day up until the beginning of March and just stopped going after Spring Break. My depression and anxiety started creeping back in and I just stayed home and/or worked every day.\n\nI'm currently 20 years old, about to be 21, with no financial support from my family and I live in a pretty pricey city. 75% of the time I can barely afford rent and I think money is one of the key issues towards my stress. I started seeing a therapist mid-March and it's helped a lot. I spoke with him about my problems and I spoke to my professors and they told me they understand my position and told me to consider medical withdrawal because I was too far behind and it would help save my GPA. I spoke with my academic counselor and he helped my with the process. The end of the semester is here and I chose to stay in my online class and passed, but my other classes will have to be retaken. I haven't told my family about what's happened, I've actually told them the opposite and said I'm graduating this semester. \n\nI'm embarrassed when they ask me if I'm graduating. My girlfriend (one grade year behind) just finished her sophomore year and is caught up to me. I just feel so down about everything. I plan on retaking the same classes in the Fall.

I have been giving medical school a lot of consideration. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Background:** I entered a community college and was in all earnest a pretty lost student with no idea about what I wanted to do. I gave Physics a run for its money but didn't do so well due to a lot of family issues and mental health. I took some time off and went to address my mental health and learn how to separate my personal life from my family. Since then I switched to Decision Science (ISDS) and have a decent 3.6 GPA  and also transferred to a Cal state. Since then I got into the honors program there, and was distinguished as top 10 percent in my junior year class. Got into some honors associations like NSCS and Beta Gamma Sigma which is apparently really good. I have a knack for analytics but I honestly don't see myself too happy in a 5 year time span.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiven this background. I have been considering Medical School for a variety of reasons:\n\n1. I genuinely excel at reading peoples emotions and supporting them.\n2. I love to take care of others, and help bring them up while consoling them.\n3. I have a genuine thirst for knowledge and learning about how we function.\n4. I don't mind the time required, and I understand the sacrifices that need to be made.\n5. I want to help people in a meaningful way with a visible influence, attending to their needs, emotions, being there to console, and reach out to others in their time of need.  \n\nThe list goes on but these are just general things that I believe would make me a decent healthcare professional. I know there is a lot of talk about \" If you can see yourself somewhere else then dont go to Medical School.\" Ive given this a lot of thought and Ive explored a lot of majors but never took a interest in them as much as I have in my experience in my EMT classes. ISDS is interesting but I'm only studying it to get a degree. I often think about medical school frequently, and I mean about 2-3 hours a day.  I have a lot of relatives who are doctors so Ive talked to them a lot and know the expectations versus reality of glamorizing medicine. I went through the glamor phase and honestly its worn off and I am still interested. I have a urging \"Passion\" to help people and be at their side for when they are most vulnerable and need somebody trustworthy and somebody they can rely on to help, nurse, or treat them. Whether it be physically or spiritually. Deep down I keep having this tugging feeling no matter how much I avoid the thought of medical school and keep telling myself \"Just Finish your degree and get a job.\" The more I try to avoid it the more life throws the idea at me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm worried that maybe I am fooling myself, or that I am too old by now. Once I finish my degree my plan was to go do a post-bacc for 2 more years and of course this would require all the exams and testings I would need to prep for before attempting to apply to medical school. I have a good network to get myself a job transporting patients in hospitals, and perhaps doing EMT work so I was thinking those would serve as clinical exposure. I am also working (By myself) on how to repair the crumbling infrastructure that is the EMR system, and how to make paperwork lighter on physicians and nurses. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiven all this I wanted to ask. What are your thoughts on my perception of wanting to go to medical school? Based on what you heard would you advise against it? Also, Am I too old or would the opportunity cost be too great at this age?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont mind Honesty so long as its constructive and polite. Thank you for reading this.",

            "content": "I am going through a really stressed out time at my college. I am finishing up my fifth year at college (third year from a university after graduating and transferring from a two-year community college). Nobody understands how much I hate college. I'm just not having a fun time like I guess I'm suppose to be having. I have a twin brother who has cerebral palsy, and we both lived in the same house, shared the same room, went to the same community college, and now we live in an apartment together and go to the same university. That's 23 years summed up. So because he has CP, he can't drive, so I have to do all the driving and take care of him, that's just how it's always been. I have to go get groceries, take him to school and pick him up, drive him around for fun, etc. You get the picture.\n\nSo I am finishing up my fifth year, and because I pushed off my foreign language requirements until it was passed the time for me to already have them done, this has caused me to push my graduation off as well until I can finish the foreign language requirements. So if I had done everything in the timely fashion that I should have, I would have graduated a year ago and I could already be a year into the next part of my life.\n\nWell, because I procrastinated and put off my foreign language, I would now have to spend the entire summer and fall trying to get the second through the fourth courses. I took the first course my first semester at the university and only passed because the teacher had a soft spot for me. But that was three years ago, and I don't remember anything from the first course at all. I really, really, really cannot stress enough how much I didn't enjoy that first foreign language course even though the professor became my favorite professor I've ever had. But because I didn't enjoy it, I just ignored it until it was way too late.\n\nI have begged my Mom for years to let me either drop out or finish online somewhere else, basically I've done everything I can to avoid taking this foreign language. I just open the textbook and look at all those words, and just see this impossible task of learning an entire other language that I don't have any desire in learning.\n\nI really don't like school at all. I've always had the worst luck making friends, the two or three that I do have, I barely see or hear from. My passion has been in movies for the past 8 years so that's how I entertain myself, and that's what I plan to in the next step of my life.\n\nSo on top of my problems, this happened last night. My twin brother who is suppose to be graduating in two weeks told me last night that for the past two months, he has considered postponing his graduation until winter (like me) so that he can minor in aviation. He doesn't enjoy the communication major he got, but what I don't understand is that he's done, but he wants to stay? \n\nHe is scared about what is going to happen to him after we part ways because I have been his source of transportation ever since I got my driver's license. He has no desire to go back home, which is honestly where everyone thought he would end up, because the town we grew up in is just tumbleweeds and some houses. Not a lot to do there and it's the kind of town you want to move to if you wanted to be a farmer.\n\nAnyways, I think it's fair for me to say that relying on other people his entire life has made him self-centered to the point that he's not even thinking about how much money it would cost my parents to keep him in school for another semester. He told my Mom his plan over the phone last night and she broke down crying and sobbing.\n\nI'm ready to leave. I'm burned out on school and also taking care of him because I'm ready to have my own life.\n\nI feel like my extended stay here at college has caused my brother to stay as well, and I'm the reason why my family is so stressed out. If I had just done the classes I was suppose to have and graduated on time, none of this would be happening right now. I feel like I'm the cause of all of this. I hate making my problems other people's problems so I do my best to figure as much out on my own as I can flying solo, but I've backed myself into this corner.\n\nI'm so sick of my family giving me crap on still being in college to the point where they basically just laugh at me and make fun of me. This is just material for my aunt, uncle and cousin to have a hay day with, they love to laugh at and make jokes about other people's problems, but I think that might psychologically have something to do with their own problems they constantly stay in.\n\nI hate being the oldest sibling because I don't have an older brother or sister to talk to. My twin and I will be the ones my sister and younger brother will learn from. We're just bait to their fishing wire.\n\nI'm so burned out from all of this to the point that I just want to quit and drop out and runaway from it all. I keep going back through my mind and thinking about all the mistakes I made that could have prevented all of this from happening. The moment I saw \"FOREIGN LANGUAGE\" as a requirement, that should have been the first big red flag.\n\nSo my family and I are going through a really stressed out time right now. I don't know what to do about my brother or about myself. I'm not trying to throw a pity-party, this is just a load off my plate that I need help with. I couldn't care less about finishing school. I've tried talking to my Mom, my Dad, and my Aunt about it many times. My Mom cried, my Dad was zero help, and my Aunt think \"what's the rush. Just keep going and get your Master's and become a teacher.\"",

Yet, it is unbecoming and concerning as A's and B's have been a standard since elementary and steadily declining since college started. \n\nHowever, what worries me is how with this decline i've struggled to improve the situation and believe i'm squandering the money my parents have invested into me. I have no friends, and the only people I have in my social circle is my direct family, so I have no reason to be distracted. My circumstances don't allow me to do extracurricular activities nor obligations to attend to so my life consists of only classes and devoid of anything else. \n\nBy all accounts this environment should be optimal for better grades as I have no other distractions, yet it seems like i'm sinking. My purpose is to get good grades and follow through with my parents wishes to be a lawyer, but as time continues I feel like my obligation to my parents isn't as strong anymore and feel my purpose and drive lacking. \n\nHow can one power through this diminishing drive, but also improve my prospects as there's no reliable system to track grades to understand what needs to be improved? What in my environment needs to be changed to stop sinking further as my gpa has lowered to a 2.5?",

I had taken 19 credit hours (Im capped at 20) and was completing a FWS in toxicology research as an assistant, which meant either no shifts a week or 10+ hours, when 6 is the pushed recommendation.\n\nOn top of all of this, i started to have health issues soon after my 18th birthday. Long story short, my body became violently lactose intolerant. \n\nAnother issue was my dad's own college journey. He is a 2L in the law school of my university, and he has been in law school for 3 years (the class he started in graduates next week). His education is being continuously halted due to various complications from former sugeries, mixed with ulcers and bad habits reforming.

I was reasonably expectant to fail out of this semester: i dropped a math course, failed every chem exam, and even switched majors from a hard science (forensics) to pre law, which also cost me a scholarship. \n\nI hope this wasn't too long, but I just wanted to share that despite things not going well, doing your best is always enough.

            "content": "I hate to say it, but I performed terribly at my university and got academically dismissed. I was able  to successfully appeal to be reinstated. Now I have to submut a different appeal for financial aid. I know there's a good chance it'll probably be denied, but I still wanted to at least try. The worst they can say is no, right? Writing is not my strong point and any tips for my letter would help a lot.\n\nHere it is: Dear SAP Appeal Committee:\n\nI am writing this letter in hopes of appealing my financial aid suspension, which has been revoked due to my failure to meet the minimum cumulative course completion rate and low GPA. I fully understand the reason for this suspension and take full responsibility. I am writing to explain what went wrong, the changes I've made, and to outline the steps I plan on taking to put myself on a path towards academic success at (blank).\n\nI did not succeed academically, because I failed to make any actual effort. I was not properly focused on my studies, had no passion for what I previously wanted to major in, and did not take my work seriously. For a long time, I was dealing with feelings of worthlessness and low self esteem. So much so that I gave up on myself without even trying. All sorts of resources were available, but I did not take the initiative to use them and instead refused to help myself. I secluded myself and ignored my classes and responsibilities as a student. I realize that excuses are tools for people that are weak and incompetent. Those that use them seldom amount to anything, and I don't want that to be me.\n\nSince spring of 2018, I have made a few changes. I spent months thinking of which undergraduate degree would best suit me. Ultimately, I changed my major to informatics, which will complement my desired career path of librarianship. I started using an emotional support hotline whenever I was overwhelmed or feeling hopeless and it has made a difference. I wasn't used to opening up to someone about my problems, but the hotline has helped me learn how to share my feelings with others instead of shutting down and keeping to myself. I've even learned to do this in day-to-day life, not strictly via phone. I have been working at a warehouse for a year, and working there has helped me realize how much I took school for granted. While not bad, it is definitely not a job that requires any skills and it's mostly physical. I want a degree so that I can achieve a better paying job that doesn't require as much physical labor and to actual work a job I enjoy doing. I realized that time will go by and I am either going to move forward towards goals or not. I want to move forward. \n\nTo prevent this unsatisfactory academic performance from happening again, I have developed a plan for myself that will guarantee a successful semester:\n\nI will make it mandatory to meet with my advisor on a regular basis to review grades and any issues that may prevent me from succeeding in class. I will communicate with my professors to find ways to succeed in their classes as well as seek help during their office hours. I cannot promise that I won't have feelings of worthlessness or anxiety again. If I start to experience these emotions, I'll immediately make an appointment with CAPS to speak with a counselor as well as continuing to use the hot-line. I know it takes focus, dedication, and capacity to study. I will switch from full-time employment to part-time so that I can manage my time wisely. If that isn't enough, I'll leave my job to solely study.\n\nLooking over my transcript, I am disappointed and ashamed at my lack of progress over the years. I'm grateful for being granted the opportunity to appeal and I want to prove to myself and the university that I belong here. Without financial aid, I will be unable to attend this fall and I hope you can give me a chance to redeem myself. Thank you very much for taking the time to read through my appeal.\n\nSincerely,\n(Blank)",

I feel like I am stuck because of an immature phase in my early 20's. Can anyone relate? Is there any option for me?",

The only reason why I decided to extend another year is that I want to do a Pre-PT track, and applying to Post Bach after graduating with a Bachelors with a few of the required Pre-PT courses won't let me apply, so that's why I decided to pull another year.\n\nI signed up for my first set of science classes that I will take this summer (M-F 9AM-4PM for 3 months-basically all summer). I was checking my commute, and it will be taking the 5:45 AM train since it's the only one that will stop near my suburb and with all the other commute will get me to campus around 8:30AM. Would be coming home around 6/7ish each night due to how the trains are. \n\nFall courses are a bit better, but it's still everyday and the timing is all over the place. I already send in my resignation for my job before I start the summer courses, and preparing mentally that I will probably not get any sleep or study time. Parents seem to be oblivious to this, since I wasn't the favored child but I want to move into a small studio in the city just for sanity sake and I won't end up crying on my commute back. \n\nHowever, I'm just not sure if it's worth the $1500-2400 for a studio. Was doing the math on this, and comparing it to gas/monthly tickets/yearly parking pass for the train station.. and money sakes the commute looks better for the pocket, but not much for my sanity. \n\nAlso, this would be my last year in this state before applying to PT school so I would like to enjoy my last year since I really haven't been able to for a while.

            "content": "So I failed my first semester of college, only passed 1/5 classes with a D. This was due to just poor adjustment and depression issues I didn\u2019t want to confront. My second semester was going well until I caught pneumonia. My parents discourage withdrawals so I continued to play catch up and for a while it seemed like I would make it. Today I found out that my English teacher (entry level English requirement for the university) won\u2019t be accepting my papers because she submitted the grades before I sent my final papers in. It\u2019s really my fault for submitting them late, but I submitted them an hour late and there\u2019s no leniency. I also found out that even if I score a perfect 100 in my physics exam, I\u2019ll be getting an F in the class anyways. This is due to bad tests because I suck at any science or math class. The physics class is also a gen ed. \n\nThe only classes I\u2019m passing are my upper level classes for my major. Those im passing with a C or low B. I have 3 credits from high school so after this semester I\u2019ll finish my first year with 15 credits, essentially flunking a whole semester. I feel awful because my parents are paying for everything and I was trying really hard to redeem myself this semester and it feels like all my hard work just doesn\u2019t pay off. This past semester is the first time in my life I consistently put everything I could into my schoolwork and my parents are probably gonna force me to drop out and cut me off financially. I don\u2019t know where to go from here. I didn\u2019t feel ready to go to university in the first place and I felt pressured to go and I failed and I feel like my whole life is messed up now. I had been trying for 5 months to get a job and didn\u2019t find one. I was only given one interview and that didn\u2019t work out (my first interview, I was nervous). My parents won\u2019t let me work this summer because I have to go on a family vacation with them for the whole summer. If they cut me off I need to have a way to make money to pay for rent.\n\nI didn\u2019t slack off due to partying or anything. I was truly unprepared. I was sent to university across the ocean where I know no one. I finished my first year with no friends. I got myself a boyfriend who is amazing but I worry that all this failure is going to make me lose him too. I don\u2019t know how to come up from nothing. I don\u2019t want to drop out and feel like even more of a failure than I already do but it might be the case. \n\nTLDR I failed college not due to partying, but mostly external factors I let get to me. I\u2019m at risk of being cut off financially by my family and have no support right now. Where do I go from here.",

I used to be an architecture major, but the workload was extremely heavy, I took a semester break, and switched to mechanical engineering.  Despite switching, I was extremely successful in the architecture program. In the engineering program, I feel like I honestly suck. I\u2019m pretty art brained and I know that doesn\u2019t exactly mean I\u2019m bad at math or anything, but I just finished up my worst semester ever. I took linear algebra, Calc 3, physics, and Engineering graphics all in the same semester and it ended quite badly. I hated my classes, I did have some extreme social anxiety so I did skip a week, but even so I felt like every day I was in class my brain just couldn\u2019t get the information easily. I really want to switch majors, but am a little apprehensive about going back to architecture. I love design and it\u2019s processes in pretty much every field i.e architecture, fashion design, industrial design, but we don\u2019t have a pure design major at my school. I also absolutely love music and have been playing the trumpet for 8 years, 5 of which have been in marching band in high school and for my college. I don\u2019t really know if I should go a music route, or switch back to architecture, but I know I cannot continue with the engineering degree without losing my scholarships.

            "content": " \n\nI was wondering if anyone can help me with my situation atm. I know that ultimately its my decision but I kind of want some other opinion.\n\nA little bit about me, I'm 23, male, currently in my senior year in college, but I'm basically part time student and full time developer.\n\nSo, in April 2017 I started learning Web development, both front end and back end. Then in Aug 2017 I started doing some freelance work. It was ok, not really something I could live off of. So I was basically still living with my parents. From Aug 2017 to Nov 2018, I was basically just living off my parents and making side money doing freelance, and was working Part time at a pharmacy. The pay was pretty good, something I could live off of but I only worked on the weekends. So all this on top of going to school full time 15hr semesters. So Nov 2018 I had a rough month, only had one client and only got paid 80 dollars. Towards the end of NOV 2018 I had to start preparing for finals so i couldnt take anymore clients. But a really lucky thing happened to me. One day, I decided to go to campus to the CS Lab to finish a JAVA Calendar app. And by finish, I mean start it (it was due that day at 6:30pm). So as I was doing the project, a guy (prob around 28yrs old I think), Went up to me and asked if I could help him with the same project. And I did, was simple enough, But he was having a hard time understanding it so I explained it to him best I could. We talked a lot, and I remember him asking me how I knew those stuff already, and he seemed lost in the class. Then I explained to him how I have been coding in C++ since I was a sophomore in highschool, but when I got to college my parents wanted me to major in nursing because it was a \"Stable\" job. And I did that for 3 years and Absolutely hated it. I found myself skipping classes to go do practice coding or start a new project. So I recently switched majors into CS. I also mentioned to him that I had been doing freelance web dev since Aug 2017 and that my favorite languages were C++ and javascript. In the end, Turns out we were in the Same OOP class, who knew?\n\nFast forward a week later, the last week of NOV. I meet the same guy in class and he asks me if I was looking for a project. I told him I wasn't because finals coming up, but if it was worth it, Ill take it. Then he explained everything to me.\n\nTurns out he works as an IT for a Real estate company that was looking to re build their website. So I took the project! ofc.\n\nWorked a total about 2 weeks in December and got paid 2k dollars. Was a good month for me. So on the last day when they payed me the CEO actually wanted to meet with me. And Turns out He graduated in the same college as I'm currently in. And he knew another CEO that is looking for a web developer. So he referred me. I went through 3 interviews, 1 call, 1 personality one, and 1 whiteboard interview. And I got in! TBH I thought I had bombed those interviews. I've been working with them ever since, as a REMOTE full stack developer. DEC 2018 - now so almost 6 months already. And I have since moved out and live with myself now.\n\nNow my situation is, This semester, I work full time remotely 8-5. And go to class 6:30-9:30pm. This was very taxing and almost couldnt take it. I had to drop half of my classes just so I could keep my sane. But about halfway throughout the semester I noticed that even if I went to class. I would just work on some personal web projects in class, So I decided not go to class anymore - Probably a huge mistake. Anyway, now finals is next week, and I already know I can only get an F in all of my 3 classes. EVEN if I make 100 on each of them. Now I know I'm going to fail this semester. My GPA since this semester was 3.9 out of 4. I know it'll affect my GPA but tbh I don't care anymore. I'm more concerned because I'm essentially moving my graduation date back by a semester. And my parents expect me to graduate This AUG 2019 and I don't want them to think that I am a disappointment or a failure because I didn't graduate college. All my friends are graduating this month, albeit, they don't have anything lined up after that though. So what are your thoughts? what should I do? should I just focus on work? Should I refocus on school?\n\nFYI: in my parents eyes, if you don't have a degree, you're basically a failure that works at mcdonalds or target all your life. And I've tried telling them that it doesn't matter. But they never believe it. They thought that I was lying about my work because I would be at home in front of the computer all day and have youtube or music running on my second screen.\n\nTL:DR\n\nPushed graduation back a semester because I'm gonna fail this semester because I took a Remote Dev full time Job. Moved out of my parents house. But my parents might be disappointed with me because I wouldn't graduate on time. What should I do?",

I believe it would help me get my foot in the door but the problem is most of these internships are unpaid. And it will be extremely difficult to go to school, while working, while doing my internship, and focusing on my own sanity. I have so much to think about and feel like I have little time to do so since I graduate in December. I don't know if I should just stick to volunteering because I will be able to have more flexibility in my schedule that way. On the other hand, I feel like an internship would help. But then I would have to sacrifice other things in my life like going to the gym and really cutting back on my finances. Staying at home isn't really much of an option either because the dynamics in my family are extremely toxic. I wish I could speak to someone more about this but I'm not sure who.

Basically, I\u2019m just on the brink of getting an Academic Alert with 113-116 credits completed, but I\u2019ve only got 8 left, so at this point, I wouldn\u2019t be full time for a semester to apply for that. I just want to finish the four necessary online class credits and the (paid) internship for four more academic credits so I can just pass and get it over with this summer.\nI just want to get the Bachelor\u2019s degree with the stupid piece of paper that will allow me to get a decent paying job after walking down the aisle in the fall. Now, my mom doesn\u2019t want to pay anymore unless I find an internship ASAP.\nPersonally, I think the major killers for my burnout were/are the superfluous amount of unnecessary required credits, and my own difficulty breaking my bad habits of shyness and finding motivation. I\u2019ve always been a good writer, there are even a few college professors I\u2019ve had who have complimented me on my papers for their classes, and I\u2019ve mostly received As, A-\u2018s, and Bs, though I did receive a couple of Cs and one F in classes where the work was really abstract.  \nBut if college didn\u2019t force me to take all these excess credits in so many different things to graduate with 124 credits and a minor that I really would rather not have taken if I\u2019d had the choice, I probably could have just taken the English classes required to graduate and finished off with something in the high 2.0 range or low-mid 3.0 range.\nTechnically, K-12 teaches you to a formatted version of liberal arts requirements that you\u2019re spoon-fed by teachers, but in private liberal arts colleges you\u2019re not spoon-fed by teachers.\nI go to Baldwin-Wallace, a private liberal arts university, and we\u2019re required to graduate with at least a 2.0 and 124 credits, including an internship and a minor. My little brother took a year off from Kent after two years of community college first, he has something in the 3.5+ range, he\u2019s not required to have a minor, and he only needs a total of 80 credits to graduate.\nShould I just go for applying for the internship for four academic credits and take four more credits of classes online? I know that I could easily raise my GPA to at least a 2.0 if I finish off with A\u2019s and B\u2019s, and at this point, I just want to pass with the degree.",

Pretty much the college changed their transfer credits to 4yr colleges every semester so all 8 of my classes wouldn't transfer so I quit when i got a full time retail management job and was able to move out of the drug house I was living in.\n\nTried to go back 2 years ago and was told that I\nI would have to pay out of pocket for a full semester at minimum but I didn't drop my last semester 14 years prior, even though I've paid out of pocket for two classes since, both I got A's in.\n\nSo my question is, how do you decide to go back to school, should I just go to a different school?  I have learning disabilities that have never been diagnosed,  I know I am dyslexic and have concentration issues so full time school and job is not going to work for me.

I came in confused because high school was very traumatic for me, so I didn\u2019t really know/have time to think of what to major in. I came in undeclared and then switched to poli sci, then nursing, then now biology. anyway I love bio but I don\u2019t really know what to do with it after and I\u2019m not into going premed. I\u2019m so scared for my future too. I came in with zero friends and even know I don\u2019t really have friends. Only people I met and then once the semester ended we never saw each other again. I can\u2019t seem to get over guy from my past even though it\u2019s been TWO years. It\u2019s even worse now, I got really depressed this semester and as a result failed 3 finals and got two C\u2019s :/ and I lost my scholarship due to this. Applied for 6 internships and was ghosted after my interview. Every time I try to get involved, join a club, or do research It never works out. all I did was commute 45 minutes, skip class, spend hours in the library on my phone because I couldn\u2019t study, and cry in my car, just to do it all the next day. There\u2019s no excitement or motivation at all and it kind of made me feel like I was going insane. I feel like a bum who has nothing going for her. How do I get out of this mindset?

Greek life and intramural sports are big here, but I'm not involved in either of them. I can't see myself in Greek life, and I'm not very athletic lol. I'm in theater, but I'm not in the \"in\" clique where they all go party on weekends. I'm eboard of two feminist clubs but we have like 5 members. I'm also in some \"geek\" clubs and they're ok I guess.  I feel like I mostly just see the same faces. \n\nPerhaps the most pressing reason why I want to transfer is that.....well, I like girls. I want to date girls. My school's LGBT club is small,and most of them don't even like girls. There's a few bi/lesbian girls in theater but they're either not interested in me, they just want a \"makeout buddy\", etc. There's an LGBT center with a young adult group, but it's a train ride away.

I already go to a school with a small CS department so it won't be that big of a change.That said, I am taking out no loans now, and I will almost certainly have to take out loans for a Seven sisters. So it's not exactly a smart financial move, but I want to enjoy my youth! I also would feel horrible about leaving my friends behind..... Is anyone in a similar situation?",

I took 2 classes this term and took a WF in one because I was too anxious to show up to class because I was sick in the 4th or 5th week (I literally developed shingles from stress) and was nervous the arrogant professor would say something. Me being sick also didn't impede on my learning since the material could be done at home and didnt require an in person exam. So it wasn't detrimental. I missed the cutoff when I thought I could last-minute make up for the 5 quizzes and 1 test I missed. \n\nI've always done the minimum and I've been a B student forever. My GPA the previous term was a 3.2  and the spring term before that it was a 2.1 or something low since I failed CHM 102. Prior though, I transferred in with 64 credits at a 3.3 GPA so my history is strong. This term has my first and hopefully last D.\n\nI knew I'd take a hit but I planned already on making it up for the summer term.\n\nI'm technically a senior but I have about 6 more semesters to go (I transferred with a shit ton of credits from a CC in another state and even though 30 credits are useless electives I'm stuck with them) I'm a stat major with a math minor and I have a while before I'm good to graduate but I have a solid plan for every semester. \n\nI transferred last year and did well these past 2 semesters prior but failed CHM 102 because I was cocky and didnt study enough. I retook it this semester but same deal was anxious and I ended up with a D in the class. It's whatever my GPA was strong before I can pull it back up.  \n\nProblem is, with a WF and a D, my term GPA is a 0.57  BUT my overall is still a 2.25. \nSO...\nWithin those parameters I am allowed to appeal the dismissal to a committee and theyll decide if I'm let back in on probation, sit out a term, or sign some academic contract about going to SI or tutors and office hours with professors.\n\nI talked to someone in the college and she said I had a really good chance of being readmitted if I just explain why I had such a hard time. \n\nSince I only took 2 classes will it look better than having failed 4 or 5? My reason for doing so badly isn't some death in the family or accident or financial burden. \n\nI was just anxious but never sought therapy, I had a tutor for like a week but bailed because I felt stupid, I got lazy, I work 20 hrs a week but could definitely study on the job since I work at another school in the area. So it's all my idiotic fault. \n I desperately need them to re-admit me and allow me to take a summer semester since I have 2 bottle-neck courses for my major to complete so I can get momentum. \n\nDo I have a good chance of making it back in? Has anyone else been term-dismissed and pleaded a successful case? \nI'm required to write a brief letter but I don't know If they'll empathize if I have no solid reason for being such a shitbag.",

I feel like I'm abusing myself studying it; it's frustratingly difficult and fast paced. I also hate my college.

            "content": "Okay, so this is going to be long. \n\nMy brother just finished his sophomore year with a 2.55 GPA. It\u2019s this low from a combination of being irresponsible (mainly in his freshman year) and also struggling with difficult classes. (He is a biotechnology major and so takes a lot of math, chemistry, etc). He has a decent work ethic but also has some anxiety, depression, issues adjusting to new situations, really poor sleep schedule, etc, that sometimes get in the way of his academics. (And yes, he takes medication and sees a counselor for his depression and anxiety). \n\nHe has spent the last two years at a small, quiet satellite campus for a state school but with his current plan, is supposed to move down to the main school for the last two years. My mother is really concerned for him because as of now he is barely getting by, and that is at a smaller school with a local family support system and classes that were easier compared to what he will be taking his Junior and Senior years. The main school is extremely huge, a party school, in a much busier area, is three hours away, and so there would be a lot of lifestyle adjustments he\u2019d have to make on top of his harder courses.\n\nIf his GPA goes below 2.5, he will lose all his scholarship money. Furthermore, if he gets a D or F in any classes, he probably won\u2019t have enough credits to allow him to keep getting state grants. My parents are the one paying for his schooling and his apartments/dorm, so they don\u2019t want to face the financial burden of him losing scholarships and whatnot. \n\nAnd so with this situation, there\u2019s a couple outcomes that my mom has considered/thought may happen:\n\n1. My brother moves down there and his GPA goes below 2.5\n\n2. My brother moves down there and he maintains his GPA. \n\n3. My brother transfers to a local school where his D\u2019s and F\u2019s won\u2019t carry over and where he can still finish his degree. \n\n4. My brother takes time off of school to work, make money, get his act together, etc. \n\n My mother would really like to see him transfer. But my brother doesn\u2019t want to. He cites not wanting to take religion courses (the school is a private catholic school) and also a biotechnology degree from the school not being as notable as one from the school he is planning to move to. \n\nMy mom has asked my aunt for advice, who says that she can\u2019t force him to transfer and that she has to let him go where he wants. However, my parents are the one paying for his schooling and so my mom feels uncomfortable paying for that schooling down there when there is a good chance that my brother will lose the scholarships and grants. \n\nMy mom also constantly asks me for advice, and I tell her that based on his past performances and demonstrations of responsibility, I don\u2019t think he will be able to keep up his GPA. However, I also keep telling her that I\u2019m only his sister and not the most qualified person to advise her on this. I repeatedly tell her that she should find some kind of neutral third party that she could discuss my brother\u2019s grades, scholarship, the continuation of paying for it, etc, with. \n\nI know you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cOP, this isn\u2019t your business. You need to back off.\u201d And I know. But my mom keeps treating me as her personal counselor no matter what I tell her and aside from my aunt, she won\u2019t talk to anyone else about this situation. I\u2019m only 21 and aren\u2019t qualified to give her this advice, and even then, I don\u2019t exactly know what to do and I don\u2019t want to feel responsible for whatever decisions get made in regard to his schooling. \n\nAny advice? On any of this? This situation has put a ton of stress on my family and I just can\u2019t stand it anymore.",

I was very torn when I applied for schools between majoring in Costumes or in Comics/Storyboarding, and these questions have brought up that nagging doubt for me that I'm not in the right place.\n\nI often hear about others saying how much they love school and how good a time they're having, but most of my classes are just stressful and difficult for me. I've struggled with my mental health a lot in the school for a wide variety of reasons, and while it's a great costume school and a great education, I'm starting to get a nagging feeling that I may not love what I'm doing the way I should to be spending so much money on it.\n\nI don't want to end up regretting these four years of my life or end up in debt with a degree I don't use or want, but I'm not sure if how I feel is burnout after a long year, issues with the school and professors itself, imposter syndrome, idealization of another program or a 'grass is greener' mentality, or if I really would feel better or different if I transferred schools (my current one doesn't have any kind of comics or illustration programs) and went into comics instead.\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences who could give some advice?",

I'm going to get all my general and foreign language classes out of the way and I'm on the transfer program so all the classes match up. I have currently taken 32 credit hours and have a 3.07 :/ (first semester I got a 2.78 because I didn't really care). I have 41 credit hours at my community college remaining. To get a collateral major I will need to take 54 credit hours at the University. \n\n(School costs)\n\nAs stated before my first two years are free as I go to a community college in Tennessee. I will take about 72 hours free. I will have to take 54 credit hours at the University. \n\nSo the cost of attendance before scholarships and book costs should be $\u202d23,826 for my 54 credit hours\u202c.\n\nThe university has a transfer scholarship if you have a 3.5-3.75 they will give you $3,000 a year or if you have a 3.25-3.49 you get $1,000 annually. (One question I have is should I sacrifice some hours at work so I can improve grades to hopefully get 3.5 and above, I would need about an A in all the classes. Or should I take more hours and save that pay and sacrifice some of my GPA.)\n\nI also get $2,250 annually if I stay above a 2.75.\n\nI'm going to try and get a job at UPS before I transfer to the University because they have a $5,520 tuition reimbursement annually. (I'm going to try at the end of this upcoming fall semester and maybe even call them when I'm hoping to apply and make a good impression)\n\nSo if everything goes right it would leave me with about $1,413 annually (before book costs) from just scholarships and tuition reimbursement.\n\nI also don't qualify for any grants (My parents are divorced and I lived with my mom for the most part and she makes about $50,000)\n\n(Job and Normal Costs)\n\nI currently work at Lowe's and make $11.31 hourly I'm currently working 35-40 hours a week, but I'm hoping to transfer to a closer store to get fewer hours during the school year (still over 3 months away), but it might take a little away from my pay. I have about $1,200 in savings and my next paycheck (next Thursday) should be $700-750.\n\nI live with my sister and pay $200 in rent. My mom and dad both separately pay $200 (I'm very thankful), but I would not be surprised if my dad stops paying $200; because he doesn't really need to, but he is just helping me and my sister out.\n\nThe main expense I need help with is food. I'm 18 years old and 6'3-6'4 and hungry most of the day. I can spend upwards of like $400 on food monthly (just from making dumb food choices: eating a lot of fast food as the only meal of the day.) I've started to just eat a Clif bar and maybe a bag of chips to be able to save more money but sacrificing nutrients.\n\nI am also actively looking for another job over the summer so I can save more money.\n\n(Questions)  \nMy main question is there anything you see that I should do differently or that would help to graduate debt free or that would overall help?",

My time in school diminished, until the last semester (spring 2018) I was only taking one math class and I dropped out when I was evicted from my home.\n\nFast forward to spring 2019: I just finished my first semester, full-time enrollment, at a university 4 hours away from my family. My grades are A+(3 classes), A- and B+. Raised my GPA from a 3.31 to a 3.76. There have been times this semester where I had breakdowns, I lost two really good friends, and I thought I would have to go back to the hospital a few times. But I made it through! And I'm really proud of myself.\n\nIf I can do this, you guys can too. I was deathly afraid of attending a university and getting into tons of debt, especially if I had a nervous breakdown and ended up dropping out before graduating, thus having a ton of debt and no way to pay it off.

            "content": "Any help is welcome I know the letter is long \n\n\"Dear Committee on Academic Reinstatement\n\nI am writing to appeal my academic dismissal from the University of North Carolina as of the end of this term. I realize I have fallen below the required 1.00 term GPA, \u00a0but I do hope to be strongly considered for readmission. My term GPA for Spring 2019 was 0.571 while my overall GPA is 2.531.\n\nThis past semester has been the most difficult I have been through and this ultimately reflected in my poor academic progress with both of my classes. Unfortunately I did not put in the effort needed for the material in class, and my attendance was poor due to not balancing my work and study schedule correctly, and allowing personal matters to cloud my judgement. I know now I should not have been apprehensive about attending classes and exams either, as my professors would have been willing to provide options for me to strengthen my understanding of the material. I felt quite embarrassed to be struggling which snowballed into my situation I currently am in, because I did not want to admit I needed help. The stress of my situation eventually caused me to develop shingles and I was in pain for 3 weeks, even during recovery. After I was able to start studying again, I attempted to seek out private tutors for both classes but the financial strain was too much and I became discouraged in my own ability to catch up properly. My inability to create momentum is entirely my fault, and this caused me to settle for poor grades.\n\nAt home, my situation was not ideal, as I only live with my little brother and I had the responsibility of maintaining the home and ensuring there is food on the table. Upon talking with him I was able to work out a plan that divided the workload between us, and it has been such a relief since. As for my work schedule, I spoke to my employer and fortunately they are flexible and will allow me to prioritize school, and have given me permission to study while at work during downtime to maximize my time. I know now I can adapt more swiftly when times get rough and I feel I am carrying the weight of the world.\n\nDuring the semester, I found a degree path and career I am finally excited to pursue. I realized Chemistry was not the right major for me. I changed my major from Chemistry to Statistics with a minor in Math and an Actuarial Science Certificate, and I feel as if I finally am working toward a future for myself. I am as determined as ever to finally earn the bachelor's degree I have worked toward for so long. Before my decision to Withdraw failing from my class, I did make plans to retake MAT 112 in the summer and start off on the right foot with the help of the Math Lab one-on-one appointments weekly to assess and strengthen my weaknesses throughout the semester. I will follow through with this if I am granted my appeal. \n\nAs shown in my academic history I have been very successful in keeping my grades high. I was able to transfer with the maximum of 64 credits at a combined 3.2 GPA. My previous semester GPA of this academic year was also strong, at a 3.15 I know I am capable of doing very well, but in a very out-of character manner I allowed myself to lose hope in improving too quickly. I am now motivated to earn my Bachelors in Statistics and graduate on track to begin work as an Actuary. This is my first time in 93 credits that I have been in any less than good academic standing, and I know my plan for my academic future will make this the last.\n\nGoing into the Summer II semester, I have a plan to attend the Math Lab 2x weekly, once for a weekly one-on-one appointment with a tutor, and another visit to work on material more independently but with close guidance as a drop-in student. I will adopt this practice for MAT 112, 161, 162, and 261. As for my major specific Statistics courses, I will be allotting 2 hours per week to attend office hours with all of my professors to review the syllabus and formulate specific study plans to build upon, creating a habit I will not break. I also will be meeting with my academic advisor bi-weekly in order to keep track of my progress in the program. This summer I am enrolled in the first Statistics course, STT 215, of my career which will allow me to branch out into different classes in the coming Fall and Spring. Since finding a career I can work towards with the help of my advisor, I know I cannot afford to become lazy or discouraged because the only person that is affected by my academic performance is myself. \"",

For now, I'm looking to go into Actuarial Sciences; my dad is telling me to go to Purdue University Fort Wayne. My two brothers, who have graduated recently, are telling me to go to UCM (University of Central Missouri) because it's cheaper, local, and I can get a $1000 yearly scholarship with  my high school GPA/ACT (the requirements are pretty darn easy for me to meet that scholarship).\n\nMy dad's reason for going to Purdue is because it's a bigger name and a much more well known university. He's telling me that, even though Purdue costs more, it'll be more worth it in the long run because I'll get paid more for going to Purdue than if I were to go to UCM (since UCM isn't nearly as well known). My two brothers, though, are telling me that going to a \"better\" school is not going to get me a salary boost since I'd be taking the same classes and I'd be getting the same degree, but just at a different/cheaper school.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I need some more insight/advice as to how much going to a \"better\" school matters.

            "content": "So for a little background, I'm in the middle of my junior year (I'm a semester ahead thankfully), and last semester, I got offered a work study position by a former professor of mine. He let me know during winter break that he was interested in giving me a job as a multimedia journalist for our university's College of Visual and Performing Arts. My concentration is journalism and my minor is studio art, so I thought it would be perfect. Plus, it sounded like a good resume builder as well, and it was a little extra money on the side.\n\nIt was a cool gig at first, I went to various events that the college was holding, and I learned a lot about production and how to properly talk to people, but after a while, it got tedious. This last semester was really rough for a number of reasons, I was struggling in a couple of my classes, I was dealing with some health issues, and I also had some personal issues in my love life and home life on top of it all. There were numerous occasions where I was asked to cover an event, but I had to decline or cancel because of something going on at home, doctor's appointments, or I was catching up on my school work. I even forgot to turn in the last assignment he had for me, to which he left me a strong email demanding to know where my work was.\n\nI tried to explain myself, but I don't think it was enough. Today I got a very impersonal email from him saying that I was being let go from the work study program and that I wasn't working next semester. I don't think that I would have returned to the program even if I was offered back, since it got too stressful by the end of it. The hours were sparse and I got paid minimum wage, and my bi-weekly paychecks always pulled in under $100. However, that being said, I'm still concerned about what to do. I don't know if I should email him back and try to explain myself again, if I should put this work study down on my resume, or if I should put the work I had done for him in my portfolio. I don't know anything.\n\nIf anyone has any experience with this or advice, I'd greatly appreciate it.",

            "content": "Hello, I just finished my second year of college at a good school. I enjoy my classes, activities, the community there and my particular friend group.\n\nGrowing up, I lived with my parents but life was really hard. I've basically been homeless since I was 16 so when I got to college I was really happy. I was sleeping inside, didnt have to worry about my computer getting wet or not being able to charge my phone because I lived inside, and there was unlimited food at the dining hall. Life was perfect. I loved college.\n\nThis past year being a college student has lost its appeal. Returning from college where students are irresponsible, rude, and little is expected of us, I feel much more like a \"full adult\" at my full time job. People even say that I look 22-26 years old, acting more mature than that, even though I am 19. I feel older than a lot of people at college and that I have many more skills than the typical college student that it makes it hard to enjoy being at college. Does anyone have this experience?\n\nWhen I am not on campus, I work a grocery store. The owner is pushing me to become an operator of a store. I'm trained in everything, have keys to the store, and am a dependable, hard working employee. It's just been two days at the store since I got back from school (I work other jobs when I am on campus and at the store only when I am in my hometown about 5 mths per year), so maybe I am speaking too soon, but I feel so much more connected to the people at the store and they see me as an adult instead of a college student. My close friends at the store are grandparents and I've always felt like I'm at the same place in life as they are, worrying about keeping heat in the house/shelter and food on the table where as college kids are so often rich, pampered, and useless.",

            "content": "Howdy Partners,\n\n\nSorry if the title seems like I'm bragging, I didnt mean for that I just thought it might bring some attention. Also, sorry for such a long post.\n\n\nI was looking for some advice on an upcoming decision of mine. I'm 16 and go to college, and I'm also finishing up my honors highschool degree too. Long story short I got into college when I was 14 and decided to finish up my highschool degree while in college to shave off some time and money that I would have to spend on school.\n\n\nPretty soon I have to make a decision about my path to medicine. I have two options that have both benefits and drawbacks, so I'll start with the riskier one.\n\n\nTo get to med school, I could take a more traditional route. I can finish my last 2 years of undergrad, pull hairs the last year while studying for the mcat, hopefully get a good score and have enough time to beef up other areas of my application, and get into med school.\n\n\nMy other option is a little safer. I can apply to a BS/MD program (because technically I'm still a junior in highschool) hopefully get in, but the program would force me to finish undergrad in at least 3 years. It is just a rule of theirs that is in place because they have their students do various things over the summers (like shadowing and whatnot), and take various classes like ones that are designed to help with the mcat. If I get a good score on the mcat (508 if I remember correctly, which is very doable) then I am immediately accepted into their med school and can earn my MD.\n\n\nThe benefits of the riskier route is that I can graduate from undergrad when I am 18, and get into med school rather quickly. Less money spent on college and more I can save. This means I can be a doctor (hopefully a surgeon) earlier in my life, pay off those pesky student loans earlier, and be able to enjoy my life a little longer. The drawbacks are extreme stress on me during the next two years of my life, no guarantee of a good mcat or the ability to be able to study well for it, and a possibility of my application being terrible, which I would end up spending another year trying to beef it up anyways.\n\n\nThe benefits of the safer route is a guaranteed spot in med school as long as I meet that minimum mcat score, the ability to explore medicine in undergrad with their various extra courses and summer programs, a beefier application (even though I wouldn't need it for the entry to medical school) and possibly a better understanding of the world of medicine. The drawbacks are that I will be taking an extra year to complete undergrad, something that matters quite a lot to me.\n\n\nAlso, for those wondering, I currently attend The Universiry of Nevada, Reno, and the Med school that I speak of is the University of Nevada Reno Med School.\n\n\nAny thoughts, tips, or pointers? All are greatly appreciated. :)",

I\u2019m just worried about getting super homesick.\n2) For those of you who have relocated for internships, what should I take? They\u2019ll be (partially) subsidizing housing for all out-of-state interns, and the apartments are fully furnished. I still want to be thoughtful about what I\u2019ll actually need to take v.s. what I want to take.

I don't have anything against CC's per se, but mine is the worst possible place I could be (hint, my computer science professor struggle to speaks English. Not his fault, but little issues like this make the education process gruesomely painful). I'm struggling to make it into a university due to my financial aid limits. Most grants provided by my FAFSA are max, as my family typically reports zero income due to my dads struggle with pancreatic cancer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy direct loans plus my grants aren't high enough to cover the cost of attendance, food, housing, etc. They will only cover a small part of all that. A big portion of my given loans is the parent plus loan, which my parents will not apply for. I understand, it's really a lot of money and it accumulates interest at a frightening rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScholarships are an issue for me as well. I spent much of my high school career in a couple of schools that didn't offer an opportunities to pick up anything that could be used to help apply for one, and I missed much of my last school year as my family was more or less homeless (forced to live in a small mold filled travel trailer). I have tried multiple times to apply for scholarships that fit me, LGBT scholarships, high functioning Autism spectrum disorder, GPA based scholarships for my time spent in community college (presidents list all but one term). So far however I've came up with scratch, as I do not have any time spent volunteering. I also have never participated in any group based activities such as sports (only a chess club in my junior year at one of the high schools I went to) do to my extreme discomfort in social situations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you guys do it? I see a lot of people transferring next year to some really expensive universities, and I can't find a way to go to the cheapest in the state. I live in a community without many career options that allow me to avoid physical labor, and I have no desire to drop out of college just to pick up a second rate job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you.",

I'm pretty sure I won't make it back into a quality 4 year school with my academic history, so I'm looking to enroll in a local community College and eventually transfer into and graduate from a four year university. Like everyone in 2019 I'm looking to do computer science lmao, but before I get off topic let me give just a little background:\n\nI was an early high school graduate (16) with very high standardized metrics (35 ACT, 234 PSAT - no SAT) but mediocre to very poor grades (senior year in particular was super rough. bad home life.). Entirely on the back of my test scores and a couple cool extracurriculars, I secured a spot at a respected state school for engineering (not New York, didn't used to live here) and joined their Chemistry program with a really solid amount of financial support and 33 credit hours of course exemptions from the AP program. Mental health issues and some serious family stuff got worse really quickly, and after an awful first fall semester (1 F, 2 D's, and a lone A) I withdrew from my spring semester and moved back home. Understandably, this makes me a pretty unattractive candidate, and my school declined to accept me for return the following spring after a semester of a local community College (2 A's and 1 B). That was in 2015 though, and now it's four years later and I've finally gotten into a position where I can go back to school and am genuinely really eager to do so, but I... Have no idea how to go about it. Like, at all. I'm really hoping you guys can offer advice or point to some resources, because I feel super lost.\n\nHow do I make a plan for this? How do I identify quality community colleges? What kind of four year institutions can I expect to get into after a few years at community College with my weird academic record? Will I retain my AP credits? Can I transfer credits from my first community College into one I attend this fall, and then a four year school after that? \n\nI'm sorry if it feels like I'm asking some dumb and basic questions, but this wasn't ever a path I expected to be taking to a four year school, and even now the opportunity has kind of just been dropped in my lap all of a sudden.

I was also going to transfer before the spring semester began, but I for some reason just never finished the paperwork. I had a lot of anxiety about leaving and I juet kinda freaked out and stayed. \n\nWhy I want to transfer: the atmosphere here isn't good. Almost everyone has mental illness, we had 5 suicides in 3 years, and it isn't a good situation for me to be in personally. I had to take a semester off. The offices are hard to get in contact with and the processes for dealing with financial aid, registrar, etc are very draining and the people that work there are generally rude, and that's a consensus from everyone I know not just me. The classes are harder than they should be, and I know for sure because people that have transferred agree that the classes here are too unreasonably hard. It's hard to get straight answers from anybody and there aren't enough professors for students, so as a psych major I almost didn't even get to register for any psych classes for next semester. The weather is dreary and I don't like the town, but those aren't really super important. \n\nWhy I'm scared to transfer: Cost is a big one. A really big one. Also, time it will take to finish my undergrad. I want to (endgoal) be a doctor, so adding too many years to undergrad is daunting. Friends, I just joined a coed fraternity last semester and I have just now started making friends out of it and out of other areas on campus and if I lwave I would have to start all over. I'm in a lease starting in July that I would need to get out of, and then figure out a place to live at the new school (dorms are too expensive). I wouldn't have a job, but I have 2 here.\n\nI really don't know what to do. I'm so unhappy but the reasons to stay feel like they're too much. I keep getting told that it's a \"sunken cost fallacy\" and I shouldn't put too much weight on how much I've put in here and I shouldn't feel stuck and it's okay to transfer, but I do feel stuck. I just don't know what to do. I'm first-gen so my parents have no clue how to help either.",

            "content": "I'm a senior at a very highly ranked art and design school. I have completed the requirements for my major and I'm now fully qualified (excessively qualified) to enter the professional world in my area of focus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever... I have not completed all of the liberal arts requirements that the school insists that we cover during our time here. These are basically \"normal\" college classes such as lectures and seminars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not graduating due to these overhanging credits. Initially, my course plan was thrown off balance by my beginning, and then dropping a double major, which I spent a year in. This typically has you on a 5-year graduation plan. As I only spent a year, I actually managed to cover all of my extra studio credits... but not my liberal arts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour senior year is dedicated to your thesis. Especially in my major. In fact, this is pretty much the most important project that you will do in this school (***especially within my major***). In fact, your thesis year is SO crucial, within my major, that they advise EVERYONE to petition for an exception to the academic policy and request permission to only take 9 credits as it can be an extreme hindrance to combine the thesis studio course with... literally anything else. In fact, the thesis studio is worth 9 course credits, when a normal class or any other studio is only worth 3... the only reason it isn't worth 12 credits is because that would be them *admitting* that you should spend ALL of your time on this work and *only* this work... but you should.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in short, I'm behind on this liberal credits due to this double major that I briefly tried to pursue. I am also behind because I WAS JUST DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD. It explains EVERYTHING that I have struggled with in my life and it's such a damn shame that this was figured out so late. Partly due to the fact that I'm a female and we don't bounce off the walls as many of the male variety do. Unfortunately, I was also only diagnosed this semester, so I was not only behind on my liberal arts *credits* but I was also behind on my actual thesis *project* which spans the entirety of the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wound up enrolling in one liberal arts course about poetry which seemed doable, but midway through the semester, **it. was. not. doable.** I was about to fail my thesis (and subsequently either ruin my future career or future finances having to retake it). I SIMPLY COULD NOT SPEND MY TIME ON POETRY OVER THIS WORK. This was about the time that I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on medication.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spoke with my liberal arts professor, and she was familiar with the heavy workload that my major involves. We kind of spoke about my not aiming for a high grade but simply to pass, which is all that I really needed. It got to the point where I was just going to have to submit the rest of the work after my thesis deadline... which would have happened had I not found out that my mother has cancer, immediately after my show. ***\\*\\*\\*FULL DISCLAIMER- My mother is OK and will be OK! Thankfully this is a cancer that only has to be watched and will not require any kind of intervention for possibly years, but this was not apparent to me, or my family and I was depressed for a solid week after turning my thesis in... also due to absolute and pure exhaustion\\*\\*\\****\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically, **I was unable to even submit the work late.** I emailed her and explained the whole situation, she has basically refused to accept any of my work late. She will not be offering me an incomplete. All I need is a GRADE. I just need the credit. I don't care what that grade SAYS. Apparently, I have missed more than half of the classes (which I actually don't think is true and SOMETHING has to have been mismarked). I have also failed to turn in most of the work, which is true, but she did acknowledge that the work that I DID turn in was phenomenal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do I even do at this point? I am SO exasperated. I am 23. I have completed all of the work in my major. I have had jobs. I have had internships with high profile companies. I am also set to leave the country to kind of just go ahead and start my life even though I am not leaving with a degree at this moment. Fortunately, you don't really need a degree in my field. I will also be getting my degree later, probably by next spring, through taking online courses and submitting the credits as transfer credits. However, **this one class is what is screwing me over, financially, and academically. I am already taking a leave of absence, petitioning to take an extra course online as they typically only allow 4 and I need FIVE. Financially, that is already difficult for me, professionally, I can NOT have the reason that I can't move on from college to my adult life be a** ***poetry class.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am *exhausted.* I don't want to come back to this. If anything I need a MASSIVE break from academia or *some* kind of exception. To offer further perspective, this school requires that students take 6 *more* classes than *any* Ivy League school, they are looking to reduce this number within the next 5 years. I am not being dramatic about how much work we are required to do... and how much money we are required to spend... especially if we fuck up... even if we were trying not to.",

Thank you all so much. I'm dealing with my issues, but I know I'm intelligent and driven and it's just a matter of figuring out the practicals.\n\nI'm a 29 year old guy, single, living in DFW. Never married, no kids, no criminal record, a little medical debt but nothing insane. One cat. \nI received my GED in 2008 and have been in the IT field since then. It's not bad, and I'm now making 50k a year in sales and project management without a degree. The degree of freedom to work at my own pace is vital. I alternate between week long bursts of energy and day long lethargy on occasion.\n\nI was regularly expelled from schools as my parents refused to address my behavioral issues. 3 elementary schools, 2 middle schools, 2 high schools, on and off homeschooling that amounted to nothing as my parents had no business raising a child. I devoured as much info as I could find but my support was spotty at best.\n\nI now know I have severe ADD and an anxiety disorder. \nI was never treated for this or given any type of assistance in school.\n\nI dropped out of high school, got my GED, and only last year when I received my diagnosis have things started to get easier. I want to get back into school to do something I love rather than just scraping by. Thanks(?) to my disorders I have very few obligations or long term commitments in my life, and I've always had a raging love of the sciences, soil systems specifically, and advancing human understanding in general. \n\nI want to go into agricultural microbial engineering to help as best I can with the coming climate change crisis and global food production.\nI face no urgent pressure to make big money with any degree I would earn, and am intent on pursuing a masters level understanding of my chosen field. \n\nAfter some local campus visits and getting my FAFSA information up to date I am faced with the question of picking my actual school while I prepare myself for an SAT/ACT test to get on file.\n\nI do not think I want to try community college again unless it makes a ton of sense with my aligned major to save a large amount of money, so I'm looking at various 4 year options to start with. It feels halfway to me.\n\nQuestions below, I'm very sorry if these are things I should know by now. None of my family has gone to school and I have few people I can turn to about this kind of thing.\n\n1. My campus visits in the area have shown me that these things are vastly aimed at traditional students coming out of high school. On campus amenities, recreations, and social programs are not of interest to me. Sports programs, on campus living, \"the college experience\", all of these things are noise to myself and if anything seem very unpleasant to someone like me. Are there types of schools that focus on the academics, keeping a bare bones approach to the fluff?\n\n2. At the risk of sounding pessimistic, I know that most people will not go to the same lengths and efforts for you as you would yourself. When it comes to student loans and financial aid beyond grants, how trust worthy are most admissions counselors? Are there independent financial advisers who have no vested interest beyond my own goals? \nIt seems like a conflict of interest that the people at the schools assisting in very serious matters of debt are benefiting their school if you take out bigger loans, yes?\n\n3. Is there a central repository or database for scholarships and requirements? Is each specific to each school?\n\n4. If I want to pursue a masters, should I expect that I will have to quit my job a certain amount of years into the program, do I have to move onto a campus? Do loans cover cost of living or just tuition?\n\n5. Picking a school, I'm unsure where to begin. Is there a central database of all majors offered by all schools in each state?\n\n6. What are my realistic chances of being accepted given my age and lack of academic history? I realize I'll have much remedial work and have already started on re-learning everything up to a highschool level that I may be rusty on.\n\n\nI want this to work. I just feel unsure about a few things and it's keeping me from diving right in for fear of starting off on the wrong foot. If anyone wants to answer a question or 2 I'd be extremely grateful. I'm sure there are questions I don't even know that i should be asking.\n\nThank you all so much.",

Most who I talk to now are college aged kids and they're great but sometimes I remember the gap between me and them in age, and the distance that does sorta bring along, and I know that most people my age already have careers started and my dumbass is struggling to make things happen. I have been told countless times that everyone has their own pace, but I have always been regarded as the slow one, the weird one, and my stumbling as an adult. It all jusdt makes me feel lonely. These college kids grew up with like, Justin Bieber, and Tangeled, and One Direction, I grew up with NSYNC, Toy Story, and Jesse McCartney. Gosh I just feel like the guy from the anime ReLife at this point lol I wanna feel excited for my opportunities but blehh, I just feel so alone.\n\nThank you for any advice you can give.\n\nAny advice is appreciated",

I don't understand why FAFSA only takes into account how much your income is, instead of taking your debts into consideration as well. If I wait to go to school, I would have to be 25 in December of the enrollment year so I'd have to wait two more years for FAFSA to cover half the cost. Is there any way to get aid or grants, really any help so I wouldn't be in a pit of debt? At this point, I don't understand how people go to college unless they qualify for tons of aid, or their parents pay their tuition for them.",

I used all the excuses but mostly the fact that I work full time. It\u2019s really difficult finding time for school when I work full time. I ended up switching up my work schedule so that I work very early in the morning (5am-1pm) and that seemed to help. The next semester after that I did a lot better, a couple Bs and still some Cs. \n\nWell this semester I passed all of my classes with all As and one B and I\u2019m very proud of myself for doing that.

I am nobody to judge but I'm not going to hold back this time because I think this needs to be said about the world we live in. I am not saying that what he did is criminal, unforgivable, Thanos-level shit. Just that a brilliant guy like him is not too reflective of himself before he goes on to do it. Now I'll also give him the benefit of the doubt because he is human after all and I tend to look at a person rather intently when talking to them, so I may have led him to believe that he could open up to me but his pettiness was reflected in his description for the role of a business developer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought the vision he had for his project was great but that's the convocation speaker and class president of one of the best colleges in the world who's worked at all of the best places. Why he feels the need to be so petty is beyond me. Maybe I'm an escapist who has cut herself off from the world for a really long time now but it has really given me time to reflect. And I have come to the conclusion that we all give in to toxicity too quick. Even as we are working towards our goals, our fucking need to be the best among everyone really fucks up any good we are trying to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe did not give me the role I had originally applied for and told me I did not have the experience for it, WHICH I AGREE WITH. But he offered to give me this role on the marketing side cuz he thought I was a good communicator. I'll say this. Yes, I like to express myself a lot. But just as I was beginning to think he might make a good mentor he went on to ask me what high school I went to and what college I go to and I told him Mand I respectively. As he went on talking further about the role he was interested in offering me, he said \"you will have to convince ppl to join our program and you'll be talking to parents of schools like M, so you'll be taking to people of \"that\" level\".\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHold up, dear.

How offensive and rude is that. \"That\" level? Is that what someone who went to the best college in the world says? Really shows what you learned at that top business firm. Good job, motherfuckers. Apparently in the world we live in today, it's okay for people at the top to say something like that. Has being on top and working on a project that teaches young kids how to write code taught you nothing about using your privilege to be more humble and a better person in general? Cuz everything begins with thoughts. And even if you are thinking it, at least don't give it more power by actually saying it. Don't make everything about work and business for heaven's sake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur world is not lacking brilliant people, but it is definitely lacking thoughtfulness in many of them. I go to a good school and have worked hard for it, for sure but I have also learned that it is really, really, really fucking toxic to compete and see other people compete. It is like being no better than that bitch in high school who thinks she is the hottest shit on this planet. You really aren't any different.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am no purer than anyone and hell, just writing all of this is making me sick to the stomach but I have learned after having spent a considerable amount of time away from all of the competition and observing people from the outside that wanting the best things from life, the best internships, the best careers can sometimes really, really blind you from recognizing and honoring all of the good work you have been doing to get there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStrive to make a living with all of the love and kindness in the world!

Don't let it get you caught up in the vicious cycle of competition, hate, jealousy and more misery. Thank you, next. I deal with problems by keeping the source at bay and that may not work for everyone but the world is full of bullshit and you don't fucking need any of it in your life. For people who relate, let's try to find substance that makes us humbler and more wholesome as a person. We all need to learn to make a habit of it to deeply ingrain humility in our hearts and souls. We have to let go of our pettiness and be free. We have to learn to be free for once, you know. We have to learn to be free.",

The school is also planning on paying for an entire 4 year tuition for me. I essentially get free college and I get to go into my major that I want to at the school I've been trying to get into for years and I'm absolutely zero percent excited about it. I know that seems selfish and spoiled too and I hate that, because I do take education seriously and I really \\*really\\* want to be happy about it.\n\nI had a really bad bout of depression a couple years ago and I dropped one of my semesters because of it. Ever since then I've just been going through the motions of each semester. I used to aim for straight A's and would genuinely be upset over a B. Now I don't care. Maybe something else important to mention is the fact college is the only real school experience I've had. I was \"homeschooled\" most of my life besides a brief bout in kindergarten and 2nd grade. By \"homeschooled\" I mean that I essentially did nothing at all and spent most of my days bleakly. When I was 17 I got my HSED (High School Equivalency Diploma) and got mostly high honors. Then I tossed myself into college through FAFSA. I tossed myself so hard into college that I'm actually nearly done with my bachelor's degree as I purposefully held off one class needed to get my associate's so I could continue to use FAFSA for an extra couple semesters at the advice of my advisor. Depression and anxiety are really big factors in my life, but this is the first time I'm seeing it consistently through my education and I'd really just like some advice on what others in a similar situation have maybe done?

Failing both of these courses suspends me from applying to my #1 school of choice for 5 years. It's not the end of the world because there are other schools in the area but this would have been the most convenient as I could commute from home and it is significantly cheaper compared to other schools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advisor told me to submit an appeal form to turn these F's into W's but I will need to have some type of extenuating circumstance to get approved. Last semester, I did really well in my courses (I took 14 hours and made the Dean's List) and this year, it was just hard and I have no idea why. I started a new job, I had an inconsistent sleep schedule that lasted all semester, I lost my appetite and lost a lot of weight, I had no energy for exercise and studying, it seemed like I was chronically late to every event in my life. I would have an entire agenda of things to tackle for the day but all I wanted to do was lie in bed and sleep. My sleep was so out of whack. I felt like the way I was sleeping was self-sabatoging. My sleeping habits seemed to negatively impact my life all around. I can easily sleep 12 hours straight for consecutive days in row-- this has been an issue for years. When I was younger, I was suicidal/depressed but I overcame it (or so I think I did.)\n\nI visited my PCP to talk about my sleeping habits and if there was something underlying causing my insomnia/hypersomnia. WHY is it so hard for me to fall asleep and once I fall asleep, it is normal to knock out for at least 10 hours straight? We had lab work done and she said my lab work was fine and it could be related to anxiety/depression/stress. I have never been clinically diagnosed for depression so I was in denial that my sleeping habits were related to depression (because I overcame it) but upon researching, I figure I could be depressed? I'm not \"sad\" anymore-- its more like I will have an agenda of things to do and I don't want to leave my bed. Half of the week I'm fine and the other half, I want to sleep in bed all day because I feel so fatigue. I'm always exhausted waking up no matter if I get 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 hours of sleep-- I'm ALWAYS tired waking up and I just want to lay in bed for hours. I'll eat once a day and I'll stop exercising. I'll stay in bed until the sun comes down. Then I'll be extremely disappointed because I could have spent all that time lounging by doing something productive like working towards my goals. I'm not sure if this is just a cycle from being depressed, or if I'm having swings or depression or swings of laziness or if I just have terrible habits. It just seems like normal people wake up refreshed and have the energy to tackle their day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy PCP suspected depression. I told her everything that I'm writing. I \\*don't know\\* if I am depressed. She prescribed me medication for 3 weeks to improve my sleep quality and if this doesn't improve, she will prescribe me medication for depression. I told this to my advisor and she said to mention everything in the appeals form and any documentation I can add.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to contact my PCP to provide her medical opinions to the committee board but I'm wondering if it is necessary to visit a therapist to determine if I am depressed or not? I'm wondering what can I even write to the committees board in my appeals form? \"My PCP suspects I had undiagnosed depression as an underlying cause of sleep disorder but I also have normal lab work\" doesn't sound like much of an extenuating circumstance. I really want to get into the program at this school but I'm not sure if I should just cut my losses with this school and focus on other schools at this point.",

I started at community college in 2012 and \nthen transferred to University in 2014. During my years of Uni I was put on academic probation, appealed it successfully, but then next year I was on academic suspension, unsuccessfully lost that appeal and I've been out of school for about a year. Went back to school failed that semester and now have been academically dismissed.\n\nNow I didn't get on academically dismissed for no reason. During my first year I had a rough time because my father suddenly got extremely sick and I was trying to balance school and driving back home to take care of him. (Also this has been the farthest I've been away from home, by myself and I was trying to adjust.) I didn't really need to drive back home because my grandma was taking care of him, but I personally had to go down there and make sure that he was going to be okay and give my grandmother a break from time to time. So I spent more time on the road ( 4 hour drive to and from) than I did studying for my classes and that cause and effect earned me my academic probation.\n\nNow as for me getting on academic suspension, well sadly after a hard-fought battle my father finally passed away, it was a tough time for me and everyone around me and it caused a lot of stress, grief and strife. (Personal and Financial, I was forced to get a job that had difficulty balancing school and work) That being said it him passing away happened around my finals week and I failed 4/5 finals. ( One teacher allowed me to do extended finals while my other teachers just straight-up failed me) and I got academic suspension. \n\nNow the school offered me a lot of resources and had a lot of people talking to me and how to deal with this and how to move on with school etc.. well a lot of it they didn't hold up and options I did take didn't work out for me well. ( such as therapy or changing my major or changing schools.)\n\nI guess I basically what to ask for advice is what should be the next step for me? I don't want to stop learning or going to school, I love learning and my language major, but I can no longer go to the university as I have been academically dismissed. I've been thinking about transferring my credits back over to my old community college then probably get my associate's degree and then try to get accepted to another four year college so I can still earn my bachelor's degree. I also want to point out at the time of being dismissed I had 92 credits out of the 120  I needed to earn my degree, so I was almost done.\n\n**Edit: I also wanted to point out that the highest GPA I had was a 3.2 and the lowest I had was a 1.9.\n\n***TL:DR I've been academically dismissed from my current University but I still want to earn a degree in my target language major what steps should I take to continue my education?***",

I also really enjoy learning (not school necessarily). I dropped out of high school (out of necessity) when I was 16, even though I was on track to graduate a year before the rest of my class.

I have about $25k in student loan currently, plus like $1500 on a credit card which I'll get to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter getting my GED, I filed my FAFSA and \"applied\" to my local CC extremely only on in the process. Like months before any deadlines. I visited the financial aid office multiple times in person to inquire about the status of my financial aid, and was always told my file was complete and I just had to wait. Then I get an email, literally two weeks before classes are supposed to start, that they need more documentation from me (which I have to request to be mailed to me from another state) and won't hold my classes. So I have to wait until next quarter to start classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's the end of my third year in college and it seems like shit like this happens every quarter. Last quarter, I had to appeal financial aid because I was over credits (since I didn't finish high school, I had to take remedial courses which counted toward my credit cap but didn't satisfy anything but prereqs). I'm doing lower level coursework to satisfy degree requirements at state universities, so that I will be in junior standing when I transfer. My community college does not have an associate's degree pathway that is anywhere close to what ALL of the in-state universities want students in my major to take as freshmen and sophomores. So they denied my appeal (even though I had multiple faculty support my appeal), because according to them I only needed the biology class I was registered for, not the other ones, and I needed to take a whole bunch of classes that literally won't transfer to university to satisfy their degree requirements that have nothing to do with my major. So I had to pay my tuition out of pocket this quarter, which I didn't have, so I put it on my credit card, because they cut my financial aid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, it seems like stuff like this happens literally every quarter - some additional requirement I have to meet to maintain eligibility to go to school. Like there's ALWAYS some issue that requires weeks to resolve, even though I'm a responsible student and do all my paperwork early, have all my documentation, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm supposed to transfer to university this fall. Well, one school, which is very expensive as an OOS, decided that per my application, I'm classified as a non-resident. I have lived in this state for the past 6 years, and I meet literally every requirement listed on their website to claim residency. All of my other schools have been in this state, and they've all classified me as in-state. So I emailed the school (I'm not in the same city currently or I would go in person), and I'm told that I can't petition my residency classification until the end of July, and that they won't start reviewing petitions until late August, with a deadline of late October. School starts in September. So I'm supposed to move to an expensive city, and do what, exactly? Attend fall quarter, be on the hook for OOS tuition if I don't have the necessary documentation (since I'm 24 and NOT 25, they want documentation from my parents that I'm an independent student, the same parents I haven't seen or spoken to in like 8 years, don't know how to contact, and don't want in my life) or you deny my petition? Defer enrollment and just wait until you sort it out? In either scenario, hoping I don't have to just pack up and move after fall quarter to go to a different school that I can afford because they recognize my residency status? Requiring me to also defer enrollment there or reapply, which with application deadlines could SIGNIFICANTLY delay progress on my degree. Financially, if I went anyway and they decided not to recognize my residency status, I would be on the hook for like $10k that I don't have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other school (did I mention it's in a different city?) has a bunch of weird general education requirements, which community colleges don't offer equivalents of. So, automatically, I have to take several quarters worth of additional electives in addition to the other lower levels not offered at my community college, and all my upper divisionals for my major. Well, in addition to that, they decided that of all the 20+ humanities credits I already have, that only 5 of those satisfy their requirement because...reasons, I guess. So there's another entire quarter of school added, in addition to what extra was already created for me. Oh, and now I would have all these credits going toward my credit cap for financial aid, but not satisfying any requirements! Hmm. Familiar. So I'm at risk of having my financial aid cut again if I go to this school, in which case I will really not be able to complete my degree. Oh, that's if it doesn't delay my degree by such a significant amount that I just time out of financial aid eligibility in the first place since I've already been getting it for three years. BTW, I PLANNED my courses! I was paying attention and looking at state university requirements. This is a blindside. They told me I should get my associate's because then my gen ed requirements would automatically be satisfied but we've already been over that! So frustrating!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is just the EXTRA stuff I apparently have to deal with all the time, not even the day-to-day frustrations. I was really excited to transfer and finally get to take courses that really dive into my major. I was excited to move to a new city. Now I am full of dread, and my last quarter at community college isn't even over yet. I had to take classes last summer, so this is my first real break from school in over a year and I can't even look forward to it now. I'm in purgatory about whether I can even go to school or not, which school I'm going to, and I feel like no matter which path I take I am financially fucked. I really want to rage quit the game at this point, but then I'm stuck with $25k in loans, no degree, and no prospects. But if I keep trying, there's very serious risk that I will be even worse off financially and still with no degree to show for myself. I can't go to an OOS school because I can't afford it. I don't know what to do. I have no support network, no assistance from anybody, and yet I feel like I'm constantly handed extremely difficult obstacles in addition to the already extreme obstacles I face trying to put myself through school at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it normal to have shit go this wrong this much? I feel like the universe wants me to fail at this point, and now I'm trapped in a place where anywhere I go from here I feel like failure is guaranteed. I'm exhausted. I have no joy or optimism left. I feel like this system is doing everything it can to buck me off and I have to wonder why I'm still holding on. Has anyone else been through this much shit just trying to get a degree? I feel like this is not normal. I don't want a lot. I'm happy with a $40k a year and a job that allows me to give back to the planet. Why is the universe trying to fuck me so hard and what do I do?",

I was 20 years old at the time coming off a terrible second semester, so I was looking forward to doing something different. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mom's second cousin owned it, so basically it was a family business. I was nervous, but excited for the opportunity. Unfortunately, everything that could've gone wrong went wrong. I was overworked, getting 50-60 hours a week almost consistently. Our kitchen was too small for the amount of business we did (almost 400-500 people in one night on the weekends). We were consistently understaffed and, speaking of the staff - some of the most nasty personalities I've ever worked with. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stayed at the house of the head chef (who was actually very nice) but he had an insane wife with an intense bipolar disorder. Eventually things got so bad that I almost packed up my stuff and quit. I nearly broke. However I realized that I'd put my education in jeopardy if I did this, so I stuck through it and finished it off. Needless to say, it was the worst 2 months of my entire life. And even though it was almost 2 years ago now, it still leaves a sour taste in my mouth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's your story, good or bad?",

I don't have a lot of work experience, mostly fast-food, which I quit after 6 months about 2 years ago, and I've recently re-applied and worked for about 8 months now, but I'm considering quitting once again.\n\nI was truly happy when I got accepted over the summer, but right now I'm feeling dreadful every time I have to go to work.  I don't even work that much, I limit my shift to about 10-12 hours each week, but I feel like it's been sucking my soul dry every time, and I haven't had a lot of time for myself because I had to juggle a lot for my uni, extra-curricular activities, and volunteer work. I'm currently a general committee for 3 different clubs at uni, though I'm only partly active there (I'm mostly active at mostly 1), and I also do volunteer work a couple of hours a week. I'm also looking for an internship for my 3rd year, and I've been going to info sessions, at least I've been trying to.\n\nThe thing about my workplace is that, even though I only work meagre hours per week, most of my shifts are only for a short period of time, about 1-2 hours each shift, and it takes me about an hour to get there from home (though it's close to my uni about 15min travel). It's been hard for me to plan my time, because I'd be called in for work for most days of the week, even though I wouldn't even work that much. And sometimes I'd start late because they didn't need me yet, or be sent home early because they didn't need me anymore. The work is also a bit physically demanding, in which I have to run around serving customers.\n\nI feel like all these combined have contributed greatly to my stress, and they're mentally and physically taxing. I don't understand how someone can work 30+ hours a week while being full time in uni, and survive. And I honestly feel pathetic/weak-willed for not being able to handle just this much work-load.\n\nAlthough I'm currently dead-set on quitting, there's still a part of me that wants to stay, because of the money and how it would help make my resume look better.\n\nI'm currently living with a relative and I pay a very cheap rent and I'd only have to worry about that and my car maintenance, but I'm pretty sure I can survive with my gov allowance (I don't know if you have this in the US but in my country the gov gives you an allowance for being in education), so money is not really a problem for me.\n\nIn the end, should I quit after all?\n\nPS. There's just one good thing about my workplace. Everyone in the workplace including the manager is friendly and nice, and it has a very welcoming atmosphere. They treated me very well when I first started while teaching me how to do things in the restaurant.",

Back in 2014, I graduated with an Associates degree with plans to transfer to a CSU to get my BA in Psychology and move on to grad school and so on. At the time, I wasn't really 100% focused on a specific career but could see myself as a Clinical Psychologist or Counseling Psychologist. That said, I graduated from community college with a sub-par 2.62 GPA due to a lack of focus and discipline as a result of depression I was experiencing at the time. I felt crushed and decided to do something stupid like packing my car and moving to LA to pursue my musical aspirations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now, I work full time in the field I studied but in the administrative side of things, I'm independent, my head's in a better space, and the music thing's going but didn't pan out the way I thought, *and* my heart's not really in it anymore. These days, financial stability is far more important, and I'm not getting any younger. I'm starting to think it's time to go back to school and complete my original plan. Therein lies the problem, though: because of my GPA, the CSUs I have applied to won't accept me, understandably so. Thus, I'm lost as to what I should do. I've sought out attending a community college to retake some classes and/or other classes to boost my GPA and try transferring into a CSU in the area as a local, since I live here now, but since I got my associate's degree in a different part of the state (CA), I wouldn't be considered a local. I'd have to get an entirely new associate's degree, and *then* transfer to a CSU in order to be considered a local and boost my chances at acceptance. Another option would be private school. My workplace is partnered with National University and I'd qualify for discounted tuition, but the thought of paying so much makes me feel dreadful. I guess another option would be to move back to where I grew up and attend the CSU over there, since I got accepted there back in the day, but I heavily do not want to move back there. That's the nuclear option for me, tbh. Any thoughts? Suggestions I haven't yet mentioned?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: CA resident. I have an associates but a 2.62 GPA. I took a long break from school but want to go back so I could have a better shot at a career + greater financial stability.  Have been denied by local CSUs because of my GPA. Don't know what to do to go back to school.**",

I academically never had an issue in school, it's always been the financial issue. I pretty sure financial aid is out of the question; the second chance I got from them I wasted by just dropping out. Any beginning steps to get the ball rolling?",

            "content": "Maybe it's me overthinking things, or maybe it's me being self-aware enough to know that my current schedule is driving me insane, but I hate college and work right now. I'll start by saying that I'm 23.\n\nI just feel so unmotivated to do anything, and this same attitude/demeanor has been ongoing for the last three years. Of course, most people have to go to work and study simultaneously, but every decision I make in my education seems to be largely ineffective. \n\nFor one, I'm going for an English literature degree and decided to start taking summer courses. One of the English courses I was supposed to take didn't even have enough students (I'm going to an incredibly small, rural university in the middle of shitville nowhere), so now I'm in a position where I have to take this random science course and I fucking hate it. It's like High School all over again with the taking courses you really don't want to take.\n\n\"Oh, this elective doesn't have enough students in it. But you can always learn about the food chain again in this infomercial rendition of a science class!\"\n\nI guess part of my problem is I ended up going to community college for four years, built up a significant amount of credits (like enough to acquire a bachelors degree by next year), then had to leave the CC I was going to because I was broke in the city in which I was living on my own. Moving back in with my Mom and Dad, I decided I wanted to move out, but they live in the mountains of Colorado, so I couldn't afford to move out anywhere nearby, and most work nearby paid you in gum and not a paycheck... in other words, the pay wasn't enough to be able to move out.\n\nSo I decided the best step was to apply for a university in another town. I got accepted, filled out an apartment application, found a job in the town in less than two weeks (I work in a gas station), and I'm settled down here, but the classes I am taking have nothing to do with my major atm, at least not until the Fall. But I feel unmotivated to work on anything. I don't even really try at work, which is sad considering I work at a gas station, the laziest type of employment there is. \n\nThis just shouldn't be happening, but it has been ongoing for so long that I feel apathetic to basically everything. And yes, I've tried fixing my diet. Yes, I've tried exercising more. Yes, I've tried to expand on my hobby (music). I just hate everything right now and my demeanor keeps hitting the bottom of the Mariana Trench.\n\nI know this seems like on the surface that everything is going well. I have a job, I'm about a year away from graduating (under the most insane and arduous schedule imaginable), and I found an on-campus apartment, but I'm going mentally insane. I'd rather be writing full-time (I've been considering entering into financial writing/blogging), but with college and work, I never have the time and feel as though I should give something up in place of the other. \n\nI would also like to note that I do have credit cards and other expenses to keep up on, being a little older than most working college students. And these are things that I can never afford to pay off because I always get the brokest jobs with no promotions whatsoever. Also, since I live in an on-campus apartment, dropping my classes would mean that I have to kick myself out of the college and essentially find living elsewhere, which I could pull off, but not in my current situation. \n\nSorry if this post is a downer, but I just feel uncaring about anything anymore.",

I will have to say my college experience has been mediocre. \n\nI transferred to a private college last fall with my AA degree. I do excellent in my classes (all As in my spring semester), made a few friends, but I feel like I can always participate and socialize more in school. I struggle with being social on campus and even outside of school such as family gatherings. Some people are very social and don\u2019t mind large groups of people. Well for me that isn\u2019t the case.  I am an introvert who can tolerate only so much social interaction. As a college student I deal heavily with social anxiety. I am not a good conversationalist. \n\nA few days ago I started a cashier position at my local grocery store. I\u2019m nice and gentle to people, but I am shy. I feel that I don\u2019t interact enough with my customers. I am trying to change that. I am hoping that my job, doing exercise, and going to other events this summer will continue to increase my confidence. Recently, I was elected as a new board member of my psychology club which I am super excited about. It\u2019s going to be a huge role that I think I can fulfill. But again my problem is the social aspect. \n\nDoes any know how I feel? How did you deal with being shy?Does it just take time? I need to be able to speak confidently if I am going to be a college professor one day :(.\n\nI really didn\u2019t want this post to sound negative, but I wanted to get it off my chest.\n\nThx :)",

            "title": "I\u2019m paying substantially lower tuition fees for my foreign degree but receiving a very poor education. Should I ride it out and obtain the degree or start over in an American uni?",
            "content": "Hi Reddit, \n\nI\u2019m contemplating whether I should make a drastic change to ensure a better financial future for myself. To give you guys a bit of a background about me, I\u2019m an 18 year old college student, currently studying at a \u201cuniversity\u201d called Management Development Institute of Singapore. I placed university in quotation marks because it\u2019s hardly a university. It\u2019s essentially a private institute that more closely resembles a diploma mill rather than a legitimate uni. I enrolled into this school at 17 and have been studying here for almost two years. The academic curriculum is aligned with the British system and the courses are presented in the following order: International Foundation Diploma, Higher Diploma, and Degree. Total length of time before I receive my degree: 2 years and 7 months (with 2 months of break in between the courses). Cost of the courses:\n\n*estimates* \nFoundation Diploma- S$6,790 ($4,900 USD)\nHigher Diploma- S$11,800 ($8,660 USD)\nBachelor of Science (Hons) in Psychology - S$31,000 ($22,000 USD) \n\nTotal cost: S$49,590 ($36,320 USD)\n\nAs you can see by the figures, I\u2019m paying substantially less compared to U.S. university tuition fees. And yes, the degree is legitimate and comes from an accredited U.K. uni called Coventry University. The program I\u2019m taking now is supposedly a bridging course.  \n\nI\u2019m now in the midst of my Higher Diploma in Psychology and I\u2019m pondering whether I should leave after I\u2019ve completed it. I\u2019m not even closely content with the quality of education I have been receiving. A lot of my course material seems to be just basic filler content with maybe a slight association to the study of psychology. It\u2019s almost as if once we\u2019ve covered the fundamentals, they didn\u2019t know what else to teach us and began adding modules that verge on the brink of irrelevance just to fill in that time. Majority of my lecturers aren\u2019t very competent (aside from a select few) and there seems to be a severe problem with the way they handle administrative matters. So far in every module, we spent a minimum of three lessons going over something we\u2019ve already learned in our previous course. I also suspect that they artificially inflate our scores. When completing a graduation project last year, I had invested close to 70 hours writing my paper. I was quite proud of the end result and received a 93 on it which I thought was sufficient at the time. When comparing results to those of my classmates, I noticed a serious discrepancy within how grading assessments were being done. Upon reading through a fellow student\u2019s paper (which received a 68) I couldn\u2019t believe that someone would even entertain the idea of it being passable. It violated close to 60% of the rubric rules, the entire \u201cresearch\u201d was based entirely off of four references in total (when the minimum was 12), and had grammatical errors galore. I\u2019d venture it was probably written within a span of a night. \n\nYou might be wondering how I even ended up at this school in the first place. I\u2019ll be perfectly honest, I have been a terrible student throughout high school. I managed to get a decent enough score on my SHSATS in middle school to get into a relatively reputable technical high school in New York but it all went down hill when I began heavily abusing substances. I got expelled halfway through 11th grade due to my addiction and was sent to a Thai rehab for treatment due to it being cost effective. Afterwards, my family didn\u2019t want me returning back to New York, or the States in general, so I began looking for schools in Singapore (primarily due to low drug accessibility) and stumbled upon my current school. I\u2019ve stayed sober since then. \n\nSo due to some terrible life decisions I\u2019ve made in the past, I don\u2019t have many options available to me. If I were to leave my school and move back to the states (where I\u2019m a citizen), this would be my preferred course of action: Obtain a GED, enrol into a decent community college (if possible, something similar to Kirkwood), spend two years working my ass off to ensure my grades are sufficient enough to transfer into a decent state university and receive my degree from there. I\u2019ll probably have to take out student loans to achieve this goal considering my family isn\u2019t very wealthy and I\u2019m not entirely sure they\u2019ll grant them to me considering how horrendous my high school transcripts look (along with my disciplinary record). I fear they\u2019ll categorize me as an unstable candidate and refuse to lend me any money. \n\nHere is a pro and con list I\u2019ve managed to make so far regarding all the benefits and liabilities:\n\nPros:\n- If I complete my degree, I would graduate by the age of 20 and can begin my job hunt (or pursue a masters). A scenario in which it all works out in a desirable manner would be quite baffling. My numerous fuck ups in life resulting in a favourable outcome would definitely be an unprecedented turn of events. By the time my peers finish their undergrads, I\u2019d (ideally) already have two years of work experience under my belt. \n\n- It would be the most cost-effective approach and I wouldn\u2019t need to bury myself in debt unless I choose to pursue a masters. \n\n- I wouldn\u2019t need to move out early and would have another year and a half to plan what to do once I graduate. I am relatively content with living in Singapore and I have a strong recovery network here that I\u2019m afraid of losing (or more like changing). \n\nCons: \n- I\u2019m hardly learning anything of value at my school. I\u2019m barely even picking up any life skills such as proper time management or problem solving. Everything is handed to me on a platter and I don\u2019t even need to pay attention in class because the lecturers practically give away exactly what\u2019s going to be on the exams. All I need to do is spend maybe 7-8 hours going over the core content based on what is \u201chinted\u201d to appear on the exams and am usually able to pass with great marks (GPA currently at a 3.6). The only singular module that proved to be slightly challenging and requiring more effort than usual was statistics. \n\n- If I choose to pursue a masters soon after, I presume I\u2019m going to be ridiculously overwhelmed with the rigorousness of the curriculum. After having it so easy for the past few years, it\u2019ll be like a kick to the face when I discover what tertiary education is truly like (especially a masters). \n\n- I\u2019m essentially just paying for a piece of paper and nothing else. The \u201ccollege experience\u201d just isn\u2019t there. Considering majority of my classmates are also fuck ups that either dropped out or failed O levels, I highly doubt they\u2019d be of any use when it comes to \u201cnetworking\u201d. \n\n- I may have chosen a poor major to study. A psychology undergrad is hardly \u201cin demand\u201d and I presume finding decent employment is going to be fairly difficult with just a bachelors. \n\nLiabilities: \n- If I choose to continue my studies here and receive my diploma from Coventry, how will potential employers regard my foreign degree? If I\u2019m asked in an interview how I enjoyed living and studying in the U.K., how the hell do I explain I never even once set foot in the country? A guidance counsellor advised me that most wont question it and it\u2019ll be indistinguishable but I\u2019m a bit skeptical of her motives.\n\n- Would it be possible to receive this honours degree and complete a masters in an American college once I\u2019m done? I\u2019m slightly worried that most admission committees will request to assess my records prior to uni enrolment. If my foreign degree isn\u2019t adequate enough to enrol into a M.D. program, what must I do then? \n\n- I fear that it\u2019ll be more difficult for employers and admission committees to check the validity of my degree. Unlike my fellow college students in the U.S., my informational won\u2019t be accessible in the national data bases employers use to confirm the alma mater claims of potential recruits. Although I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be possible for them to do so, the question is whether it\u2019ll just serve as a barrier to entry when a candidate with the exact same set of credentials and work experience can be fact-checked a lot easier. \n\nI think that pretty much sums up my dilemma. My classmates tell me that our degree-level course is going to be taught by professors flown in from Coventry and they surmise that our curriculum is going to be entirely the same as the curriculum at the actual campus. That our two courses are merely bridging programs to prepare us for the degree level course. That does give me a bit of hope. Ultimately, I\u2019m very lost as to what I should do. I\u2019d hate to have to drop out this far into my studies but I fear that I\u2019ll lose even more time and money if I choose to stay. I think I\u2019ll end it here and kindly ask you guys for some advice and what your thoughts are on my predicament. \n\nThanks for reading.",

This question doesn't really revolve around the financial aid topic itself in my opinion, but please let me know if you think it should still be in that megathread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI attend one of the state IT schools (MIT, caltech, etc. -not specifying) and pretty much burned out my second year- spent most of my time gaming and didn't attend class often. I got all second year fall and spring grades changed to W's after showing that I was diagnosed with a mental health condition. I've been working on that and finally got a semester of satisfactory performance in spring 2019 (the second semester of my third year), but I have lost my scholarship and grant after using my second, third, etc. chances; I did receive aid for this spring 19 semester.\n\nThere's no way I can pay full price for the two years I need to complete my MSE bachelors degree there, and I have the option of transferring to a local college in my hometown. However, they don't have an MSE major program- just a minor, so my best plan at the local college would be a mech E major with a mse minor. I understand that the money I've spent on my education at the out of state tech school is sunk cost, but I still feel bad about the choice to go to a lower prestige school. I have a few different questions, and really any advice you all have towards any part of the situation i've explained is welcome.\n\nFrom a hiring perspective, how much of a difference would there be between finishing at a high caliber tech school with some research work, band involvement, and a mediocre GPA (3.2) and finishing at a regular state school with research work, some sort of club involvement, and a good GPA (hoping for somewhere in the 3.7 range given my current improved state of mind) ? At the moment I don't have any internship experience- I was stupid enough to wait until the last minute to apply for something for this summer and therefore am currently unemployed. I have applied for local jobs and am using my free time to learn solidworks and other engineering softwares.\n\nHow feasible is it to take a leave of absence and work as much as I can to reduce my current debt and come back to finish my degree at the 50k per year tech school? I am 20 (turning 21 in september), and I figured that working hard while living with my parents (0 housing and eating costs) until I am 24 and can file fafsa as an independent might be an option. The other main option I see is to swallow my pride and transfer to the local college, which does happen to have carnegie 'tier 1' research status.",

            "content": "Hello. This is my first time on this subreddit but I figured it'd be the best place to ask.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone says how \"college is better than high school,\" but I'm wondering just how true that is for school outcasts.\n\nI was (and still am) an outcast all the way from elementary school through high school. I didn't know until now (I just got diagnosed) that it was/is mainly because I'm on the spectrum (but I'm a girl so my autism isn't really noticeable). I do know how to socialize (one-on-one socializing is my strong-point), however I learned how to too late and this has damaged me. Everyone developed their friend-groups and cliques and I was excluded. And my severe social anxiety (it's gradually getting better with age) made it impossible to attempt to join a friend group.\n\nFunny enough, I'm not \"outcasty\" enough to hang with the outcasts. Most of them at my school are into heavy drugs or drinking, anyways, and I'm not into that stuff. I'm also not nerdy enough to hang with the nerds, according to them. I developed a few \"normal\" (not popular, but not outcasts) friends but even they deemed me too boring to stay friends with (I don't like hanging out with people outside of school (probably something PTSD-related), so it makes it hard to maintain friends).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately all of this has damaged my self-esteem and self-worth, because all the girls at my school are \"grown-up\" looking/acting. Very hot, very sociable (social media just shoves it in my face, unfortunately). I feel ashamed of who I am. Will there be less of this pressure to \"fit in\" in college/university? Or will it be the same BS all over again, but in a different place with more freedom to do stupid shit? I plan on going to a college in Florida (because I have seasonal affective disorder) which is very far away for me (I'm from New England), so if it *is* just like high school, I won't have a home to go run to and hide in when things get rough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease be honest with me. I'm not gonna go off myself if you tell me it *is* just like high school -- I just want to be prepared for the worst. Thanks!",

            "content": "You guys gave me some really great feedback on my [post from a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/a3x1ej/considering_leaving_my_lab_and_joining_a/). I've taken a few steps so far and wanted to summarize how things are going in hopes I will help someone else lurking here!\n\nThe first thing I did was meet with my grad coordinator as well as the dean of graduate students (we have a familial connection which helped *a lot*). I told them what was going on, and they both were very concerned, as well as glad I came to them in my first semester. They said it's much easier to change early into the program so now is a good time. They were also unsurprised at the news - apparently my advisor has a bad streak of \"losing\" PhD students - bad enough that the dean mentioned she had been looking to terminate my advisor's adjunct position. So I felt far more justified in leaving and more confident that staying would mean four years of hell and anxiety.\n\nThe next step was to find another advisor who was a good fit for my interests, and see if I could change. I'm only partially funded (about 75% of my fees) which made this more difficult - if you have good funding, most advisors would easily take you on. I had a few rejections. It was a lot like full-on applying for a Ph. D. again. \n\nNow, I have one potential advisor who is interested and we're talking in a few days. I'm very excited, it sounds promising, and my amazing Master's advisor worked with him and vouched that he was a great guy.\n\nI have decided I will leave my current advisor, no matter what happens. If things go well with the guy I'm talking to, I will either immediately transfer to his lab, or quit school until September to start over again. I've decided it's not worth it to stay with my current advisor and have another several months of anxiety, while also losing enthusiasm for my project because of her attitude. Instead I'd rather invest my energy starting on a new project with full enthusiasm.\n\nThe man I want to work with is also fairly well-known in his field, and I'm switching to a more popular and applicable field (with more job potential), so there are some career benefits to the change as well. I try to remind myself of this when I'm feeling bad about it.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to say is that I'm really, really, really glad I got my Master's first. During my MSc I was thinking of transferring up to a PhD, and my advisor at the time told me to take it slow instead, and reap the benefits of more papers, more experience, and a degree in my pocket. He was absolutely right, and now I feel like I have a leg to stand on if I leave my PhD, because with my Master's I have much better (& more lucrative) job options than with just my Bachelor's.\n\nAnyway, if you're struggling with something like this feel free to PM me. It was fucking hard and I did my best to enjoy my holidays while all of this was going down, but still miserable at times. I'm just glad I finally decided to do something.\n\nAlso, if anyone has some good \"breakup\" phrasing I could use with my current advisor, I would love to hear it...\n\n",

My daily activities include data collection/analysis, writing my dissertation, giving presentations, etc. Normally I am very productive, efficient, and passionate about what I do. Recent problems with my mentor, however, have effectively killed my productivity, self-perception, and joy for my work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mentor has changed the way she interacts with me. She used to speak to me like a colleague, taking my ideas into consideration, helping me identify gaps in my knowledge, and supporting me with small words of encouragement during difficult times. In interest of full disclosure, she is not an overly supportive individual and I was aware of this when I chose to continue my doctoral work with her after a brief period of research as a MS student. However, she supported me in her own way and I felt that all criticism given to me was constructive, clear, and well-intentioned. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, our interactions are humiliating, demeaning, and cold. She has taken on the role of omnipotent PI, unable to do anything wrong and any issues in our mentor-mentee relationship are my fault. She will tell me to do something, I will do it exactly as told, and then she will criticize me for what I have done. When I try to (respectfully) explain to her that this is what she wanted, with email documentation as well as my own personal notes, she will tell me \"That is YOUR interpretation of what I wanted. You need to stop thinking you know everything and take my advice.\" Furthermore, she has taken to criticizing how I interact with others, how I choose to spend my time in the lab, where I choose to write on the weekends, and the fact that I seek advice and support from other graduate students - solely because that is not how she would do/handle those situations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sought help from other members of my department - they helped me recognize how I was feeling and gave me suggestions to help me address my concerns with my mentor. A few months ago, I tried to have a conversation with her about how uncomfortable I feel in the lab, how I do not feel supported anymore, and how being the only student in the lab puts me in an especially vulnerable position with respect to how she treats me. She immediately rejected everything I had to say and instead placed our changed work environment on me and all of my personal shortcomings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am at a loss for what to do. This is very difficult for me because we have had such a good mentor-mentee relationship in the past. Any advice? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS - changing mentors is out of the question. I would have to stay longer and only have \\~1.year left. I just don't think I can handle this for another year.",

Every job she\u2019s applied for in the last year she\u2019s been unsuccessful with (opticians, office work, teaching assistant etc).\n\nI was wondering whether doing a masters to give her another qualification might be the best route.\nHer current qualifications don\u2019t seem to be getting her anywhere, so I thought maybe if she did a masters it would give her enough qualification to do something she\u2019d actually want to do.\nMasters cost \u00a310000 here. Some sites seem to suggest she\u2019d be able to get a loan, but others seemed to indicate because of her age (she\u2019s 53) she wouldn\u2019t be able to.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of whether getting a masters and paying all that money *would* actually put her in significantly better a stance for getting a good job, as I really don\u2019t know enough about it.\n\nI was hoping someone here might be able to give me some advice on the ins-and-outs, to see if this actually might be a viable option for her to get out of the trap she\u2019s in.\n\nMany thanks! \n\n",

Anyhow here goes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am in the penultimate year of grad school and I feel cheated. Cheated because all these years of education were supposed to make me equipped for life. I am in my late 20's, barely making it financially, riddled with student debt and with very little hope of getting a decent paying job.  I was told that doing all these years of education were supposed to lead to a glorious path of achievement and self-satisfaction. \n\nBut I am simply unhappy with my life. At the start of the year as I was reflecting on the year that went by, I realized that I am not sad or upset: I was just angry and unhappy. All those years of working hard and being the best - first at school, then at undergrad, then at post-grad -  to land a prestigious graduate fellowship are for nought. This is a thankless job because your advisor doesn't tell you that you have done a good job or that you are progressing. Its a high stress job and you take the work everywhere you go. And for miserly pay. \n\nWorse it makes me feel so bad about myself. I feel so worthless. Penultimate year of graduate school and still no publications. How can we take people - bright, driven and motivated people- and turn them into emotional wrecks?  I am constantly overworked because I cant detach myself from it. I am demotivated so I don't work leading to anxiety about not working leading to even further de-motivation because I now have more things to do. Furthermore, there is nothing fundamentally important or useful or stimulating about my work. Its writing code and analyzing data. This stuff would probably be automated in a few years anyway. What am I in grad school for? \n\nPeople my age are changing the world by working towards providing medicines via drones in Rwanda, and I am cursing at my computer because the server queue for running simulations is full. It feels like I am wasting the greater part of my 20's just going through the grind. All for what: the title of the Phd? To what end? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood thing I am in a STEM program.

I wanted to take a minute to reflect on something positive that happened to me this week:\n\nI am entering my second semester of a heavily research oriented STEM program.  After managing the growing pains of my first semester (moving with my wife to a new state, entering an unfamiliar field, and list goes on), I took the holiday to seriously reflect on career choices.  First semester was rough for me because I learned what it feels like to exceed my stress threshold  \ud83d\ude43 .  As it turns out, I'm not so good at managing stress and had some weeks where the last place I wanted to be was in the lab.  After weeks of under-performing (mostly by my standards) and trying to get my shit together, it was time to take a break and spend with holiday with my family in another state.  The holiday helped considerably.  I've returned with a positive mindset about my work obligations and a solid plan to live a healthier lifestyle, which my wife and I are committed to tackle together.\n\nYesterday, out of the blue, my lab partner starts a conversation with me while we were disassembling and rearranging lab equipment.  He loves gabbing with me about internet nonsense and hobbies, but usually it's me that starts the conversation.  He proceeds to act like a giddy child who just received a puppy for Christmas, saying how happy he is that his paper is finally in the revision phase (as of this week) and that he's dismantling what has been the bane of his existence for \\~8 months.  Come to find out, he had been dead set on leaving the program this year and finishing with a non-thesis degree.  He had even sent a letter to the chair to discuss his decision this Spring.  My lab partner seems like a completely different person now.\n\nKnowing that my colleague has a newfound motivation for their research has made me realize how hard academia can be without camaraderie.  It's easy to feel my research is a sculpture that never realizes the project's vision.  You can spend 12 hours in the lab and feel like you accomplish next to nothing, which sucks.  You know what else sucks?  Spending 50, 60, or more hours a week on a project that's generating more troubleshooting that foreseeable progress.  You know what will flip that mindset on its head and completely change your perspective on your career?  Realizing that your struggle isn't unique.\n\nI've spent a lot of time on this subreddit in the last few months because of the positive stories you all share, not the negative ones.  When you keep your struggles to yourself, though, or surround yourself with people who do, then your stress might fester and keep you from achieving *real* progress.  Thank you all for continually contributing to this subreddit!  My lab partner and I have made incredible progress in just a few days on our new, cooperative experimental setup, and I'm thrilled to be able to share that with you!",

Last year was my coursework year, and I kind-of-sort-of balanced my life by working part time at an active job as well as TAing. This year I've been working on my thesis more, and also working as a research assistant. I do have an active job still but I can only work really one day a week, now, because of school and RA related obligations. I've already applied to begin my PhD next fall, which will follow a similar pattern in first year but then go on to be more self-directed again, kind of like where I am now.\n\nHere's the issue: I hate sitting. I literally despise it. I spent five years in the workforce after I finished my undergrad doing a variety of retail and labour based work, which was less interesting intellectually than school, but honestly in some ways... more satisfying? I got to work hard/run around/tire myself out every single day. I was always working; I rarely was stuck sitting down. I'm definitely a person who manages their stress through burying it in work and... I can't do that in full time school/academia. I especially can't do that when I'm glued to a computer screen all day. I am mentally exhausted all the time but physically have so much energy that I feel insane.\n\nI know I'm in a particularly rough/heavy spot with my workload right now, but how do I possibly not go completely nuts from sitting down constantly? How do I focus? I try to balance my life by being active in the evenings and on the weekends, but this is still very different than my previous life of working hard and coming home feeling accomplished. I'm good at my work, I'm a highly successful student... but  I haven't figured out how to translate these different spendings of energies into something that feels satisfying to me. Because I am restless I feel unsatisfied. How am I supposed to figure out if this is a thought process that I can change... or if I'm just doing the wrong thing?\n\ntl;dr: I feel restless and thus unsatisfied.

She is about to finish her masters in a biology based field. She has also not done as well during her two years there and will graduate with around a 3.1. Her plan was to hopefully stay on for a PhD in her field. Her main issue behind the gpa is some poorly treated mental health issues which we are working on. Unfortunately she recently found out her current institution would likely not admit her due to her gpa, requesting a 3.5 which is not mathematically possible at this point. She will be completing a thesis for her masters. Most frustrating is she has a good relationship with her current PI who was willing to fund her for the PhD if admitted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway I am trying to help her figure out next steps. Would it make sense for her to try to work as a lab tech for a year or two to get further experience and hopefully overcome her gpa history with this? How realistic would this be? It seems post bac programs are only geared towards fixing gpas for professional programs like pharm/med/dental. Plus im not sure if that would be a great financial investment. Her overall goals are to have a career in academia as a researcher.",

            "title": "Figuring out the best path to Grad School",
            "content": " **Background:** \n\nI graduated in 2013 from a University of California (one of the top 40 schools in the country) with a really shit Gpa, like under 2.5 shitty, with a degree in Sociology. Well, shocker that degree is pretty useless. My GPA is explained by a health condition I didn\u2019t push hard enough to get treated and some personal trauma\u2019s that happened during my undergrad. I have since addressed these issues and am doing fine now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI worked temp and part-time for two years before landing a full-time office manager position at a really small local company that pays shit and I have to carry all my own health insurance costs, my only actual benefit is paid vacation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Today:**  I now want to pursue a computer science career. I got admitted to Oregon State University\u2019s Post-Bachelors Computer Science degree program. I start in Spring 2019. I do want to go for a masters degree as well. \n\nBasically, at 28yrs old my parents are pushing me out of living at home with them. So I need to move as well. I have a couple of options, but am struggling to make a decision and figure out which one will put me on the best path. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy plan, either way, is to work part-time in the area I move to, and possibly even online while studying. And take out student loans for the rest. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Option 1:** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMove to the Sacramento, CA area (which is way cheaper than where I currently live and has family close by). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can take some supplemental community college courses and do the OSU program. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen apply for a computer science masters program at in-state schools (and out-of-state, but due to costs I would prefer to stay in-state for this option). With my main choice being Sacramento State University. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cost of living isn\u2019t too bad for the area. I think that there would be some decent internship availability for the city. And it\u2019s got several good schools in the area that have comp science grad degrees. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe pros for this is the area expenses. Car insurance would probably be lower than if I went with option 2. Food prices should be lower as well. Most places in the area I\u2019m looking at don\u2019t charge pet rent, just a deposit. Parking is included and not extra. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Option 2:**\n\nMove to the Bothell, WA area. The Seattle area is ultimately my dream location to live in, and where I would eventually like to end up anyway. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe University of Washington Bothell has a graduate certificate program in Computer Science that is designed for students who lack formal computer science training to succeed in their master\u2019s program. It says on their website that 50% of people who do that certificate go on to the Grad program. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that given my background going for the grad certificate would be a good way to get my foot in the door for a masters. They get to know me, and I get to prove I can do the work. I should still have time to apply for Fall 2019 admission, and that program is about 9 months, and I can go for the masters after that. I should have two OSU program courses and two community college courses done by the time I apply for the certificate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe pros for this one is I get to be in my ideal location, I kind of feel like I wouldn\u2019t put down roots in Sacramento as my thinking is it would be temporary anyway. But the main concern is cost of living in the Bothell area. Most places seem to charge for parking and pet rent plus deposit. If I\u2019m in Bothell I would need to keep my car. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Option 3 (Or the in-between option):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMove to Portland, OR. It\u2019s kind of in-between cost of living for Sacramento and Seattle. It\u2019s the Pacific Northwest, which I love. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPortland State University has their own post-bachelors program and a grad prep program that I could take to help me get into a masters program. University of Washington Vancouver is also close by. I feel that the internship opportunities are about even with Sacramento, but probably not as good as the Seattle area can offer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s sort of the middle ground option for me. Not quite the leap Bothell is, but not the \u201csafe-space\u201d California offers. I get the outdoor playground of the Cascades, but I\u2019ve never had to deal with snow before. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy plan is to apply to grad schools in Montana, California, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Arizona, and Texas as well. I feel like that way I have a good blanket of schools and would hopefully get into one of them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I fucked up with my first degree. That I was too young and had no clue what I wanted to do, but was more or less pressured into it by my parents at the time. It was a great source of pride for their kid to go to a UC. But I didn\u2019t appreciate it, and I was just not ok after the first year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I feel a great deal of pressure not to fuck this up too. And if I do then I\u2019m going to be screwed with debts. ",

            "content": "*Fair warning, this is a bit of a story. TL;DR will be at the bottom.*\n\nI'm not really asking anything here, just sharing my tale. I'm going to do my best to finish this PhD but just need to share this story so I can figure out for myself what happened over the past 4 years...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**It begins...**\n\nMy PhD is in History and it has been tumultuous to say the least. After 4 years of Life throwing it's little adventures at me I am now in my final year and have yet to write anything down... Though, I have been doing what research I could and feel that if I just put my ass in my seat and knock it out, I'll get it done in time. \\*cautiously optimistic\\*\n\n(I base that on my track record of always pulling my work out of the fire at the last second and that I've never failed any course before, and in fact usually have pretty decent marks... but, I've also never had to write 80,000+ words before...)\n\nI started my PhD in 2014 and fully intended to complete it in 3 years. I spent my first year working as a tutor whilst putting together my proposal and, thankfully, it was accepted. My second year didn't start off so well as my funding dried up and I had to get a full-time job to cover this. I though that I would still keep my PhD full-time and just work on it in between work... what a fool I was...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Museum**\n\nThe job I managed to get was working at a museum. \"Hooray!\" I thought, \"This will be the perfect opportunity to work in the area I want whilst also completing my studies!\" but the museum didn't want me to work in their social sciences or military history sections, as I had applied for, they wanted me to work in their marketing department as an events manager...\n\nNot a problem, I had marketing and eventing experience from a previous job, this should be fine, a job is a job.\n\nIt wasn't fine.\n\nWhat followed was 2 years of torture. The museum group had 11 museums under its auspice and is government owned and managed. Some would think a cushy government job, right? Unfortunately, far from the truth. Understaffed and overworked with remarkably unhelpful coworkers (barring 3 or 4 who kept me sane during my time there) I was expected to manage the weekly events for 11 different museums and regularly started work at 5am and ended at 1am to cater for events. I was ONE MAN managing all these spaces. My request for extra help or even just to borrow the dept intern to answer some of my emails fell on deaf ears. And my boss was an ageing widower who frequently made me drop everything to accommodate her latest crush who just HAD TO have his party in the gallery but first he wants to walk around the space for three hours umm'ing and aww'ing with me in tow.\n\nNeedless to say, there is a lot more to this whole story, but bottom line I was unable to work on my PhD at all, barring ONE research trip to some archives I needed to visit, which cost me 2 weeks of backed up event work... I intended to eventually quit so I could go back to my studies, I just wanted to get 2 years of solid work experience on my CV first.\n\nMy academic supervisor was supportive but mostly absent during this whole process apart from the occasional emails and meetings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Wedding**\n\nHalf way through 2016 (1 and a half years into working at the museum) my parent's health took a turn for the worst and that required me to visit when I could to help out.\n\nAnd then, IT happened.\n\nMy sister was getting married, so I took a few days off to attend the wedding, a nice welcomed break from work, and to help the family out with prepping and running everything. I was to do one of the toasts and to help with the catering and other organising.\n\nWell, even though my sister was bridezilla, the wedding went really well and the reception was a blast... up until the marriage ended 4 hours after it had begun.\n\nTo this day we're not exactly sure what happened, some kind of massive argument behind closed doors that lead to the marriage being dissolved soon after. To be fair, there had been cracks and warning signs for the duration of the relationship, but we didn't expect it to explode the way it did not even a few hours after the actual ceremony.\n\nSo, I had to request an extra few days from work to handle the fallout, and eventually this would lead to me quitting my job at the museum so I could focus on keeping my family together and getting them through this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Rehab**\n\nI spent another month at the museum finishing up a variety of projects before heading overseas to help my family out in the least few months of 2016. My sister had gone catatonic, due to what would later be diagnosed as PTSD from the events at the wedding, and was quite literally killing my folks (who were still suffering from ill health) so I had to take charge. (I should mention that they were overseas as my folks were in the process of immigrating when all this happened so they took my sister for some R&R but couldn't handle her fallout. I had some psychology training so I could help a bit.)\n\nThis is called the rehab phase not just because I would spend almost all of 2017 helping my sister and parents recover, but also myself. You see, I had some bad injuries from a car accident back in 2006 in my hip, spine and shoulder that I had done well to recover from over the years, but the sheer stress from the job I had taken had ruined all of that progress.\n\nThe sitting at the desk 9+ hours a day, the 2-4 hour daily commute, and the overall stress had caused my body to seize in places and I had gained a ton of weight. All of that just wrecked my health and I spent most of 2017 going to rehab and helping my parents recover from health issues and my sister come out of her shell again.\n\nMy academic supervisor was aware of most of this, but for the most part I was a ghost in the department. Three years into the PhD and people at the department had no clue who I was when I would pop by for meetings.\n\nAnd to top 2017 off, I ended up having to take my brother in for rehab because he had fallen into a bad cocaine habit and had lost his business as a result. My father's health also took a sharp dip and all around it was a very dark time for my family...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A New Dawn**\n\nIf I sound bitter through any of this, I must admit that I was for a long while. I was very angry and I STILL had not done any real work on my PhD by this point.\n\nLuckily, things began to look up at the start of 2018.\n\nAll this while, I had used up most of my meagre savings from my museum job, but luckily I managed to find a semi-decent ESL job which I could do online and from home. I also got a part-time gig submitting articles to a magazine so money wasn't really an issue for a while, but it also meant less time for studies.\n\nI had also managed to get a small bursary grant for my studies which were enough to cover my tuition fees and a research trip (which I took last September and did some magnificent research if I do say so myself!).\n\nMy brother got out of rehab in January and the family rallied to get him back on his feet. He had a set back or two, but he's been clean 5 months now.\n\nMy sister is out of her shell as well and I got her a job teaching English at the same company I work at, so she's doing much better for herself.\n\nAnd, I'm happy to say, my parent's health is vastly improved, though they have had to sell their home overseas and move back due to work commitments but at least they have their health!\n\nFor my part, I started losing weight (23kgs so far, only 7 away from my ideal weight!) and I'm also back to running and boxing, which I love and haven't done for years.\n\nAs for research, last year I managed to do a lot more research than I ever had before, and I made a name for myself in my department (though for work unrelated to my PhD) by being hardworking and dependable. I started spending time in the post-grad room often, making friends and re-introducing myself to the staff there. My supervisor even had me to teach a class of his for a semester (though that ended up taking 2 months of my time as it was a month of teaching and then a month of marking! Sigh...) which turned out to be one of the most popular classes of the year! The students loved it from what they told me, so that made me feel really good.\n\nAnd to top 2018 off, in a good way, I managed to receive a second iteration of my bursary, so my fees and research trip for 2019 will be covered again.\n\nThe documents I found last year will also blow my research wide open, for which I am very excited! Just need the military to declassify some and we're golden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Twenty Nineteen**\n\nAnd that brings us to now. This year I HAVE to finish my PhD and I have yet to start writing.\n\nI am more than a little nervous, I won't lie, but I also know I'm a prolific writer once I get going and I know this subject well. I have to hand the dissertation in in October and am presenting what I have done so far in a conference in June.\n\nSo far, my supervisor has been super supportive but he hasn't seen a single piece of my actual writing, though I have filled him in on what I've uncovered so far. He seems optimistic that my research will be good, but he doesn't know I haven't actually put pen to paper yet... so to speak. But I'll have something good for the conference I'm sure.\n\n(Oh, did I mention my supervisor retired at the start of this year? This is sort of a good thing because it means he'll have more time for me!)\n\nI still have to earn a living, so half my month will be spent teaching ESL so I can have enough money to get by, and the final half will be spent at the dept writing my arse off. I've written out a schedule of what I need to be writing when and how many pages I need to complete per day, week, and month to meet my deadline.\n\nIt is going to be brutal, and gruelling, but I think I can do it. I have to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thanks for reading!**\n\nSo, yeah, I think I just needed to vent and reading through the threads here, many of you seem very kind and experienced. Not sure if anyone else has ever been in a similar position and managed to pull off any miracles, but if so, I would love to hear about it. Or if anyone has any advice on ways to make my writing go smoother, that will also be appreciated.\n\nI will definitely report back here after all is said and done to put an end, one way or another, to my sordid tale but I think it will be a good ending.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*TL;DR*  \n>  \n>a variety of things happened over the past 4 years which meant I didn't have any time to do any research or writing. From being overworked at a museum, to my family imploding (including a botched wedding, a sibling in rehab, and the ailing health of myself and my parents), to finding the time between work to write something. Through it all, I'm still optimistic I'll get this done.\n\n&#x200B;",

Then I moved back to my home country to work in the industry. I didn't enjoy work and the environment too much and it even made me doubt my career choice of mechanical engineering. So I felt like I needed a change and to escape. At the time I thought my best option was grad school. So I applied and got accepted to a masters program in mechanical engineering at a school in Germany. \nTo be honest, my interest in mechanical engineering started to fade during the 3rd year of my undergrad and even more during my work. And the main reason why I chose Germany is because of the cheap education. But I applied for a masters in mechanical engineering anyway because, at the time, I thought this is the easiest way to guarantee my acceptance into a masters program.\nNow fast forward 4 months and I am miserable. The first 2 months were amazing. I got my escape. I got to move to a new country and all experiences were new. I pulled myself together and make sure I attend class and try to focus. And I even met a girl.\nThen things started to go south real quick. After the excitement settled down, I realized how boring and empty the town the I am living in really is. Classes got mundane and I don't follow what is going on. Unlike my undergrad experience where I made a lot of friends, I have made 0 friends here and I have no one to talk to. Things ended with the girl which left me sad and heartbroken. And over the past week I have just been contemplating dropping out. \nEverything is happening so quickly because if I drop out before end of January, I get my second semester tuition back.

I'm not teaching yet, for example, or doing community outreach.. Maybe I should be writing more.. Or doing research assistance..\n\nIs this warranted or am I overthinking things?  Do others feel this way?",

            "content": "I completed a B.S. in Mathematics in the USA with a 3.6 major GPA.\n\n1.) The strongest LOR I have is from a lecturer with a PhD in 2010 that I took two applied Statistics courses with. They're graduate courses for programs in Bioinformatics/Genomics etc. We covered probability theory, linear regression, multiple linear regression, nonlinear regression, ANOVA, factorial designs, split and split-split plot designs, various block designs, etc. I know the instructor well, I performed well, and he really likes me.\n\n2.) My one research project was in the department of biology in Bioinformatics, but I never finished the project in the deadline my PI gave me and he told me to forget about working on it more. He has refused to write me letters for scholarship applications citing his busy schedule. That would be a bad letter.\n\n3.) I have taken three courses with a Math professor in Sets & Logic, Modern Analysis I and Modern Analysis II. However, my professor said that while I started strong, the thoroughness and rigorousness of my proofs declined with each class I took under him and that my letters would need to reflect that. He was hesitant. I got an A, B+ and B+ in his courses. I don't think that is a good letter.\n\n\n4.) All of my other courses were just a single class with a professor I only had a course with once and didn't get to know. Of these, I got an A in undergrad probability theory, an A in undergrad Linear Algebra, and an A in undergrad Abstract Algebra. Unfortunately, for Abstract Algebra, I spent $800 on a tutor who helped me with homework / exam studying and I also occasionally derived answers to homework from the internet. I don't know how letters from these classes would look.\n\nThe only math classes I took for my Bachelor's were Sets & Logic, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, Probability Theory, Modeling in Biology, Ordinary Differential Equations, Advanced Calculus 1 & 2, and Modern Analysis 1 & 2.\n\n5.) I am currently looking for a full time job and completing an online B.S. degree (for cost) in Computer Science from a university across the state to meet prerequisites. I will take classes with a couple professors multiple times, but I do not know how LORs from an online degree would look.\n\nFinally, I want to say that I would like to get into a great program in Computer Science to study Machine Learning and Math Theory outside of my state. I can only afford to go International (a country with tuition < $12,000 a year) or recieve a TA/RA'ship at an American University that waives 100%/most of the tuition for my entire degree.\n\nI almost think that to get into a great school, I need to do a subsidized Master's internationally (or tuition free Master's in USA) in Applied Statistics / Mathematics at whatever school I can get accepted (while working a part time job). I would do research there and build up strong letters of recommendation from the professors. I really really want to avoid loans.\n\nI would then be able to do a second masters at a better school in the field I want to specialize in (or possibly get accepted to a PhD program if that's what I decide). I'm just afraid that I would enter the job market too late or that employers would call me a professional student.\n\nIs attending a top graduate school even feasible for someone in my position? How bad of a position have I put myself in? I'll still apply and find out where I stand.\n\nAlso, while completing my online degree and job searching / working, I am also working on personal projects (programming) and self-studying some statistics. I can reference this in my personal statement.\n\nI'm currently 25.\n",

            "content": "Hey all,\n\nI'm in a huge dilemma/quarter-life crisis right now. I studied Immunology and Genetics for my undergrad and for the most part, did very average (I'm 0.01 CGPA away from meeting the minimum requirement for most graduate degrees in my locale). I remember back in university, I wasn't able to thrive in such an environment, was probably too undisciplined (being young and dumb), and had a language barrier (English is not my native language). I ended up skipping most of my classes and failed to get any research experience because of my mediocre results. I'm also thinking that my international status at the time was probably a factor as well. Honestly, I'm surprised I didn't fail lol. I regretted a lot of my actions during undergrad and for the longest time (and possibly as a coping mechanism), I told myself after graduation that I'm not meant for science and that maybe I'm better in management or business or whatever.\n\nFast forward three years, I'm working in education, mostly administrative and management work. It started okay because it was a new field to me and honestly, I'm pretty good in administrative work (attention to detail and organization) but I feel like the only reason I went into non-science career was because I needed the job to secure my immigration (it's secured now) and of course, I needed to survive. I'm all here by myself, my family is so far away from me and not supporting me financially at all. I'm in Canada btw.\n\nI'm at this point of my life (quarter-life crisis???) where I feel like a zombie, where I wake up and go to work, finish it and go back to playing my PS4 to stress-release. Rinse and repeat. My life feels so empty and I hate work so much, I've been calling in sick more often now and not just because I hate work, I notice it's actually more common for me to get sick now more than ever. My boss has already noticed my decreasing commitment and has had the 'chat' with me, I feel like being laid off is coming pretty soon. Given my work experience, I don't think it's difficult for me to get a similar job somewhere else but I'm so afraid of being stuck in the same limbo again. My boss, friends and colleagues had all told me that despite me denying it so much, that I really miss science and I feel like deep down inside, it's true. At work, while others talk about life and stuff, I actually talk a lot about science with colleagues. My best friend at work dubbed me 'walking wikipedia with an annoying voice' lol. Even my boss told me that I had a very scientific approach to things at work. I'd like to acknowledge that at the end of the day, despite hating my work, my work did taught me a lot of new stuff and I have a newfound interest in aspects of humanities and social sciences like sociology, history, geography, politics, and linguistics (hence why I was dubbed the 'walking wikipedia' because I knew a lot of social sciences as well) but natural science will always be my number one love (even physics that I hated so much in school, *I am missing it so much*). I don't know if I miss all the labs and exams but I really miss the knowledge, talking about it, educating others about it, and perhaps working in it. I remember going down to American Museum of Natural History in NYC few weeks back, I was like that kid who just got his first toy, not even exaggerating, I haven't felt alive and so excited in a long while.\n\nAnywayyyy, **I am wondering if it's possible at all for me to come back to science after abandoning it for years?** Has anyone been in the same spot? How did you do it? Thinking of going to grad school, I have my degree but my CGPA wasn't impressive and I didn't have any research experience. I'm trying to be careful with my plan because I'm not getting any younger and I don't want to incur any unnecessary debt. I've been thinking at going into genomics or genetic counseling because I remember back in undergrad that I excelled in genetics and microbiology classes (especially genetics), not so much with physiology and ecology. My work right now has taught me that I'm pretty good with people and organization so that's also why I'm also considering genetic counseling. I'm also thinking of other human-facing healthcare professions like medicine and nursing but I'm not very good with huge amount of blood...lol. And no, I don't want to be a teacher.

Graduate school is an entirely different world, where you're basically thrown off of a cliff and told to fly. I ended my first semester in a suicidal breakdown after being so physically and mentally exhausted that I couldn't even think straight. After spending my holiday break rethinking my entire life, there's a few things that next year's cohorts should take to heart.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Treat graduate school like a 9 to 5 job. I was spending 12 hours/day 6 days/week in my office last semester but ended up being less productive than I have been since I started treating this like a day job. While you're on campus, *work*. Once you get home, relax, spend time with your family/SO/dog and relax. Overworking yourself will reduce your productivity, not increase it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Don't be afraid to say \"*I don't know*\". Chances are that most of the other students in your seminar don't know the answer either, and if you're all just faking it, you're not going to learn much. I think imposter syndrome plays a big role in the pressure to pretend you know things that you don't, but that's exactly why you're in graduate school--to learn things you don't know.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Meet with your professors and talk with others about your projects because two minds are better than one, and they may be able to point out something you haven't thought of, missed, or did incorrectly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Set *realistic* deadlines and goals for yourself, and get the short assignments out of the way early so you can focus on the big ones. If your classes assign x number of short papers of each week's readings (in my case, the most common seems to be five 2 page papers of any five week's readings), get those out of the way as soon as possible. Try and start all of your term papers/end of semester projects by the sixth week of the semester.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Try and make friends with your cohort. They are your competition, but they are also your future colleagues, coauthors, ect. If you help eachother out rather than trying to stab one and other in the back (there are programs where graduate students are actually like this), you'll all be better off in the long run. My department discovered a few years ago that if you shove all of the first years into the same office, you end up with fewer students leaving because they failed quantitative methods (basically a combination of elementary statistics I and II that teaches you the bear minimum foundations you need for the subsequent multiple regression and maximum likelihood estimation courses).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'll update this if I think of more things, but these are essential to surviving and being successful in graduate school, especially in your first year.\n\nEdit: After some suggestions from one of my office mates, I've added a few more.",

Just after I was accepted into my program my partner developed chronic fatigue syndrome and became housebound. The stress of research and caring led me to try a series of antidepressants, and eventually into an experimental medical trial of ketamine for depression. Last year my best friend died. The result of all this is that I'm extremely behind in my work. But the final deadline is approaching fast. I have to hand in all my work to date on May the 1st. I've used up all my leave, and I've even gone officially part-time just to extend my milestone (although I'm still working full-time). And I haven't written very much. \n\nThe stuff I do write is insipid, and there's still so much I need to read. The more I panic, the worse my writing is. I have about 30,000 extremely rough words at the moment. My supervisor says that I won't have a full draft ready for my committee, but hopefully a few well-crafted chapters will convince them that I can finish the job. He has such helpful suggestions as \"write it right the first time\" to save time on editing. I honestly don't know how to get through the next 3 months, let alone how to do my best work.

We went through 6 proposal drafts to really make sure it was perfect, and she called my research \"potentially fundable\" multiple times.

In the email, she also touched on pleading a stronger case for funding in the proposal, so I made sure to make things clearer. A week later, I was accepted. I just put in my funding applications for two different scholarships that may come with tuition waivers and stipends, but I'm absolutely terrified.\n\nI've been incredibly stressed about not receiving funding ever since I accepted the offer in November. I didn't apply to any other schools because I received my acceptance well before Canadian schools would even start accepting applications. I have wanted to do a PhD in the UK for ages, but now I'm afraid that things are going to fall apart and I won't receive any funding. The consensus online is that self-funding a humanities PhD is a bad idea, so that's off the table if I don't get any money (nor could I otherwise afford to go). How do I deal with the prospect of potentially not even going back to school next year if this falls through?

            "content": "**Edit: Originally posted this in** r/socialwork **but it got taken down by an automod due to the first paragraph mentioning grad school, I guess? Idk, let me know if this is somehow inappropriate for this forum and I'll take it down for sure.**\n\nHi all. I have a couple questions but first, my situation: I have been accepted to an MSW program in my current city. It is a public school but tuition is still quite high and I received a disappointing scholarship of only $4,000 a year. I already have around 46k in debt from undergrad, and completing this program would mean that I have to take on an additional 38k for tuition alone, not even taking living expenses or other fees into account. Best case scenario I feel like I'd end up with around $90,000 in debt but realistically it's probably more like $100,000, at least. A lot of people in my life are telling me to go for it, including my partner and my parents, but I still have doubts.\n\nMy main question is, how much debt do you think it is reasonable to take on as an MSW? Am I crazy for considering this? I currently work part-time and only take home $600-$700 a month, so life is a real struggle, lol. The most I've ever made in a year is around 12k. I guess I'm a bit of an underachiever when it comes to jobs - my family seems to think so, at least. I'm not lazy but I struggle with depression and I have somewhat significant back issues that make certain jobs very hard for me.\n\nI guess I could theoretically make more money with my BA (in an unrelated field), but I don't see an easy path to doing so, especially considering the current sad state of my resume. I want to go into social work, but when I think about having 100k in debt, I feel like I can't breathe. I'm trying to talk to practicing social workers that I know irl and get their opinions, but nothing beats the Internet for efficiency.\n\nAdditional questions:\n\nI see a lot of people on here talking about paying student loans back \"until they die.\" I don't understand this. Aren't student loans forgiven after 20-25 years of qualifying payments? I currently have an income-based repayment plan and I pay $0 a month, so maybe it's given me a bit of a blas\u00e9 attitude towards all of this. But seriously, what's to stop you from using IBR and then, worst case scenario, having your loans forgiven after 20-25 years? (Can't remember which one it is, sorry.)\n\nMarriage - my boyfriend and I will probably get married in a couple years. Am I understanding correctly that the best thing to do if I want to get a reasonable payment under IBR would be to file taxes as married - filing separately?\n\nThose of you with significant student loan debt - has your debt prevented you from doing other things you wanted to in life, such as buying a house, having kids, saving for retirement, or going on regular vacations? If so, how?\n\nI learned the other day that in the year when you do finally have your loans forgiven, it counts as income, meaning that your income appears ridiculously elevated for that year. How do people deal with this? Do you essentially just have to save up money in order to prepare? This seems like it would be hard to manage on a social worker's salary.\n\nAlright, I probably have more questions but I know this is mega long, so if you've read the whole thing, thank you so much. And thanks in advance for any help you can provide. I apologize if I seem cavalier about the debt - I'm not, I promise. It keeps me up at night. It just took me about 24 years to figure out something I might want to do with my life, so I'm not exactly excited about the prospect of starting that whole process over again.\n\nTLDR; How much debt is too much for an MSW? Is it foolhardy to rely on programs such as IBR and eventual loan forgiveness? Those of you with significant debt, how do you cope, and do you feel it was worth it?",

I started working 12-16 hour days, trying to graduate with my degree in 3 years.  I started making excuses not to see friends, or leave the house. I would have panic attacks while driving anywhere, but especially to campus. Since advancing to candidacy, I've been using alcohol to tame my anxiety. Using the excuse \"I'm in grad school, this is normal, it sucks.\" But one day it stopped working. I'm 5'4\" and could down 1/2 handle of whiskey \"taming my anxiety\" before I finally felt something. \n\nA few weeks ago I finally sought help. I went to my primary care physician and she diagnosed me with an anxiety disorder and panic attacks. She recommended that I see someone on campus for therapy. I found a cognitive behavioral therapist and started on some meds, immediately. It took some doing, but the therapist was free through my student health services (rolled in with tuition) payment.  I needed some semblance of normalcy. I swore I would never, EVER let myself get to this point, but dissertations, and theses, can be all consuming.\n\nThe therapy and scripts have helped. I can drive now without a panic attack, I can face my anxiety and have learned how to fight it. I'll likely be on meds until after I graduate and my anxiety drops to a normal level. Today I opted to push back my graduation date another semester for my health. It's a failure in my eyes and one that I'll come to accept eventually, but necessary.\n\nIf you are in this same situation and haven't sought help, please do. Im finally starting to feel like a human again. This is not an easy feat, and people who judge you who have not tried to get a PhD/MD have no idea what you are going through.

There is help out there, and most of the time it's included in your tuition. ",

It's been starting to affect my work a bit - I have no motivation to work on things, exhaustion and insomnia more and more frequently, etc. My husband and I are living in a West Coast state for his temporary job, while my university is located in the Midwest. I'm working from home on data analysis and writing, and have been struggling a lot with my mental health lately. \n\nAt what point, if at all, do I tell my advisor about my mental health struggles? I've been struggling since I passed my prelims last June, so about 6-7 months now. He was really understanding when I told him about some family stuff (I left it super vague) before then, since it came up while I was wedding planning in the spring. But I don't really have a good excuse now, besides \"I've been lonely living halfway across the country from my entire support group and it's affecting my mental health.\" It just sounds pathetic to write that out...\n\nAny tips? I'm still being productive, but I know it's not as productive as I could be. Thanks! ",

I am at a point where I like my program and my supervisor (most days), however, lately I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt, shame, and a feeling that I don\u2019t belong here and messed up my life by choosing to study in another city.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 8 months before moving, I fell in love with my current boyfriend in my hometown. I was clear about my plans to move and we had decided to try long distance. We have now been dating for 2 years. We have the long distance thing down to a fine art. We make time for regular visits and we call each other lots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe original plan was for him to move to be with me after one year. But that didn\u2019t happen. One night, we were lying in bed, and he told me that he couldn\u2019t picture his life not living close to his grandparents and parents, because family is the most important thing in the world to him. I told him it was okay and that he didn\u2019t have to move if he wasn\u2019t ready.\n\n  \n\nFlash forward to now. He has gotten a permanent job in my home city. I\u2019m still doing my Master\u2019s elsewhere. Neither of us wants to split up. My hometown isn\u2019t a bad place, but it doesn\u2019t have nearly the career opportunities that I have in my current city. And my career is important to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I feel like my decision to go back to school put me \u2018behind\u2019 in life. I left a good paying job as a software developer to come here, it seemed like a good plan but I found that being a student again made me feel like I had taken a step backwards. My baby brother recently got engaged and my sister, who is only a year older, bought a house and has been married for 2 years, while I am still a student living alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent a long time narrowing down my research topic, and with a year and a half done of my program, I\u2019m still not totally sure what my thesis is. I have been stalled for the past three months and unable to get results for one of my projects for reasons that are out of my control, and it\u2019s extremely stressful. I don\u2019t feel a sense of support or community in my research lab, although I do like the actual work I\u2019m doing. I think my program is going to take me longer than the 2 years that most students take, and I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it to continue. I\u2019m seriously considering quitting, moving home, and trying to get my old job back. I feel like I have wasted the last two years of my life. On the other hand, I\u2019m sometimes worried that I will regret moving back to my hometown or not finishing school.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah.

            "content": "Hey everyone! I applied to graduate schools this past cycle (in physics and the earth sciences), and I've gone 2/2 so far with 11 results yet to come. I like these two less than most of the rest, but they're still competitive programs, so I feel good about getting into at least one of the remaining 11, and I would very likely still enroll if I don't. So I have seven or eight months until I would start graduate school. I've been working at a research job for the past year, from which I have learned a lot. However, it turns out that it's a really poor fit for my interests, and a large part of the reason I've stayed on is that it's given me some valuable experience and that I have very little confidence in my ability to get work elsewhere. On top of that, I am getting to the point where I am no longer learning anything valuable from any of my current projects, and furthermore I think the work I do right now is a little pointless. I think it essentially qualifies as a bullshit job, and I am half convinced that the only useful purposes it serves are to make sure that my group uses all of its funding and to help me on my journey to grad school. This and the grad school application cycle have really taken a toll on my motivation, and I'd like to move on soon. I am worried that, if I do not, I am not only wasting time I could better spend actually preparing for grad school (some combination of learning relevant things and relaxing), but also risking a depressive relapse, which would be the worst possible way to prepare for grad school. I don't have any friends where I live (I haven't hung out with anyone since last August) and forcing myself to work is a little exhausting, so I end up at home afterward failing not only to do anything productive but also even to relax/calm down/take care of myself. I probably have just enough in savings from this job to live at current comfort levels until school starts, although I would happily pick up another job, especially one that's part time or that lets me spend time away from my computer.\n\nHowever, I haven't discussed this at all with my supervisors. Indeed, I feel very guilty, as two of them wrote me letters of recommendation based on (pretty solid!) work that I did last year, and my productivity very noticeably declined during the application cycle (indeed, one of my letter writers even brought it up with me in a recent meeting!!! D: ). How long do I owe it to them to keep working here? How should I discuss this issue with them? My working relationship with my primary mentor has deteriorated substantially, at least on my end, and I am really struggling to communicate well with him. I also have paranoid fantasies that my letter writers are going to contact my prospective programs if I quit, and mention the decline in my productivity/efficiency; I know this is probably unreasonable but it would be nice to be told that by somebody else. What should I do about this work situation?\n\nAdditionally, how should I go about finding something else to do in the meantime? I rather like where I live, and I have six months left on the lease, so there's a lot of inertia keeping me here and really nothing drawing me elsewhere. There are lots of government labs around where I live (front range CO), including my current place of employment, but none of them seem to have job postings for which I am qualified/are short term. I got into the physics program at CU Boulder, which is a 35 minute drive from where I live, but I don't think that really helps me to find work there. I am also open to doing things with my time that have nothing to do with STEM, but I don't really know what I'm looking for.",

I want to offer all of you soon-to-be graduate students a piece advice that I, a first year Astro PhD student myself, truly wish someone would have given to me. \n\nThat is:\nIf you have any issues, whether it be mental health issues, academic issues, imposter syndrome, family issues, or anything you\u2019re hoping to mend up when you get into graduate school, FIX IT NOW. Do not wait. Skip your vacation/summer-off to study your most challenging subjects, to get some therapy, or to do whatever you need to do that you\u2019re putting off. \n\nI\u2019ve heard that most people have a hard time their first year, but if you have any gaps (small as they may seem now) that aren\u2019t yet filled, fill them now or they will be amplified in your first year(s) of grad school. \n\nI don\u2019t want to make this about myself or scare you, but I seriously contemplated suicide for the first time in grad school. I didn\u2019t sleep, I became clinically malnourished, and felt so alone. I was behind in some subjects and I had underlying health issues I was able to cope with in undergrad so I neglected to treat them. This snowballed into a cluster of mental and academic issues that could have been prevented had I studied hard over the summer and gone into some therapy before grad school. \nI\u2019m getting help now and things are getting better for me, but it has been a rough transition and it would have been MUCH easier to mend these things before I started my PhD program. \n\nIf I can encourage just one person to even slightly prepare a little more now and over the summer (in whatever way they need to) for graduate school I will feel really happy.\n\n(Side note: If i could go back, i would accept my admission again, but for those of you who do not get accepted into graduate school, know that it\u2019s definitely more okay than you think it is.)",

I've picked the brains of people in my chosen field and while their feedback is helpful, none of them were single at my age and nearly all of them had kids. I've noticed that greatly influences the choices they made, even if they aren't aware of that influence. Let me explain and you'll see what I mean. \n\nI'm a single 30 year old woman, choosing between two different options. They are: \n\n1) Attend an amazing program in the middle of nowhere that will take at least 6 years. This program is the BEST for what I want to do, and while it's incredibly well funded for most students I also received a generous scholarship and stipend offer. All in all I'd pay $8,000 in tuition and that's it. \n\n2) Attend a 2 year program that only gives me about a third of what the first program does (in terms of licensing/training) but it's in a huge city. I also received a generous scholarship for this program, so I'd only pay for cost of living (which would be much higher, but maybe worth it for the social aspect.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically everyone I know that has followed a similar path had a spouse already, and took their family with them. Yes couples want a social life too; but, it's a whole different bag when you're considering how you'll spend all of your thirties and thinking about the dating pool. \n\nMore than anything, I'm concerned one day I'll look back with regret. I don't want to blow it at an amazing program that happens to be in a tiny town, but I also don't want to doom myself to a life of serious academia and nothing else. I am in an amazing position and I worked my ass off to get these types of options, but I'm seriously struggling here. \n\nIf anyone has any insights, especially women staring down their biological clock, please share.

            "title": "Sudden uncertainty",
            "content": "Okay, so - some background. I went to a prestigious high school - Catholic, private, very obsessed with college prep (like they pushed it on us from the beginning and right before senior year we had to go to a meeting where they mapped out our entire lives). I've always kind of marched to the beat of my own drum, but I took a lot of things to heart - mainly because they pushed grad school right away, even though I was only 17. It was kind of a situation where they were like \"Well okay, I *guess* you can major in film and television, but then you should get your masters in psychology and go into advertising\" even though that clearly wasn't what I wanted. But, anyway - starting off on a great foot. \n\nWent to undergrad with the express purpose of wanting to get into television production, mainly camera operation and floor management. I dabbled with some other stuff - did a lot of news videography, professional photography, internship in online editorial, another one in social media management - but that was the main goal, all with the idea of \"and then after my body breaks down too much to carry equipment, I'll go back for grad and become a professor\". Job market was tough though, and after graduation I wound up in a marketing job. I didn't really like it, and while I was researching something else, I stumbled on a bit of film history and suddenly I was struck with inspiration. Archival. *That's* what I wanted. I had a purpose and I started to put stuff together - I talked to an adviser about skipping a Masters and going right to PhD, looked at a few programs. Then when I got laid off from my job, I started putting a little more effort into it, realizing that I wanted to do some kind of combination of academia and archival work, but I wasn't 100% sure on what I wanted to focus on. \n\nI found a newish MA program close to home and it's only a two year commitment, and pretty low cost, so I jumped at the opportunity and got in! Sweet! Cool! Progress! I'll focus on that, get my MA and then use that to figure out where I want to get my PhD, cool. I got through my first year pretty okay, our program is small so it's decently attentive and I pretty much know what my wheelhouse is at this point so I finished up thinking \"Alright, cool, so I'll finish this but wait until *next* November to apply for PhDs so I can have my thesis as a writing sample\". Now, here's the kicker. \n\nSo around the end of August, I was sitting in the airport at like 4AM getting ready to fly out for a trip to a convention I take every year around Labor Day - it's also a liiitttle work related because I usually run a couple of panels while I'm there and one of the vendors sells a lot of dead formats. It's something I look forward to a lot since it's the only time of the year I get to see certain friends. I'm sitting on top of my suitcase in the bag check line, waiting for it to open and I think to myself \"Oh, I guess I won't really be able to do this trip for a while if I get into a doctoral program because it'll conflict if I have a class or something\" and I just felt really, overwhelmingly sad. \n\nAnd I know it's a stupid reason - but then a bunch of other things started hitting me at the same time. There's only three film PhD programs in my area, and they're all kind of hard to get into. The rest of them are kind of far away and I'm dreading the idea of moving far away because:\n\n1. My mom is the only family I have left and she's not financially stable so no safety net for either of us,  \n2. I don't know how to drive because I've always had good public transport, and \n3. I have friends in lots of different parts of the country, but only small pockets are close enough together. \n\nAlong with that came other worries about my research and finding work afterwards, or wondering if maybe I should get an MLS/MLIS instead if I want to do archival (meanwhile I can't afford another Masters degree), and just overwhelming self doubt. I basically spent this whole semester on high anxiety and my work really suffered for it. \n\nRecently I decided that I'm going to maybe take a couple of years before I decide on another degree, but I'm wondering if I'm just letting myself down or setting myself up for more failure since I haven't worked in an actual media based job since 2014 (I had to go back to secretarial work and lemme tell you, the impostor syndrome is real). I tried to get an internship this semester but one was an archival position that only wanted MLS students, the other was like the equivalent of a part-time job but unpaid, and the last one wanted me but I couldn't fit in enough time around work and classes. I've also told myself that if I don't get into a program close to home, I'm just going to take it as a sign that it's not meant to be.  \n\n\n**TL;DR: I thought I was going to get a PhD right away, but not wanting to completely uproot my life has left me in a state of \"wtf do I do now\"** ",

            "content": "I received my bachelor's degree in anthropology (specifically, archaeology) back in 2013. I had significant time working in the field, and fostered very strong working relationships with my professors along the way, both in a teaching assistant capacity and as a student-staff member of a field school. I was in a poor emotional state through my last two semesters of undergraduate work (mostly due to my now-wife being overseas for her graduate program), and foolishly decided not to pursue any graduate programs.\n\nIn the time since I graduated, I've worked jobs completely unrelated to my field (really just standard corporate 9-5 stuff), welcomed my son into the world, and got married. Financial pressures to pay down my wife's massive student loans and provide for our family have kept me firmly entrenched in this career, and I've unfortunately fallen out of communication with the professors I grew so close with during my undergraduate work.\n\nOnce my wife returned from her program in 2013, my emotional state gradually reverted to it's normal state, and in the summer of 2014 we decided I should leave my job in order to focus 100% on applying to graduate programs. We literally discovered we were pregnant on the day I was to put in my notice of resignation at work. Out of fear of not being able to provide for our family, I decided to stick it out at work a little longer.\n\nA \"little longer\" turned into 5 years, and I now I'm at the point where I want to make this my entire focus. I fortunately work in a position now where I have an extremely flexible schedule, and I can take time out of my day to focus entirely on relationship building, networking, and preparation for my application to graduate school.\n\nI'm incredibly anxious for the process, however, and feel a bit lost and alone in terms of where to start. My primary concern is how to address my years away from the field as I apply for programs. I fear that my age and my divergent career will dissuade programs from accepting me. Additionally, I don't know how to best reengage with my former professors to drum up some support on that front (or if that's even possible with some who may have retired in the time since). I live in a different area now, so getting together for coffee isn't really an option for me.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position in their experience? Or does anyone have any suggestions or advice as to how I should position myself as a candidate, and what I should be focused on along the way? I have taken my GREs in 2014 and did fine in both analytical writing and verbal reasoning (not so great in quantitative reasoning) - should I be considering retaking those as well?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated!",

I have experience with big data and a lot of things related to data science, so I want to test the waters by applying to some data science jobs. However, I'm sure I will need some letters of recommendation of some sort. How do I go about this without the department and my advisor becoming disinterested in me if I decide to stay? Testing the waters definitely might send a signal that I don't want to be here, but if I decide to stay I will still be all in. \n\nFor clarity this decision is partially motivated by recent family changes. My first born son is 4 months old, and my wife really hates her job and there isn't much opportunity in the area. She would be much happier somewhere else as a stay home mom, or having a part time job while focusing on being a mom. That is only possible somewhere where I make much more than the pathetic $20k stipend I make now. \n\nThe other motivation is driven by burnout/imposter syndrome. I spent all last summer studying hard for quals only expecting to fail or barely pass and I passed without even having an oral. For some reason in my mind passing quals should come with this newfound level of expertise, but I know that I'm just as little of an expert now as I was before then. I don't feel like an academic or that I belong here. And I feel like I slipped through the cracks of quals as a fraud that they think belongs. I also just have a hard time feeling like I have a contribution to my field. I'm good at being given data tasks and accomplishing them. But beyond that I can't motivate myself. Just getting out into a task oriented job might be better for my self-esteem and mental health.\n\nI appreciate all your advice!",

I go to North Carolina State University, a R1 university, my GPA is 3.92\n\nDemographics: I am a female, Asian-American first-generation college student who comes from a low-income middle class family (close to my state's qualifications for the \"poverty\" line).\n\nExperience: I have experience as a research assistant who assisted with research on aquatic stressors on aquatic macroinvertebrates, and I won a research grant from my university to conduct environmental engineering research last year.\n\nPurpose for an REU: (this isn't my Personal Letter or Statement of Purpose) I am seeking to participate in an REU because I would like to pursue a PhD and would like to learn as much as I can through research experiences in preparation for grad school. Right now, I would like to experience research outside of my home institution since I would like to explore graduate school options and other kinds of environmental/aquatic research, and the living expenses being covered would be incredibly helpful for me since I nor my family would have no way of paying for my living expenses.\n\nUnfortunately (or fortunately?), being at a R1 university and having had other previous research experiences, I am unsure as to how likely it would be for me to get accepted into an REU program. I understand that most of these programs seek underrepresented minorities from liberal arts or community colleges with little research experience, therefore I am seeking a realistic analysis on whether or not I can get accepted into an REU program. I was told by others that I should exclude the fact that I got a research grant, but I am unsure as to how to feel about fabricating the truth to make it seem as if I have had little research experience. I am at a loss for what to do, but I have to complete my personal statements by next Friday, and I am rather stressed about my odds of acceptance.\n\nAny advice would be greatly greatly appreciated. Just as a heads up: there are unfortunately not many other REUs with research/themes specific to the field I am going into (Non-marine Aquatic chemistry/ecology), so that is why I am only applying to 7 programs. Most other environmental REU programs are focused on forestry, climate change, or marine & coastal sciences as far as I can tell.",

Is this similar to graduate school or is graduate school worse?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHi all,\n\nI am currently in a intern research position and I am planning to attend graduate school in the Fall for materials science. In general, my internship has been.... challenging. For the most part, this entire year I have driven my entire project with little to no mentoring from my assigned mentor. It has honestly gotten to a point, where if I ask or try to talk to my mentor they would act like it was a pain for them to mentor me let alone talk to me about my project that they assigned me too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the rare occasion they do assign me work, they tell me to do one thing then when I finish it they tell me what I did was wrong and to repeat it but the way they wanted me to do it and it continues to be like that.  Along the same lines, if I give them an idea of what to do next they blow it off one week saying it is pointless but a month later they come to me saying they had a great idea and it was the thing I mentioned to them......\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did research for a good part of my undergraduate career and had excellent mentors who encouraged and challenged me to do well and meet my potential on a regular basis. But I also know that my current mentors behavior is more of what to expect from a science mentor but it also hard to care about what I am doing when they just don't care and tell me that I probably know more than him about my project then ignores me the rest of the time. They also criticize the relationship I have with my family ( I am very close to them) and encourages me on a regular basis that moving as far away from them is the best thing for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis entire situation is compounded by my PI. They are very temperamental, i.e. their feedback towards me depends on how they are feeling for that week. For example, one week they tell me I am a great student and have the mind of a scientist.  Then the next week, they say stuff like how they did me a favor by hiring me, I have no relevance to the team or project, and how if they wanted to be productive they wouldn't have hired me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I have talked to other members of the team about it they just tell me that it's normal and to never take anything our PI says seriously, this in of itself is concerning. I have honestly gotten emotional whiplash from how their mood/attitude changes at the drop of a hat. On top of the emotions, what they tell me vs what my mentor tells me is VERY different. So I get stuck in the middle of what my mentor wants vs what my PI wants. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hear on a regular basis of how graduate school is one of the worst experiences in someones lives and I will say now that I am more than willing to work crazy hours for research for shit pay because I genuinely enjoy research and learning about chemistry. But I am concerned that graduate school is going to be similar if not worse to my current experience. So my question is, is my current experience representative of graduate school or is there some hope that I will get some mentor-ship on how to be a better scientist? ",

Regardless of my instructional design, I still have to manage the classes and adjust. Plus, our district is moving towards the model of personalized learning used in Wisconsin, which so far seems to require a hell of a lot more decisions than traditional instruction methods. Long story to say that I think the Ritalin is helping to dampen the decision fatigue (it\u2019s easier to ignore 6 children calling my name or poking me or raising their hands while I finish helping one student) so I\u2019m less mentally and emotionally exhausted at the end of the work day.

I felt really bad about my situation and I didn\u2019t understand. I felt like I have gone through the trouble of getting through a challenging research-based masters program and a challenging (but fun!) R&D position in a reputable biotech company. But these other interviewees who are 5 years younger than me had efforts that were much more fruitful in getting into PhD programs. \n\nThe university that I interviewed at is far away from my family and unless I get my family on board, I likely won\u2019t attend if offered admission because my family is extremely dependent on me.

She diagnosed me with serotonin syndrome. I fortunately had an appointment with my psychiatrist the next evening and I sat in his office just shaking with these horrible tremors. He took me off the SSRI I was on (my dose increase prompted the initial symptom of insomnia) and gave me an antihistamine with a serotonin blocker and diazepam.  \n\nGrad school is my job. I\u2019m the breadwinner in a household of 4 (partner, 2 kids, me), living on a grad school stipend. Not going in to work was not an option. But I couldn\u2019t make in to TA because I was constantly gagging and shaking, couldn\u2019t do my research (currently doing brain surgeries on itty bitty brains), and the cognitive dysfunction makes it difficult to write my qualifier. \n\nOnce I received a diagnosis and proper meds I started feeling better. Well, I stopped shaking, started eating (ravenously), was able to sleep (like 18 hrs a day for the last week), and the GI issues have mostly subsided. However, the current meds I\u2019m on make me extremely dizzy, unable to concentrate or follow long conversations, and I\u2019m sooooo sleepy. I cannot drive because of how dizzy I am. \n\nI reached out for support. I told people what was going on and the steps I\u2019ve been taking to take care of myself. I was able to find a grad student willing to drive me to campus in the mornings. Two of the biology department admins have made arrangements to drive me home at night and pick up my kids from their schools. The graduate student support office is calling the department chair to explain what\u2019s going on with me. I\u2019ve reached out to the two people I TA for (one for lectures, one for labs) have been very accommodating and understanding. \n\nI almost dropped out of grad school my first year due to a rotation in a lab with an abusive advisor, and the passing of my father. I\u2019m a third year now and ideas are blossoming and I\u2019m looking forward to passing my qualifier (we\u2019ll get to my anxiety about that in a few months) and moving forward with my experiments. \n\nAbove all of that is my wonderful advisor. He\u2019s the best mentor I can ask for. He has allowed for me to have a work/life balance, I can ask him any question about anything and talk through it with him, and he\u2019s willing to let me take the lab in a new direction with my research. More than that, I was able to be open and honest about my struggles with mental illness and the steps I\u2019ve been taking over the last 4 years to address them. He, too, has anxiety and sleep problems and he was open with me about that. \n\nMy body and mind are fighting against me but I will persevere. I am blown away by how supportive everyone has been. It\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019m going to go cry and take a nap now. ",

I currently have a decent job 400 miles away from them and visit them once a month. They are already deeply depressed people especially since I moved 400 miles away 2 years ago. \n\nI have a few options: 1) I could just be selfish and pursue this PhD program on the other side of the country, 2) I could apply next year and try to get into a program in the same state. programs in this state are EXTREMELY competitive and there are no guarantees. I am already 26, which is older than the average PhD student.

I've narrowed down my list to the two: UCSF and UT Austin. Both of these schools have amazing programs (in fact they are ranked equally at #3 in the country) and offer so many great opportunities and I know that if I go to either I'll receive a great education that will set me up for my future career. The issue at hand here is location.\n\nMy home is SF. I love my city, all my friends and family live here, and it's all around a wonderful place to live. But, when I visited Austin, I did really like it. I'd never been to Texas before and I was pleasantly surprised by how cool it was.\n\nMy parents obviously want me to stay in the Bay Area. They make the case for staying nearer to home just to have the proximity to them and everything I've known. They also say I can save money by continuing to live at home (but to be honest I would like to move out and apply for school housing). In addition, I have an ailing grandfather, an aging dog, and close friends getting married in the Bay, and being closer to them would be valuable.\n\nBut I also liked Austin. I would really appreciate moving to a new city, as scary as it is. I've never lived on my own and I would like to strike out as a full-fledged adult. The cost of living is much cheaper in Austin, and once I establish residency in Texas, the tuition would be too. But, I'd also be alone since I have no family near the area. In the long run, I don't see myself living in Texas for my career, so everything would be temporary, but, where I would move after is a mystery for another day.\n\nWhat do you think? Where would you go if you had a choice between the two cities? Anyone from Austin, and for that matter the Bay Area, that can make the case for your city? Has anyone made the move from CA to TX and have any advice? Also, any tips on how to move out in general?\n\nLastly, the people that I've talked to also bring up the big weather component. SF is pretty mild year round, but what is Austin like?\n\nThank you!\n\n&#x200B;",

            "content": "This may be a lesser-experienced viewpoint in a sub full of graduate students, and it also might sound a little naive.\n\nI will soon be staring down my senior year as an undergrad biochem major and questioning what direction I want to go in after graduation. I've always been the type of person who'd take schoolwork over \"job work\" any day of the week--I'm introverted, really dislike jobs where I am required to interact with others, and have always found a lot of joy in all academic fields. I work as a tutor at my university and spend a shocking amount of my waking hours tucked away in the library. I chose to major in biochem not because i liked it more than politics or history or religion, but because my 18 year old self made this decision: science = money. \n\nI am less than taken with the idea of spending long days working in research labs for the rest of my life, but I know I couldn't work with patients in a medical setting. Where I currently stand, I'm more likely to abandon my daily molecular genetics reading for a history book or a novel. If I stay in the library too long I get restless and want to go for a long bike ride with a friend. \n\nI am, perhaps selfishly, uninterested in scientific research that may change or influence the world. I can't focus on one thing for too long. I am interested in living a life, not having a career. Which probably sounds so starry-eyed and ingenuous. But I want to have a house/apartment. I want a dog. I want to accomplish cool things like riding a bike across the country. But I want to have earnings that support that. \n\nSo my questions (finally) are these. 1) Will going into grad school (a PhD program) in a scientific field like biochem completely take over my life and allow me little time to think about and do other things? 2) What are the chances I could change fields for graduate school? Is it feasible to survive financially and get a graduate degree in a less demanding (maybe a humanities) field? I am a Chinese language minor, and go to a liberal arts school, so may have some prereqs for something else. And 3) how badly am i overreacting? I am concerned largely about financially supporting myself, and have considered taking a gap year before grad school to work and bike and maybe see what comes of it. Is this a good idea? But if I do it I should still probably apply to grad schools this fall/winter, right?\n\nAlso... 4) Are there alternatives to grad school that I should be considering? I've been inclined to go to grad school since I started undergrad because overall I like the environment of academia, and still do to a fairly large extent. I have older siblings who have regretted not going to grad school, and feel stuck now, and I don't want to end up feeling like that. \n\nThanks in advance! TL;DR I'm disillusioned with undergraduate life as a biochemistry major and want to do the kind of shit most young 20-somethings want to to do--travel, have their own life and freedom, etc.--so am contemplating an alternative to the intense research workload I will have to take on as a biochemistry PhD student.",

It's always been there, and I know its a habit instilled in me from when I was a kid.  My father would constantly call me stupid, dumb, an idiot, scum, you name it, he hates me for it.  Whatever went wrong, it was definitely my fault.  Now, I'm not saying he was right.  In fact, I cut off contact with him years ago because hes a toxic narcissist and I know its simply better to move on with my life.  And I feel like, to a large degree, I have moved on.  But one personality trait that has stuck with me throughout is my self-loathing/doubt.  I'm not at the top of my class(a GPA of only 3.21), I'm not at a top college, I'm older than most of my peers(33), and I often struggle with the material(especially the math).  \n\nI have, for much of my time in school, wanted to go to grad school(specifically genomics or similar), because the more science you know, the more you realize you don't know, which makes you want to know more, ad infinitum.  I LOVE all the new material, all the new, cool stuff we, as humans, are able to learn!  I do well with that material(genetics and life sciences), but I have no CS background, so that is a clear hindrance to a genomics program.  I know I'm not a *bad* person, but I just feel dumb.  I look at my fellow classmates and especially at my professors and I just think, \"How the hell could I ever be smart enough to be one of them?\"  I constantly call myself stupid, dumb, idiotic, or my most common self-retort; \"A fuckin' retard.\"  Both an offensive term and a horrible thing to call myself.  And of course the biggest problem is that I believe it.  \n\nI know I could get by in life being a nice person.  Theres nothing wrong with that, it would make me a perfectly ok human being, other humans would be fine with me just doing me, and no one would think I lived an unacceptable life.  I could continue my current career(as a med lab tech), where I am a \"scientist,\" ie a glorified button pusher at a hospital lab.  \n\nBut I want more from my science career.  I dream of contributing something, ANYTHING, to humanities repository of knowledge.  To know that I helped move us along, even if just a tiny bit.  I really want to contribute something, but I honestly don't think I'm smart enough to be one of the big egg-heads contributing to the general knowledge of the world.  Not to mention I hear every other day in here about how difficult grad school truly is, how taxing it is on peoples mental health, and I am almost certain I am not of the caliber required.  I have, like an idiot, mentioned my grad school aspirations to others, who now constantly say positive things towards the prospect.  My sig other truly believes in me; But she and these other laypersons have no idea what it really takes to be a top academic!  They vastly overestimate my abilities, because that how humans are; a never ending high five, pat on the back, you can do it! culture.  They are not realists.  They do not see peoples actual limits, or at the very least are willfully ignorant of them.\n\nAs I get to the end of this rambling post, I guess I should get to the point.  How do I stop being so self-depricating?  Anyone else here suffer from an extreme lack of self confidence?  Has it sabotaged your grad school goals, or were you able to overcome your doubt and grow past it?  \n\nThanks in advance for any time and advice anyone is willing to give.",

My job offers tuition reimbursement so I figured it was the perfect time to continue my education. The way the program works is 5 courses a year 2 to in the spring, 1 in the fall, and 2 in the fall. I applied for one of the graduate certificates(15 credits) I've always had an interest in(Programming and Web Development) in fall 2018 so I would have graduated in summer 2019. However I found out that I didn't get tuition reimbursement benefits until after 6 months after my hire date, so I ended up starting in October instead of August. I absolutely hated my first course(an aesthetics course). I'm in my second course now(a coding course) and while I do like it I feel like its too basic to have any practical application to my career.  My certificate has 3 required course and 2 electives and I've done 1 elective and I'm in my first required course, the problem is that for the next term(spring 2) none of the required course or the elective I'm interested in was offered. In addition it turns out that my tuition reimbursement covers the costs of just under 2 courses(bummer but still worth it). I decided to skip the one coursed that was offered next term(an advanced coding class) because the elective I'm interested in(database management course) is too important to my career right now. So Now I'm graduating at the end of 2019 instead of the summer and it sucks.\n\nIts a big deal because I'm also applying for a masters degree(Information System degree) and the way it works is I can apply the credits from my certificate to my degree. What I originally wanted to do was the masters in Information Systems with an option in Intelligence(did something similar in my undergraduate degree) but since I'm already doing my first certificate not in Intelligence, I would have ended up graduating at the end of 2021. I just couldn't do that! So instead I decided to(this happened yesterday) to do a degree with no Option and instead doing a graduate certificate in Intelligence Analysis after I'm done with my degree.\n\nOverall I think this is what is best for me, its just not taking a course next term(starts on Wednesday) and changing my program just has me feeling uneasy. My academic advisers are completely unresponsive over the weekend and I don't know anyone else in school for this industry so I've just been feeling very alone in this process. I plan to make the most of my time off but I feel down and now have a hard time motivating myself to finish my current course. I know I wrote a lot so thank you for reading and I appreciate any words of wisdom you may have for me.",

You'll figure it out though.\" Or, \"That's not my expertise, why don't you ask *other faculty who turns out to also have no experience doing this*.\"\n\nI feel like I'm not really back in grad school, I'm just taking whichever semi-relevant classes are actually offered each semester and doing what amounts to underpaid modeling work for the grant, without getting the skills and knowledge I need to do my own research.\n\nFor every research question I've come up with that could fit into the requirements of the grant, I've either found out it's been done before, after digging deeper into the lit, or I don't have the resources to actually complete the research. Even the project I'm working on for the grant (which is very established but doesn't transfer to an interesting research topic) doesn't have the resources/data requirements that we need to complete what was proposed and expected to be delivered by the funding source.\n\nI'm kind of at my wit's end with this, I think. I want the end results of what the program will give me, being the degree, skills, and qualifications for future jobs. I'm sure I can suck it up and get three publications out of what I'm doing for the grant, but that will only get me the degree and some relevant skills, but not the skills I came here to get, and I'm not sure that's worth it. And I'm not sure how much the time between now and completing the program will wear on me if the situation doesn't improve and I'm still left to figure out everything for myself without a nudge in the right direction.\n\nAlso, I don't think I'll find a job with my current qualifications doing what really interests me (I tried before coming back to school). But, there are jobs that I'm qualified for out there right now, they just aren't exactly what I'm after.\n\nJust writing this out has helped me think through things. Ideally, I want to stay and make this work, but I'm frustrated with the situation and I need that to improve in order to make it through with my sanity.\n\nSo, some questions for people who read through all this and maybe experienced something similar:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHow do you deal with generally unhelpful advising/mentoring?\n\nHow do you deal with a grant where your deliverables turned out to be pretty different from what was originally described and not necessarily, ...well, deliverable?\n\nIf you left grad school, what pushed you to that decision?\n\nDid you have a job lined up before leaving or did you leave and then find one after the fact? How did you explain your choice of leaving to the people doing the hiring?\n\nIf you heavily considered leaving but stayed, why did you decide to stay?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks in a advance.",

The university has offered him a small reimbursement to help defray travel costs, but it won\u2019t even cover half of what it would cost for both of us to make the trip. They also offered to put him up with a grad student though with both of us visiting, we will probably get a hotel for one night (total trip cost a little over $1k). I think it is important for me to also visit to see if it makes sense to uproot my life and career to move 3k miles away with him...is it totally inappropriate for him to ask whether there might be an additional budget for them to help cover my travel costs as well? In my mind, he\u2019s already been accepted and the worst they can say is \u201cno\u201d but obviously they don\u2019t necessarily have any reason to offer funds for a spouse to visit as well. Anyone have experience or advice with this?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been informed this is a terrible idea so will not ask for any additional help with travel costs.

I couldn't even bring myself to apply for a grant that my advisor suggested.\n\nI came into this semester still burnt out. I've come to realize that I just... Want to be done. I want a 9-5 with a wage above poverty level. \n\nI feel terrible... I like my advisor and I like working with her. But I don't think I can do this anymore.\n\nMy advisor is currently giving me leeway because my credit load is huge right now. In March she wants to start talking about my summer plans. So what do I do?\n\nI want to finish out the semester. She's leaning on me for the class I'm TA-ing for her. I can keep getting paid and finish out my classes and surrender the position. I don't think I'll ever want to come back.\n\nI'm looking at jobs. Applications are going to keep closing during the semester. I can miss out on a lot of good opportunities. When do I start applying? How do I disclose my current status as a graduate student looking to exit academia?\n\nHow do I do this?\n\n***\n\nBackstory:\n\nI'm about 90% confident that I want to drop out. The reasons I have for not dropping out aren't for me. They're reasons like: \"I can't let my advisor down.\" \"My family would be so disappointed.\" \"I've never quit anything before.\" and \"I like this town.\"\n\nTo summarize, I entered my program in Fall 2016 as an MS student. I battled a lot of mental health and personal issues throughout my first year. I didn't disclose much to my advisor. Mostly I told her if I was struggling with my health and I did tell her I had been \"the victim of a couple of crimes\" since coming to this town. We also worked it so my class load would be lighter in Fall 2017 while I continued to collect data. So it boils down to I would be struggling and tell her if I had to push a thing or two off because of mental or physical health and if I had a doctor or therapy appointment to help me out. I was ultimately diagnosed with PTSD in 2017 (by two separate therapists) but I never told her.\n\nMy thesis was the first for this HUGE project that a few departments and a government organization are collaborating on. I was enjoying it, even though I bit off more than I could chew. (It ended up getting whittled down a lot.) To keep me funded for summer 2018, I got an internship with the government organization with the help of my advisors.\n\nMy advisor asked me in Fall 2017 if I would consider staying on for a PhD student. She has never had a PhD student and thought I would be a great candidate. I tried to talk it through with a lot of people in my life and got little to no advice. Just a Nike slogan and a pat on the back. So I applied and got accepted, fully funded. \n\nI was allowed to defer my acceptance to Spring 2019 while I finished my internship and thesis. It felt like the department was making a lot of allowances for me. Some things turned into \"we'll just address that during your PhD.\" Also, I got in just under the wire. The department is strapped for funds and getting funded for the PhD is turning out to be very difficult.",

On the other hand, I'm incredibly burnt out. I worked all weekend to meet a personal deadline, but did so very slowly because it was so hard to focus. part of it is that every task feels extremely overwhelming, and multitasking has been really hard.

Essentially, my dose of SSRI was increased and I experienced extremely negative physical symptoms for a month before being diagnosed. They immediately took me off the SSRI. Now that the SS symptoms have dissipated, I\u2019m now experiencing severe panic and depression. My psychiatrist is currently treating me for comorbidity (panic disorder, bipolar 2, depression, and OCD). \n\n\nI\u2019m a third year. I\u2019ve designed several experiments I am genuinely excited to get underway and am working to get them set up. When I started my PhD, it was expected that students pass their qualifying exams by the end of their 3rd year. When the cohort that came in behind me started, those conditions changed and they have to pass the exam by the end of their second year. \n\n\nBecause of my physical/mental issues, I am having cognitive issues. I can\u2019t focus for long periods of time. It was suggested by the director of graduate students that I seek an accommodation. My psychiatrist also agrees, and says it will take months to get me back to stable. He is going to write an accommodation asking that I receive extra time on assignments (meaning my qualifier and a seminar presentation), and perhaps the ability to use notes for these. \n\n\nIn the meantime I\u2019m attending seminars, have been able to get back to research, and am fulfilling my TA duties. I\u2019m still working on my qualifier, albeit at a slower pace than I was before the SS. But I\u2019m watching my cohort and the second years scheduling and passing their qualifying exams. There have been whispers around the department that I\u2019m not well (other students noticed my shaking and inability to carry on conversations, as well as being out quite a bit during the month I dealt with SS). \n\n\nI\u2019m so embarrassed that things have gotten to this point. I feel like a hassle to my committee members and I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll judge me for not getting my qualifier done at the same time as everyone else. I feel incompetent because everyone else is passing and defending their qualifiers, and it may take me longer. I fear what my cohort is going to say and think about me when I haven\u2019t passed and they have. I\u2019m worried about the stigma surrounding my need for accommodations. \n\n\nI don\u2019t want to face anyone because I spontaneously burst into tears. I\u2019ve been hiding away in the darkest corner of the library chipping slowly away at my qualifier. I\u2019m working weekends in the lab because I\u2019m embarrassed to face my colleagues. *I\u2019m still pushing through despite everything.*\n\n\nI can\u2019t take a leave of absence because I\u2019m the breadwinner in our household and have 2 kids to support. \n\n\nMy advisor has been very understanding about all of this and I\u2019ve been proactive and open and honest with how I\u2019m progressing on my qualifier and research, and he\u2019s okay with it. It\u2019s the rest of the department that I\u2019m worried about. \n\n\nTl;dr: I have had mental illness for years that was managed but have now declined to a debilitating state.

            "content": "I'm not really looking for advice here, as much as a place to just vent / confess.\n\nI'm a PhD student in year 5+ of my program. I have felt like I've been spinning my wheels and going nowhere since year ~2 or so. Around the start of year 3 I seriously considered mastering out. I spoke to my family, dept counselor/coordinator person, professors I know from courses/undergrad, etc, and couldn't find a single voice in favor of quitting. I like to imagine that if I had found even one opinion to latch on to I might have had the courage to do it, but I figured that if literally everyone in my life said it was a bad idea, I should listen. Or at least, I was able to justify my inaction by this reasoning. So I \"stuck with it\".\n\nI put \"stuck with it\" in quotes because I never really put in the effort to make it go anywhere. I have just existed on cruise control, drawing a stipend and producing work on an as-needed basis. I have an almost entirely absentee advisor, so it's been easy to take work as it comes up in fits and spurts. Occasionally working more-than-full-time weeks to make a submission deadline or a funding application, but more often than not just answering emails and dealing with TA stuff and minor issues as they come up. With a lot of variability, I would say I've been working 5-10 hours a week (or sometimes less) on average for several years.\n\nThere were always other small things to do than to work on my own proposal / thesis work. I like to say my advisor pushed me away from working on this to grant-related projects / new funding proposals, etc, and there's a degree to which that's true. He always had other priorities for me to be working on, and didn't actually sit down with me to even start discussing putting together a thesis / thesis committee until somewhere my late 4th or 5th year. But the truth is I could have pushed the issue, moved things along. I could have been more self-directed, but I didn't want to deal with it. If I'd put even an hour a week into it I could be in much better shape now.\n\nI also have a serious problem with grad school related anxiety and avoidance. Whenever there's something that's too big for me to get my head around in a sitting I procrastinate, avoid, dissemble, even outright lie to avoid the \"scary\" part of starting with it. Usually, it's just a self-preservation instinct and a strong sense of panic that drives me to eventually get some work done. After some concerning personal experiences and introspection, last month I finally went ahead and sought mental health care to try and help with these and other personal issues. My doc prescribed some meds that have actually had a great effect and made me feel better in a lot of ways, but this hasn't helped my productivity at all. If anything, it might have hurt a little. Bug-eyed panic might not be a healthy way to work, but at least work gets done. Now I just feel a bit better / more calm about letting undone tasks loom overhead. (At least I presume the meds are responsible for the internal change - I suppose it's possible that I've coincidentally just burned out and given up at the exact same time, but that seems less likely.)\n\nI should point out, it's not like I haven't done *anything* in my years here. I have one first-author journal article, a fistful of first author conference pubs, and a bunch of miscellaneous other deliverables to show for my time. Imposter syndrome is one thing, but I'm not a complete fraud. I've just never put in the time or effort to integrate that work, extend it into anything cohesive or thesis-shaped, or really do anything at all beyond the sparse deliverables I was being checked against.\n\nNow, after 5+ years of this, my department has suddenly taken notice of the fact that I don't have a committee or proposal and wants to meet to figure out what the hell's going on. I'm supposed to be working on a draft of my proposal even as I'm typing this up. It's in okay shape, if a little all-over-the-place and lacking any strong unifying principle (much like myself). I'll send something to my boss tonight so he can take a look.\n\nI don't have any good advice on how not to end up in this position, or any kind of happy ending or lesson to share (other than \"don't end up like this\"). But I don't know what's going to happen this week, with my advisor and the department, and wanted to get things straight (just for me, in my own head) by writing it out here. Confession is good for the soul, or something.\n\nThanks for reading",

Sorry for the strange grammar, English is not my mother tongue.\n\nI\u2018ve got an offer to start an external PhD in the area of blockchain/crypto economics, so I\u2018d neither be paid nor somehow employed by the university. I\u2018d need to complete courses which correspond to \\~13-14 ECTS before being able to officially hand in the result of 3 years work, which in this case would be 3 papers.\n\nMy background is in finance and accounting, I am working in the insurance industry since the beginning of the year and am pretty well paid here. Before that, I was at a company which invested in cryptocurrencies and that\u2018s where I met the prof who is offering me to start the PhD. We get along very nicely, he is a great dude and reaffirmed that he\u2018d be happy to have me several times.\n\nI\u2018d feel great to start the PhD, and it should easily be possible for me to reduce my workload to 80%, maybe even 70% so I can work on my PhD in the remaining time.\n\nWhat hinders me is the corresponding pay cut, it would be tough to keep the \u201aliving standard\u2018 since I\u2018m married and need to support my parents as well. My wife works part time but needs to cut back due to the physically hard work (nurse at a home for aged), so her income stream is not safe.\n\nWell, it\u2018s late here and I\u2018m tired - what do you guys think:\n\n* does it make sense to start a PhD given the circumstances?\n* would you risk to start a PhD in a risky field like blockchain economics? Risky in terms of unsure whether it will be of any use in the future\n* what else should I consider?\n\nThank you guys",

            "title": "When did graduate actually school become hell?",
            "content": "Need to just throw some words on the wall and see what sticks. Check my perspective a bit. \n\nBackground\n\nI completed my PhD in inorganic chemistry almost five years ago. My department was wrought with problems but it was pretty easy to do the work, get the grades, write, and get out. Publishing was a different issue and a beef I never really settled with my PI but it\u2019s fizzled out by now. \n\nI have a job, I am the income earner for my family, I live in/near one of the most expensive metropolitan areas in the US. \n\nMy observations on the subject\n\nMy partner is a graduate student (doctoral candidate) in communication. Year six is coming to an end and it looks like graduation will happen in 2019 (we are excited). \n\nMy partner realized after four years it was time to change advisors. The department had a very toxic culture to it. My partner\u2019s advisor was one of those who criticizes any workplace/climate studies because he doesn\u2019t see the problem. \n\nTurns out he is part of the problem. \n\nIn those four years everything was going well in spite of the toxic nature. Suddenly, as time came to write the dissertation the advisor was suddenly unavailable, slow to respond, personally harsh in criticisms, and offered improvements that had nothing to do with the dissertation. \n\nAll I can figure was the advisors personal life was destabilizing his professional life. He was split between jobs, a professor and VP of a national society for communication. His wife was chair and was militantly trying to control the department and reinstate dates policies and procedures (of which the university had dropped before she took the chair position) and leading the workplace study. He had two adopted children that were getting ready to move out, and I believe the board was scrutinizing resources and teaching loads. He is now back in the classroom as a new policy swept across the university requiring teaching at least one class. \n\nI believe he let all of the disarray and chaos get the best of him, but I don\u2019t think he was the most empathetic person to begin with. \n\nJust my observations and deduced opinions. \n\nIn all this,  the damage is done. My partner took a whole year to summon the courage and self worth that it is not right to be treated this way. \n\nNeglect, unfair criticism, and abuse of power and trust have eroded my partners motivation, confidence, trust, and writing skills. Anxiety, depression, and mania are weekly if not daily struggles. \n\nThe new advisor is daylight to the old advisors black out. Trust has been restored but the confidence, skills, and emotional turbulence remain. \n\nOh, we had a kid in all of this too. \n\nThe daily struggle between school, parenting, daily responsibilities, and our relationship is always ready to boil over. \n\nI know as my partner finishes, healing will continue and things can get better(they could stay the same or get worse I suppose, but I\u2019m an optimist on this subject).\n\nBut watching my partner be brought to tears because of the self doubt swelling while trying to write a cover letter for a job that is a sure fit, it\u2019s gut wrenching. \n\nWhen did graduate school get to be hell?! I\u2019ve read the horror stories and had a few friends struggle, but nothing like this. Meanwhile, I\u2019m burning at both ends, tending to the child overnight, going to work in the morning, coming home and cooking dinner, leading bathtime, bedtime, and then if not too late tackling the always there household chores. \n\nThe psychological damage of a toxic advisor relationship ripples through the student and into their personal life. I have never experienced personally or in witness, anything like this. I have always regarded toxic relationships as a known bad, but now I hurt for those who endure, suffer, and escape them whether they are at home, work, or school. \n\nThings will change, if not for me, hopefully for the rest of those in grad school as transparency increases and more share their stories. I hope, those that go on into academia become inspired to be the ones to break the circle of abuse. \n\nIt\u2019s been a hard morning.  Guess I should go back to work. For all those on this sub that have had similar or worse experiences. I offer my sympathies and, if it matters, encourage you to rise above. You are worth it. \n",

            "title": "Why I\u2019m leaving my biochemistry PhD program [rant]",
            "content": "In my junior year of college, my undergraduate advisor referred to his time at graduate school \u201cthe best years of \\[his\\] life.\u201d My experience here fell far short of what my professor led me to expect. These last four years have instead been the most miserable ones of my entire life. My expectations for my academic career here were entirely dashed, mostly because of a noticeable lack of a support structure.\n\nMy first consideration for leaving the program actually came even before I qualified. Throughout my first and second year, I experienced repeated rejection and bullying, especially from my cohort and classmates, the likes of which I haven\u2019t experienced since middle school. After a first-year class workshop where we discussed research papers, an acquaintance told me that other classmates were saying \u201cthe girl with the glasses and the deep voice\u201d was \u201cfighting with the TA\u201d when I was having a polite academic disagreement about a point in the paper. After that instance, I stopped wanting to participate in debates and ask questions in class. Slowly, my cohort stopped inviting me to lunch with them as I struggled to \u201cfit in.\u201d By my first February, I remember openly crying in the Molecular Biology class after hearing my yearmates discussing what a fun time they had playing D&D together at a board game night to which everyone from my year was invited except for me. At a poster session, speaking my native language to another classmate, one of my cohort stopped to make unusual comments that made me feel unwelcome and like I didn\u2019t belong. I noticed I was being laughed at when I wasn\u2019t looking, and pretty much everyone stopped greeting me in the hall. I had no friends in my program by the end of my first year and I was extremely lonely. I would begin to exhibit my first symptoms of depression the following fall. I began to link my self-esteem and self-image to my performance in the lab, thinking that if I performed well in my career I would like myself more. Unfortunately, I had applied to the prestigious NSF-GRFP fellowship grant and been rejected. I then applied to an in-house travel grant, something other students had told me was an easy grant that is freely given to everyone who applies, and was subsequently denied because I didn\u2019t understand the prompt and completely missed the objective. These rejections further discouraged me. I had told myself that I didn\u2019t deserve these awards because I was a bad scientist, and thus a bad person. By that winter, I had actively returned to self-harm as a coping mechanism and had suicidal thoughts on an almost daily basis. I stopped drawing and cancelled my piano lessons, as I could no longer enjoy them and felt guilty that I was taking time out of the lab to do something fun.\n\nMy breaking point where I actually decided to leave was after my presentation in a class in my second year. I had worked so hard on my presentation, spent hours on my slides, and expected at least a decent evaluation. I was fully in the throes of my depression at this point. My self-esteem at that point was basically non-existent, and the brutal and mean anonymous peer evaluations after my presentation obliterated whatever I had left. Having to read the rude and unfair criticism from people who just clearly disliked me was awful and hurtful. It felt like everyone in the course was just seeking to put others down. It seemed as though the course itself was not designed in any sort of pedagogy in mind. Five minutes of faculty feedback after my presentation was not even a little sufficient for me to get any learning out of the course. I felt as though I could not redeem myself after performing poorly and continued to spiral into a chronic state of embarrassment and shame. The week after I presented, I had a panic attack just being in the classroom, reliving that traumatic scenario, and stepped out to hyperventilate and cry in the bathroom down the hall. I thought of myself as human trash, deserving only of punishment, pain, and sadness.\n\nI did take the step to see a university therapist to improve my mental health symptoms, especially since at this point it was starting to interfere with my performance in lab. I was struck with crippling fear when it came time to leave the house for me to go to lab; I became distracted and forgetful when setting up reactions, constantly messing up the volumes and getting frustrated; I could no longer do quick mental math calculations with speed and ease; I was sleeping too long and eating almost nothing. My experience with the counseling center was generally positive; my weekly therapist helped me get through that tough second winter. This was also the first time in my life I began treatment with antidepressants. What was unfortunate for me, however, was that I was only allowed 10 sessions with her annually before I was forced to be referred to a therapist \u201cin the community\u201d, which was a subtle way of saying, \u201cwe cannot care for you anymore.\u201d It is clear that these 10 sessions are designed with the undergraduate community in mind, where seeing a therapist 10 times in a 12-week semester is appropriate, not with the graduate community who is in residence here for five times that duration annually. I definitely felt as though my condition was stigmatized here; explaining to my labmate that it was difficult for me to come to lab on time because I was depressed, she suggested to \u201cgo home and do something nice for yourself like take a hot bath\u201d and questioned, \u201cdo you really *need* antidepressants?\u201d After her unsympathetic reaction, I didn\u2019t want anyone to treat me differently, doubt me, or fire me because I was depressed, so I told no one else about it, especially not my advisor. I began reading about mental illnesses in the graduate student population and was surprised to learn that grad students are highly at risk for depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and suicide, since no one had ever mentioned mental health problems or told me about student accommodations for mental illness while attending grad school. Attending grad school is actually a significant mental health risk, and no one in the administration seemed to even be aware of this, let alone take steps to prevent their students from developing mental illnesses. I felt completely alone. My depression improved in the summer and I was able to get enough done to prepare a qualifying exam proposal, but by that point I knew this was not a place I imagined myself belonging anymore.\n\nI began to look for jobs immediately after passing my qual. I even got an interview with the crime lab downtown as a DNA analyst, but didn\u2019t end up getting the job. Unfortunately, there were not many jobs for scientists not at my university, as I didn\u2019t want to alert anyone here about my plans to leave.\n\nMy lab situation has contributed to my desire to leave. I was disappointed with my lab experience too. In my second year, my advisor failed to submit a recommendation for the NSF-GRFP grant in time, something that obviously hurt my application. I was not put on the path to publication early on. I was given high-risk projects that would not result in publication even if they were successful. I wasted months on hand-me-down projects that failed in other group members hands that were only tangentially related to my thesis work. I didn\u2019t feel as though my work was respected or appreciated. In the last year especially, our lab dynamic has further deteriorated. After losing funding, our lab became unstructured and disorganized quickly. We stopped having lab meetings, let our technician go, and no new students joined after me. I had very little mentoring with regard to my career plans and the publications I would need to achieve my career goals later on. While my classmates are publishing first author papers or have already published at least a middle author paper by their fourth year, I am ashamed to say that I haven\u2019t, which has been difficult for me to accept, and is still something I\u2019m working toward and trying to change before I leave here.\n\nMy greatest joy in these dark years was my husband, Jack, who is the light of my life. I met him here in the December of my first year and we married almost exactly three years later. During all my worst moments here, he has been there to share his light with me. When I was having a panic attack, he ran from his lab to hold me and give me water when I was shaking. He deals with my depression so well even when that includes being irritable to him. He boosts my self-esteem and makes me believe that I deserve to be happy. His upcoming defense and subsequent exit was the perfect, extremely reasonable excuse for me to leave. He is the only person who believed in me and enabled me to get even *this* far.\n\nLooking back, I see where there could have been opportunities for mentorship by people I should have looked up to. Oftentimes, when listening to inspiring speakers who have overcome challenges in their careers, they say something along the lines of \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without my advisor/mentor who supported me in my tough times.\u201d I honestly cannot think of one person with whom I interacted that I would describe as a real mentor and champion of my success here. It really seemed like no one in a position of power ever took the time to get to know me or fight for me, let alone advise me. I spoke with my committee members on an annual basis, who were understandably busy with their own labs for the entire rest of the year. My first time talking one-on-one with the graduate program director was when I announced my intention to leave. I had no female role models even though it appeared that promoting \u201cwomen in science\u201d was a major focus of the program when I was applying and was a major factor in me choosing to attend this institution. No one throughout the course of my time here has ever asked me, \u201cHow are you?\u201d and really meant it.\n\nOf course, the last thing I want to do is make excuses for myself. I don\u2019t intend to blame all my shortcomings on others. I just wish I had found the support that I needed to be successful here. Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case, and I hope I can find that support somewhere else in the future, even if that is a different graduate school. I believe that I am good enough and smart enough to earn a PhD and do good science, but I am only as good as those who take the effort to put me on a trajectory to success. With zero publications to my name, it\u2019s just not realistic for me to get a competitive postdoc at a top institution like I wanted even if I did finish my degree. \u201cGood enough\u201d was not good enough for me \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to \u201cjust get through\u201d graduate school and force myself to barely stay afloat in a place where I was not offered the critical support I needed to excel. I imagine if all those inspiring people had their great support network taken away from them, they would probably be in a situation similar to mine. If the strongest person had lived through even one of the negative experiences I did while I was here, it wouldn\u2019t be an unusual reason to leave. I\u2019m honestly surprised that I got this far and proud of myself for surviving. I know my story isn\u2019t the only one since the dropout rate from graduate school is astronomically high, but I hope my sharing my experience can explain the motivation behind why some of us chose not to continue and maybe inspire some lasting meaningful change too. Some have told me that sticking through it and suffering daily to get a PhD is ultimately worth it and an investment in myself. I offer this statement in response: changing my trajectory and terminating my studies is my expression of self-respect which is ultimately the greatest investment in myself I can make.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I'm quitting my PhD program 4 years in because I hate it here and it's the honestly the best thing I can do for myself",

They're both pretty good programs but I'm at an impasse for which one to pick.\n\nProgram A is rated higher and in a nicer city. It has great research and students seem nice but really driven and potentially not as close. Potentially higher stress. The leadership seems dedicated to get to the top 10 in the field (it's hovering just outside it right now). A professor from the program is aggressively recruiting me but other students have told me to avoid the guy. I didn't 'click' with any of the people I interviewed with, but I only interviewed with 4, out of 100+ training faculty. Program A would also be closer to where my SO lives but both are a plane ride away.  \n  \nProgram B is also rated well and well known but not as competitive. The city it's in is not in my top choices to live, it's very cold with long winters, which will probably be hell on my SAD. However, the students are really close and friendly and they have more focus on teaching and pedagogy. I'm not sure if I want to go into academia or not but program B gives me more resources to explore options. There was also a \"red flag\" prof I spoke to but he wasn't in my field. There were some professors I could definitely imagine myself working with.  \n  \nBoth a good schools with great research resources and similar stipend to CoL ratio.

I love painting, and since I have graduated I have kept up a pretty consistent practice, shown a few times, taken a few commissions, sold a few pieces, etc. The job I have now is my first well paying job with artistic undertones and door-opening capabilities, before this I worked in restaurants. With that said, *this is just not what I want to be doing*.  I could, however, happily see myself as a college art professor. I come to this realization with hesitation, because I am a a mom of a 3 year old, working full time (as does my husband) and still barely making ends meet.

            "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI have a lot I need to get off my chest and no one to really vent too. Hope you kind folks don\u2019t mind. I apologize in advance for the length. \n\nI\u2019m in my final semester of my PhD in microbiology. A few weeks after I picked my lab, my advisor was offered a VP position with the university. I went from seeing him everyday to seeing him about once a semester, just like that. So, from the beginning he\u2019s been distant, hard to reach, and impossible to communicate with He just doesn\u2019t seem to care about his lab at all. On top of that, the person who started my project left after only one semester of training me, so I\u2019ve often felt like I was floating in a sea of confusion trying to figure out how to even do a single thing I was supposed to be doing. \n\nAfter years of hard work, I\u2019ve finally produced enough data for two papers. I put together the first one and sent it to our lab manager/grant writer and one of my committee members for review. Once they finished I sent it to a second committee member. He went nuts. He put this paper through 10 revisions. After the first two he was pretty much just editing his own edits. All in all, it took over two months for all these revisions to occur. And, on top of that, his writing is just bad! He changes perfectly coherent sentences to a mess that makes no sense. And if I refuse the change, he tells me that \u201che knows what he\u2019s doing\u201d and to \u201cjust listen and learn\u201d \n\nFinally, my lab manager said fuck it and submitted the paper. Now, you\u2019ll notice, my advisor isn\u2019t on this list of people who edited it. I sent him every version, but never got more than a \u201cgood, keep me updated\u201d in response. And, last night, I get a rejection letter. One of the reasons cited was lack of a specific experiment I suggested we do but was shot down! Another reason, amazingly, was \u201cmediocre writing\u201d. Ten revisions!!!! I\u2019m so mad!!! \n\nAnd, it isn\u2019t just me. The other PhD student in my lab just went through the same experience, except he doesn\u2019t work as closely with the lab manager so no one stepped in. His paper went through 16 revisions with this guy and has now been rejected twice! We\u2019re both at a loss for what to do. This is both of our first papers and we feel that our mentors should be showing us how to do this successfully in the future, not setting us up for failure and then blaming it on us. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s not even the point of this post. I found a perfect postdoc. It\u2019s a female PI (all I want is to stop being surrounded by old men who love to yell), in a perfect location, at a good school, doing a project that is exactly the kind of work I want to transition into. The PI and I jived really well and she offered me the position.\n\nI told her during the interview that my first paper was being put out soon and that I have a second one in the works. Now, I have a rejected paper and the second one was just turned in to my committee. But, at this point, I\u2019m terrified that neither will come out before I graduate. And, my lab is out of money (meaning they couldn\u2019t pay me to stay and finish even if I wanted to) and word has spread about how dysfunctional we are so when I (and the master student I work with) graduate in May, there will be no one left on our project. So, no one will be around to finish any experiments that need to be done if reviewers ask for them. I\u2019m also incredibly terrified that I\u2019ll have to tell the women offering me the postdoc this and that she will rescind the offer. \n\nI have struggled so much, worked so hard, sacrifices my health and sanity for this damn project. The only thing that got me through all of the shitty, petty, bullshit that happens in my lab was that at the end of the day, I would have my PhD and I could move on to better things. And now I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re going to screw that over too and I\u2019m going to have a meaningless PhD with no publications and no job to go to. \n\nTLDR: my advisor sucks, my committee member massacred my paper which is now rejected from the journal we submitted too, and I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll graduate with no publications and lose out on a fantastic postdoc opportunity   ",

            "content": "I started teaching my first course in January. I felt ready for the job, but I was working full time on my thesis as well to get it done as quickly as possible and devote my time to the course. I worked all through the holidays. The only thing I prepared was the course outline. From then on I'd have to prepare each course one at a time. This would take three days. \n\nI finally submitted my thesis 3 weeks ago, meaning I worked non-stop on it til mid-February, while trying to prepare classes. My supervisor did a Wonder Woman job and sent it back a week later. I was expecting to have a full month. The good news is she thought the thesis rocked. The bad news is I already had revisions to take care of so the extra time I thought I'd have never happened.\n\nOn one occasion, I cancelled the class one day prior due to the \"flu\". I just couldn't do it. I was a mess of anxiety. Last week I had a breakdown and my friend offered so kindly to take my place. I thought I would be able to get on top of things for this week. I start prepping this morning and start crying for the nth time in the last month. Despite two classes off I never recuperated, which makes me feel like a bigger failure.\n\nI decided to finally email my supervisor to explain the situation. She doesn't know about the two lectures I didn't give and I'm completely overwhelmed by the anxiety of lying (or not offering the information). She offered to speak to the course coordinator after asking several times if I was sure I couldn't keep doing it. I've heard a lot of people say recently that I just have to relax, it will be ok. It's not ok. I told my supervisor I was afraid she'd tell me to take a break from the thesis too since she might decide I was no longer apt to do anything. She did not say that, so that part is ok.\n\nNow I'm waiting for the sky to fall on me when the coordinator calls. I can forget about teaching again I guess. I should have asked for help from the start so part of this is on me. This has huge financial consequences as I can barely make ends meet currently.\n\nThanks for reading. Academia is so demanding. I'm thinking of all of you who feel like me. ",

            "content": "I just had a conversation with my advisor today and it hit me hard. He is a very nice and gentle person, but he straight told me today that I'm not productive enough and he's bothered by it. As for me, I personally wanted to do research and go to academia, but I know I have come across a few obstacles that I don't know how to solve. These obstacles seriously affected my productivity. And if I didn't overcome these obstacles, I don't think I would get the endorsement as a researcher from my advisor.\n\n1. I get stuck in research a lot. Sometimes the paper is too difficult to understand (I do theoretical research) and it might take days for me to understand it. However, my advisor only thinks I'm productive if I had actual progress with the project I'm working on. I wish I could read/understand it faster but I don't know how to.\n\n2. When my project comes across an obstacle, I suddenly feel \"traumatized\" and my mind freezes. I start to ruminate. I think there must be something wrong with me. My mind becomes foggy and I couldn't think of a solution. My mind starts to wander and I started doing something else such as browsing reddit. I don't know how to recover from the \"traumatized state\". I think this might have something to do with the fact that I lost my mother when I was 12 and my father has been emotionally absent. I have depression and anxiety, I'm taking meds and therapy. I want to know a way to get over the traumatized mentality fast, when it happens.\n\n3. When I run into a certain problem I want to solve, I get very absorbed into this one problem, and I start to forget about the big picture. and when the problem that I was facing came to a conclusion, I look back and get confused - why did I start this problem in the first place? I need to keep track of what I have been doing.\n\n4. I have always had problem sleeping and getting up. I always wake up tired and drowsy. I couldn't fall asleep at night.  When I go to school, I always feel a lot of anxiety and could not start working for 0.5-1 hour. It's a very nervous feeling, as if I'm worried that I have forgotten something important in my life.\n\n5. After working on something very focused for a session of 1-2 hour, my brain gets very fatigue and I don't feel like thinking about anything. I don't know how to recover from that.\n\nThese are the problems I can think of at this point. Please let me know your suggestions on them, or any related information! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

My family thinks I'm stupid for not taking this job because I have no money but I am willing to wait til the summer to start making money (I make a bit now babysitting part-time for said family).

            "title": "Realistic description of academia? [15M]",
            "content": "Hello. I am a fifteen-year-old male concerned for my future. For months now, I thought getting a PhD in some sort of experimental physics and then getting professorship was the dream for me. Reading Feynman's autobiography gave me a rather naive view of a world in academia. My (naive) viewpoint was that I would get to travel the world while doing my research, have fun, and still have a lot of time to do the things that I love. But as I researched more, it came to my attention that that wouldn't really be the case if I were to pursue academia. It seems that your research becomes your number one thing in life that you pursue until you die. Which is a nightmare for me. I love travelling, hanging out with friends and family, and doing countless other hobbies. \n\n So then I changed the dream - perhaps I wanted to work in industry? Maybe gain a job in Research & Development at some high-end company? This sounded quite appealing to me. But if I were to gain a job in industry, then wouldn't it be better for me to major in engineering instead, since it would be much easier for me to get a job anyway? But doing this would steer away from my initial purposes of majoring in physics anyway - I wanted to do research and further the knowledge in my field! (But the thing is, I don't want this to be the #1 thing in my life - I want to dedicate my life to other hobbies as well.)\n\nI used to think I didn't care much about the money - all I wanted was to understand the world and create a meaningful contribution. Richard Feynman, Stephen Hawking - they were (and still are) my idols. But I value freedom over everything else, and perhaps money can buy me that? Starting up a business is looking more and more appealing to me - even though I don't think I want to be a business major. \n\nSo I guess my questions are:\n\n1. What is a realistic description of life in Academia?\n2. Would you say that life in industry gains you more freedom over life in Academia? (e.g, you get to choose where you live, more social life, more free time, etc)\n3. If I wanted to pursue industry, would it be better to major in some form of engineering, or perhaps get a PhD in one? (Let's say, mechanical engineering/aerospace)\n4. If we were talking in terms of research opportunities post-gradschool, would you suggest I take some field of Engineering (say Rocket Propulsion, or something like that) over a field in Physics (e.g experimental particle, high energy, etc)?\n5. If we were talking in terms of money, would you suggest I take Engineering or Physics?\n6. If, in the long run, I decided I wanted to start up a new company, do you think it would've been worth it if I chose to major in Physics or Engineering?",

I have been physically sitting at my desk and technically working a lot (8-15 hour days, 6-7 days/week), but still feel overwhelmed and like I haven't made any real progress on my projects. It's also been carrying over into my sleeping habits and diet, and I've recently developed a facial twitch. I'm also feeling a bit emotionally detached and generally distracted.

The museum itself was great and quiet, and the only people there were me, the front desk person, and the owner. The owner was working on a display when I walked in and it looked nice, so I stopped to compliment her work as I was leaving. Then we got to talking, and she asked me what I do for a living. So I told her I was a graduate student at the university down the street. She asked me what I was studying and I told her. Then she immediately dove into a 'How are you going to get a job with a degree like that?' lecture. She went on and on about how schools are pumping out people who can't find work, and I am going to be one of them. She called my degree \"useless\" and \"a waste of money\" (I'm not actually paying to get my degree, but whatever. I don't owe her an explanation about that). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whole thing caught me off guard and I'm a bit emotionally fragile at this time, so I didn't defend myself.

I\u2019m finding the study to be a massive grind because of the sheer amount of modules I\u2019m being examined on, and also because I have really lost sight of why I wanted to do study this particular field. I\u2019m finding that the subject matter is really esoteric and I\u2019m finding it hard to get motivated as a result. I never thought I\u2019d say this, but I really want something more concrete and tangible to work on. As such I\u2019m considering leaving because my grades are tanking and I don\u2019t really see it getting much better.\n\nWith that being said though, I really don\u2019t think I want to leave learning and studying behind me, as I truly love it when I get engrossed in the books and learn something new and genuinely neat.\n\nMy potential solution is that I\u2019m considering making a change and trying to apply for PhDs in climate/Earth sciences. I think it\u2019d be super exciting to be working on such pressing issues but also to be able to actually see the results and importance of the work whilst I\u2019m doing it, as opposed to what I do now which feels like I\u2019m not really achieving/going to achieve much.\n\nThe flip side of course is - what if I still don\u2019t like the PhD life at the next place (if I can even get one)?

My second reader on my thesis stepped into a mentor role even though she\u2019s not my advisor.\n\nOk so I posted the TL;DR at the top since I\u2019m about to get sappy. \n\nI entered my PhD program in 2017 at 22 years old. I was ill prepared because frankly I had no expectations. There are 4 advisors at my school, and all of them have a crazy amount of students. I chose the advisor whose lab looked interesting, and started to get to know him. Or, I tried, and quickly gave up because I realized he wasn\u2019t around a lot. \n\nI relied on older students as stand in advisors my entire first year and saw him maybe... once a semester? During which times he tried to derail my thesis topic and add random analyses that make no sense. He refused to fund any research in our lab until he saw that we were well received at a conference and then asked to be an author. \n\nOver the summer I heard rumors that he was looking for other jobs and I thought I wouldn\u2019t be surprised since he was always gone but I didn\u2019t think about it much. In November he announced he was leaving, taking no one with him, staying on no one\u2019s dissertation committee, nothing. He then said he would devote spring semester to helping us finish as much as possible. But! Instead he has been spending every week in his new school destination settling in. \n\nThrough all of grad school I\u2019ve never felt like I had an advisor. No PI checking in on my thesis, my projects, or even doing research at the school? I know not all advisors check in on a regular basis but he didn\u2019t even know I had a deadline for my thesis when it happened... he\u2019s CHECKED OUT. On top of this I am by far the youngest in my cohort, everyone else has a spouse and family to rely on and has been in industry for 10+ years. I\u2019m quite lacking in support and I\u2019ve felt the consequences of that as I move through my program.\n\nLast week I met with a different professor to ask her for help on a research project. She asked me how my PhD track was going and I broke down and told her honestly I had no motivation to work right now and that I was falling behind and just waiting for the transition to happen so I could meet my replacement advisor once they are hired. I also disclosed my depression and that I was struggling in my classes. \n\nShe said she understood but would NOT take that as an answer. She told me she cared about me and that she doesn\u2019t want to see me fail and she set up calendar reminders for herself for her to email me, check in, and push me to keep working. She also set me up with points of contact to collect data at a local university. More support than my advisor has ever given me in 2 years, in 30 minutes. She probably has 30 students and still took the time to make sure I was ok even though I\u2019m not working with her. \n\nThis is what an amazing advisor looks like and I hope my future advisor is as good as her!

Just got out of the ER where I spent the night after the cops showed up at my lab and took me away because someone told them I was crying in the lab and when they showed up they determined I wanted to kill myself.

I've tried for six years to get off-campus help (I wonder how many hundreds of therapists I've called by now) and only just found a therapist four weeks ago, who I can't see anymore because I'll lose my health insurance when I leave grad school. My \"mental health care\" until this point has been a combination of involuntary and voluntary visits to the ER when I get to the point where I feel the only other option is killing myself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to have promise and potential. Somehow I managed to get into a top PhD program in STEM and work for one of the most well-regarded researchers in my field, even though everyone always told me I was too dumb, that I only got in because I check \"diversity\" boxes, that I don't deserve to be where I am. I am so excited by my research and it is the only thing that has been keeping me going, and now it has been taken away.

            "content": "I\u2019m 2 years into a 4-year PhD and I\u2019m at the point of counting down the days until I can leave. Thankfully, I absolutely love my research and my advisor (for the most part lol) and that\u2019s honestly the only thing keeping me going.\n\nMy problem stems from the following:\n\n- I had to file 4 Title IX complaints against people in my department. The guys will *not* take no for answer. Some pursued me for over a year and became sexually aggressive or harassed me via text, even when I clearly did not respond to any communication or clearly said no to attempts to hang out. I would be approached in class, my office (showing up unannounced), or \u201cdropping by\u201d my apartment. I stopped showing up to class and required seminars to avoid it. I was not aware their actions were in violation of Title IX until someone pointed it out to me. 1 one of these people was a friend, another was a close friend, and another was borderline best friend. It seems to be a case of unrequited love, but that doesn\u2019t excuse them to treat me like shit or ignore lack of consent. This happened over the course of the last 15 months and was just one person after the other.\n\n- note, I\u2019ve been asked out/pursued my entire life, even when I clearly had a SO and I\u2019ve never had 6 people mistreat me because I said no. I grew up in CA, went to undergrad in NY, and am now in KS. Is this just coincidence or some weird midwestern behavior? Everyone I\u2019m discussing is from the area or a nearby state.\n\n- there were 2 additional Title IX-ish behaviors of people, one of them graduated, so I didn\u2019t bother. The other has been chastising me for not texting him back after he gave me his phone number unprompted. I\u2019ve been out of the country for 2 weeks and I\u2019m dreading him stopping by my office and asking why I didn\u2019t text him.\n\n- I had to cut out these people, or they eventually cut me out. This excluded me from pretty much every friend group in the department. I never hang out with anyone or get invited to things anymore, which sucks realizing that they only cared because they wanted something physical out of me. All of my other friends live on either coast and I\u2019m an only child with parents old enough to be advisor\u2019s parents lol. I\u2019m effectively friendless day-to-day.\n\n- my only friend in the department is one of those people where you say \u201ccan\u2019t live with them, can\u2019t live without them.\u201d If we didn\u2019t work together, I probably wouldn\u2019t put so much effort in. She is toxic and downright mean. She does things like tell me that I\u2019m an overachiever and make everyone in the department look bad because I\u2019m ambitious and driven, even by doing things like joining swim club. I never brag or gloat about grants and fellowships I receive, but she even told me that she automatically hated me when I was accepted because the department announced that I was on a prestigious fellowship. She views the successes of others as her own failures and constantly projects this.\n\n- for solutions, I have done the following: joined marching band for a year to try a new friend group. I\u2019m nearly a decade older and I couldn\u2019t deal with the teen drama as most of them went to HS together.\n\n- joined swim club for the last 2 seasons. It\u2019s ok, not drama but the group is dwindling to 5-10 people and it\u2019s more of an activity rather than friendship thing.\n\n- work out outside of swimming, it helps with mental health and such.\n\n- spoke with CAPS and the ombudsman. CAPS doesn\u2019t really do much for me, they said given the circumstances, I seemed to be positive and doing all I can. I didn\u2019t like the ombuds approach - they told me everyone else had unmet needs and I need to cater to them. I discussed this with my advisor and he agreed we couldn\u2019t do anything about the negativity of my only friend.\n\n- I despise the weather in KS. It has been a harsher winter the past 2 years than it normally is. I\u2019m also very into outdoors stuff and hiking - KS doesn\u2019t cut it for me and I leave every academic break to go somewhere else. It helps, but I dread getting back on the plane and landing here.\n\n- I\u2019ve picked up hobbies like reading (again). \n\n- I had a rapid onset of allergies to cats and dogs, so I can\u2019t volunteer in the animal shelter anymore. I have a pet lizard and he\u2019s great, but I can\u2019t really get anymore with my travel.\n\nI don\u2019t want to live my life borderline hating everyday, but that\u2019s the point I\u2019m at. I\u2019m even considering driving home and *living with my parents* for part of the summer (I left for college 10 years ago and haven\u2019t been home for more than 3 weeks at a time). I figure if I\u2019m at least near hiking and a better outdoor situation, that could help. Any ideas or suggestions? I don\u2019t want to look back negatively on this part of my life/career that will be a huge defining moment and I want to make the best of it. \n\nEdit - crucial typo lol.",

            "title": "Year 4 PhD Student Considering Quitting",
            "content": "Hello all,\n\nTo add to the ongoing online literature of leaving the PhD, I wanted to run through my thought process here. I'm going to leave out my field only because it's relatively small and there might be still enough detail to sniff out the crumbs regardless, but I will just say that it's in the life sciences.\n\nI am considering leaving the program at the end of my year 4, after spending some time sitting down with the department chair last year on contemplating leaving the program. He ended up convincing me to stick it out.\n\nI came in with two chemistry degrees and research experiences in organic chemistry. For some strange reason, I had this thought that I could apply it to this lab because some of the papers from the lab had some organic synthesis components and that's what I enjoy/am good at. I also like this new field itself from a broad strokes perspective, but just never quite got into the rhythm of the research lab that I'm in.\n\nIt turned out that the entire work of the lab is largely biological, which I was not prepared for. I have been learning to transition into those techniques, and actually had some marginal success (nothing paper worthy, just some general success) as far as data output went. I also had some side work project with developing methods to synthesize a target compound we needed (we were doing some natural product extraction, which seemed silly to me at the time), that I hoped could be used to produce enough for future studies, and were much improved over the previous methods we had used as well as the older synthetic method that was developed.\n\nHowever, it turned out that our postdoc and my adviser were not particularly enthusiastic about the side project, which I spent quite a while doing. The compound was a little too bioactive compared to the natural material, which we couldn't explain and the postdoc and my adviser felt would not agree with the published results. In any case, a lot of my synthetic work/skills have been shelved.\n\nThe last two years have been mostly fumbling around with biological techniques. I ended up getting really burned out and decided to take a summer to intern at a production facility nearby in the countryside. While not the line of work I was expecting, I had a much better time getting along with coworkers and learning the ins and outs of the industry. While the commutes were long, I loved watching the sun rise in the morning. I also loved the whole production process, even though at times it could seem monotonous (I have a strange love affair with stainless steel pipes in processing plants). There was a real sense of possibility that I could contribute and maybe even help optimize the processes. Around this time, the postdoc ended up publishing his results, so I never contributed to that work or learned those techniques. Also, when I came back, my professor said that while I passed my yearly review, he was considering giving me an unsatisfactory and wanted me to be more productive in the lab. Part of me wishes he'd just let me know before I left on my internship, but perhaps looking back, it was way better to just do the internship than consider sticking it out during the summer.\n\nSo now I'm near the end of my 4th year, and on advice of the chair, I stayed. I have no ill-will towards my professor, I just think that when he had a death in his family, that really took him out of the game in year 2, and the direction of the lab seemed to be off-kilter. Around this same time, a [M.Sc](https://M.Sc). student who was in the lab sort of drifted away and eventually took a job in the industry without completing their degree, which I think was largely due to finances. So things ended up being me and the postdoc. I realized I had to make a decision between putting more effort in the lab or developing skills, and so for a while I ended up spending my free time building up relevant industry skill sets and leadership experiences to make the transition more palatable in the event I needed to jump ship. I ended up getting into freelancing, which I was pretty surprised by - I absolutely enjoyed working with local small businesses and startups on some of their technical issues and it's been amazing to see people react with appreciation because I happen to be able to dig into literature and technically dense material for nuggets of gold. Also, getting paid for my time has been a fun, rewarding experience as well. I've also learned to write for technical marketing and informational industry materials, which has been a lot more in line with the way I think and process information around me. I've won an award that could have some brand name recognition in the industry as me being a capable professional. For a while I thought I was being dumb and lazy, but this has been a lot of fun and a rich experience.\n\nI am faced with my preliminary exam in the next few weeks (which has been largely pushed back by my adviser, probably due to my lackluster results). I've emailed the chair about what options I have moving forward with leaving with an [M.Sc](https://M.Sc). I have a backup job lined up with the internship (they said no matter what happened, they'd be happy to employ me). I also know that the [M.Sc](https://M.Sc). is pretty marketable, and its only the PhDs that I've seen struggle to land a job. But I know that people have asked me if I can't just keep going, including my wife, because I have one year of funding left. My professor plans to retire in a few months, and the postdoc is leaving at the same time, so I'll be in a bit of a lurch. If I keep going, I'll be in that limbo period, and without the expertise of the postdoc, probably be floundering just as bad as I have been before while more interesting opportunities will keep lining up my way.\n\nThis ended up way longer than I had hoped. I'm struggling to decide if I even want to go through with the preliminary exam, and if I can find a way to master out before the exam. The advice I've been given is to stick it out, do the exam, and then see what my options are. I also have that tinge of guilt of having used up all this time. It's just really clear to me at this point that whichever way I go, I'll end up mastering out anyway. The policy in the handbook isn't particularly clear about mastering out (I swear, PhD programs need to be up front about these policies, it makes no sense to leave it hidden) but last time I spoke with the chair, he said there was a way to do it and the department would help me out regardless of which direction I go.\n\nTL;DR - 4th year PhD student. Burned out and tired, feeling technical skills are underappreciated. Doesn't look like data will add up to dissertation level, will need some serious commitment to pull off PhD. Learned a lot of marketable skills along the way to make up for lost time/training. Have industry position potentially lined up, excited to move on and work in industry, make some cash and support me and my wife. Wondering if I should find a way to master out before preliminary exam.",

I can easily manage school and my job, and thats not the problem.  \nThe problem is practicum. My university only allows us to start practicum in the summer semester at 10 hrs/week, and then bump it up to 20 hrs/week for the following fall and spring semester, and then ultimatley graduate. If we do not have a practicum site confirmed by May 24th, we have to wait another year to re-apply for the pre-approved list of sites the university allows us to do our practicum at. (Additionally, my practicum advisor will not give me the contact information of any of the other approved sites to at least reach out to show my interest until I hear if I have been approved or denied from one site I recently interviewed at on April 1st, so I'm very anxious) As if thats not daunting enough, I've been dealing with some kind of hard decisions to make.  \nI recently turned 26, and as such am off my parents healthcare. I was denied for Medicaid, but my job offers great healthcare, but only if you're working 30+ hours a week. I really want to take up my company's healthcare, but obviously would need to stay at more than 30 hours a week. I've heard from so many people that working anything over 25 hours a week with practicum and practicum supervisory meetings are hell, and I'm honestly feeling so overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. I'm sure I would have no issue doing the 33 hours a week at my job and the 10 hours a week at my practicum site for summer, but once fall semester rolls around I'm not sure how I'd be able to do 53 hours a week not including travel time for both. I'm worried my own mental health will suffer because of it - something I have struggled with since I was young. I take medication and see someone for it, but that doesn't mean its all ok 100% of the time.  \n\n\nI have considered taking time off to work full time (likely at a different job that pays a little bit more... would need to look into options and such to see if thats even feasible) to save up so in the future I can do my internship without needing to work so much, but then my loan repayments would kick in, and I have well over $100,000 worth of debt. So in that sense, I'm scared I'd end up taking time off in an attempt to save up, but then be bulldozed by student loan payments and end up not saving up much at all and just screwing myself over. \n\nI just feel very hopeless right now, and at this point, I'm regretting even going to graduate school. It seems like theres no way to win.   \n\n\nI'm basically at my wits end and have no clue what to do. Does anyone have any success stories of being in similar situations to mine, or any ideas for what they think I should do? Seriously, anything would help.. I've been trying to consider all my options, but I'm falling flat. ",

(Licensed Mental Health Counselor)\n\nI\u2019m planning on going in 18 months after saving enough money to not take out any loans in order to go.\n\nCurrently I live in a HCOL area in affordable housing (read: about 20% of my income) and make about $52,000 a year. My job is manageable and provided good health care and benefits but not what I want to do for long term.\n\nThe decision is this:\n\nI could apply to a state school program of which only 6 people get in each year, where I have to take two courses at a community college and a GRE before applying. The program costs $26,000 in tuition over a two years being a full-time student. I would have to move to the town where the school is (and housing is more affordable there) but I would have to quit my job and give up benefits. The kicker is, I have the options of working as a Teaching Assistant and having that pay for most of my tuition. So the program is essentially free minus what I need to stay alive, which isn\u2019t much. Also, I could not get in initially and have to wait another year before applying again.\n\nOR\n\nI could go to CityU, pay $52,000, rolling admission and more lax application process but the program is three years and designed to be done while working a full-time job. I wouldn\u2019t have to quit or move, and I wouldn\u2019t get the opportunity to teach college classes.\n\nDo I go through the hoops and try to go to the practically free full-time program or do I try to balance both work and school to pay for a more expensive part-time program but would hopefully get to continue working at my job?\n\nI know this is probably a \u201cwell do what you value more\u201d kind of question, so if that\u2019s where you\u2019re leaning please tell me what you would do in this situation.\n\nThanks to anyone who participates!",

I went with my Honours PI's(HP) close colleague for a different project, with some over lab with my Honours PI. I have let my HP to be my secondary supervisor to sustain the relationship as he is a good PI and have industry connections. (On a side note, I am not living in Australia as my undergrad visa is finished and a post study visa after my PhD is more worth it (2 years if UG vs 4 years if Post-Grad), so I'm currently living in my home country.\n\nMy program only starts on July and while waiting around since February, I got bored and tried applied for jobs to start a career in science, though the jobs require me to have 2 years commitment and if I quit earlier, I need to pay 3 months worth of salary, which is not worth it. My HP did ask me to look for collaborators in my home country which is a nice gesture to keep me busy and make connections(I haven't had any industry contacts while I am in my home country), though it can be depressing when no one responds. So I would begrudgingly write some emails to industry, and get no replies and demotivated and motivated myself as the cycle continues.\n\nI was wondering, if there are better things to do while waiting for your PhD/Master's program to start or what did you do while waiting for it to start.\n\nTL;DR: bored while waiting PhD to start, career requires longer commitment and penalties apply, what to do in the mean time?",

            "content": "I knew I wanted to pursue research when I was a junior in college. I loved research after working as an RA for my undergrad professor, and I was passionate about pursuing a PhD to go into academia.\n\nI\u2019m now in the 2nd year of my PhD program and I\u2019ve developed a level of depression/severe anxiety that I\u2019ve never experienced before. I\u2019ve always had some baseline depressive symptoms throughout my life, but I\u2019ve been feeling especially depressed (crying frequently/having suicidal ideation) since entering this program. I\u2019m now seeing a therapist and looking into anti-depressants. I just hate the lack of work-life balance and the pressure to always be thinking about work, even on weekends/holidays. I\u2019m extremely burned out and feeling empty inside. Everyone also seems miserable trying to pump out publications to move up the next step, which really kills the passion I once had for research.\n\nNobody in my program knows about my issues. I\u2019m a high-functioning depressed person who pretends to be a pretty happy person, so I\u2019ve been doing extremely well at surface level. I submitted a training grant that received a very high and fundable score, published a first author, presented at conferences, and hold leadership positions in the school. All of the faculty are pretty much expecting me to go into academia at this point, and to be fair, I came in telling them that I wanted to (cause I originally did). But the amount of mental breakdowns I\u2019ve had behind closed doors has become too much. I also realized something was very wrong when I got the score of my grant back and I wasn\u2019t even that happy. In fact, I was afraid this meant I was selling my soul to academia and that scared the hell out of me.\n\nSo here\u2019s where I\u2019m having a moral dilemma: I came into this program telling my professors and advisor I really wanted to pursue academia. The grant I applied to is also geared towards students who want to become researchers. And our school/field is ESPECIALLY pushy about us going into academia, so they obviously try and prioritize admitting students who demonstrate interest in this career path. However, I truly am starting to realize this isn\u2019t for me, but now I feel disingenuous and guilty if I tell my advisor that I am exploring other options. When/how should I bring this up?\n\nEdit: Thanks so much to all who have given me advice and encouragement! I was starting to reply to some comments but realized I needed to clarify a few things: My program is a 3-year program in a health science with no lab type setting. I have 1.5 years left and I\u2019ve passed my quals/received my masters already. Right now I want to stick it out and finish for financial reasons and because I want a PhD to make the job hunt more realistic and feasible. So my guilt really comes with telling my advisor I do not want to pursue academia after I graduate, but feeling bad about using up the university\u2019s time and resources when this is kind of their expectation. As of now, I am looking into consulting (applying to bridge workshops and starting to practice cases), but it\u2019s been hard to really delve into this option with all of this guilt/pressure/demotivation I\u2019ve been feeling.",

On my visit to the school the admissions guy who walked me and my fiancee (who is in the same program) said that plenty of students have graduated here and have done the same thing. Well to my surprise I now find out thats a load of BS because an MFA is more or less required to teach at the collegiate level and this program is only an MA in Theatre. \n\nFor back story, I am a Technical Director at a theater in NJ, I love the work and I love building and designing sets, which I wanted to improve upon, but this program is general theatre and is all stuff I LEARNED IN UNDERGRAD. Thats not me exaggerating either, I literally have learned everything I have done in the past two semesters while I was in my bachelor's program. Taking a look at my choice of classes for next semester is infuriating because none of it will benefit me in the career I want to pursue. \n\n I am bored out of my mind in class, I work 80+ hours a week at my real job as it is, I am planning my wedding that is in December and have to attend class at least 9 hours a week, do 3 practicums of 80 hours and Stage Manage a production (roughly 150-200 hours over two months while working a full-time job) to even do the thesis I want to do because it's \"required for design thesis\". I feel like I am completely wasting my time and would be better off asking for a raise at my current job or going into business for myself. \n\nBut I have this other feeling in the back of my mind that's telling me to just go ahead and finish. Do the bare minimum, hope my real job doesn't fire me for taking so much time away from the theatre, do a BS thesis on something I don't care about and justify spending the thousands of dollars I've already spent by getting a piece of paper that says I know what I already know. \n\nI really just don't know what to do. The last post I made had several comments that said wait a few months and see where I am at then. Well its been a few months and I am even more confused and stressed out. I've considered dropping down to one class a semester but in order for my to keep my loans (I know), I have to be full time which is three classes. \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated! ",

            "content": "Hello - thanks for any input in advance. I feel very lucky, honored, and grateful to have received an external fellowship this year and have much more space to get on with my writing and fieldwork. I am a bit nervous, however, because my committee is anxious that I'll essentially fall off the face of the earth during the fellowship years (they've seen many students become lost to addictions, getting too caught up in dating/family life etc.). I don't intend to get into any of this mess, but I see why they are concerned for me. I currently attend school at a rural campus with no family, no friends, no car, no savings, and I'm in quite poor health. I was looking forward to moving back home for a bit and finally taking life back into my own hands, but I do want to actually progress and respect my advisers. One of them wants me to continue staying on campus just to take this one class and have that \"structure,\" but I think it's a massive waste of money (despite having roommates and being frugal, my rent and utilities on campus is about 60% of my current income) and would be a continuance of how badly my social and physical being has been doing. My other two committee members vehemently disagree that I should stay on campus but want me to visit frequently (which I would be totally OK doing).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've decided I want to find a middle ground. One way or another, I'm going to start my fieldwork (for context, my home region is actually where a lot of my fieldwork needs to take place). I agree that moving completely back home-home my first semester on fellowship could be detrimental, because I do have a harsh family life (I have a parent with a rare, life-threatening illness and we're very poor). However, I don't want to be on campus right now if I can help it--I intend to move back for my latter writing stages, but I could really benefit from some time apart given the opportunity and the fact that I am not even allowed to teach next year. There are a handful of scholars that I really want to work with at other universities (both near my hometown and across the country). How do regular students with fellowship flexibility end up becoming \"visiting students,\" or working with other professors despite not being a part of a special program? I will not be ABD by the fall. In April, is it still feasible to try and work out being at another school to work with someone and do a little coursework for next semester?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel a bit clueless; I'm sorry if this post is redundant or silly. Most fellowship resources tell you how to get them, but not what to do with them once you get them; I really don't want to mess up this opportunity and my advisers are scaring me a bit. Any ideas about how I can implement productive structure during fellowship life, especially to a degree my advisers will feel comfortable with me taking time away from the campus, would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would love the opinions of people who are neither my family nor my advisers, as they each have independent interests in my whereabouts.",

            "title": "Non-traditional undergrad needing advice for grad school",
            "content": "Hi all,\n\nSorry for the long text - I am really jumbled inside and really need some guidance.\n\nI'm currently a statistics major/bio minor at a state school and work in a biological research lab as a permanent employee (not student employee) at an R1 university. I'm also 31, have a high-functioning eight-year-old with special needs, a fiance, and I'm going 3/4 time to school because I just cannot juggle work, 9-10 credits of upper level STEM courses, and the needs of my family. (When I go to grad school, I am not planning on working an outside job - just TAing or RAing).\n\nI want to work in some area in the intersection of biology (immunology/disease pathology or something similar), statistics, modeling, and data analysis. Most MS in Biostatistics are geared toward public health and not really biological research, and don't include many courses that give a solid biology foundation that I want. But I do absolutely love statistics. Something like Yale's or Cornell's Computational Biology PhD really appeal to me.\n\nWithout hesitation, I know that I want a graduate degree, but I don't know if I should do a PhD or an MS. If I was single and childless and 23 years old, I would absolutely, 100% go for a PhD. I would like a PhD for the sake of a PhD. It's not a question of if a PhD is right for me, but of considering everyone in my family - not just my own wants and needs. It has been suggested to me to go for a PhD for the funding and master out if I don't like it, but I'm concerned with the ethics of that.\n\n\\- Debt: I've had to accrue a significant amount of debt due to not being able to finish some semesters due to my own health issues (now resolved) and the loooong path to discover what I actually wanted to do (I got my paralegal degree first). I need to pay the debt down. It's haunting me. I guess I could probably start paying down with my stipend for a PhD, but I'm worried about accruing even more debt for a Master's.\n\n\\- Savings: I have zero savings or 401k. I won't graduate until I'm nearly 33, and if I do a PhD, I won't enter the workforce or really start my career until I'm nearly 40. I mean, I've been a cashier, a waitress, etc, but I haven't started a career.\n\n\\- Time: If I ever did a PhD, would I really be working 60-70 hour weeks and never see my family or have any time to spend with them? I currently \"work\" (eg, work, school, homework, commuting, etc) about 11 hours per day Mon-Sat, and that is grueling and kind of killing me emotionally.\n\n\\- Money: I'm not gonna lie - a stipend of $27,000 a year would be on par with the most money I've ever made in my life ($13/hour as a paralegal). My fiance also works, and right now, because I'm a student, we're making it on his salary and my part-time salary alone. However, I am not sure how to crunch the money I'd be losing out on by not entering the workforce for three to four additional years by getting a PhD, and then also comparing a PhD salary trajectory + career opportunity cost with MS salary trajectory.\n\n\\- Career trajectory: I'd like to work in an academic research lab and to have some autonomy, but I am not interested in worrying about finances/grants. I don't necessarily want to have my own lab. However, I know that even if you are not interested in having your own lab, a PhD is heavily favored in academia. What can I expect career-wise with a Masters vs. PhD?\n\n\\- Location/Schools: Right now, we live in Rochester, NY. I want to either stay in the Finger Lakes area to minimize the pain of moving, or move somewhere where we can settle down. For multiple reasons (leaving out details for brevity) my schools I could apply to are really limited. Like... University at Buffalo, University of Rochester, Yale, Cornell, and Brown. And for a Master's degree, I'm basically stuck with UB due to cost. I have straight A's (aside from when I had health issues) and have worked in a research lab for 2 years so far, but I don't have any papers to my name. I'm not even sure exactly what I want to research or do with my life. Yale's program so far is the most enticing to me, but... it's Yale, and a PhD program. Am I completely out of my element here? I feel like a misguided loser even looking at their website.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for listening.",

As a result, this puts me in the position to start thinking about grad school ASAP: beginning my applications late this year! But I truly have no idea where to start. \n\nI believe most grad schools have application deadlines in December, right? This would leave me with only one semester to make adequate connections to professors to obtain letters of rec. Is this enough time? \n\nAnd on that same note, when would you say is the latest possible time I should take the GRE? (Haven\u2019t even thought about studying for it yet, but I have some time).\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve found very unclear is whether or not you get paid \u201cto go\u201d to grad school. Will those assistantships/fellowships enable you to not have to work outside of school? About how much per month would you typically make with one? Is it equivalent earnings to that of a part time job? More, less? Can you start on an assistantship/fellowship in your first semester of grad school?\n\nAlong with this, are you eligible for federal or state grants at all? I know that the Pell Grant allows for up to 6 years of funding, not sure if that only counts for undergrad though. Basically, is it possible to not rely only on loans to get through grad school?\n\nI\u2019m worried at how graduate students manage to support themselves. Surely you can\u2019t manage a full time job outside of school on top of your studies, right? (Without severe mental health strain anyway). So I\u2019m curious as to what most people do. \n\nThanks in advance. I\u2019m seriously clueless and have gotten no guidance so far on any of this, which is especially difficult with my unique situation of expediting my undergrad years. ",

            "content": "So let me start by saying my time in college has been all over the place. I had very severe mental health issues that made it hard to function. I had a 2.3 gpa one semester because of how badly I was doing. Then I got my shit together and brought my gpa up to a 3.2. I also jumped around majors before finding one I love, economics. Our economics program is prestigious and highly ranked. Right now I have a 3.5 in major gpa. Yet this semester I\u2019ve started to have a flare up of health issues again on top of working two jobs and completing the whole economics major in three semesters, this being my last semester. I have never gotten a C in a single economics class but that might happen this semester. I\u2019m a tutor for Econ, I love it and I\u2019m good at it. All I want is to further my education in it and hopefully go into academics because it\u2019s my passion. Yet I might get a C in my capstone which is all group projects and presentations. I still have one more big project and one yet to be graded but he gave our first project a 69/100. I\u2019ve gotten As in the weeding out and hardest classes of my major and my professors adore me. I just have a lot going on and my mental health is very up and down but I am smart and I\u2019m always on the top of my classes when I\u2019m functioning. I am not planning on going to a grad or PhD program if possible right away. I need a couple years off to focus on my health, and take more math classes for upper level Econ. I just love economics, I also love calculus and my calc professor also adores me. I\u2019m not in it for the money. All I wanna do is study or for the rest of my life. I love school, I love to learn but I can\u2019t help how bad my mental health was and still is. I\u2019m on a good track toward recovery but my grades will hurt in the process and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019ll hurt me a lot. I know this is long, I\u2019m just freaking out. ",

            "content": "I\u2019ve been sober for about 8 years now. I finished my masters in December and am about to start my PhD. I\u2019ve always been very open about my recovery. My PI, most of my cohort and most of the faculty know that I\u2019m in recovery. Anyone who\u2019s close to me knows that I\u2019m sober.\n\nI went to interview for a PhD position and there was a brewery tour as part of the (essentially mandatory) schedule. It hit me that academics freaking love alcohol. Conferences all have happy hours and social stuff centered around alcohol. It\u2019s become somewhat standard that people in academia are obsessed with micro brews. \n\nSo I thought I\u2019d make a post for people newly sober and in grad school or just trying to navigate academia without drinking for whatever reason. \n\n1. Don\u2019t be ashamed/embarrassed. Not drinking is not a bad thing. My experience is that academics are mostly forward thinking and do not care if you don\u2019t drink. Get soda/water/whatever and just act like it\u2019s totally normal\u2014because it is! Most of the time, the only person thinking about the fact that you\u2019re not drinking alcohol is you. \n\n2. If you\u2019re comfortable, tell people. I\u2019ve found that when I tell people I don\u2019t drink, that\u2019s the end of the conversation. They usually don\u2019t ask any more questions. More often than not if there is a comment about your not drinking, it\u2019s a positive one. \n\n3. Don\u2019t feel like you\u2019ll miss out on networking if you leave an event early because people are getting hammered. The important networking happens before everyone gets too drunk anyways.\n\n4. Hopefully you have a good enough relationship with your PI where you can be honest. Because I\u2019ve been upfront about everything, my PI understands and doesn\u2019t mind if I leave once a week for a long lunch to meet my sponsor.\n\n5. If you\u2019re a member of a 12 step program or any group that helps keep you sober, don\u2019t push that to the side for school. Maintain the course of action to stay sober and you will see the benefits in your work. I\u2019ve had periods of time when I stopped going to meetings etc because I was \u201ctoo busy\u201d and my productivity actually increased when I got back into the swing of it. If you\u2019re like me, you won\u2019t make it in school if you go back to drinking, so make sure your sobriety stays important to you. \n\n6. Finally, there is no one size fits all. Everyone\u2019s recovery is a little different and everyone\u2019s experience with grad school is a little different. Do what makes you comfortable. \n\nAlso, my friends in my cohort love having someone who can be the designated driver :)",

            "content": "Hi everyone! I'm looking for some advice; hope you all can help. This will be a long post, so thank you in advance for your time.\n\nAs the title mentions, I currently live with my parents and work at a city-level, union-protected, pension-providing engineering bureau, but am considering applying for a PhD. My work is currently very heavily construction related, and I don't feel very challenged or enthusiastic about my work. It pays decently well, has great benefits, has great security, but it's not what I wanted to do.\n\nI wanted to help tackle climate change. That was one of my primary motivations for my environmental and water resources engineering focuses in undergrad, and why I took extra atmospheric science classes as well, hoping I could get a career that would let me do that. Once I got an offer with the city, though, it seemed like the right thing to do, as undergrad had really burned me out and this provided a lot of security.\n\nNow that I've had some time away from undergrad (about a year and a half now), I find myself yearning for something more challenging and fulfilling. I spent some time reading parts of the IPCC report on climate change of 1.5C, and wanted to contribute to global research like that.\n\nI contacted a professor doing the exact kind of research that I'm interested in-- regional climate change modeling and its impact on water security and communities-- and he seemed willing to take me on as a student, even mentioning that despite the deadline for this fall having already passed for the atmospheric and oceanic sciences PhD program, if the committee is willing to accept me, \"we might be able to see if we can get you in\". (Reality check-- am I overreacting, or is this a really good sign?)\n\nI talked to my parents about the possibility of me going for a PhD, since I know I'd need financial support through it. My dad's of the opinion that it sounds cool. And while my mom's a huge proponent of education, she's worried that the sacrifices I'll need to make won't be worth it, as she wants me to \"live a normal life\"-- in other words, get married, have kids, and have a life-- and that the 6 ish years for the PhD is a sacrifice that's different for me as a woman than it would be for men without any financial payoff, whereas the job I have currently will be very sustainable in the long term. She said she's seen a lot of people get married and have kids later in life because they've felt left behind by their peers, and she's seen a lot of people give up what they thought were their dreams because it just wasn't worth it.\n\nI'm not sold on having kids but haven't had the heart to tell my parents, so the raising-a-family part doesn't quite ring true for me. My motivations for pursuing a PhD and this research aren't for accolades or fame-- it's more about changing the world-- but I am worried that I'm going to invest a lot for something that, in the end, is going to be too much of a sacrifice with potentially no payoff (payoff being a. finishing the degree, b. continuing to find the research rewarding after the getting the degree, and c. getting a career that will let me continue doing the research). My mental health has been a pretty big concern of mine over the last few years-- while it's certainly improving, I'm worried about how taxing a PhD will be.\n\nSo in short, my big questions are\n\n* If I get this PhD, will there be decent options to continue researching climate change? I live in the US, which is currently very adamant about denying climate change and I'm concerned about future funding (though I am more than open to leaving the US).\n* Is the path to getting a PhD in the US really as exhausting and life-draining as everyone makes it sound? For women especially, do you think that your PhD has come at a considerable cost to your personal and family life?\n* How has a PhD impacted your mental health? Have you felt that it's worth it?\n* Money isn't quite important to me, but the program that I'm interested in is at UCLA and costs of living there are astronomical-- what are my options for staying afloat financially? Would I be able to continue working, or would I be compensated enough to at least afford rent?\n* Would it be stupid of me to give up a very secure future with the City for a PhD? I know that jobs will always exist, but this is a big source of my anxiety.",

            "content": "Hi, gradschoolers!\n\nI recently arrived at a bit of a life conflict and would love your advice.\n\nI came from a pretty poor background, so I never felt 'secure' when I originally attended university and ended up dropping out to work as a software engineer since I was always a good coder. Since then, however, I've gotten a lot more skilled, matured and found an area of computer science that I really really adore, I would love to dedicate myself to career-wise (information/computer security) and that I'm really damn good at.\n\nThe big reason I'm considering a degree now is that I honestly love research within this area (though all my work is self-motivated right now) and I am tired of code-monkey work. I'm already reading all the papers that come out and consider myself largely up-to-date and would love to both contribute to it and dedicate myself to it further. But... as you probably know, research whether academic or not pretty much necessitates a higher degree of some kind (usually masters/Ph.D.), and particularly in this field it's really difficult to get a job without a master's or Ph.D. in Europe.\n\nMy parents are very supportive of me but my GF is very concerned with me accumulating student debt to support my studies and worried I'll regret my decision and end up in debt. She thinks it's a bit late for me to go back (I'm 26) and start a degree since it'll take so long to finish. I understand her point and it's a valid concern since I'm no stranger to trying different things in life and this is a long-term commitment, but on the other hand I feel like it's going to get more and more difficult to go back and study as I get older and I have a hunch I'll really regret not going for it when I get older (having a higher degree -- particularly a Ph.D. has been a lifelong dream of mine, but when I dropped out I decided I'd go back and get it later in life)\n\nDo you think pursuing a higher degree makes sense for me?  I'm already more than capable of making 50+ bucks per hour and so a degree is not a matter of salary but rather I am dying for more fulfilling work that also pays the bills (less modern skilled factory worker, somewhat more free-form and novel research that actually makes a difference and maybe some more leadership stuff) and I'd like to be taken more seriously as an expert in my field than I am currently being.\n\nSo my question is basically... what would you do in my situation? I'm already making good money and am very good at what I do, and have no problem getting well-paying software gigs, but I guess I'm coming to the realization that maybe money isn't enough for me and perhaps the type of work I'm doing is not what I want to be doing with my life. On the other hand, maybe I'm being naive and seeing education as a silver bullet to more fulfilling work when it isn't? I'd love your advice. Thank you very much.",

            "content": "## \n\nHi all,\n\nIt is a rant\\\\ long read and I am sorry, but I am sure many grad students have similar problems. TLDR below.\n\nI (4th year F grad) have an undergrad student (M, senior). He signed up to write a senior thesis, and I suggested a fairly easy project that was very doable in a short amount of time. We outlined everything in December last year. His work included getting together with our lab tech on an experiment that usually takes not more than 2 days to perform. I promised to help with analyzing the data, so his job was to prep an experiment, perform it, and collect the data.\n\nBefore assigning him to work on this, I spent a few days with him in the lab showing everything and explaining how stuff works. We did a couple of initial experiments together, and then he did a couple on his own. They were not perfect, but he appeared to me as being hardworking and totally capable of working on his own.\n\nNow the experiment that he needs to do for the thesis is a little bit more complicated, that is why I asked him to pair up with the lab tech (who is amazing btw, and have very good relationship with him).\n\nSo here is where it gets more complicated. He did one run of experiment. It did not work out for all samples, most failed, but for a couple we got the data. After this he decided to practice more. One or two practice experiments were done the last months, but no real data acquired.\n\nWe met quite a few of times in the course of these months, and I assigned him to read literature and get familiar with data analysis, which he did. We had multiple chats where I tried to be supportive and encouraging, saying that making mistakes is fine and everybody screws up. I made it clear that nothing is getting done while he is \"practicing\". At the same time, I am not going to do his work for him, because I do not want to steal his thesis or make him feel like he is not capable of working. I am very confident that he can do everything, and the only problems here are very low self esteem, perfectionism and absolute lack of confidence in himself.\n\nI am kind of tired of being a tough mom to this guy. It is now close to a point where I need to do everything myself if I want him to finish his thesis. But I made it clear when we discussed his thesis that I am not going to do his work for him. If he wants to do the thesis, he needs to finish this experiment himself. Otherwise there is no point in doing this thesis if he is not producing the data. I really want him to succeed, he has good hands that can be put to good work.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you guys have any recommendations? I really hit the wall with this situation.\n\n**TL;DR**: undergrad is not doing his thesis project due to procrastination and lack of confidence. Any advice?\n\nsorry it was long, thanks for reading.",

            "content": " I'm posing for a friend who doesn't have a reddit account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nURGENT HELP NEEDED:\n\nHi all, I am in a bit of a pickle and need some serious advice on how to handle this\u00a0**grad admission**\u00a0situation. About 3 weeks ago I interviewed at my top school and met with my top pick for an adviser. While I was there I got the impression that we were maybe not the greatest fit (nothing happened just intuition and what I heard from other students). While I still find this person\u2019s work interesting I found another person in the department\u2019s work, personality, and lab more to my liking and it seemed to be a better fit. It's important to note that both professors work closely with each other.\n\nOn Monday of this week I heard back from the first person (the one I don\u2019t feel I jive with) that I was first on the wait list and could work in her lab if I wanted to (through direct funding). I waited 3 days to email them back because I felt I needed to think about this and make an informed decision. Do I want to go into a lab I didn\u2019t feel fit my needs or stay at my perfectly fine, although not research focused, job (Lab Manger at a good university, good pay, benefits, could potentially lead to options for a masters or PhD but in a different field that I would love to be in)? I send an email Thursday morning to them saying thank you very much, but I have decided to explore other options before committing to a PhD program and have decided to postpone my graduate studies.\n\n**THEN:**\u00a0Three hours later I got an email from the director of the program telling me that I was still a high priority for them and that they could find a way to bring me in even though I wasn\u2019t offered a direct spot into the program (i.e. a faculty member would bring me in, not the department). I though okay, this is just the director\u2019s version of telling me I could work in the first person\u2019s lab if they got funding for me. I chalked it up to bad communication (which I still think was the case)\n\n**BUT THEN:**\u00a0I got an email two more hours later from the faculty member who I really enjoyed and who\u2019s project I was very, very interested in, and she is adjunct in a department I am very interested in so there could be the opportunity to do a broader, but more interesting PhD.\n\nThe problem is that I still am not 100% sure I want to get a PhD (**is anyone? I am seriously asking**). I can think of a lot of reasons not to but also a lot of reasons to do it. It would be really interesting and fun and might get me a cooler job someday. But there are a lot of draw backs (would need to quit recently acquired job, break lease, partner would need to find a new job, we would be poor). Not to mention I already told this first faculty member I was delaying my PhD studies. But I didn\u2019t think this other person would offer me a position. Clearly the department is not communicating well with each other about who wants what students (I know very few departments do).\n\nAs a professor how would you feel if you had been denied by a student who said that they just generally weren't sure about doing a PhD but then the student started a PhD with a close collaborator? If you were a student how would you handle this? Would me accepting the second persons offer damage my relationship beyond repair with the first person (they were very understanding of my email this morning)? I\u2019m truly confused about what to do or how to handle this situation.",

            "content": "**# Leaving Academia**  \n \n\nEveryone starts a PhD expecting to graduate and be able to pursue what they have identified as a passion of theirs, pushing the frontiers by a smudge or a mile in the process. However, as the years go by and your friends grow families, the uncertainty of job prospects and future security looms. Despite having, or almost having, the highest academic credential available you can find yourself utterly unemployable.   \n \n\nAs the economy shrinks, so do the opportunities that lead to permanent jobs- the coveted tenure-track position. Without earning one of these positions a newly minted PhD must either work long hours on contract teaching, with little pay, or attempt to navigate through the post-doc landscape. Post-doc positions amount to a year or two of working under a senior researcher. In other words, a post-doc position is essentially another degree.    \n \n\nNow you may think 'so what, you gotta pay your dues,' however the truth is that after completing one post doc the chances of landing a tenure-track position improve marginally. Further, you find yourself a year older and without security. So you have just completed what is usually ten years of post secondary education, and a post-doc position on top of all of that, but still have little or no stability. So you do the familiar.... you take another post-doc, and maybe one after that.  \n \n\nIt is becoming more common for people to pursue multiple post-doc positions. In fact, it is expected now that a PhD committed to becoming an academic must spend on average four years of tenure-track chasing, and much of this work is not glamorous. Much of that work is, and I have personally lived with an example, sycophantic. People are desperate and they even play the public relations twitter game while doing menial work for the department that no one wants to do, still earning a very modest income.   \n \n\nHow anyone can run through that gauntlet and remain healthy the entire time is now beyond my comprehension. The example I have lived with displays signs of narcissism and a well displayed inferiority complex. Yet he has chosen to remain on that life path despite it clearly rendering him miserable, and the scientists he would like to advise simply being completely disinterested in what a scholar has to say about their methodology that he does not remotely understand.   \n \n\nPersonally, I have chosen to leave academia by pursuing a professional degree in data science, which I am still waiting on. If those applications do not go well, which is not impossible, I will try my hand at junior programming positions. Ultimately this route will allow me to gain stability, manage my mental health better, and even let me practice music again.  \n \n\nThere is no doubt that my academic career path has taken years off of my life beyond the actual time I spent on it, and I have no interest in sacrificing more years on research that is very unlikely (as almost all research is) to carry social utility.  \n \n\nWith all that said, it is impossible not to begrudge or be bitter about the Pretty Huge Disappointment. There will probably always be some regret in someone who leaves like I do, but there is simply too much to balance the calculation in favor of remaining. Hopefully in a few years they will start posting health warnings on graduate applications like they do on cigarette boxes as many of my friends have half-joked about.  \n \n\nSomeone reading this might be interested in pursuing graduate studies. That is fine, but do not specialize in an academic area without developing skills of practical import. You might not think something like this will happen to you, but I was likely in very similar footwear.  \n \n\nBeing disillusioned sucks. ",

            "content": "I was admitted recently to an R1 United States school to do a thesis masters in mechanical engineering (pretty respected in my state, but not an \"elite\" school IMO). I've been in touch with a few professors regarding RA funding opportunities, and the gist I got was that there wasn't a lot of funding available for terminal masters students, and if I *were* to get offered funding, there'd be kind of an implicit expectation that I'd continue at that school to do a PhD.\n\nI'm hesitant to commit to a PhD at this point because I don't want to burn bridges at that school if I either decide to leave or to pursue a PhD at a different school (either better reputation, or program that's closer to what I'm interested in). I also did not apply to PhD programs anywhere this year because my application wasn't competitive enough (not enough LOR's, no undergraduate research experience, last 2.5 years I worked at a small company doing a mix of product design, IT, software development, and data analysis).\n\nObviously I'm going to try to find money either in external scholarships or TA positions, but my thought is that, if I accept, I'm probably going to end up paying for at least some of it myself. My thought is either self-fund for 1-2 semesters and then if I like the program, try to get funding later to do the PhD, or just pay for the whole thing myself and network like a motherfucker to try to get internships during the summer to try to put myself in a good position once I finish.\n\nThe two points I've been banging around in my head are:\n\n1. I'm financially solid enough that I won't have to take out any private or PLUS loans. The loans I would be taking out are eligible for income-based repayment, so in the case I end up getting a crappy low-paying job, I don't think I'll be in an awful situation. The debt might affect my ability to buy a house or some other major purchase down the road, but I'm not super worried about it at this point. I also have a lot of web/app development experience from my current job, so I'm 75% sure I can get a decent paying part-time job to help offset the cost.\n2. The area I'm interested in going into is control theory, dynamic systems, robotics/automation. For one, I think that's going to be a pretty high-growth field in the future. The existing job openings for those fields seem to all require higher degrees. This may be kind of alarmist, but I'm also beginning to wonder if maybe it would be more expensive for me *not* to go to graduate school now. I'm 25, and I'm not sure mechanical engineering is going to be a job in 25 years, at least not the way it is now (advances in technology might enable one engineer to do the job of dozens).\n\nThe reddit hivemind says paying for your own graduate school is always a horrible idea, and isn't worth the debt. Is my reasoning to pay for it myself sound, or stupid?\n\n\\*edited several times because I accidentally submitted it before I was finished\n\n&#x200B;",

            "content": "(I also posted this in r/Professors, if that's okay. If not, I'll take this down.) \n\nThis is a long post, bear with me. TLDR included below.\n\nI'm in my 5th year of my PhD in a field in the humanities (I want to preserve some anonymity). I went on the job market very tentatively, seeing it as basically a dry run for the real thing next year. My advisor barely gave me feedback on my materials, told me not to expect anything back, etc. It was framed as all practice. I hoped from the beginning to receive a fellowship so I could beef up my CV and complete my dissertation with the time to research it and produce a doc I'm proud of.\n\nI still applied very widely. Now I've received 2 offers. The first is the fellowship I'd been wanting. I'd get to continue living in the city I'm in, would be a member of a group of fellows I like, and would get to grow as a researcher. The second is, bear with me, a TT job in this same city at a public teaching school.\n\nIt feels like I'd be a total moron to turn down the TT job. All of the reasons point towards choosing job safety. I know the vast majority of people don't get this kind of offer, and especially not this early. On an objective account, taking the job is the incredibly obvious choice.\n\nBut, for personal reasons, I'm very much struggling. Basically from the moment I got the offer, I've been a wreck. I've felt sick, sad, and anxious. I'm having trouble sleeping, I can't focus on my work, etc. The upshot is, I feel sick about taking the job. In light of how nuts this seems, I'll give here what I think are the two most important personal reasons for preferring the Fellowship:\n\n1. I went straight to my program from undergrad and took a while to figure out what I actually wanted to research. I also changed fields from undergrad to grad. I feel like taking this job is cutting short my chance to grow into the researcher I want to be. The TT job is a 4/4 with required summer teaching at a school that very much values student-faculty engagement. Research is barely of importance for the other faculty I talked with. I'm terrified of total research stagnation, of feeling like I won't grow as a thinker after taking this position.\n2. I came into grad school not wanting to be a professor. It was always my plan to leverage my PhD into some other non-academic field. I had planned on using the fellowship to in part figure out other options and apply to other types of jobs. Taking this job feels like the obvious choice for someone who wants to be an academic more than anything, but that's not me. I enjoy teaching, but I've always known I enjoy it just because I like working with people, public speaking, and clarifying information - all of which were skills I hoped I could use in another field. I feel like taking this job is taking the clear and obvious path, rather than actually pursuing what I want to do.\n\nThings I've considered:\n\n\\- You can always leave the TT job. - Yes, true. But I can't ever get back a year of pure time, time to think about what I want, time to grow as a thinker, etc. Since I've been in grad school, I've just wanted time to actually figure out what I'm want (grad school is a madhouse, as you know), and now I've been offered it.\n\n\\- You can publish your way out of the job. - Maybe. But I know the kind of sacrifice that requires, and I just don't know if I can sustain it. Also I get the feeling that my new dept may respond with some hostility if they see me trying to conference/publish too much.\n\n\\- Overall, I know to everyone, and even to myself in some moments of clarity, the job is the \"best\" choice. So why do I feel so fucking bad?\n\nI'm overwhelmed and exhausted thinking through this. I know I am *incredibly lucky* to have this choice; that's not lost on me. I'd appreciate a little outside feedback, though.\n\nTLDR: Have a choice between research fellowship and TT job. Know that the TT job is the objectively better choice, but am having serious personal doubts. What do to?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(A few other things I realized might be helpful:\n\n\\- I'm not from a top program and I don't have an especially strong CV. I got no other interviews this job cycle. The chances of my receiving another TT offer range from 'Yeah, probably not' to 'For sure' from the faculty I've consulted. I'm going to guess it's much more like, 'Probably not,' just based on my experience this round.\n\n\\- In case I gave the impression I don't want to teach at all, that's not true. I think I could be happy in a school with more of a balance between teaching/research. Or honestly, I might be happy at an all-teaching school. I think what scares me the most is just that I *don't know*. And honestly, a lot of it is petty jealousy. I know other people who took longer, and they seem so much more sure in the kind of work they want to do. I don't want to have peaked intellectually at 26.\n\n\\- I don't think I'd mind doing a VAP or a Post-Doc (which I may be able to score next year). Everyone has been treating that like the worst possible thing, but honestly, if I was working somewhere with great scholars, learning a lot, I would mind having to shift gears a few times to do that. I think I just haven't reached the point of desperation yet. I'm young and am generally willing to sacrifice a little stability for the chance at a more fulfilling career, but maybe that's the naivete speaking.)",

(My shitty almost minimum wage job contributes to so much more of my anxiety and depression than school) meanwhile in K-12 school I became suicidal due to the stress. I mean if you think about it, I went from 5 days a week 7 hours a day in public school to like 3 days a week 4 hours a day in college. I\u2019ve improved so much and the load is far lighter. \n\nBut now I\u2019m terrified grad school will just put me back into that horrible downward spiral of being overwhelmed and all my time being consumed by school ON TOP OF abusive professors.

She passed away in December after a 20 month battle with cervical cancer. This week my grief hit me like a truck and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0\n\nMy Mom was diagnosed at the end of a rather disastrous first year. I had to defer my generals last year when she needed emergency surgery to save her life. In 2018 I took close to 7 months off informally, in that my DGS and advisor let me leave to be with her, but I was still paid my stipend. I don\u2019t regret this choice. I left in good standing and ahead on a few projects. I also finished all of my coursework.\u00a0\n\nComing back this semester, I\u2019m struggling though. I\u2019m not teaching or in courses - just trying to study for generals and finalize my dissertation prospectus. But I find myself incredibly apathetic and flippant about work. This last week especially, I just feel stuck. My advisor is supportive but not a resource to talk with about my personal issues. My family are \\~7 hours away by car. My friends just don\u2019t get grief having never lost parents themselves. While I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist for the last 3 years, it only does so much.\u00a0\n\nA friend asked me how I was doing in the office today and I just started crying. I\u2019m getting worried about my ability to prepare for my generals. I\u2019m behind on my review and I really only have one shot to pass. Everyone says to do the minimum. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even there....\n\n**Tl;dr**: For others who have managed loss in grad school, what helped you navigate grief while completing research? My mother died and I feel like I\u2019m drowning.\u00a0",

That move tacked on an additional two years, but it got us closer to family, so it has been worth the extra stress so far.

Coming to grad school, I had my \"why\" - I was going to do the combined degree program, go on for a residency to specialize, and then land back in academia to work as a clinician scientist. I was so passionate about translational research and veterinary medicine. I wasn't scared of the long path - I'd always loved school and worked incredibly hard and while I knew what the long path I was taking meant, I was excited for where I would end up.\n\nYeah...And now I'm suddenly not sure that I want any of it. I just turned 25, probably irrelevant, but I'm suddenly doubting that I have the stamina and the drive to make it through this program - the constant redoing of the PhD, the firehose of information of vet school, the 80-100 hour weeks of a residency. I don't think I can do it. And I'm not sure that I want the career that I always thought I did. \n\nI don't know what I would want to do instead. I find myself longing for a job where I can go to work from 9-5 and leave my work at work. Where my work life balance is assured. But I know that I would probably be extremely bored in a job like that. So I'm just left paralyzed.\n\n I don't want to do anything. I'm barely coming in to work and I'm not doing anything when I'm in. I'm so embarrassed because I'm not usually like this, at least not for this long, but I just don't can't bring myself to push toward something I don't know if I want anymore.\n\nI'll take any advice - please be kind if you can because I've been feeling very fragile recently.

            "content": "This Thursday I will be appealing my dismissal from my PhD program at the end of the 4th year in my program. I'll be using an argument around mental health where this past year following my single parent's death in a car accident, I've had increasing depressive states, moreso than that already exhibited in grad school so far. It went far enough into suicidal ideation that scared me enough to avoid a lot of my needed work, hence the dismissal, and instead accommodate multiple counselors into my weekly schedule. Asking for accommodations didn't help much, even when referring to the Americans with Disabilities Act. I guess I do need to also prepare a research progress update too if I am to stand a chance, plus potentially have my advisor's approval of such.\n\nI'm pretty sure I want to finish out my program but certainly need a break to deal with my own health instead of ignoring myself as often necessitated in certain ways grad school life can be lived out. Not sure if the argument will work or if the committee really cares that much. Since said dismissal formalities early March, I've really only received minimal correspondence from faculty and my advisor is mostly impartial still being on his own sabbatical. At least counselors are nice about it but it's kind of their job.\n\nI think through all of this, I'll be happy to finally get some change happening in my life. It's been a shitty year, so much so that even winning a new car last month didn't really make me that excited. I work on numerical analysis and climate science so a gas guzzling car is counter to my values (though fun road trips are still valued so I accept my fossil fuel use a little bit).\n\nIn any case, thanks for letting me vent. I don't know what I really want from Reddit just felt like reaching out. I've applied to a few jobs, need to ramp it up a bit though. I just feel bad since I haven't really told my friends yet that I'll probably be leaving. Still won't leave too soon anyway since I don't really have a home to go to right now anyway so I'll awkwardly be around campus for at least a while. But maybe I can leverage my network to work again in India or Japan given my internship work there in the past. \u65e5\u672c\u306f\u3068\u3066\u3082\u3059\u3066\u304d\u3067\u3059! But probably staying in home country and comfortable American culture to find jobs in Denver or Minneapolis would be a good first step.\n\nIf you have any advice or want to vent yourself in comradery, you're more than welcome to share. My main takeaway this last year is that your health is vastly more important than a silly degree. And please reach out to any crisis hotline if you need it. I'd even strongly recommend considering an honest conversation with your advisor(s). I think it'll only be these kind of honest conversations which will lead to better support in response to the current mental health epidemic in grad school.\n\nI have appreciated the opportunities I've had to try to improve myself and I'm sad it may end soon as it would happen in an educational setting, but I can at least look forward to having a stronger say in what I need in my own life after all this vs what the ivory tower thinks it needs from its students. Many opportunities exist outside grad school and not all will require a PhD. Plus, as you age more and gain more life experience, if a PhD becomes necessary, you can always try again. Grad school is often very fun just hard to balance with all life's curveballs.",

Nothing from my host, nothing from the government.

            "title": "Advice on choosing which program to attend this fall. (Sorry for the length)",
            "content": "So i don't really know what advice i'm looking for here, but I'm giving it a go since i have till the end of today to commit to a one of these two programs and my friends/families advice has been astoundingly lack luster.  \n\nI've been accepted to a few different programs for this coming fall and have narrowed it down to a choice between University of Pittsburgh (GSPIA) for their Master's in Public and International Affairs with a specialty in security and intelligence studies and Penn State Harrisburg's School of Public Affairs for their Master's in Public Administration. \n\nSo here are my concerns. I truly LOVE the GSPIA program it has everything i could ever ask for great professors, interesting courses, and the chance to participate in work groups that aid the FBI. They also offered me a merit based scholarship that just about cut the price of tuition in half. Penn State on the other hand has offered me no merit based scholarship despite their program ranking being noticeably lower than my other admitted schools that did offer me a merit based scholarship (Pittsburgh rank 31, George Washington University rank 13, and University of Indiana rank 1). Penn state also reports a 33% unemployment rate for it's graduating class of last year. The head of the program told me this is because the residential program is only about 60 students at a time and many are international students that can't find work in the first year due to visa issues. On paper Pittsburgh SHOULD be my obvious choice, but i'm utterly terrified to accept their great offer and move to the city. \n\nTo explain this apprehension I've never lived outside of my mothers house (My undergraduate schools were within commuting distance and i probably wouldn't have been able to afford college had i also had to pay living costs.) I also struggle with depression, anxiety and an Auto-Immune illness that made even my undergraduate schooling difficult. My professors always commented on how excellent my work was, but that my attendance was utterly terrible (Some classes my attendance was well below 70%, but professors gave me a pass due to the quality of my work and my illness). If i accepted Pittsburgh's offer i would be moving their and having to find my own apartment as they don't offer any sort of campus housing to Graduate students. (this also drives up the cost of attendance, but i could afford it so that isn't so much my issue.) So during this program i would have four classes a week for 3 hours at night, be in work group, and work some type of part time job to help with the costs.\n\nI know that graduate school is hard work no matter where you go, but i am so fearful that when i'm in a new city with no support structure i won't be able to keep my mental health, my illness, and everything in check to become a successful graduate student. It's such a big leap from having a relatively light load in undergraduate school (I only worked summers, and on occasional semesters when i had particularly easy classes) with a support network to get me out of my slumps and keep me honest that i'm pretty sure i'd fail. However, i'm equal as scared that if i choose Penn State, the program that feels mediocre, that it's going to utterly cripple my future job prospects (My undergraduate degree failed to get me a meaningful job, even after a year of searching.) \n\nSo i feel as if i'm stuck between going to program that will land me a nice job and teach me a whole lot, but that i don't know if i can adjust my life to be able to actually complete it or a program that seems utterly mediocre in comparison and my leave me without any real career potential, but i feel confident that i'd be able to complete without any major incident.    Like i said i don't know what sort of advice i'm expecting, but any would be appreciated right now. \n\n\\*\\*I thought after typing this to add two things. First i can still get experience in the specialty i want as Penn State offers a separate certificate i could get in Homeland Security that i could build into my degree using electives. Second this degree will most likely be a terminal degree for me, but i still have some interest in possibly pursuing a Phd after i see if i enjoy graduate level work enough to do so (I know school ranking can play into Phd acceptance so Penn State also scares me here since it is ranked 84th compared to Pitts 31st)\\*\\*",

But it certainly doesn't feel great!\n\nMy long-term goal has always been to get a PhD and teach/research in a university.

I'm thrilled, but I also know that PhDs can be stressful enough, let alone adding the knowledge that crippling student debt is looming. (Granted, I could go to teach a state school afterward and still qualify for PSLF, presuming Trump doesn't get his way with the program.)\n\nI suppose I don't have any explicit question, but I was hoping to hear from people with other perspectives, particularly from those who had gone through the PhD process (especially if you did so carrying debt in with you) and know financially how it can work out.\n\n(Edited to add: It also might be worth mentioning that because there is so much overlap between the coursework for the PhD and the Masters, I would basically shave the initial 2 years of preparatory coursework off the program length.)",

            "content": "Hoping to get some perspective and advice on something that has happened to a friend of mine. \n\nFor context, we're both finishing up our MAs at a mid-tier Midwestern university; I'm male, mid-twenties, she's female early twenties. We've both been accepted and are excited to attend PhD programs this fall. I will be staying in the Midwest, while my friend will be attending (she already has accepted the offer) a program at a university in the Deep South.\n\nShe was excited about the school and her offer until she returned from admitted students visit day earlier in the semester. Since then, she has been apathetic at best about the opportunity - today she finally told me why. At the visit day, one of the older PhD students, who was explicitly instructed by her potential advisor to look after her and show her a good time while she was there, drugged and sexually assaulted her. They had gone to a bar with some of the other PhD students, and this happened after. She told no one until she recently confided in another mutual friend and myself.\n\n Since she's been back this PhD student has been texting her non-stop, harassing her both about the assault and threatening to continue doing similar things when she arrives there. Additionally, he is the only other PhD student in the program with her specific research focus, and their advisor will be the same. She will likely be assigned as an RA to help him finish his dissertation because of this fact. He knows this, and is using this power over her in order to threaten her, saying that she won't be able to complete her degree without him/the advisor. My immediate advice was to screenshot the texts and send them along to someone - either her potential advisor or the graduate coordinator - at her new school.\n\nUnfortunately, she does not want to do anything about this, using really dreadful slut-shaming logic about how the initial assault was her fault, and justifying it by saying this guy will likely just \"get bored\" eventually and leave her alone. I know that she is scared to be moving so far away from home, and doesn't want this to be the first thing she's known for in a new program, but I'm having a really hard time with her desire to just do nothing, while she asserts that I should leave it alone because it's \"her thing.\" \n\nI can think of two possible courses of action here if she continues to refuse to do anything. The first, and most likely to have some effect in my opinion, is for me to go see her current MA advisor about it. This advisor is very close to her, and highly recommended the program that she will be attending. Furthermore, this advisor is very outspoken about ethics violations and gender equality in the academy, so I know it will strike a chord with her. My friend absolutely refuses to let her current advisor know, as she is a mandatory reporter.\n\nThe other possible solution I see is to reach out to the graduate coordinator of the university that my friend will be attending myself, and at least make him aware of the situation. I don't see this having much of an effect, especially if my friend is unwilling to come forward or speak to anyone about the situation. \n\nRegardless of what my friend thinks, I believe this kind of abuse needs to be reported - if not for her, for the potential others that this student (and potential future faculty) will assault and harass. I don't want to take away my friend's autonomy or ownership over what has happened to her, but I believe something must be done.\n\nAny advice on a potential next step? Or am I totally helpless here, since it didn't happen to me?",

I qualify for tuition reinforcement in my job so I decided to go to back to grad school. I wanted something to focus on development since GIS development is big in my industry and since I only minored in GIS i had 0 experience in it. \n\nI'm just over half way done with my GIS programming and web map development certificate(it works as the first part of my masters in GIS degree) and I'm realizing this won't help me become a GIS developer at all. As someone in my class explained, programming languages are not things you can teach anyone in just a few months and there are so many languages that are important in being a GIS Developer. What this degree will do is help me become a developer GIS(professional if that makes sense). I'm finally understanding in being a GIS Analyst/Admin/Developer the GIS part is just incidental, but there is no real training in being an Analyst or an Administrator but there is a lot of training needing to be a developer, which is why a degree for a GIS developer doesn't really work. You'd need a GIS degree and entirely separate developer degree to truly be qualified. \n\nSo I'm doing this GIS Programming and Web Map development graduate certificate, and next year I'll have my Masters in GIS and then I was planning on doing a graduate certificate in GEOINT analytics(there is a lot of course crossover) to make myself the most rounded professional I could be, but now I'm thinking it may have been better to double down in a GIS Administrator degree since, my pay grade is already the highest in this capacity. I feel like I didn't put enough thought before I started my pursuing further education(I definitely didn't since this is my second academic crises in just this year) and now I'm second guessing everything.\n\nHope that makes sense.

The idea of selling all my stuff, saying goodbye to my friends and boyfriend, and starting all over in a new city has me feeling equally scared and excited. My family doesn\u2019t live in this state and I wouldn\u2019t want to move back to this part of the country anyway, so it would likely be a very real goodbye. \n\nWhat do you think? Should I keep my comfortable job in a town I hate, or leave everything behind for grad school? I would really appreciate if anyone has any advice on what I should do, or if anyone has been in a similar situation. Typically, master\u2019s degrees are not necessary for civil engineers and often there is little salary bump for having one. I know the design firm I work at now doesn\u2019t care about graduate degrees at all. On the other hand, this degree would likely open up other doors and I might not necessarily end up in the design world, and may go into transportation planning and policy instead, which ultimately sound like more rewarding fields to be in. \n\n\nTL;DR: I need to choose between staying at a comfortable design job in a city I don\u2019t like, and moving across the country to go to grad school for something completely different in a much more thriving part of the country.",

To keep this somewhat concise, i'll avoid explaining why I am interested in these fields. I graduated (debt free) from college in spring 2018 with a bachelors in liberal studies, and a GPA of 2.72 with a less than impressive transcript to boot. To be honest, I was very lost in college, dealt with pretty severe depression, and wasn't excited to do or study anything. I only graduated by kind of floating through a multitude of menial classes.\n\nAfter working odd jobs for the last year and doing a lot of reflecting, I finally feel as though I have lifted myself out of the depression and am ready to point my life in a new direction. I am interested in pursuing a masters degree in one of these two fields I have interest in (architecture/fashion design). Unfortunately, both fields require portfolios, which i do not have (despite taking art classes in college/high school- lost everything to a broken laptop and frequent moves). I am considering attending a community college to familiarize myself with programs and techniques used in one of these fields as well as create a portfolio, and then applying to a masters program. I am also considering trying to learn the important programs and techniques on my own, and then craft my portfolio from home.\n\nSo I need advice on: what the benefits are for architecture/ fashion design as a career, what steps I should take to develop a portfolio/ what could be beneficial to include in my portfolio, what steps I can take to make up for my poor GPA and transcript, what steps I can take to look in to an affordable loan/ an affordable university to attend a masters program, and what steps I can take to be more financially secure throughout this process. I am also curious as to whether it would be wise to obtain my associates in one of the fields and then apply to graduate school, or if that would be a waste of my time and money (as a result of being forced to take unnecessary classes).\n\nI want to include that though I am not in a rush to make this happen for myself, I would hope to be able to be working in a field by the time I'm thirty. If what I'm hoping for is unrealistic, please let me know that too.\n\nThanks everyone!\n\nTLDR: 23 years old with a bad GPA looking to try and get myself into either an architecture or fashion design graduate program.",

The course is generally aimed at working professionals (not in the finance sector) and is part time and taught by distance learning. \n\nI want to do the course for a number of reason. Firstly I think I'll enjoy it. But primarily my aim is to enhance my knowledge/skills which in turn will help me to move out of the public sector and into private sector.

            "content": "I wanted to share my story because, 2 years ago, when I was grappling with my decision to quit or stay in my PhD program, I couldn't find many stories of people who had quit a science PhD. It was a difficult decision to make but was the right one for me in the end. \n\nI am not trying to encourage anyone to follow the same path, I only want to share my story in case it might bring some perspective to someone going through a similar struggle.\n\nSome background: in 2016 I started a PhD program in a subfield of biology. It became very clear I was unhappy. After doing 4 lab rotations in the first year and not being able to imagine myself in any of those labs for the next 4-5 years, I decided to leave the program. It's hard to describe everything that went into the decision and it usually ends up sounding like it wasn't a big deal. But it was a huge deal (lots of crying, I'll admit it) and lots of talking and thinking and internet searching. Maybe you can relate.\n\nI quit grad school with nothing else lined up. I don't necessarily recommend doing it the way I did because I got lucky. After I told the necessary people about my decision, one of them knew someone at a local biotech company and recommended me. I got a job a week later. I 100% recognize my luck here and this unfortunately means I don't have much to say about the job search after quitting.\n\nI worried that people would judge me for quitting grad school. The reality has been a mixed bag. I found 95% of people were supportive. One friend said \"if you felt like you needed to quit enough for you to go through with it, then that was absolutely the right decision.\" There were some people who asked why I didn't at least get a Master's degree. One person dismissed me as the type of person who quits things easily. I'm sure other people have formed all sorts of opinions. I thought it would be a huge shadow following me around for a long time but, for the most part, that hasn't been the case. Especially 2 years later, it is becoming a smaller and smaller blip on the timeline of my life. It's on my resume under \"experience\" and, when people ask, I tell them. It has not been a problem or deal breaker so far.\n\nI'm still working at that same company and have been promoted twice. I love my colleagues and the work that I do. I don't feel the sense of dread in the mornings that I felt in grad school. I don't feel the need to escape my life on weekends anymore. And I realized it is possible to move up in science-related work without a PhD. Grad school has the potential to be an amazing thing but it's not for everyone and it definitely wasn't for me. Admitting that to myself was hard (I had to go to therapy and everything). Everyone around you wants to see you succeed and wants you to stay in school (at least that was the case for me) and seeing a therapist can give you an impartial person to speak to. That helped a lot and I recommend it if you are going through anything similar and have access to one.\n\nMy main point is: it works out. Life is about trying things and I don't see leaving a PhD program as any kind of failure. We all try things and sometimes they're a bad fit or we don't like them so we move on. \n\nI'm not trying to push anyone in any direction and I hope this post won't come across that way. I would have wanted to read a story like mine when I was deciding on quitting. Maybe it will help someone, maybe it won't. Figured I'd share just in case.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you for the amazing responses and for the gold. I wasn't sure how this post would go but I am so glad so many people have shared their experiences here as well. I hope others going through similar things now and in the future can read this post and feel less alone. This is an amazing community.",

            "content": "So for the past 4 years I've been pursuing a degree I was absolutely miserable studying.  I started as a Computer Engineering major, changed to Health Science during my sophmore year when I really considered that maybe that field wasn't for me.  While as a HS major I rotated a lot of ideas and really heavily considered just doing lab or research work because I absolutely love science.  My university was really toxic however and told me to avoid that path and try medical or dental school, so I consider it.  Next comes along a terrible summer class I had to withdraw from and panic attacks that I'll never be able to do this and I can't even finish my degree before my scholarships are up.  I decide that well I'm at least good at getting by in Computer Engineering and I don't need grad school to get paid ok there, so I change back.  I ended up failing circuits and hating everything that semester.  I kept what was told to me before inside though and just said I'll switch to Computer Science since programming classes were always ok for me.  Flash forward to two weeks ago,  I am 4 years into my college career with 1 and a half years left to graduate with a degree in Computer Science.. I transferred schools to a less toxic environment and finally realize that I've been absolutely miserable with this degree.  I hate every single work opportunity I get (I had 4) and I never want to learn. I sit here thinking about an ideal world where I can just pursue a science degree and do research.  \n\nI ended up talking to my partner, who was starting to notice this as well but due to my stubbornness didn't push me too hard, and we decided that I should finish the Biology degree I started years ago, especially because it would take almost the same amount of time to complete.  I'm changing my major and really only worried about if I will end up needing a 7th year for my Bachelor's because of how class rotations are at my school. \n\nRegardless I'm much happier and even actually looking forward to the future for once.  It's crazy to feel.  I think these next two years to get my Bachelor's will be great.   I even plan to go to graduate school, which is something I was so against beforehand. \n\nI am afraid of some things though.  I'm afraid that my F in circuits (a class I can't even retake any more) my flip flopping of majors, time spent in undergrad, and a new fear about a D in my Programming Languages class will keep me from getting into any graduate school even if I do great for the rest of my biology classes.  I'm still even afraid I'll struggle to make ends meet with a career in science because of how much it was ingrained into me that these are failing jobs and paths, even if you're determined.  I would like some affirmation that things can be okay, but I don't know.  I don't care to live an extravagant lifestyle or go to a top school I just want to do what I love, and that's science.",

            "content": "Hello great people of r/GradSchool, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've lurked a bit over the last year and, at 40 years old, I should be finished with my master's degree this week. I am grateful for many of the posts I have read over the years and wanted to somehow express that gratitude. Some context so that you know whether to disregard this or not; I am a senior software engineer in advanced engineering in an emerging technology and my employer paid for 90% of my degree. I only paid anything out of pocket because I wanted to finish in 3 academic years. Please don't take that as a humble brag as I only want to provide a baseline if I say it was worth it. I will finish with a coursework master's in electrical engineering. I have a bachelor's in the same so it seemed logical.   \n\n\nAs I am typing on a wonderful mechanical keyboard that I discovered in my studies gazing upon the specialized paper, my favorite coffee cup, a fancy pencil, while listening to instrumental trance music in preparation to finish my last paper that is maintained on Overleaf and \"written\" in LaTeX. So, in no particular order, things I wish I knew.   \n\n\n1. Tablets are useful for quickly going through academic papers. The insurmountable research that needs to be done was made easier for me with a Surface 3 tablet my wife won and never used. I was able to be physically present in the evenings with my family and get through a dozen papers by reading abstracts and eliminating them quickly.   \n\n2. Student discounts even for old people. Yeah, look around, figure it out, and don't be ashamed. The craziest one I just got is an IKON ski pass. I called them to let them know that I am an enrolled student but would graduate before next term and they said \"time of purchase!\" Software like Adobe, random things like amusement, use your big brains to find them!   \n\n3. Find the tools that bring you joy. I am 40 so this clicky keyboard and the wordless electronic music of prior decades feel comfortable to me. Be true to yourself and use the tools and methods that work for you.   \n\n4. Clean your space. This may be only me but the office I created in my house to do all my work was a bit of a mess because of other work I was doing in the house. I spent a day between semesters and cleaned it - basically detailed the room - and my studies have felt better since.   \n\n5. I got my first cavity of my life last year. Grad School is consuming. Let things fall off, don't let dental hygiene fail. We tend to over consume caffeinated, beverages and make other poor health choices. Do your best to mitigate the damage. If you manage to keep your life together while going through this ridiculousness my hat is off to you and I sincerely respect you and am impressed with you. I am just a common guy with a job and kids. My life is not really in order.   \n\n6. Fraud syndrome. You guys post a lot about it, it is real. I am still not sure if I am at all smart or just lucky or if electrical engineering is actually really easy and I am lying to myself that it is hard. Maybe I am a fraud, maybe I am smart - I don't know. My wife beat this into me and she is the emotional type. How you feel about what you are doing is less important than the fact that you are actually doing it. If you are in grad school you got into grad school and, my fellow Redditors, if I can manage to do it you all can crush this.   \n\n7. Group work sucks. They make you do it. Find collaborative tools that you like to use. Take advantage of anything that your university pays for like Google suite and get out ahead of the projects. Set up a shared drive and start the paper before anyone else can. Set the tone. I have found, in engineering at least, doing that mundane stuff is appreciated by other students.   \n\n8. If you have to find your own group find people much older or younger than you. I learned more from group mates than professors.   \n\n9. Get to know your professors, go to their office and say hi. Ask specific questions about their research. Grad school professors seem to hold sacred the tremendous latitude they have in subjectively grading things. Be a human to them. The weirdest thing that happened to me is that I went across country with my wife and kids for my wife's aunt's funeral. It fell during finals week but it was a take home final. I was open with the professor about this and he called me, he literally called me, and said my final was poor and asked me to redo it. I ended up with an A in the class. Your mileage may vary and that may be a ridiculous thing to share but just be human. Also, being old is an advantage in grad school. No offense to you young and beautiful people but age does bring a few privileges. :-)  \n\n10. I don't know about anyone else but it felt like every single semester was its own game with its own rules. I was able to carry some skills from class to class but every semester was like starting over and I had to find a new routine that I learned just in time to finish.   \n\n\ntl:dr; Old guy needs to finish last paper for grad degree, procrastinating.",

I\u2019ve got two assignments remaining worth 25-30% of my grade for each of those two classes. In order to reasonably complete them I would need to barely/not sleep the next four days and I have a chronic illness that makes that kind of thing quite dangerous (have had very bad complications in the past). I have also been sick the past few days as a result of that chronic illness (affected by stress and lack of sleep/heavy caffeine intake) - I\u2019m starting to feel better now but I had to take a couple days off my work which set me back. Those were the first days off I\u2019ve had in months.\n\nI asked my professor for an extension (telling him honestly that I was sick, but not specifying details) and he said no, because the grades for the semester are due soon and \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be fair to those who want to submit on time\u201d. I can\u2019t just half-ass them either because they consist of questions that build on previous answers so you can\u2019t do the next question without successfully answering the previous ones (if it matters, I\u2019m in engineering).\n\nI could just decide to not do the assignments and finish with just over a 70% (minimum passing grade) as I have nearly perfect in everything so far. But the professors are on my committee (in a Master\u2019s program, will be continuing to PhD next year if all goes well) so this would look kind of bad - plus, they\u2019re classes at least somewhat related to my research.\n\nAlso a kind of irrelevant point - I\u2019ve also never got below an A- (in fact, almost all A+) through all of high school, undergrad, or grad school so I feel like I *should* be able to handle this but it\u2019s looking like I have no other choice but to just give up and take a minimum passing grade. Never been this stressed before (before you ask, I don\u2019t have a therapist and this isn\u2019t really a good time for me to start looking for one).\n\nWhat should I do here?

My own professor is just waiting for me to give up or fail and I'm not good at learning how to do lab work on my own without guidance.

I'm currently failing a class I don't have the time or background knowledge to be able to pass. I can't quit though bc then it'd be a complete waste of a year and my family will forever know me as a quitter. I will think of myself as a quitter. I used to be so productive and good at school. Now all I can think about is Memento mori: someday you will die. So all I think about is existentialism. Why am I here? I know I need a master's degree to get a job that pays a living wage, but is it really worth this misery? I am not a scientist and do not want to be a scientist. Science is interesting and helpful for progress, but I can't be one to do science. There are so many things I'd rather be doing; is this just something I think in every job I have?

            "content": "Hey everybody, this is my first time on this sub, so I don't know if this kind of post is common or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am currently at the end of my first year in an Economics PhD program. It's fully funded and at a decently ranked university (top 40).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI came straight from undergrad last year. I was originally planning only just doing my master's in economics at the same university as my bachelor's, as I get free tuition there from the benefit of a family member. At the beginning of my senior year, when I told my undergrad advisor my plan he brought up the idea of possibly going for my PhD instead, which I hadn't really ever considered. He basically said he thought I wouldn't learn anything new from their master's program, and that it would be too easy for me. Not having been exposed to much research, and not being hard set on the MS program I decided to entertain the idea and prepare to send off some applications. Over the course of the semester I was allowed to take the micro, macro, and econometrics MS level classes in place of the upper level bachelor's classes, and it became clear that my advisor was right about the MS program at my university not being worthwhile for me. This, along with introducing myself to the world of economic research, was enough to convince me that I would go for my PhD if I was accepted into a decent program. I ended up getting into a few schools, picking one I felt comfortable with, and starting grad school excited and proud of myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInitially, grad school was okay. I had a good amount of work to do, but I had an end goal that I was set on pursuing. I wanted to end up as faculty at a university somewhere. By midterms, however, I was very unhappy. I was not used to being challenged, and it was showing. Out of my small cohort of less than ten, I'm willing to bet I did the worst on two of the three of my midterms. I went home for fall break dejected. Not only was I struggling with my coursework, but I was starting to become disillusioned with my goal of becoming a professor, which I hadn't even been thinking about a year prior. I missed my family and my friends, and I felt completely isolated at school. That was my low point, and that's when I first considered leaving. At that point I wanted to leave immediately and never go back, but I decided to stick it out for the rest of the year, and at least have the choice of getting my MA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today, when there are a couple weeks left in the semester before the month long study session for comprehensive exams. My grades have improved dramatically, and I am no longer feeling overwhelmed with the  coursework. This is all fine and well, but what hasn't changed is the fact that I am no longer interested in academia, and I still miss my family and friends back home. I am leaning toward leaving with my MA, moving back home, and looking for a job, but this is a big decision that gives me a lot of anxiety. That's why I was hoping to get some input.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can skip to here if you don't want to read my backstory, but here are the reasons I'm considering leaving, summarized and categorized:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinancial:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStaying another 4 years would cost me 4 years of income at a decent job. If I starting working next year I could have my student loans paid off within a couple years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCareer:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know for sure I don't want to go into academia anymore, but I also don't know what I do want to do or could do with an MA. I have been doing some light job searching, and it seems I would probably end up doing something along the lines of business data analytics, or low level policy research. This seems somewhat interesting to me, but I'm not sure what's out there for me exactly. I'm fairly certain a PhD wouldn't be worth the 4 years if I know for sure I'm going into industry, but one of the main sources of anxiety for me is that I don't know what I would be getting into by leaving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonal:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am unhappy here. My cohort is nice enough, but I don't have a personal connection with anyone. There aren't many opportunities to meet anyone, and I can't imagine spending another 4 years with no real relationships with anyone around me. The academic community seems so toxic to me. Even within our department, nobody seems to respect work in any field that isn't their own corner of economics.\n\nI know I would be happier back home. My parents, my brother, and my best friend are there. I would have time to meet new people and discuss more than just economics. I feel like I would be wasting four years of my life being unhappy during I time when there isn't anything else to be unhappy about. There is something very appealing to me about getting on with my life, getting a real job, and growing outside of education. I feel confident that I will be able to find something I'd enjoy as a career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just struggle with the feeling that somehow I am wasting potential. Like the fact that I CAN pass these exams, and that I COULD probably survive the next four years means that I SHOULD. I know many people don't get the opportunities I've gotten, so it's hard to throw them away. I think fear of wasting potential is a reason I came to grad school in the first place. I'm glad I came here if not just for the MA and to figure things out, but it's proving tough to pull the trigger on the final decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, any life advice, career advice, or general thoughts would be appreciated.",

I went to one on the east coast that gave me full funding.\n\nA semester into the program, I started having an intense impostor syndrome. I passed my first year with a 3.56 or something along the lines of that, which is barely what was needed to remain in the program (3.5).\n\nSecond practicum rolls around and everything goes to shit. I was depressed and anxious 99% of the time. Started having issues with timelines and interpretation and things I needed to have down. My professor gave me a C- in the course, and I should be kicked out of the program because I'm below 3.5 but they let me stay in to see if I can do better. I did do better the next semester (got a B), but it wasn't enough. They wanted to kick me out, and I fought hard. Stayed in the program for another semester. Paid out of pocket to be there.\n\nSecond practicum rolls around again. I was clinically diagnosed with depression and anxiety the semester before, and was on medication. I still felt some effects. More specifically, I was tired, but I thought it was only because it was summer. I'd be at practicum but just immensely tired. Someone saw me nodding off during practicum and they would not let me go back. I went to my psychiatrist and we fixed the problem. The health center wouldn't let me go back to practicum unless they had a letter from them that was worded in a specific way. I asked my psychiatrist to write said letter--he wrote his own and wouldn't write the letter they gave. They woudn't accept his letter, and he wouldn't write another. I kept asking and asking and fighting and fighting but nothing was happening and it just ultimately made me look bad. One week without practicum turned into a month, in all this time I was just in panic mode and not doing anything. \n\nI was let go from my practicum site due to timelines. Understandable. My adviser kicks me out, though I gave a letter of dismissal iirc before the semester was over, so I like to say I left on my own volition. The program wasn't a good fit for me--I was miserable in the state, with the people. I woke up hating my life, myself, every day. However, the initial feeling of relief that I felt for the first week after I wasn't obligated to be in school has slowly been replaced by the need to pay for student loans.\n\n\nThe problem is, is that I have no idea what to do now. I've been out of school since November and I still don't have a job. My entire resume is primed toward me working with kids--I don't even know if that's something I want to do anymore. I have an associates, two bachelors, and a masters, and I still am like this. All I have is a mountain of debt. I don't know if grad school is even something that's feasible anymore. I wouldn't be able to get letters of rec from my this school--depression just seriously fucked up my performance hardcore and I went from a diligent & competent student who was only slightly anxious about the future to whatever I am now. I'm 27 and it feels like my life and career choices are basically over--that I'm going to HAVE to work minimum wage jobs I don't want to because I can't go back in time and change things.\n\nShould I even think about grad school in the future, once I have my life straightened out?

They also do not have many connections to government agencies I would like to work with. However, I know everyone in the department and the opportunities for research at this university are huge. Moreover, I would have a big data related internship immediately upon deciding to go here, which would definitely help me find a good job after school.\n\nThe other option is Johns Hopkins in China. I would have to take out significant debt, even though I have a 29k fellowship and will need to find 3k of my own money to afford going. My Mandarin would improve immensely and I would be able to follow a career path that has been cut off to me by financial constraints for my whole life. However, in two years, I will double my debt. Plus, besides my thesis in Mandarin, it doesn't seem like I will have all that many opportunities to conduct research, though many graduates from this program do go on to good PhD programs.

My (poor) reason for doing so is as follows. My fianc\u00e9 is still doing her undergrad, and until April 18th we were unsure if her parents would be willing to financially support her move to an out-of-state college. If they had not been able to do so, it would have been too much of a financial burden for us to move so that I could attend graduate school. I should have reached out to the department and explained the situation as soon as I found out that I wouldn't have been able to respond by the deadline, but I didn't and I'm really kicking myself over it.",

            "content": "I'm a PhD student, soon to be candidate, in a field where most spend a year or two doing extended fieldwork. I've spent the last year applying for grants, reading for and taking my exams, and writing my dissertation proposal. All coursework, MA, and a bunch of teaching obligations are done. This summer, two days after my proposal defense,  I'm starting a very intensive language course abroad. Though the work paid off, and I earned external grant funding to undertake my fieldwork, the past four years (especially this last one) have really been a marathon, with many sprints along the way, and I am burned out.\n\nInitially I had planned to stay in my city during the summer, and just take a couple of months off with nothing hanging over my head for the first time since starting grad school. I made these plans with my partner. Since I'll be moving to the other side of the world with a 13 hour time difference, it made sense to spend the summer together. Then the opportunity to do the language training came up and I couldn't turn it down; my partner understands because working on this language has always been a big priority for me, and important to my research. But it means I've got 3 more months of hustle, and my summer disappears. It would make the most sense just to stay on in my fieldwork location after it's over and begin research. But I'm not ready to move back to the other side of the world for a year or more in 6 weeks. Plus, immediately after this language program ends, my family is having a little reunion back in the US (home country) and I want to be there.\n\nWithout thinking things through completely, I decided to delay my research start time until November, so that I can attend 2 good friends' weddings in the US. I lived abroad for about 5 years before grad school and I missed a ton of these things - and I'll miss them again when I move back. So I figured I should just delay starting research for a while and instead of taking the summer off, take fall off and chill out in my US city instead.\n\nBut here's the rub - now that I've committed, the thought of spending 2.5-3 months with nothing work-related to do terrifies me. (FYI, my fieldwork fellowship I have requires lots of bureaucratic paperwork and visas so my start time can't easily be adjusted, and I'm more or less locked in to this timeline.) I know I need time off, but this seems like an excessive amount. Many of my friends have moved away to do their own fieldwork, and I won't have any big academic milestones I'm working toward. I am lucky to be in a position to swing it financially. I'm just... really scared I'm going to feel stir crazy, and that I'll regret taking this time, or worse, waste it (whatever that means).\n\nDoes this seem like a reasonable thing to do? I am really beating myself up for taking an 'extended' period off, and to be honest, I didn't think this way before grad school - I always tried to build in a little time off between jobs, even if it meant I had to live extra frugally to have a bit of time to feel human again. What would you do to ensure that you made the most of an opportunity to take a couple of months off and didn't get bored, depressed, or resentful? I know that this is a first world problem - I'm actually dumbfounded that it is even feeling like a problem for me - but I'm really anxious about it and I'd really appreciate hearing from others who have dealt with similar feelings at any point.\n\nSome ideas, specific to my situation: I have been getting into ceramics lately so I'd like to be able to spend more time making stuff. I also hope to do some more leisurely reading of work in my field and take advantage of some of the workshops and lectures I'm usually too busy to attend on campus. I'll spend time with the few friends who are around as well. And I'm going to prioritize working on my mental and physical health. But I'm still terrified that this time will feel 'wasted' and that I'll resent my decision to stay in town, with no game plan for too long. What would you do to make the most of an opportunity to take 2-3 months properly off? Has anyone else struggled with similar ambivalence about hitting the pause button? I feel like I've been brainwashed by a workaholic culture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I've committed to take 2-3 months off this fall, which I need because I'm burned out and about to move to the other side of the world - and instead of feeling excited or relieved, I feel ambivalent at best, dread of 'wasting time' at worst. Not sure how to make this time work for me and seeking suggestions and wisdom from anyone who's felt the same.",

Decided to ask Reddit.\n\nSo my story, graduated with a good undergraduate science degree five years ago give or take and have just been getting work experience since then. Ive been applying to medical school and recently had my fourth interview. I might get in, but I also might not get in and really need a plan B, since I've been thinking \"I'll probably get in this year\" for three years now. I have been accepted into a graduate program, pharmacology, in the past, but when I tried to advertise around for a supervisor, they all told me to fuck off because I'm trying to get into medicine and \"you'll definitely get in this year, so don't waste my time\". So I guess the lesson there is don't be TOO honest on applications. Similarly, I've just lost my job at a school because I took a few days off for my interview and they're also giving me the *goofy smile* \"you'll probably get in this year, and we can't use you for half a year\" routine like saying that while taking my job away is supposed to Inspire me somehow.\n\nI'm stumped. Been applying for work the past month and feel like I'm underqualified for absolutely every job that isn't shit. So I've been thinking of grad school again, but realistically have no idea what programs have the best chance of a highish paying and robust career. By high-ish I'm not talking 250 grand. I'd be happy to make 70 grand, which shouldn't be unreasonable for someone with a graduate degree. Are there resources to help me chose?\n\nShould I reapply to pharmacy and lie and tell them I'm no longer applying to medicine (I feel like they might ask)? The faculty of medicine is in the same building! Could that hurt me if I was caught lying on my application?\n\nMy GPA is great, I should have no problem getting into a program of my choice-- medicine is just particularly punishing in my country as the average GPA to enter is about 3.9.

I am a video artist/experimental filmmaker with a passionate interest in theory and film history and assumed that a proper film MFA would be as useful, engaging and rigorous as some of the graduate theory courses I was auditing toward the end of my senior year. After they offered me a scholarship, I picked up and went without much thought.\n\nLong story short, and now a semester and 3/4ths in, the experience has been a tremendous waste of time. I am terribly bored: the material is repetitive, almost arbitrary and mind-numbing. I could learn these things on a Wiki page. I feel less creative than ever and have sunk into increasingly depressive, aimless, flattened states of mind. The theory and history classes are surface-level in a way that even my freshman undergraduate classes were not. There is no intellectual community at all, and the professors, conservative and commercially-minded all, leave more than something to be desired. I can barely scrape myself out of bed to go to class, much preferring to work on my own independent art projects, read along with the more focused and challenging syllabi made for me by old professors and visiting local arthouse cinemas.\n\nMy impulse is to drop out; in fact, it is almost surely what I will do. My concern, though, is as follows: will dropping out exclude me from the possibility of getting a different post-grad degree, maybe something more conventionally academic,  later on? Has this bad dream, precipitated by a rash and cowardly game time decision immediately after graduation, damned me from participation in academia entirely?\n\nPlease let me know your two cents!",

I more or less wish I would have taken a slightly different path, albeit possibly to the same end degree. \n\nThe truth of the matter is, I'm terribly burnt out, but I'm finishing up year five of my PhD. All I have to do is synthesize what I've done already - methods development, most of the data collection - into my final two papers and get out. A traumatic accident (over 20 fractures throughout my body including skull and back) in July of last year put me a bit behind, but I've managed to physically recover from that.\n\nI will more than likely be going into industry (biomedical engineering), so I understand I'll have some flexibility with career options. I feel that my best option is to suck it up and push through to the finish line, which I hope to be around the end of this calendar year.\n\nAll this said, what strategies do you all have to cope with somewhat miserable conditions and ploughing through work you otherwise find miserable because it basically no longer represents what you have long held to be your goal? Any good music suggestions? Mental coping strategies? Is this the best course of action?\n\nThank you all in advance.",

I've sent them everything required.

I was informed it was still a group grade, but my teacher will carefully go over what we submitted separately. He's given me a B before by like .15%, so I'm not surprised he would word the situation like that. I'll try to forget the situation as there's not much more I can do. I'm sitting in A range for sure so as long as it stays that way, I'm good.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLet me start out with this. I know no one is perfect, but at some point...something had to give.\n\nI was assigned a group project in one of my classes (I'm an on-line only student) with two other members of the class. I have never had a single issue with members before. Sure, some of them didn't stick to a certain deadline, but nothing major and it could be easily resolved. We've all dealt with this. The two members of my group are international students. Because I work in IT, I also work with a lot of immigrants. I reiterate this because I am very familiar with working with people who's first language is not English. In a professional and academic setting, especially graduate studies, I would assume that the entrance exams into the program would require a certain level in order to be successful. However, my group members either are not at that level or are simply not putting in the work required. I've had a very difficult time attempting to get them to turn send me any of their work. I offered to do my part of the work, but also edit the paper if necessary. I in no way offered to cite sources, correct almost every single word, etc. Every time I've asked, they told me they're too busy to work on it, which is no excuse for me. Both of them? They couldn't even send me an outline?\n\nAt this point, I had to involve my professor because it was getting ridiculous. They refused to use email or Google Hangouts and requested using WhatsApp or phone calls. One of them even took the time to send me a request on Instagram...which is funny because at the University I go my maiden name and on Instagram I go by my married name. If I wouldn't have had issues with their lack of responding to emails, I wouldn't mind doing chatting over a different line of communication, but it wasn't the case. I wanted everything documented on our school email or messaging. We had ONE conversation over Google Hangouts. I asked them to submit their work to be with at least four days time  (4/22) to go over it and make sure all the citations **were correct** (btw, this goes way beyond citing sources)**,** not to create them myself, and I had time to create the PowerPoint presentation to accompany it. The project was due 4/26. What they sent me was absolute **Garbage**. In an 18-page document, about 3/4 of it didn't apply to the topic or if it did, I definitely didn't understand the point they were trying to make.  I went ahead and attempted to fix everything they had sent me without bitching. Eventually, it was Thursday 4/25 and I still had about four pages worth of work to finish. I contacted my professor, explained the situation, that I needed an extension. He agreed and I've been attempting to work on the paper/presentation, my own homework and assignments for other classes, my work-work, and my health (let's say 18/7 instead of 24 - I can't go without sleep) for the past two weeks. As I reached the end of the paper, I started becoming more and more furious with the situation - not because of the language, but because of the lack of effort they put forth into the paper. If they had questions, they should've reached out to me or the teacher. They did neither....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then I got to the required case study. We were supposed to find an applicable case study and review it. Their review was 90% word for word of the case study, besides a few synonyms they exchanged out. The entire review was the abstract from the case study, excerpts from the review of literature, and the conclusion. At this point, I called my teacher and no response. Luckily, the head of the department has become a friend and I contacted her. She asked for all the emails and correspondence, their paper, my edits to the paper - which is everything, and the messages she had send to my teacher. Unfortunately his correspondence has been severely lacking. She's going to take care of it all. I'm just wondering if I had the right to do what I did. I don't want a student to get in trouble unless absolutely necessary, but it felt warranted. All I want to do is enjoy the last of my graduate studies, but this is ruining what should have been one of the best weeks of my life. I've put my heart and soul into this work. It reflects on me and my future. Even if they didn't plagiarize, they still need to have a serious discussion with someone in the department about writing papers correctly. There is a serious lack of knowledge here that needs to be addressed, especially for someone in a graduate program.",

I had a perfect undergraduate GPA, loved my professors, enjoyed all of my philosophy classes, and had moderate success in that realm after winning several awards and conference invitations for an ethics paper that I wrote as my senior thesis. I got into one of my top choice masters programs a couple months ago, and I recently visited the school in person. But ever since getting back from that visit, I've been plagued by a deep discomfort about the whole prospect of starting grad school. I have been laying awake at night questioning whether I actually even like or care about philosophy enough to make a career out of it. I was good at it in undergrad, and good enough at it to get accepted to a well-respected graduate program, but do I love it? I'm not sure anymore. The prospect of studying philosophy at the graduate level for the next several years (let alone the thought of devoting my entire career to it) just feels.... wrong. I don't get excited when I think about doing research or teaching classes or publishing or writing or reading or studying in the area of Philosophy, in fact, that all is starting to sound kind of tedious. Honestly, after being out of the undergraduate bubble for a year now, philosophy and the idea of studying it further has lost its mystique and excitement for me and actually makes me feel a little trapped and panicky. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been examining all the possible reasons that for these new feelings of crippling doubt and worry. It's a fully-funded program so I wouldn't be going in to any debt or significant financial hardship to attend, and I've lived on my own for a while, so I'm not necessarily worried about moving away from my hometown or my family. I guess it could just be nerves about entering into a bigger, more prestigious academic environment and the new challenges connected with that, or maybe I'm starting to feel the economic stress at the prospect of trying to  find gainful, secure employment  with an advanced degree in the humanities... or maybe it's a combination of all of these things. Idk. I just know that I'm not pumped about philosophy at the moment and grad school is starting to scare the shit out of me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave any of you experienced a similar falling-out-of-love with your area of interest? What did you end up doing? Are you happy with your decision?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I have become apprehensive and doubtful about starting my masters program in the Fall, and I'm starting to think seriously about rescinding my acceptance and just not going.

My mom and I\u2019s already sinking relationship would get worse and I feel like I should at least try it out before dropping. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to grow up and do this. But this is a field that I\u2019m very passionate about after a very long internship in undergrad. Any advice?\n\nForgive me, this is long. \n\nI (almost 23, F) start my 2 yr masters program in less than a month and I don\u2019t even know if I really want to go. If I am gonna go to grad school for anything, THIS would be the field I\u2019d choose. But now I\u2019m not sure if I want to go.\n\nI was originally put on an alternate list for one of the schools I applied to and was doubtful a seat would actually become available. So, I cried for a few days and then started making other plans for the next year or so. I was excited to start these plans and thought about reapplying for school again in the fall. Last month I got an email about a seat becoming available.\n\nI read the email as I was leaving work and I honestly was just shocked. I had no idea what to think or how to process it and I wasn\u2019t excited at all. I literally drove in silence on my way home when normally I have the windows down and music blaring.\n\nI live at home and I didn\u2019t tell anyone for almost a day. When I did tell my brother, he told me that if I were going to go to back to school, now is the time to do it. The school is fairly close to home, I\u2019m accepted now, and I\u2019m still pretty fresh out of my BS program. He is a big believer in not giving your money to colleges and you can make a career out of networking and blah blah blah. Except you can\u2019t really make a career in the medical field without a degree.\n\nI\u2019m also currently going through a rough patch with my mom. When I told my parents the news another day later and explained my hesitation with it, she said \u201cYou are going to school!!\u201d about 5 times to me. Because we are on bad terms, I can\u2019t really talk to her about any of this nor do I feel any support from her when I tell her the LIST of things I\u2019ve accomplished EACH DAY in preparing for school.\n\nI already signed a lease with 2 roommates, bought my books, paid for my background check/drug test, and am almost to the stage of actually signing up for my classes.\n\nI was really excited to start working on my new plans that included traveling, but that won\u2019t help me move away from home (which I desperately need to because of my mom and I\u2019s sinking relationship). With school, I\u2019ll at least be out of the house and away from this shitty town.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m not ready to grow up and tackle this program when the only thing on my mind is, \u201cHow much can I work to pay my bills and save money for traveling/festivals to do in between semesters AND keep my grades up??\u201d Literally everyone I know in the program (a couple of professors included) advise against working at all during this time.\n\nI feel like I should at least give it a shot and if I really hate it, then I can drop out. \u201cIt\u2019s only 2 years\u201d I keep reminding myself. But I\u2019m really worried I am about to spend a lot of money and put myself in more debt just to end up hating it. I also know that dropping out before even starting will make mine and my mom\u2019s relationship even worse. I know I should do things for me, but like.... who doesn\u2019t want to make their mom happy...? I\u2019m torn.\n\nCan anyone offer support in either direction? Thank you",

I had no idea how to learn effectively and had to play catch-up throughout my 4 year degree. I graduated last June with a first-class masters degree in chemistry. I wanted to do a PhD but I talked myself out of it because I didn't think I was a strong enough candidate, mostly due to my unconventional academic history but also because I was dealing with a lot of personal issues. I've now been working in the software industry for the past 8 months. It's fine, pays well and the opportunities are great but it doesn't interest me in the same way chemistry does. I've been teaching myself to code during downtime at work and that got me back in the habit of self-learning. I'm going over my chemistry books again and I've applied to study a maths qualification (my weak maths skills were always a sticking point for me).\n\nI'm not naturally gifted when it comes to chemistry, but science is one of the things I love most in life. I want to apply for a PhD in physical chemistry in January 2020 for 2020/2021 entry. I'll be 27. I've drafted e-mails to 2 professors to ask for academic references and I think I'll send them after the weekend. I don't think I'm a strong enough candidate yet (particularly as I want to apply for some of the most prestigious universities here in the UK) but if all goes well, I think I could be by the deadline.\n\nI don't necessarily want to be an academic (though I probably wouldn't say that at any interviews) so I know that realistically, doing a PhD will set me back in my career. It's not the greatest choice financially either, but as long as I can live somewhat comfortably I don't really mind not being as rich as I might have otherwise been. I'd really appreciate some thoughts/input on my situation before I make any decisions I can't take back!",

I thought it would get better when I got past the first 2 years and into the full-time research, but I'm starting to second-guess that. I feel like my passion for the field, and maybe research in general, has been slowly sucked away. It's almost been validating that this happened because it proves these issues aren't all in my head (and tbh, when would my advisor have shared their concerns otherwise???). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a while to go until I'd retake the part of my exam. I am making aggressive inroads to work on my mental health to make sure that's not the core source of the issues.

I had always had it in my mind that I would pursue an MSW after I graduated but am now recently getting cold feet and am unsure if it\u2019s the right move for me. The main reason I am reluctant to pursue the MSW is due to the low salary that it commands. I\u2019d likely be making less annually than I make now without the masters, and COL isn\u2019t cheap in California so this is a big factor for me. I am now considering some alternative paths but they come with a considerable amount of post-bac preparation, which I am trying to keep to a minimum due to my age (29). The alternatives I am considering are a Psy.D or Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner.

I've been having a really stressful time making this job work with grad school and hearing that just felt like I got kicked while I was down.",

            "content": "25M, 2 years out of a non name state school with BS in Finance. I\u2019m quickly realizing, post grad, how much I fucked up my undergrad opportunity. My GPA was a 2.98 and my work since graduations has consisted of a PE Search Fund internship and Back Office/Client Service work at a large Broker/Dealer. \n\nLong story short, I went through a bout of depression and mental illness junior and senior year which decimated my gpa and career goals. Since resolving said issues, I\u2019ve set my sights on breaking into high finance (Equity Research or Portfolio Management). I understand the odds are drastically against me, I figured it was time I finally commit myself to a goal and see how far I can go. I\u2019ve been networking extensively, am scheduled to sit for Level 2 of the CFA program this June, and will prepare for the GMAT following that.\n\nOutside of the fore mentioned stats, I\u2019m considering returning to school for a masters degree, particularly an MSF. I\u2019m not expecting to get into a T25 program, but was hoping to build my quantitative skills and advance my career. Aside from the lack of work experience and poor GPA, I\u2019m mostly concerned about my lack of quantitative coursework in undergrad. A majority of the MSF programs I\u2019ve researched in Southern California state their candidates should have extensive experience in multi variable calculus, linear algebra, R, C#, or Matlab...all things I do not possess... The highest level of math I\u2019ve completed is Calc 1.\n\nSo I was hoping to get some guidance and realistic advice on my prospects.\n\n1. Do I even stand a chance given my current stats (poor GPA, lack of quantitative background, average work experience, but good extracurriculars)?\n\n2. Would attending a CC or Uni and taking some math or programming courses increase my odds?\n\n3. Should I give up and look more into an MBA?\n\nAny and all advice would be welcomed.",

            "content": "I'm was never the smartest, never the brightest student. Not even in high school, college or even now.   \nBut I know when I want to study, then I WANT TO STUDY and I HAVE TO STUDY. \n\nI'm a girl (youngest) and I have resigned from 3 jobs (2 jobs were from government institutions). I can't even recall how complicated each of them was. To start with, I come from a country where being a civil servant is dream job for 99.9 % people, everyone worships the job and even try to bribe to get the job. Here's list of my previous jobs :   \n\n1. Export/Import Division  \nGraduated from vocational degree in Uni, majoring in IT. I ended up working in subsidiary of the biggest garment company in Southeast Asia. Our native language isn't English, but in my work I had to use English on daily basis. I had to deal with General of Customs (the real deal), 2 out of 3 of my bosses were also Korean and they didn't speak native, so we could only communicate in English. I was doing REALLY AMAZING, but it was the kind of the company that whatever diploma you have, you'd be paid with the national minimum wage. Long story short, handed my resignation letter after 3 months. Boss said he'd consider raising my salary. NAH, I left , I knew it, I would rather code until I cry. So I went to continue my study to bachelor degree, taking IT major.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. IT Staff (Government Institution)    \nStill in bachelor degree (early semester), out of curiosity because all my friends tried to applied for this particular job, I applied too for a job in a government institution. Made it out as the highest scored applicant, got the job immediately. The salary was massive, really massive. And my job basically I had to input whatever data from a paper form into the system (computer). **The hardest thing I had to do was setting up a printer and scanner**. It was a 9-5 job, I had to input data for 8 hours straight. I swear to God I applied for IT position, so I was expecting something else. But my job, even high school student could do it. Quit after 2 weeks, boss asked if the reason was the job wasn't challenging (HAHAAHA. EVEN HE KNEW. OMG. But I was such a polite girl so I gave another excuse). Also had a fight with one of best friend since she was applying for the job too, got rejected meanwhile I ended up resigning, if I didn't apply to begin with, she could've got the position. Drama. (Again, working in govt. institutional is dream job in this magical country). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. IT Staff (Government Institution)    \nBachelor degree (last semester, just months away from thesis defense). Dad passed away, crying a lot, panicking, massive financial chaos since Dad was the only financial source, no one else in the family was working. I tried my best to get any job fast, so I could help my family. So I applied for a job, in a local govt. institution. Again, highest scored applicant, signed the pre-contract. **The hardest thing I had to do was using Microsoft Office**. Yes, but this is govt. institution and I was guaranteed a safe life, to have a job for the rest of my life, good salary, get pension money, get to wear the 'famous' civil servant uniform. DREAM JOB (!) My mom would iron my uniform literally every single day, she was so proud and told the whole neighbors that I was a civil servant. Again long story short... quit after 2 months. Reason ? said I was going to take Master degree, boss told me I could work and take master degree (special employee classes) at the same time, he permitted it, No, just NO. I would rather pull all-nighter every night debugging my code than having 8 hours sleep from working and getting a degree from courses I don't even attend. I quit. My mom was soooo devastated, she just couldn't justify and understand my desire to go to school. (I'm not coming from a family with academic background). We didn't even have any money and my only option was getting a scholarship, ASAP. I had a deal with my mom, if I wasn't getting scholarship for a period of time, I would go back working to help my family.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose 3 jobs were the kind of job that when I woke up in the morning, I'd be like \"here we go again..\" with plain expression, no passion, not excited, no everything. I was like a living dead, I wasn't happy.  You've no idea how many neighbors, friends (even best friends), families even your own mom said how STUPID you were for wasting so many job opportunities, how many people actually fight for the job, day and night, even bribe for the job. ABOUT HOW UNGRATEFUL I WAS ?       \n\nDeep down I knew my life couldn't possibly just stop there. Getting a safe job for the rest of my life work using Microsoft office. I'm not saying the job is necessary a bad job, I just feel like people have different calling in life, and that just isn't what my heart wants. I know what I want.   \n\nOn the other side, do you understand all the panic, the legit headache when you're in school ? Paper deadline, code debugging error to the point it haunted you in dreams (I did dream about it !! LOL), learning new programming language ? Research presentation ? The whole \"Which way should this experiment go after this, damn it I'm stuck at this step !\". This is the kind of headache that I miss !! I want this migraine ! This is the one that always keep me going, I wake up every morning longing for that feeling. That's why I keep coming back to school and I'm not even that smart. duh !\n\nHappy ending ? Hopefully !! Now I'm taking my master degree abroad on a scholarship. (YAAY!!!!) Not only I still can support my family financially from my scholarship money, I also get to GET BACK TO SCHOOL !! \u2764 Maybe (or not) I'm going to continue to PhD. PhD is world apart from master degree, 2 years hardwork alone isn't enough. It's a 4-5 years commitment, crying, lose your shit, crying again, debugging error, sleep deprivation and crying again. I don't know if I'm ready for that, I don't know if my family ready for that, I miss my cat, I don't have scholarship yet, no LoA yet and I'm getting old !! But, I really can't imagine my self outside academic field / school, no. Damn it, NO. What would I do then ?? Collecting more cats ? XD    \n\n\nDear whoever read this, this might sound cheesy and cliche but LISTEN TO YOUR HEART. Don't go around knowing what your heart wants and give it something else it doesn't desire. It will take some time to make big decision in life, take time as you need. But when you know you're really want a specific way in life, don't wait, go for it !!",

I don\u2019t know if any university will accept me anymore because of my poor gpa from university. I\u2019ve been feeling nothing but an overwhelming amount of anxiety these last two weeks and I start my next semester (possibly my last) in 10 days. I need plan but I feel like I have no options. ",

I took time off for financial, mental, and physical reasons but I am now 100% ready to go back. My schooling will be paid for by the GI Bill so I have nothing standing in my way any longer. I am applying to a Liberal Arts school that has the following majors that I would be interested in: \n\n* **Communications** \n* **Humanistic Studies** \n* **International Affairs**\n* **English Literature**\n\nI can also minor in these along with some others I would really be interested in that I cannot major in. My prospective career is to be a teacher (preferably a language, or literature), translator, guidance counselor or social worker- so this makes me want to lean towards Humanistic Studies, especially because honestly that is what I would find the most interesting and would likely excel at.\n\nHowever, Communications also seems very promising for Education or Community Service. Obviously English Literature would be great for teaching the subject and for writing. International Affairs could possibly be the most fruitful career-wise with Foreign Service, and working with International Institutions- as I hope to completely relocate from the US after I graduate. \n\nOn the Common App, there is no option to apply Undeclared but on their official application there is- but I fear that applying undecided especially after such a long break would make me seem disheveled. But I don't want to rush into a major just for the sake of doing it. I really like all of these and am having trouble deciding which would be the best for me career wise and enjoyment wise.\n\nThis school is an American School based in Europe and I have read in some of their niche reviews that changing your major is sometimes frowned upon there. I really ***really*** want to get into this school, it's my #1 and I'm sure I would enjoy any of the above majors. Should I just go with Humanistic Studies or should I risk applying undecided?\n\nAlso, for the record, I know there is a big debate about applying Undecided on this sub! I have applied Undecided to every single school I have applied to before them in my previous years and have been accepted to all of them. I'm just paranoid about my time frame now that it has been longer. \n\nAny advice would help me out a ton! Thank you so much :)",

            "content": "Hello, I'm an Asian from a upper-class family coming from a state in the Mid-Atlantic. The odds are already not in my favor.\n\nOn top of that, my grades are far from perfect. Bad GPA, SAT could be higher. I had a really rough freshman year following a death and struggled for a while to stay afloat, especially with other household issues going on, overcommitting to activities I've since dropped, and working at a restaurant. I definitely don't see that as a complete excuse because I know plenty of people who have gone through worse and still managed to do much better, but it really did shake me up. However, I know for a fact that if I were to redo high school right now, my grades would be completely different. Each year there has been an ascending trend, but I don't know if the upwards trend is steep enough.\n\nMy extracurriculars are decent. I created a nonprofit, have a position in the local government (not school), hold multiple leadership positions in a few clubs that I genuinely care about, I'm on track to be the only person from my team (in my event) to qualify for forensics nationals (cfls) since the creation of the team decades ago (and basically rejuvenated the team), etc. I've also worked different jobs. I was purposely vague because of identity purposes, but I feel like my activities do reflect my interests in the social sciences, which is what I picked as my field.\n\nMy essays are pretty great too. I feel like they could have been even better, but I think they're still pretty decent. They touched on the struggles I underwent and how I've gotten better since then and grew from them. I also had a slight push for how I'm not the typical asian, but I don't know if they'll catch it.\n\nMy rec letters were probably okay. My 1st teacher's was probably an 8/10, my 2nd probably a 6-7/10, and my 3rd was probably a 15/10.\n\nWill they even look at my application beyond seeing my grades and my ethnicity? I know they have a holistic review process, but if they're sorting through thousands of applications, I don't see why mine wouldn't just be dropped as soon as they find those two red flags. I have mediocre grades and no hook \u2013 not a URM or a legacy.\n\nSorry, just feeling really deflated. This whole process has been incredibly rough and I know it just sounds like I'm whining and I know everyone else is going through the same process, but I just feel like I've been spending the past years trying to climb out of the whole I dug my freshman year, but it's just not going to amount to anything anyway. I really want a fresh start because I intend on thriving and working my butt off in college, especially without having to worry about previous years pulling down my cumulative GPA. I know Harvard is going to have that type of environment that is going to push me to keep working harder and learn new things. I really don't want to come to a stall like I did in some of my years in high school.\n\nI'll try to stay positive though. (#newyearnewme) Good luck to anyone else out there. I know the rest of the people applying to Harvard are probably much more qualified. Regardless of whether you get in or not, you're still all of the top students out there whether it be through academics or something else.

I was in your shoes just last year so I know the struggle, except I was applying with much lower stats than any of you geniuses in here. Let's just say that I fucked up during my first year of high school. Failed multiple classes because I wasn't the most motivated. Got my shit together for the rest of high school and got straight As but it wasn't enough to erase the damage already dealt.\n\nI was also at a lack of information due to coming from a very poor and uninformed family, so I didn't study for the SAT until really late, and ended up with a 1390, a score which even I believe to be trash now. I was so scared I wasn't going to get accepted anywhere, hoping my professional acting experience would make up for my lackluster academic record. \n\nLong story short. I got into UCLA. it was my dream school and I was so excited that I managed to get in from a super competitive high school. However, I was hit by a wave of imposter syndrome when I first set foot on campus. Multiple people from my hometown were worried for me that I wasn't going to survive due to my lackluster scores.  I was worried myself, and felt that  I didnt deserve a spot over so many smarter than me that got rejected.  I was stressing the whole quarter about whether or not I was going to fail since I was the odd one out. I checked my grades once the Fall quarter ended. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got straight As\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was so happy. I couldn't believe that I not only managed to survive, but did much better than I anticipated. I guess what Im trying to say is that your numbers don't define you or how smart you are.  You can still make up for it with a killer work ethic in college, If you fucked up in high school, that's okay just explain it in your app. And if you get into your dream school but have people doubting your ability, prove those fuckers wrong and kill it your first term.

Before I get into anything, I\u2019ll state my stats in case anyone was wondering.\n\nSchool: top 10% of 700 students\n\nGPA: 4.33 W, 3.78 UW\n\nACT: composite score of 33 (34,33,31,34)\n\nSubject tests: 780 Math II, 710 Chem (did not submit)\n\nEC: counselor for camp, library helper, Kumon tutor, tennis, internship at USC for biochemistry, etc.\n\nSchools applied to: Northeastern (EA), UCI, UCSD, UCSB, UCLA, Georgia Tech, Boston College, UofMichigan, USC\n\nApplied as general Chemistry major for all schools.\n\nEven though I live in California, I refused to do any cal stats because I only applied to schools I would actually go to. Not saying anything is wrong with cal states because I know how great the facilities of CSULB, SDSU, Cal Poly Slo, etc. are. I would just rather go to community college at that point and transfer into a more prestigious school.\n\nI\u2019m already mentally prepared to get rejected by UofMich, UCLA, and USC. My sister is attending her third year at USC for neuroscience with a tuition of  around 9k/year, so if I ever get in, it would be because of legacy. \n\nI\u2019m mostly concerned about Northeastern because I obviously EAed to it for a reason. I\u2019ve been singing about it for so long because I felt that it was a perfect target school for me. But after reading a lot of reddit posts, I\u2019m beginning to think that I overapplied to reach schools and only applied to one safety school: UCI. At this point, I feel as if my stats are so mediocre and regular compared to everyone else. I do realize that the majority of people who care about colleges and post on reddit seem to have higher stats than the average senior, but I can\u2019t help but feel so upset about myself. I used to dislike UCSD because my sister chose USC over that school, despite the fact that she got in as a biochemistry major. (UCSD is #2 in the nation for biochemistry and the major is highly competitive for admissions) But now I want nothing more than to get into UCSD LOL\n\nI\u2019m posting this more as a reminder to myself that it\u2019s completely okay, regardless of the results. I think I\u2019ve just constantly felt so compared to my sister but we have different dreams and aspirations. My sister wants to open up a clinic and therapeutically help others, while I went to work for the CSI as a forensic chemist. Same branch of STEM but completely different dreams.\n\nI\u2019m a first generation Asian immigrant, which at this point isn\u2019t that big of a deal because we all know many first generation immigrants around us. I realized that I can\u2019t exactly use that as a hook when it comes to my applications, because the immigrant population is actually much more higher than we assume. And both of my parents went to college, as my mom got her bachelor\u2019s degree in pharmacy and my dad got multiple bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in computer science, software programming, etc. I guess you can say that my family is extremely STEM oriented. But besides that, I can\u2019t help but feel so hopeless, having such high bars already set up for me. \n\nIn the end, I just want people to understand that it\u2019s really not a good idea to base off your expectations on college decisions from reddit and everyone\u2019s posts. If you\u2019ve noticed, there\u2019s always a large range of cases, and no 2 students are the same. I guess this post was more for myself to vent than wanting feedback.\n\nI\u2019m sure you guys would be curious about my sister\u2019s stats so feel free to ask and I hope 2019 strikes off amazingly with EA and ED results. Praying for all of you and I simply only want happiness for my peers.\n\nGod bless you, happy New Years.\n\n\n\n",

I've exhausted just about all of my resources and I just really need help with the process here. \nThanks so much in advance! ",

            "content": "I am currently a junior attending a large high school in Greenwich Connecticut (an affluent area that is very competitive when it come to schooling).\n\nRight now I am completely overwhelmed with the college process and feel as though the trajectory of my entire life rests on what I do this year and the next.\n\nSo now I'll give you a bit more background about me and what I\u2019m trying to do: I\u2019m a pretty good student, I am taking all honors and 4 AP\u2019s this year, despite that, most of my grades are A\u2019s this year. I did very well last year with all A's, but in my freshman year I didn't do so well with only two A's. Ive grown a lot as a student and since being diagnosed with ADD my freshman year, my learning experience has become a lot better. My weighted gpa is 4.2 right now and I project it will be around 4.4 at the end of this year. I haven\u2019t taken a ACT but from taking multiple practice act\u2019s I think i'll be able to score a 34-36. My strong suits are math and science and am looking at doing engineering for college.\n\nBoth of my parents are immigrants from europe. One from Germany and one from England. Neither of them went to college and my family as a whole is deeply confused on the entire college process. I\u2019m not entirely sure how being a first generation will help me in the college process.\n\nAnd lastly, my extracurriculars. First I play a sport called waterpolo and am pretty good at that, I\u2019m looking to get recruited but am not sure I want to take that route. In addition to that I swim. Secondly my other activity is interacting with my german community. I speak german fluently. I am the President of my schools German club and I help out at the local german school every Saturday. I\u2019m not too sure how this helps but I just wanted to show how I was different as many other people don't interact with german communities. But I don't have any extracurriculars for math or science and am not sure how to start doing one or which one to do. The only extracurricular that I do have for math/science is a internship at Duracel this summer.\n\nHaving said that, another large problem is that I go to a very large school. My junior class has about 700 people in it. I believe that I\u2019m in the top 10% but that means my class rank will be very low. And that also means that there are a lot of people at my relative level.\n\nMy guidance counselor haven't been much help. Although she attempts to help I really don't think she has a great grasp on me and focuses on what other people did. But besides that, she adores me so I'm sure that ill get a glowing recommendation from her.\n\nSo now that you've heard my entire background. What kinds of schools can I get into? Give me examples! What specific things I can do to ensure I get into a top tier school? In terms of my highschool career, what can I do and what should I stop doing. Please help me.",

Both commuter and go-away schools.\n\nHere's my situation: my parents make too much money for me to qualify for any need based assistance from the schools or the government. My parents won't be helping me pay for my tuition either. So I'm basically on my own. \n\nNow if I go to a commuter public school, I did the math, I'd be able to work a part time job and afford the entire time with no debt. If I do a community college then I'd be able to pay for the two years and have nearly enough money left for a year in the go-away state school. \n\nThe negatives to this though is that the commuter schools, especially COMMUNITY COLLEGES, are known to have less of a social environment than dorm schools. \n\nFor a little while now, I've been wanting to go away for multiple reasons:\n\n-I'm honestly CANNOT STAND being around to be at home around my mother anymore, I see an onset of mental illness that might worsen her behavior in the coming years and I don't want to be around that\n\n-My high school is so boring and I feel like I've missed out on so many \"high school experiences\" I look at other people's high school and they have fun but NOTHING, I MEAN NOTHING, ever goes on in my school.\n\n-I want to be around more of my own race, I feel like such an outcast at my high school (some of you guys may not understand this point but it has really affected my experience a lot)\n\nI feel that after how my four years were at my current high school, I honestly deserve to have a better next four years. Besides that, I truly can't stand my mom and I don't want to feel a certain way at home after I turn 18.\n\nThe cons to this though is that I'd probably have to take out a loan and a part time job wouldn't be enough to pay it off before school ends.\n\nI need some honest advice because I'm really stuck on what to do. I'm still 80% leaning towards going away but also still thinking about how beneficial a commuter school would be.\n",

Dropped out her sophomore year due to depression and allegedly lives somewhere on the east coast, doing \"modeling.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2011- I have not been able to find anything out about this year. Extensive research has led me to believe that a valedictorian was not named this year, for some reason or another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2012- Enrolled in Amherst, but she started showing signs of schizophrenia during the second semester of her freshman year. Didn't return after that summer. Nowadays I see her occasionally while I am out walking at night, peering out of the window of her bedroom wrapped in a blanket. Sometimes I can hear her softly playing the piano.

He enrolled in college at the University of Alabama (on a full ride, of course) much to everyone's horror. Has gone missing after graduation. The rumor is that he moved back to Pakistan. For what purpose, we don't know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2014- I fucking miss him, man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2015- Fried his brain on drugs at UC Berkeley, currently confined to a mental institution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2016- No valedictorian named, the probable winner was kicked out of Harvard for her bizarre behavior, and has basically gone missing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2017- Still okay, for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2018- It was revealed shortly after graduation that she had basically cheated her way all through high school. Stanford has not yet taken action against her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy old neighbor was the valedictorian in 2008. His parents have completely lost contact with him basically ever since he graduated high school. He took over his college savings account. However, I think I know what he is up to. In 2011, my father ran into him at the local super market. Their conversation was very strange: He told my dad that he was going to move to Thailand after graduating from Dartmouth, and from what I can tell, he did. A dark thought in the back of my mind tells me he is not there to do humanitarian work, but is rather working for the CIA, doing God knows what...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/03/gina-haspel-black-site-torture-cia/555539/](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/03/gina-haspel-black-site-torture-cia/555539/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone have any idea about what the FUCK is going on?\n\n&#x200B;",

Financial economy. Ap Graduate. so 2 years with \u00bd a year internship.Only there is no prestige in this school. I took an intro course because it had been years since I last remembered mathematics. It was super flawed, even the two pretend \"exams\" had errors in over 40% of the problems we had to solve. waste of money. and its not just me, my hwole group who solved them complained. Everyone smokes. and I don't see the education leading anywhere. at the same time, I suck at law and tax. I  don't even think I know how to study it properly.\n\nso in effect, I am saving money by staying home, wiht a privilegies, but at the same time, I see my career going nowhere.  every other day I feel like I am in prison.I want to move to Nice or London or some otehr place. But I KNOW that just moving out of frustration is a very very bad idea that is often poorly planned.\n\nThus, I keep telling myself that this is \"just a steppign stone\" and I am in thre process of writing aplpications to real universites.But the truth is, I am now 28.  I visited a councelor at an international business university. they told me I am too old. That was two years ago.I can start writing applications.. but It seems unlikely that I'll get accepted, or even be capable of completing the education. I have a lot of rutines to change. I am not a person who smokes or drinks a lot or do drugs. but I do waste time on tv and games and stuff like cleaning or reading about becoming organized.\n\nI HAVE to evolve. and it can't go fast enough.\n\nI have  to find some way of being truly content. or at least not feel like I am jailing myself.\n\nI know some people moeve to another country and end up way poorer, but rationalize it as them \"being more free\", which simply isn't true. not if your pay is half. there are certain standards of living that it is only stupid to discount. Such as being able to afford a car or air conditioning.\n\nidk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck.\n\nI tried applying to Monaco IUM, to HUlT university, to CBS in Copenhagen,. the issue was, at the end of the day, despite legit efforts, I never got the applications fully completed.And it doesn't help to have a selfish father who do tonnes of shit like gaslighting my every move, or preventing his dying wife from finishing her will for his own monetary gain. only to then undermine my credibility to family friends. and my older sister is not at all better.  The ex I had who was on my side, made some bad moves that further gave ammunition for my sister to turn my father against me. because he is also racist as hell and my ex is asian. we still talk, but have busy lives. I tried to send her christmas cards which she appreciates. but since she literalyl lives in Asia, it is unrealistic and I am alone.I am alone. and even the school friends I studied with.. they are non-tall, smoking, hooked up girls. and I am a tall non-smoking guy who doesn't even watch soccer or care about stereotypic male things like cars or shit. I am not a tool. And yet I have let myself become one. Moving out just opens up my father and sister burnign up all my dead mothers inheritance faster. no really, you don't konw the half of it.  like randomly buying tow machines for 6k$ simply becaue my father \" wanted to make a dining table\" and saw an ad. and he never even began making that table.  its just sitting there for years. and he could have bought a table easily for way way under 6k$\n\nsigh..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsometimes I get frustrated and burn myself out.  and in that moment I feel like my only option is to sleep. especially when my father and sister creates this image of me as the bad guy. regardles of me showing strong work ethic. like showing up at school every day for two weeks at an online school where it is not even required to show up. and then the day after the course ends, I overhear my sister say to my father in his pseakerphone \" so he is too lazy to go to school today or what?\".. like who talks like that? and the worst part is, the only information she has, she has gotten from my father. which means that HE has been the one giving her wrong information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFUCK!  \n\n\nall I wanted to do was write a simple post about how I am trying to apply for universities. But I get sidetracked. constantly. if its not my family drama, its cleaning, or other insignificant shit.",

(150 words)**\n\nOne of my extracurricular activities is entertaining other people by selling medicines. I mainly trade cocaine, meth, and heroin. I used to sell marijuana as well, but I got bored after it became somewhat legal. By supplying unofficial medicines, I truly make other people\u2019s lives happier. \n\nFor example, one of my friends\u2014let\u2019s call him Jeff\u2014used to be a dull valedictorian with basically no social life. \n\nJeff spent most of his time doing the homework, acing the tests, trying hard to win competitions, etc. Jeff was more like a robot than a human. \n\nHowever, with magical substances, \nI successfully turned him into a human-being. Today, he\u2019s one of us; he quit the school, flips burgers, and occasionally gets high. \n\n\n**What is the most significant challenge that society faces today? (50 word limit)**\n\nIncompetent admission officers trying to select the best minds of the world. \n\nYES I AM TALKING TO YOU!!!\n\n...I was joking. Hope you had a good laugh. \n\nNow, accept me to prove that you\u2019re not incompetent.\n\n\n**How did you spend your last two summers? (50 word limit)**\n\nI studied 40 hours a day to score 1700 on SAT. \n\nOther than that, how I spent my summer is my private matter. Mind your own business... You don\u2019t even fucking know me. \n\n\n**What historical moment or event do you wish you could have witnessed? (50 word limit)**\n\nI don\u2019t fancy history, although I got a 5 on APUSH :) \n\nBut, there\u2019s one historical moment I\u2019d love to see:\nMyself getting into \u201cSt. ANfoRd.\u201d \n\nMake it happen.\n\n\n**What five words best describe you?

(50 word limit)**\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to become a billionaire. Clearly, due to its location and its historical record of #billionaire alumni, going to Stanford will automatically make me a billionaire. \n\nI thought about going Wharton or Harvard, but becoming an entrepreneur has a better odd of making $billion than becoming an investment banker.\n\n\n**Imagine you had an extra hour in the day \u2014 how would you spend that time? (50 word limit).**\n\nIt\u2019s not worth answering to this question, because I know I wouldn\u2019t have an extra hour. Rather than wasting my time to think about how to respond to this stupid prompt for an hour, I\u2019d spend that one hour productively.\n\n\n**The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning. (100 to 250 words)**\n\nAs I mentioned in my extracurricular essay, I professionally supply recreational medicines to my customers, mainly my classmates. While it seems like it has nothing to do with academics, it is closely related to economics, as all businesses are. \n\nLast year, one of my classmates thought it might be a smart idea to copy my business, and he actually did. Consequently, as my business was no longer a monopoly, my profit almost halved. Many customers, even the loyal ones, turned their backs to \u201cget a better deal.\u201d \n\nI personally struggled. People, who I considered to be my friends, betrayed me, and my business was falling apart. I was clearly losing the competition with that bastard, even though I mastered Game Theory. \n\nI knew I had to take an action, and I soon had my lightbulb moment. If I get rid of another supplier, I can become the monopoly again!\n\nI consider myself a doer, so I immediately contacted one of my friends and explained my situation. After my explanation, my friend agreed to resolve my problem in return for a few dollars.\n\nA few days later, my competitor disappeared. Everyone at my school became happy again, and I was able to earn money for my tuition! :-)\n\n\n**Virtually all of Stanford\u2019s undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate \u2014 and us \u2014 know you better. (100 to 250 words)**\n\nHello, you don\u2019t exist, because I\u2019m planning to request a single room. \n\nIf I don\u2019t get a single room, I\u2019d get an apartment outside, because I cannot stand an idea that someone will break into my personal space. \n\nWhenever my mom, dad, brother, sister, or friend intrude to my room, I cry as loudly as possible to assert my dominance and to warn them \u201cdon\u2019t fuck with me.\u201d \n\nWhile I consider myself friendly and open-minded person, I just can\u2019t... \n\nWell, I think I made my point. \n\nBye.\n\n\n**Tell us about something that is meaningful to you and why. (100 to 250 words)**\n\nI care about prestige, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m applying to \u201cSt. Anford,\u201darguably the best Catholic school in the world. \n\nWhile Stanford\u2019s acceptance rate might prevent me from getting in, once I get in, it turns into the biggest pro. \n\nNot only I\u2019d fiercely defend your controversial admission policy, such as legacy or affirmative action, to show that I passed the higher bar, I will always inform other people that I went to Stanford. \n\nNo matter where I go, I would be able to confidently say, \u201cI did my undergrad at Stanford. What school did you go to?\u201d \n\nNo matter what other person\u2019s answer is, I would be able to respectfully reply, \u201cHa, peasant!\u201d \n\nThen, people around me who heard the conversation will be awed by the fact that I went to Stanford and worship me. If not, I would make sure they do by directly speaking to each one of them. \n\nOverall, attending \u201cSt. Anford,\u201d the most superior institution in the world, gives me a right to brag my degree and crush other people\u2019s pride. \n",

            "content": "I'm 25 now, had finished undergrad at a top school (IIT) in India and working a well-paying job. But I have a major regret in life - not going to a US college for undergrad.\n\nSo, my dad who is a bureaucrat, got posted to Washington DC at the Indian embassy there for 3 years. I was a junior in high school in India at the time. My parents tried to persuade me to join high school there. I'd have to repeat junior year, but the family would stay together and I could apply to a US college as a US resident (not international student).\n\nNow, preparing for college admissions in India is a really challenging task. Students go to school and then go to special coaching centres to prepare for entrance exams. I was in the middle of all that for engineering entrances, and being the immature kid I was, I just didn't want to leave this preparation half-done, leave all my friends and head out to the US. At that time I had no idea how much better the US was in general, and for college education in particular. I did take the SAT, without preparing for it, and scored a 2220. Mainly because I'm good at English and Math and that's all the SAT is.\n\nNow even though I got into a great Indian college, I feel if I had taken up the offer, I could have secured admission to a top University with scholarship, and studied under the greatest minds of the world, and really found my calling and enjoyed my college life.\n\nIn India, I ended up pursuing Computer Science just because it had the highest paying placements, and once you get into the college with a particular major, there's no scope for changing it. I didn't really enjoy the studies much and scored a dismal 6.9/10 GPA in college.\n\nI recently discovered this sub, and reading all the posts here makes me feel I missed out on a great opportunity.\n\nIt's a major regret I have in life. I keep brooding about it even though I know I can't change anything now. All I want to ask you guys is- do you think there's a silver lining? Am I romanticising how good it would have been if I'd come to the US? Is there a catch that I'm not thinking of? Am I better off having studied here rather than there? I just want something that can make me feel less shitty about it, but not a placebo, something that's actually true. Imagine, it's been 7 years since I started college, and I still keep thinking about it.",

            "content": "From 8th to 10th grade I had a couple family events that became really stressful for me. To put it concisely, these events kind of triggered depression that took 90% of my energy away from my school work and I just wanted to sleep and eat when I got home. It went on and off, so thankfully I didn't come out with any C's. And during my bouts of non-depression I could put time into my ECs which are quite good.\n\nThankfully, the summer before my junior year the situation improved tremendously, and we also moved to a different part of town (and away from certain family members) and I felt so much better. I was suddenly motivated to try way harder in school. So I started studying way harder, and also hung out with people who were much more supportive. I got only A's from then on.\n\nFreshman and sophomore year I got some B's. My UW is about the same with freshman year (3.69) or without it (3.70). So there isn't really a difference between how, say, Yale (includes 9th grade) and Stanford (ignores 9th grade) will calculate my GPA.\n\nI still took a very rigorous course load. And my school (kind of a \"magnet\" school, but the exact type is unique to my region) is quite challenging. In most classes, you do *not* get A's unless you study extremely hard. I often wish I went to my town's regular school. I would have had the same personal issues but could have cruised through HS with a 4.0 like many of the people who will be compared to me in the admissions room.\n\nI beat myself up about this every day, I just wish I could go back and tell my 14/15 year old self to fix his damn issues instead of hiding from them and ignoring the important things in life.\n\nThe only evidence I have that schools will care is 1) Stanford mentioning you should apply RD if your grades are \"on an upward trend\" and 2) one of the Harvard essay questions asking if you're a \"late bloomer.\"\n\nI included a short description (1-2 sentences) of the situation in the additional info section. But I wonder if I should have fleshed it out more. \n\nI understand they get so many 4.0/36 kids that it's unreasonable to expect them to treat me the same. But at the same time, I am a totally different person than I was when I was 15. I'm more mature, I am more organized. I know I will be prepared enough for even a hard college. The only thing I worry is if they'll believe it.\n\nI'm not hooked and my scores are fine: 36 ACT, good (750+) subject tests. My ECs are great, same with essays.\n\nI have no question that I would be seriously considered if I had a 4.0 based on the past HYPSM admits from my school and on here, in terms of essays and ECs.\n\n**TL;DR**: I have B's freshman and sophomore year, but all A's junior and senior year. My UW is 3.7 but I have a high weighted and solid scores. Do I have ANY chance at top schools?",

This has been the school I've wanted to attend for years and you can only imagine the pure excitement I felt when I was offered not only admission but a full ride merit scholarship to attend. However, unfortunately, my parents did not share the same excitement. I always knew that my parents didn't want me to go out of state for college, but for some reason, I thought that the reason might have been financial. So when I showed them the scholarship I got, I thought they would reconsider their decision. They did not. I live in Georgia and they keep telling me that I am forbidden to leave out of state.  They tell me I must apply to Emory, GaTech, etc. They say that being too far away from them is a terrible decision that I will \"surely regret\". And they also claim it is too dangerous for a girl to leave for college by herself and that I can only leave them once I get married. So \"I should just forget about this whole NYU thing\" It doesn't help that my parents are foreign (Nigerian), so they believe in micromanaging every aspect of their children's lives\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, in my heart, I know that NYU is the school for me. However, my parents are refusing to accept this. I was heartbroken when I showed my parents my admissions and scholarship decision and they just shrugged it off, telling me it did not matter because I'm not going. Not to be dramatic but it felt like someone literally punched me in the gut. This whole situation is causing so much stress for me. So guys what do you think I should do? Any advice is appreciated.

Fuck collegeboard, fuck all the ivies all the T20s, fuck this whole process. It's so mentally and emotionally draining and it's put so much strain on my relationship with my family. Unfortunately I wasn't blessed with wealth or a straightforward family situation so this is so much more complex and messy than it needs to be.\n\nI'm turning 18 tomorrow and right now I want nothing more than to go back to elementary school, a time where I glamorized this point in my life and saw it as an impossible dream. I was happier then. I'm not ready to be an adult. I've spent my whole life trying to be the best I could be, making the best of my circumstances, stepping up in the house when no one else wanted to.

I understand now that this isn't the end and I still have so much life ahead of me and this one setback isn't the end of everything. Thank you all for helping me realize that. \n\nI've decided to go with what many of you recommended and contact the colleges to explain my situation.

Even some dumb people who don't know one goddamn thing about history are getting A+ and I don't understand what's going on with her\n* Multivariable Calc: I had an A- at the midterm with an 83% test average and promised myself that I would get it back up, but I had so much work due on the last test day and I think I bombed it again\n* Mechanics: I had a B+ at the midterm, his tests are so bullshit because one multiple choice question is 6 points and there's only like 4 grades a term\n\nI'm just burned out and have no motivation to do well in any of these classes besides college.  And it's not like I want to go to one specific college, I just want to get into one of them and actually do stuff that I care about.  I barely have time to interact with anyone in person and sleep like 5 hours a night.\n\nDebate went to shit for most of this year because the coach was an asshole who didn't let us go to any nationally competitive tournaments.  They just fired him but it's so late in the year and I have limited time to show colleges how good we actually are.  I don't even like the other ECs I have, they all suck ass.\n\nWhat the hell do I do",

            "content": "Hi, I am a senior who has been awaiting college decisions. Lately, I have been feeling slightly depressed and sad over my current life. I have been recently deferred from BC and Northeastern but have gotten into bing and stony, so it has been a stressful time for me. I dont want to go to college because college marks the end of my childhood and i don't want to grow up. My parents are very poor Asian immigrants who put a lot of pressure on me. My mom is very controlling tiger parent. I(Male) have never been in a relationship because my parents say they don't want me dating until I am 25! WTF. Once i get to college, I want to get in a relationship and have nice experiences with the opposite gender. Also, I am not particularly handsome not very ugly and was born with not so great looks, but i know my looks can be improved by hitting the gym and getting some muscle. However, my parents dont like me going to the gym, say it is a waste of time, and not allow me to go (even thought my health is slowly deteriorating). All my immigrant parents want is for me to do well in school, and I did do semi-decent(1530 sat score and 92 unweighted at a prestegious feeder school and 9 APS by graduation ), but it doesn't mean anything if girls don't want to date me and I am not happy. I used to run track sophomore year and I have developed plantar fascitis and it has hurt me for 1 year and a half. I can no longer run track, and it has always been my childhood dream to run track. I feel crushed. Another thing that is conflicted me is my special needs. Recently, I have gone to a therapist for mental health issues and wanting to know why I was different from other people. My therapist told me that she suspected I have, \"high-functioning autism\" and I was, \"on the spectrum\". However, she couldn't officially test me for it, but could refer me to another clinic to undergo evaluation.This didn't come as a surprise because I have always known I am different from others. It was hard to talk to others for me and understand people until I was around 11-13. A few of the super smart kids in my school have suspicions I am autistic. However, my parents don't want me to be officially evaluated in a real clinic so I can get an IEP. My parents have the notion that if I am not struggling academically, I am not special needs(they were told this by my idiot uneducated relatives back in China- that if someone excells at academics, they cannot have special needs). I know in Asian society, there is stigma in being different and having special needs, or even of seeing a therapist. People with special needs are ostracized and cast off in Asian culture. This is a deep ongoing struggle in me as I know I am different from most people. My therapist told me that the reason i wont get evaluated for autism is because there is a very deep stigma in asain society of being labeled as special needs and my \"Asian parents will lose face\" as a result of me obtaining the diagnosis.  My life story is very unique and I am afraid of failure, growing up, and leaving home. All I have known is suffering and nights being yelled at and trauma.  What should I do? What tips do you have with me? ",

            "content": "This might be a bit long, apologies in advance! Just looking for some help figuring stuff out.\n\nSo basically, I'm a senior in high school, and I fast-tracked a full year in high school by taking extra courses. I live in Canada and \"skipping\" grades (as in, the school system letting a student move up a grade) isn't a thing here as far as I know, and it's not allowed in my school board. I always felt really under-challenged and out of place in the grade I was in, and as I left the gifted program for high school (so I could get better grades for university), I decided I would take extra courses online/during the summer to work a semester or year ahead (this is the only way to work ahead in my school board). This was definitely the best choice for me for a number of reasons, and now that I'm a grade ahead, I've found a great crowd of people and it feels like a better fit.\n\nMy school is semestered, so I've just started my second semester of grade 12 (final semester of high school, and last 4 courses). I am SO burnt out. I'm way more stressed than I've ever been in my life, which is saying something because in working ahead I've juggled a full two semesters of courses/work in a single semester, 3 or 4 courses per summer, and volunteering/jobs/sports etc. I have a really stressful semester and so much school work on my plate, plus there are still supplementary applications/scholarship applications to submit to some universities, plus I'm trying to find a part time job (which I don't have time for) and a summer job so I can make enough money to cover some of my university costs. My mental health is beginning to suffer, and I can feel it.\n\nI've had serious issues with depression in the past (thankfully have been doing better for awhile, but the stress is really starting to get to me), I've got anxiety, and just generally my mental health has suffered a little bit as a result of the academic, personal, and other stresses I've been facing over the past few years. I'm planning to get a summer job (even if only for a few hours a week), and I really want to spend my summer focusing on making sure I'm a happier, more relaxed person before starting university in September.\n\nThe thing is, I've realized over the past few days that if the semester continues as such a crazy pace, I don't think the summer will be enough time for me to recover and really get into the best state of mind. I am so incredibly stressed and worn out. I haven't really had summers to fully relax/cool down for a few years, because I've been taking courses. So for the past week or so, I've been thinking about maybe taking a gap year. Part of me thinks it would be a great idea; I could defer my university acceptance to spend a year working, keeping healthy, relaxing, doing a little bit of travel, saving up some money for university, and just generally living a more stress-free life. One thing that would be really cool is that I might have the opportunity to go on a six-week certification course/whitewater canoe trip in the Arctic with some friends, which would be super beneficial for me (I've done other leadership programs with the same organization for years, and they've been incredibly transformative for me). I wouldn't have this opportunity if I didn't take a gap year, as I would have to work to pay back a good chunk of the program cost to my parents. It might sound stupid, but an opportunity like this would seriously change my life, and it would give me the opportunity to run trips like this in the future (going into a Kinesiology/Outdoor Recreation program, so I'd have all the certifications I'd need to get a great summer job as a university student). Additionally, I could spend some of my gap year working in Outdoor Education/leadership programs with some friends, which would be beneficial to me as I could really take time to be in nature and get in touch with myself while also helping others do the same thing (and getting paid!). \n\nAnother part of me thinks, \"Well, I've made it this far; I've worked ahead a year, I've applied to universities, I might as well go.\" I guess I'm just worried about my sanity. I'm also worried that I won't be able to fill my gap year. I can't afford to go backpacking or travelling, so I'd probably work a full-time outdoor ed job in the fall/spring, or a couple of part time jobs. I could go to the gym every day, meet up with friends more, etc. I can't think of many other things to do, and I'm concerned that I might get *too* bored. I keep picturing myself waking up in the morning and not having school to worry about. What would I do? What *could* I do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I guess what I'm asking is, should I take a gap year? Why or why not? And if I should, how could I fill my time?\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated! I'm just trying to figure things out, I've been super stressed about this for awhile and I guess I'm just hoping for some clarity.",

            "content": "Last night my mother and I got into an argument (political in origin). She has always had major issues with understanding appropriate disagreement, and tends to take everything as a personal insult. The argument ended with her telling me that I was a horrible human being that she would never associate with if she didn\u2019t have to. \n\nThat\u2019s usually how these discussions end, but this morning she says to me that she thinks that I\u2019m mentally ill, and that only violent terrorists and psychopaths believe the things I do. She said that she thought I was going to end up being some type of shooter or something, which obviously hurt my feelings coming from my own mom. I have no history of violence of any sort, I have no violent tendencies, and overall I\u2019m pretty happy with how my life is going. I have no idea where these ideas of hers are coming from. \n\nShe has always been slightly unstable towards me, but then she pushed it to the point where I now need to really consider some stuff. She told me that if I didn\u2019t see some therapist she was going to call everyone she could contact at UT or through the Army, and tell them that she thought I was some kind of violent lunatic extremist. I am extremely concerned that this could result in my admission and scholarship being jeopardized, as that information coming from someone\u2019s mother would generally be taken seriously. If I allowed her to force me to see some therapist I would likely lose my ROTC scholarship, and I can\u2019t afford to go to UT without it. Would it be smart for me to try and contact UT and Cadet Command to try and warn them about her, or should I just hope they don\u2019t take her seriously? I don\u2019t know what to do, and I\u2019m afraid that she\u2019s going to ruin everything I\u2019ve been working towards for the last four years. What should I do to try and mitigate risk? I need any advice possible.\n\nEdit: She is extremely anti military, and is convinced that I am doing ROTC as a way to stab her in the back, I don\u2019t know if this has anything to do with it. She has also been getting worse and worse lately, and I\u2019m concerned that her mental health has been affected by the stress/ anxiety that my going off to college may be causing her, despite her refusing to give me any financial help in the last 6 months.",

Even though she has worked for three years straight (summers and school years) there is objectively not nearly enough money to pay for even an in-state school. So my friend, without a loan, without parental support, without enough personal income, has seriously resorted to looking at community college instead of all the other great colleges she got into. She has applied to multiple scholarships, but realistically even when combined with a min wage salary they still won't cover tuition. Financial aid is a dead end, as her parents messed up when registering her citizenship so she is currently ineligible.\n\nIs there ANY other option? She is adopted, if that makes a difference.

Most of us are hard working compassionate people. Not all but most.\n\nI am URM female STEM. CS.\n\nI will be totally honest.\n\nWhen I first learned that I would receive an advantage because I'm Hispanic, without knowing anything else, without knowing what it implied, I was excited. I didn't want to beat any one out or take their seat. I just wanted to a good school for my major. Japanese back in 2013. I had grades from As to Cs afyer going to the number 2 school in Texas at the time. No APs. I was lazy but afraid to take APs at a school that I knew was challenging as heck. \n\n\nThe reason for that fear was because my mom would always push us not to take on risks. She lived by the better safe than sorry mentality to this day. And I absolutely hate that I bought into that and I take full responsibility for giving into fear but yeah... I wanted the ability to work hard at a good school and study my butt off and do well for myself. I was a rebellious high schooler who didn't want to do anything not relating to my chosen major. And unlike many Asians, I didn't have parents that pushed me through that rebellion O understand that they can be true hell, but meeting such expectations would have put me in a waaayyy better position for school. My mom to compare just expected my siblings and I to not fail, esp after my older sister got pregnant and dropped out of HS and my other, younger sister had autism. The bar was set reeaallyy low for me. Just graduate p much. That's what a lot of URM parents want. For their kids to neat the odds. \n\nWhen I got into UPitt, rather than be proud of me or be disappointed I didn't het into an Iby, my mom, a single mom was worried about how tp pay for it. She made 80k and got no grants and had to report my dad's army pension even though he helped us very little if at all. Then my mom was layed off and couldn't send me at all. So those hoping for my failure, there you go.\n\nAhh sorry for how long this is. But I wanted to give insight of the difficulties even mid class URM go through often. Poor URM have it much worse. I still am happy for my URM advantage cause after that, I worked my butt offff in trade school and community college once I found my nack for and interest in IT and CS. I had gone to community college for a year before this but was not motivated, questioned my major and dropped out. I got all As in trade school and As with a rare B in CS comm college after that. Due to my first year tho , my GPA is 3.4. So mr getting into a college with a good rep would be an up hill battle so I am disgusyed by it, but I'm hoping for my URM to maybe help me bridge the gap. Bevause I know I have what it takes to succeed in such a school, my GPA is just penalizing me for my lack of motivation from 3 years ago. And that really isnt fair.\n\nI hate very much, that my URM stat might take away a seat from somebody equally as hard working if not more.  With equally hard lives if not harder.Let me iterate thats not something I wish for or condone, but it is out of my control if thatcwere to happen. I hope you all go to schools of equal if not grrater caliber than me and reach your much earned success.\n\n\nSoo I hate being URM but I cant help but hope for it to possibly help me reach my present full potential.\n\nI humbly submit this and apologize for any pain I've caused. I hope you all get something from this retrospective. And perhaps I dare say understand at least a little, my position.\n\nThank you.\n",

At the end of my sophomore year (2015) I was academically dismissed from the college. No excuses - I absolutely should have handled the situation better. A lot of what happened was out of my control, but I blame myself for not tackling the issues before it came to dismissal.\n\nAnyway, I planned on applying for readmission and working through it, but it turns out my health was worse than I thought. I have cancer. And my life has kind of been in limbo since then. I've always loved school and I really want to go back, but my previous school does not offer online degrees. Unfortunately, due to the academic dismissal, I don't meet transfer eligibility requirements for any of the online programs I'm looking at. Has anyone had success transferring to another school without meeting the requirements? I'm waiting to hear back from some of the admissions staff, but I figured maybe someone on Reddit could make me feel a little less alone in this situation. Thanks.\n\ntl;dr - Good student, love school, but was academically dismissed from college for various reasons. Have cancer, can only do online school, don't meet transfer requirements due to low GPA/dismissal. Just looking for advice/similar situations/positive stories.",

            "title": "Hey Kids, Community College is a great choice too",
            "content": "I just stumbled upon this subreddit from /r/all, and it brought back all the stressful memories of applying to universities as a kid in high school. I applied to many schools but was not accepted to a single one. I was absolutely devastated and thought my life was over;  I would have to work in retail for the rest of my life. \n\nI\u2019m excited to tell you that none of that is true. My #1 school was UCSB, I even appealed their denial, but they kindly told me to fuck off. I didn\u2019t know what to do until I stumbled on a Google advertisement for Santa Barbara City College. \u201c#1 City College in the Nation!\u201d it claimed. I did a little research while I was in my CS class and said what the hell I\u2019ll apply. A few clicks later and I am a student at SBCC. \u201cWell that was easy... a little too easy.\u201d I was certainly skeptical at first. I thought that going to CC would be like a stain on my permanent record. I thought employers would laugh me out of the interview room upon learning I lowered myself to the unthinkable standard of Community College. Little did I know it would turn out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made. \n\nOver the course of the rest my senior year I began to get more excited about my future the more I learned about it. I learned that many of the professors were actually adjunct professors with the university, and the university was closely involved in the curriculum so as to ease the transfer process for students who wished to move on to the UC. Not to mention I was going to live in Santa Barbara! Beaches, Babes and Bottles!  I moved two weeks after I graduated to an apartment right across the street from SBCC, and had the absolute best summer of my life. No rules, no responsibilities just pure fun. I did plenty of things I shouldn\u2019t have done, but I don\u2019t regret a single thing. \n\nThen fall rolled around and it was time to buckle down and get my studies down so I could transfer to UCSB and love out my dream. I learned a lot that semester. Not much from school considering I got a 0.88 GPA, but I definitely learned a lot about life and how to live it. The best piece of advice I can give you: GO TO CLASS. I don\u2019t care how smart you are, or how hungover you are, or how much other shit you have to do, just show up to class. Most teachers won\u2019t care if you show up, but you\u2019ll get your grades back wondering \u201cwhat the hell is an FW?\u201d (It means fail-withdraw for those people who fuck up so badly that a normal F isn\u2019t enough). Another valuable lesson: it is a marathon not a race. I stacked my schedule with 18 units, and had class Monday thru Friday. This hurt a lot. Talk to your counselor for advice on what classes to take. (For CA students there is nifty website called assist.org). I recommend taking 12 units and trying to get them all on the same days ie M/W or T/Th, and try to get them back-to-back so you aren\u2019t left with nothing to do for 3 hours in the middle of your day. Also since I was living life as an adult (even though I was only 17) I quickly learned what it meant to be an adult such as paying bills/rent and dealing with other adults like my roommates. \n\nThing is I simply wasn\u2019t ready for university. I didn\u2019t have the work ethic instilled in me to be succesful at that level, and my ego was inflated to an unsustainable size. If I had been that irresponsible with my classes at UC they would have sent me home no questions asked. On top of that I would have only gotten the cookie cutter college experience surrounded only by people nearly identical to myself. Fortunately CC didn\u2019t do that to me. They actually did the exact opposite:  I spoke with counselors and advisors and they helped me figure out a path for success that worked for me. Not to mention with the reduced cost compared to UC I was technically being paid to go to school instead of digging a grave of debt. \n\nI look back now, and think about my choices, and I honestly can say I wouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way. It would have been nice to get better grades of course, but I know at the very least I had way more fun than all the university kids. I hung out at the dorms a few times namely the one with a big rep: FT (Fuck Towers) It was so utterly lame. I could not imagine having to live in such a boring hotel, worrying if my RA could smell my weed LOL! All of this while getting the same if not better education. In UC you are thrown into auditorium with 500 other kids taught by a student, and you don\u2019t get the opportunity to ask questions during lecture. At CC there was maybe 50 people max and the teacher would encourage you to ask questions;  most people probably are wondering the same thing anyways!  Above all though, the experiences I had outside of school with the friends I made will never be forgotten, and I can assure you we did things that simply couldn\u2019t have ever happened at a University. I won\u2019t go into too much detail because truth be told a lot of it was illegal, but it was so worth it. \n\nI\u2019m starting to ramble at this point, and it is 2 am so I doubt many people are going to read this, but for the one or two kids who do take a glimpse, I just want you to know that just because someone said you need to go to University to be successful doesn\u2019t mean they are right. Life is short, and I believe enjoying it is the most important part. Stressing out about how other people view your academic pathway is ultimately worthless. You will learn the same stuff at CC and can always transfer to a Uni when you have your credits. And you\u2019ll give yourself the opportunity to figure out your life before the mistakes you will inevitably make have a permanent effect. \n\nTake a deep breath. \n\nEverything is gonna be okay. \n\nStay cool\ud83d\ude0e",

Each hour - each minute - slides through my fingers like hot, summer sand. Nine days until I submit the document that possesses the greatest bearing on my life of any inanimate object since my birth certificate. As March 1st approaches, my life feels more and more like a one-way chemical reaction; the equilibrium between work and sleep continually shifting towards the unbalanced.\n\nOver the past year, objectivity has become an intimate friend. Standardized tests were simply another problem set - a series of questions I could solve by applying my love of mathematical formulas and scientific knowledge. Now, as I sit 216 hours away from the dreaded, maroon button labeled \u201cSubmit,\u201d I foolishly wish each element of my application was this straight-forward. But this, as I am all too aware, is not holistic. Just as I feel this way about objective subjects, there is someone else who divulges their test-day anxiety and dislike of math with an effortless and eloquent written expression that I cannot help but envy.\n\nThe future of my dreams stands locked away - guarded by a series of innocent essay prompts. My ability to expound upon my passions in the comfortable form of a 3rd-person research essay has ground to a halt as I am compelled to put my whole life in context. I try to elaborate on my non-traditional background, and how it has led to the person I am proud to be now. But I am fearful I cannot adequately communicate who I am in a handful of 250 word responses. As the hours tick by, I remain locked in mortal combat with the words contracted to express 18 years of meaningful existence. My time as a circus performer, Greek mythologist, and life-long learner reduced to the equivalent of a few minutes of conversation.\n\nMy stressed mind again strays to court the ideals of objectivity. I daydream of a future where robots scan applicants for evaluation. No essays. No interviews. Just truth. In my heart, I believe I am a student worthy of walking the halls of educational institutions well-traveled by brilliance. I ache to share my background and experiences at a university with students who have come from similarly vivid and extraordinary places - and perhaps teach some of them to juggle! I yearn to lift my passions to the next level, building upon the foundations I have cultivated at community college to improve myself as scholar, helper, and future physician. I long to immerse myself in the ocean of opportunities available at a four-year university; to seek out research positions, join clubs filled with passionate peers, and serve as a leader in the campus community.\n\nThis image sits tauntingly at the edge of my vision as the approaching deadlines crystallize before me like Potassium Nitrate in a rapidly cooling solvent. My thoughts wander to my time as a homeschooler and the roots of my scientific devotion. Before medicine, a sequence of careers paraded through my impassioned childhood imagination. When I was five, my fascination with the unknown turned me into a dedicated archaeologist. At twelve, I dreamed of being a para-rescue jumper - a hero fast-roping from the sky to help those in need. Soon after, I recognized that medicine links my two greatest desires in a career: an opportunity to submerge myself in the complex science I love so much while improving the lives of those around me.\n\nMy word count is nearly up, but I am contented. My initial feeling of dread replaced with gratitude and appreciation. I no longer feel animus towards the inexorable flow of time. Instead, I cannot wait to share my expression of the life I have grown proud to live. I am excited to start the next chapter of my collegiate career. And I only have to wait nine more days.",

            "content": "Hello all,\n\nI'm currently a junior (female) attending a prestigious high school in Indiana.  I have 9-hour school days with no lunch  break (I take 4 science classes and 2 math classes), I actively participate in several extracurricular activities I deem worthwhile (Science Olympiad, Debate Team, School Newspaper, Academic Super Bowl, Community Service, International Club, Quiz Bowl, plan on playing JV tennis), and I have decent test scores thus far (33 ACT, 1470 PSAT will take SAT in March and retaking ACT because I was 1 question away from a 34!).  I also have a 4.33 weighted gpa (max at my school) and dedicate substantial time to fulfilling my academic objectives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am bent on applying to several top-tier colleges as a rising senior, such as: Dartmouth, Vanderbilt, UPenn, Princeton, Columbia, UNotre Dame, WashU, and Harvard (just for the heck of it!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is, what are the circumscriptions of information that one can disclose in their various college essays without throwing themselves a pity party?  For clarity as to why I'm asking this question, I'll share some details:  My mother neglected me at the age of 9; she ditched our family for her Latino lover and my two younger brothers and I have not communicated with her since that unfortunate development.  To compound to our issues, my family and I had no other option but to relocate across the country after formerly residing in an exorbitant, financially unsustainable West Coast city.  We resettled into a shoddy town in the Midwest, in an area unbeknownst to us erstwhile city dwellers.  This was the precipitating event that caused me to perceive the fallacies of the disparate political spheres occupying our nation; upon attending my new high school on the first day, I was disoriented by the sheer magnitude of cultural disparities that greeted me.  To be clear, my family did not regard this new experience with disdain; rather, my father is unemployed and the house he paid off does not require any additional mortgage.  Hence, we live below the federal income poverty level and only receive monthly abysmal child support payments from my emotionally untethered mother.  My parents are both Eastern European immigrants, and my father has full custody of my brothers and I.  After realizing how academically inadequate my school in an small town was for my own intellectual development, I began to read voraciously (140 books last year) and decided to apply to the highly selective school that I now attend.  I was accepted, waived all tuition and room and board fees, and now enjoy residing in a residential environment where I can thrive intellectually and expand my horizons by immersing myself in the broad extent of academic opportunities that my school has to offer.  So, ergh, I apologize for digressing so ludicrously but my fundamental question is- would the fact that I am a first-generation immigrant and hail from an impoverished family with a single father that I admire profoundly for encouraging my academic pursuits in spite of the emotional trauma that I have suffered with regard to my mother's disinterested nature serve as an interesting essay topic?  Or would colleges roll their eyes upon receiving such an emotionally packed essay and perhaps immediately disregard my entire application?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you, any advice would be immensely appreciated.  I don't know what I'm going to do next year.",

I'm just distraught and I yelled at my parents about how the system is rigged and politicians are greedy douchebags who are keeping the people down and destroying the middle class.

For a few years now I have felt absolutely certain that I wanted to become a doctor; the idea of building relationships with patients, getting to the root of their problems, and helping to improving their quality of life felt like a calling. I have gone through high school with this in mind, but as I near the end of my grade 12 year, I'm not so sure it's what I want to spend my life doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy? Well, there's a bit of a backstory here. I'm a total nature lover/outdoor enthusiast. I went to an overnight camp for 10 years where I was able to to explore the outdoors, meet a whole bunch of incredible people (in my life, these are the people I have found most like-minded; they're seriously family to me), and embark on hikes/canoe trips. I've participated in leadership programs at this camp for the past few summers, earning some basic qualifications, learning various technical and leadership skills, and having a great time in the outdoors. Every time I head off into nature or get to share my experiences/knowledge with others, I feel so passionate and excited. I think I feel the same way about medicine, but I won't have much way of knowing until I have the opportunity to shadow (I volunteer in research at a hospital now, but there's little patient interaction), which will be during my undergrad. Lately I've realized that I could see myself spending the rest of my life working in nature, as a camp director or outdoor education instructor or something (I haven't explored careers all that much, but that's the first thing I'll be doing after posting this). I know I wouldn't regret spending my time doing something I know for certain I am passionate about. I guess I'm worried medicine might not end up being something I enjoy, especially if I have to give up so much else?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are other reasons I have begun to feel uncertain about my career path. For one thing, I fast-tracked a year in high school (took lots of extra courses online/during the summer, to advance a full grade in school), so I'm the age of a grade 11. I'm probably really young to even be asking any of this, but I just feel like I need some clarity right now. I have worked incredibly hard these past few years as I have had so many courses to excel in in a short amount of time. To be completely honest, I'm so burnt out and more stressed than I've ever been in my life. I don't often have time to do things I enjoy, like spending time outdoors, or meeting up with friends; I often feel guilty for going to the gym (something I really like doing), because it takes away from the time I could be spending on school work. I know  medical school is rigorous and I know I could get through it successfully (especially after the stress of the past few years), but every doctor I know/have spoken with seems so stressed, and they keep telling me they don't have time to do the things they enjoy. A doctor I spoke with a few weeks ago told me she feels like she gave up her teen years to high school, her 20s to university, and her early 30s to residency. Now, she's mid-30s, just starting to figure out the rest of her life, and is trying to finally make room for aspirations she has outside of medicine (e.g. starting a family, travel, volunteering, etc.). She said there are so many things she has always wanted to do that she still hasn't had the chance to do. I know that adulthood in general is somewhat like this, but I also believe that it's important to live life to the fullest (as cheesy as it sounds). One of my greatest fears is that I'll get to the end of my life having done very few of the things I wanted to do most, just because I \"ran out of time\" or \"never got around to it\" (within reason of course; you have to work hard to achieve what you want to achieve, and money/resources are not unlimited). I'm concerned that if I don't follow my passion for the outdoors and instead go into medicine, I'll spend so much time in school (and then working to pay off loans and establish myself in my field) that I'll miss out on exploring that passion altogether, or until I'm no longer young enough to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of the university programs I applied to, I originally applied to only science programs (biomedical sciences, health sciences, medical sciences), but I realized that my fascination with the human body (and the outdoors/health) could be better explored in a broader context (physiological, mechanical, psychological, cultural) by studying Kinesiology in my undergrad, so I applied to several Kinesiology programs as well. I have been accepted to 3 biomedical/health sciences programs so far, and 2 kinesiology programs (one of which has an \"outdoor\" focus). I'm not deciding on anything until I've heard from all the schools I've applied to, so I've got a few months to figure everything out (and really, a few years; it's not like I need to know what to do after my undergrad right now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now to get to the questions portion of this post (which is more like a novel at this point, sorry again!).\n\n(1) First things first, I think I would really benefit from taking a gap year. I'm burnt out, I've been stressed out of my mind for so long, and I could stand to make some more money before heading off to university (especially as I'd like to go out of town). I actually have a pretty cool opportunity available to me; the camp I've been going to for over a decade is offering a \"wilderness instructor\" whitewater canoe trip, where you go on a 6 week whitewater canoe trip and earn a bunch of certifications that would allow me to run a variety of flatwater/whitewater canoe trips for them (or other companies) in the future (this was kind of the plan for my summer job anyway, it would just take a long time to get all the certs). It costs a lot of money, but the camp has told me there is financial aid available to cover a portion of the cost, and I could cover some of the rest, and my parents would cover a bit as well (and I could pay them back afterward). I'd be back for August so I could work for the month of August and make some of that money back already. I would only do this trip if I were to take a gap year, because of the cost. However, I could work at an outdoor education centre (my camp offers this) for the fall, winter, and spring, spending time outdoors and making money in the process. I could defer my university admission for a year (wouldn't have to reapply), and I'd be going to university at the same time as other kids my age. BUT, my parents aren't keen on me taking a gap year right after high school; they think it would be better to take a year off during my undergrad to find some work in my field (kinesiology), however there's no reason that I couldn't take a year off after high school AND during my undergrad if I wanted to.\n\n(2) In terms of the medicine/outdoors dilemma, I guess I'm just looking for some guidance or advice on what you would do if you were in my position. I know that because I'm a high school student, it's early to ask questions about my postgrad education. I just know that if I want to go to medical school I will have to take specific courses as prerequisites, get a lot of volunteer experiences, etc., and that's stuff I should be planning as soon as I start my undergrad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdvice?

We always tend to pay the most in taxes between the wealthy and the poor. But when it's time for something like financial aid, we get nothing.

I'm literally only 17 and I'm seriously considering taking out a federal loan. I doubt the government will even give me a subsidized one. State schools are known for basically only awarding scholarships based on need or super high HS grades.\n\nI really wanted to go away for school but I\u2019d probably have to take out a loan for it.

Unfortunately i developed a drug problem in my senior year of highschool. That's was in 2015 and I will be turning 22 later this year.\n\nLife is much better now and I'm in a much better place. I have just been working for a while now and saving money. My biggest motivation for going to college is my current job which \"deadens\" me if that's a word. I use to be a good student at one point but I really screwed up my last year of highschool. I went from 85% average in 11th grade to like a 65% average and many absences in 12th. I am in Canada btw, ",

            "content": "Hi everyone, high school sophomore here. I'm looking to get some feedback on my plans for the rest of high school. I want to make sure that I'm doing what I can to ensure that I'll get into a good college when the time comes. Any of your thoughts, opinions, critiques, and other comments are very much appreciated.\n\nAnyway, here's a list of specifics about myself, what I've done so far, and what I plan to do in the future:\n\n\\- I'm a white male, and I go to a fairly competitive public school in the US. Out of a class of \\~650 kids, I believe that I'm around tenth in rank. My school doesn't tell us our class ranks until junior or senior year. If you think it's dumb, so does almost everyone in my town.\n\n\\- My unweighted GPA so far in high school is a 4.0, and my classes have been fairly rigorous. By the end of my high school career, I will have taken ten honors classes and eleven AP classes. If those numbers seem low, it's because some of the AP classes will take up two blocks of my schedule. Thus, I won't be able to take many more than that.\n\n\\- I got a 1420 on my PSAT with no preparation. As for the SAT, I plan on taking a prep class over the summer and getting the test out of the way shortly after. Ideally, I get a good score- my goal would be mid-1500s or higher- and never have to think about it again.\n\n\\- I run cross country, winter track, and spring track. If it matters, I have varsity times in all three seasons.\n\n\\- As for other ECs, I'm in Key Club and Spanish Honor Society. I also have a job as an umpire in the spring, but I don't work all that many hours. (Note: I'm well aware that these ECs are weak. I was thinking about taking up a few more clubs or honor societies next year, as it's too late to join anything this year. I was considering the Environmental Action Club and Math Honor Society, but I'd be open to other suggestions. I saw elsewhere on this sub that joining NHS isn't worth it, but I'll probably try and get involved in it anyway. Would this be smart or just a waste of money?)\n\n\\- I want to have \\~100 hours of volunteering done by the time I start applying. Unfortunately, I've felt as though my hands are a bit tied in this department. My public library and school don't do student-to-student tutoring- even through NHS- so I have no options there. Also, I didn't turn fifteen until after school had already started for me in September, so most of the organizations in my area told me I was too young to volunteer last summer. I plan to get more done this coming summer, though.\n\n\\- I'd like to become an actuary after graduating college. I've chosen a lot of my high school classes based on this, and I'll probably continue to do so in the next few years. \n\nWell, that's that. Again, I'd like to hear anything you might have to say about the stuff in this post. And to the three people who have read all of this- I appreciate you more than you know.",

He cares a lot about helping others and bettering things, he rarely does things for college and puts in so much effort just because he wants to (added roads onto Google Maps, petitioned for a better school email system, etc).\n\nHe got into Stanford early, which was very expected from everyone at my school, and everyone always gloats about how he must be so proud and relieved.\n\nThe thing is, he frequently talks to me about his problems and confides in me about his depression, suicidal thoughts, problems at home, etc. The only reason he does so many things outside and inside school is so he can 'keep busy' and not kill himself with all of his thoughts. It breaks my heart so much because when I congratulated him on getting accepted into Stanford, the first thing he said was, \"Thanks, well too bad I'm still lonely.\" :/\n\nI try to talk to him as much as possible and make sure he's okay. I don't think he'll hurt himself anytime soon but he always has a lot of negative and self-deprecating thoughts, and even though he accomplished one of his biggest goals, he still fails to give himself any credit and can only focus on his flaws, like how he hasn't been in a relationship yet or how he isn't outgoing like everyone else.\n\nI just wanted to make this post because it seems like everyone's focused on getting into such a prestigious college and assume those who make it into the top ones have their lives figured out, seem to be heading towards inevitable success, and must be so proud of themselves. It's a huge honor, but getting accepted into Stanford doesn't mean you're the perfect student with the best mindset.\n\nI'm talking to him right now and trying to make him feel better. A few of my friends can't believe someone who got into such a good school could still be disappointed with themselves and upset at their lives, but those events aren't mutually exclusive. I wish we wouldn't keep associating college admissions to our overall success and well-beings. I hope everyone's taking care of themselves.",

Turns out I hate it after a semester of a mix of geneds for engineering and then intro engineering classes. Additionally I got involved with the big engineering club on campus and dove in. Around the end of the semester I realized how miserable I was and just didn't enjoy the work/people or any part of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI talked to advisors did some soul searching and discussed with different professors. I settled on accounting and am taking the accelerated intro to accounting along with a business law and management class. I am happy and enjoying the classes. Additionally I am volunteering to do income taxes and enjoy learning and the process, although I don't think I will want to do personal income taxes for my career. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the dilemma is I have a full tuition scholarship to a great state engineering school with pitiful engineering coops. The business coops are not as available and while the business program is okay its not great, especially if I want to make it into big 4 public accounting as there is less than no recruiting done here. I am from Texas so UT and TAMU are options for transfers (I know UT would never happen, I think TAMU is more possible). Classes this semester are going well so I should end the semester around a 3.6 gpa, my SAT was a 1400 if that matters. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I am asking if I should consider a transfer, I enjoy the school/city/people but its not going to get me where I want to be career wise. My other option would be to do a masters in accounting at one of the large recruiting schools for accounting and get into the recruiting cycle that way. My current path has me graduating at least a semester if not a year early so I could use my scholarship to get the masters at this school instead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTldr; went to right school for wrong major, while I enjoy the school it won't get me where I want to be early in my career, what should I do/advice?

Woohoo social anxiety). In the dream he was dating one of my friends who also liked/likes him.

New terrible symptoms every day. \n\nStill sick Saturday and Sunday. \n\nMonday morning I wake up to drive to school and it\u2019s super foggy outside. I live in a county an hour from my school on weekends and I drive the hour to school on Monday and stay with my brother who lives in that county until Friday so this fog is a big deal because the visibility was so low but I\u2019ve missed way too many days of school this semester so I\u2019m like \u201cfuck it.\u201d Guess the universe heard that and said \u201cif you don\u2019t wanna drive in my fog then you won\u2019t fucking drive\u201d as all the oil from my car leaked out this weekend unbeknownst to me and my \u201clow oil pressure. Stop engine\u201d light came on while I was going 80 on the highway :). I only know 1 other exit in the county I\u2019m in on the weekend bc we just moved here September of last year and I\u2019m only here two days a week and it\u2019s super country and somewhat racist in the super country parts and I\u2019m blackity black black so I\u2019m worried about what exit I\u2019m about to get off on.

I\u2019m stuck at Olive Garden for like an hour waiting for my parents (even though I\u2019m twenty minutes from the house) and another hour for towing. Also I\u2019m still sick. \n\nThis is my seventh absence? Maybe eighth? This semester. I\u2019m in the medical program (even though I wanna be a poli sci major and I now hate medicine after four years in this) and if we miss a certain number of days we can\u2019t be certified this semester.

I specifically remember encouraging her when there was a time she wasn't sure about going for her masters after her bachelors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou know what they say about God and making plans right well we made our plans but before that could happen,I suffered a pretty bad car accident that messed up my spine. It made it so I would no longer work the type of jobs I had been working. On my feet 8 hours, working on cars, to then a maintenance guy for a school district, to a cook in a restaurant that had just opened up so I was really getting in on the ground floor, but I just couldn't handle the pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked for part-time hours, and eventually asked my Dr. to place me on disability. Since I made a decent amount of money when I was working on cars, and I guess that's what they went off for the decision on the amount I would receive, I got enough of a check every two weeks for a whole year that I most definitely took it for granted. I rested and got my back healed up, but other than that and collecting checks, I did absolutely nothing productive, meanwhile my wife continued to chugg along her education path. I felt like I was doing my part with my DI checks coming in, but in reality I was sitting at home getting fat (I've lost the weight now, at least) and just not only throwing a pity party about myself because I was now knocking on 30 without a degree or any skills to speak of other than entry-level, minimum wage jobs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the messed up part that I should have soon coming. My wife thinks that I should have been doing night school or something during the time I worked full time so that \"the college experience\" for her didn't involve roommates and dorm rooms and instead nice apartments and HDTVs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in essence, I'm the idiot for not using my crystal ball to know what kind of people we would be in the future and that she doesn't think it is fair to hold her responsible for something she agreed to so long ago and without the proper information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't even know how to respond to that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I have my plan B, really more like plan C. I'd have to move back in with my pops. My bother just moved out of the 2nd bedroom in the house but this would also involve breaking up romantically or at least taking a break. I know neither of us want to date again but that's beside the point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nI owe the local CC $800 from financial aid overpayment. I cannot enroll until I pay this, I have the money to pay this. My question is, assuming I will be in one of two positions,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA. I'll be living with my SO, mostly as just roommates (not a huge problem for me, the romance has been gone for years)  and be kind of relying on what she decides to contribute to the join bank.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nB. I'll be living at my pop's house, rent free, I'll quality for a decent amount of loans (in both scenarios actually, but  I would also have to take out student loans in both as well. The only benefit here is I wouldn't have to pay rent. Having said that, if I get a job, I would obviously contribute to the family funds. The downside: Loss of a long term relationship that I basically put all my eggs in but it's clear that this relationship has no future so I'm only prolonging the inevitable and it would only be to milk the benefits of having my own place, and also I know she is very vain and would hate to have her friends and facebook friends see that her relationship of 8 years failed AND I don't believe her job has an office where her family lives so two things, she still has that work contract to finish out, so she'd have to rent a place, and B, If and when she moved back to where her family is from, She'd be starting from scratch where as here she's already in a pretty high management position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth of us staying here is the most beneficial for both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions:\n\nAssume I have no credits; I passed English 1A, Speech 1A and Psych, but that's about it. I would love to get a bachelors in psych but what I really want is a degree in money making. MBA. STEM. Whatever I could do that is realistic. I'm relatively smart but I don't have transcripts or SAT's to back that up so I'm kind of screwed on that part.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat career path/diploma/degree would be the fastest way to get into a field where finding a job that isn't gonna make me filthy rich but comfortable. As I'm mentioned, I am already 30. I gave my 20's to \"love.\" Which is a bunch a bullshit if you ask me. Love wouldn't make me wake up in a puddle a sweat wondering what the fuck I'm going to do with my life or think about what the least painful way to just drift off into oblivion would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I've already decided to start learning to code as it seems to be something I could teach myself at home. I honestly have no idea where to start though. I remember reading somewhere that once you learn one programming language its easier to learn the others. I was thinking of learning python,",

            "content": "I am currently a high school junior in a decent ranking school in SoCal. Currently I am in the process of filling out a bunch of internship applications for this coming summer which  only highlights my lack of uniqueness and life changing experiences. All I feel that I am writing about is embellishments to the few positive attributes that I have and acting like they were way more formative and positive experiences than they actually were. I really don't want to have to lie like this on my college apps but without it I literally have nothing to write. The problem is that I have such high hopes for college, like I really want to get into a great school like USC or Caltech because my entire life all I have ever been told is that the college you go to defines how well you did in your childhood and determines your future. My mom literally only talks about what I can do to get an edge in applications and how I should apply to a million different things. Even I find myself only doing things anymore so that I can get into college.  Every opportunity I get or apply for is so that I can get into college. It is literally all I think about. And I am so scared that by the time it comes to college apps and I write my mediocre essays, I am not going to get into any school that I want to and I am going to have to disappoint my parents and go to some random school. In addition, my mom is always comparing me to other kids and is like why can't you be more like X cousin and go to so and so T10 school. And my parents are always going after my brother for pursuing a business degree and not trying to take a bunch of courses in computer science after he took one class and did not like it or do well in it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really like astrophysics and space and I really want to be an aerospace engineer and do a degree such as mechanical, aerospace, or astronautical engineering. But the other day my mom literally said to me that my grandfather in India, who did mechanical engineering, would not be proud of me if I did mechanical engineering. Like I don't think she said it to be mean but like that made me feel so shitty and I am so scared of not getting into a great college because I value it so much be a disgrace to all my family and my parents won't be proud of me and be able to tell our relatives how good I am.  My mom also just paid for me to attend SAT Math 2 classes for the next 5 weeks and then SAT Physics classes for the 5 weeks after that so that I can ace the tests and she also paid 5k for me to go to college counseling. I appreciate everything that she does for me and pays for all of this but I am so scared that even with all this help I am just not smart enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond semester has really been sucking ass. I started off with a terrible score on a Calc AB test that I thought I did well on. I have been consistently getting C's on my Honors Chem tests all because of stupid mistakes or terrible time management. And I honestly thought I was good at history and I did not do great and even though it isn't that bad, all of these failures are leading to a terrible start for second semester which is supposed to be so much harder than first semester and I am so scared of getting a B. I got a B last year in second semester AP Bio all because of my final which dropped me 6 percent even though I got a 5 on the test. One of my main problems is that I sleep extremely late at night and literally all I do is put work off until the last minute such as my internship applications that are coming up. Sometimes I feel like if I just worked harder I could do better but honestly that is not even what it comes down to cuz half the time my bad grades are because I do idiotic mistakes. I have good test score stats on ACT and SAT (pretty bad scores on subject tests so far) but I really wanted to get NMSQT but I lost it by 2 points on the selection index and my mom really wanted me to get it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of my friends are doing great in their classes and especially my chem grade is really getting me down. I am so happy for them but it just makes me feel like shit because all my life or atleast in middle school I always thought I was really smart and I even skipped kindergarten, and I'm not trying to brag at all but it just sucks to suddenly feel so stupid and behind all your friends. It takes me so longer than them to get understand material that my teacher teaches and it just makes me feel so slow and stupid.  Also whenever I am alone with my thoughts all I think about is how I am worthless and no good and I do not deserve my parents or the life I have because it is all too good for me. Anytime anything remotely goes wrong I feel like dying and I just feel like such a waste and that I am never going to get into a good college or succeed and fulfill all my dreams. I am nowhere near extraordinary and if I feel like this before I have even started applying to colleges, how can I even get through the application process? Sorry this is so long\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Have a lot of pressure to get into a good school and am feeling like I am nowhere near extraordinary enough or smart enough to get into my dream school of USC, I want to die unironically and haven't even started applying to colleges yet, as I am a junior\n\n&#x200B;",

He kept asking his wife a series of questions, fearing that, if left alone, he'd have to confront his thoughts of regret. \"Wasn't that girl good enough for the University?\" \"And that boy with the sick mother?\" People's futures depended upon this man's yes or no. And he had to take it in his stride.\n\n\"...after the bank took our house, I had to stop learning and work to provide for my family...\"\n\n\"...and ever since I was a child, I always wanted to go to your university...\"\n\n\"...but the shouting got louder, and one day...\"\n\nAnother sleepless night. \n\nAt the break of dawn, he set off for the university. Known for being punctual was he. He waited patiently in the conference room. His colleagues came and they were all ready for another daunting day.\n\nAs he flipped through a student's application, he wondered why he wasn't as strong as the bodybuilders he sees on television; he has held so many people in his hands, some tall, some short, some rich, some poor. A few pieces of paper. Paper. Paper to express themselves. Paper that does not give them room to tell the admissions officers all the little things they did. Does this really do the students justice? \n\n\"So we all agree this kid's a reject?\"\n\nHe had zoned out. He had simply been nodding and agreeing to whatever his colleagues said. Panicking, he started to read the kid's application. Granted, the kid's scores weren't up to the university's standards but this kid paid for his own education, looked after his siblings and found the time to teach children at nearby orphanages. With the proper education, imagine the changes he'd bring about. \n\n\"Umm, can we go over his application again?\" \n\n\"What's the point? He's unlucky, yes, but how do you expect to help everyone? He's self-sufficient. If he's gone, who do you think will raise his siblings?\"\n\nShe was right. It'd be like taking a parent away from those children. But he wanted this so bad...\n\nTime for another application. He looked over to his side and saw that one of his colleagues had a ketchup stain on his shirt and finger. He kept leaving stains on applications. Another kept nibbling on the edges of the paper. She, too, was nervous, like the man who was looking at her.\n\n\n\n[I felt like writing this and so I did.

I am an English major.  Two years ago, my full time job (which I recently left) got crazy and I had a bit of a nervous breakdown and failed a class twice and lost my financial aid due to rate of completion.  I was prepared to pay the $1500 tuition out of pocket to pass another class without aid, which they said would get it reinstated.  Then I get an email that they are discontinuing the English major altogether, and since I have been out of classes for more than 6 months, I cannot re enroll in it.  Okay, cool.  Here are my issues:\n\nI never took my ACT or SAT.  (I finished high school online due to health issues.)  That was the main selling point for me for choosing that school.\n\nSo now I must find a relatively cheap school (but obviously not so cheap that the degree is meaningless) that doesn\u2019t require standardized test scores and will somehow accept me as a very, very unattractive transfer.

I strongly believed that a US education is only fathomable if you have the means to pay for it, and I worked hard to at least get into a decent school in India itself, but something always struck me in the back: the headstart I would have with a US degree (at a reputable college, of course). In late July, I discovered that there are FIVE need blind colleges out there. FIVE BRILLIANT INSTITUTIONS! I know the chances of getting into any of them is extremely slim, but it was enough gasoline for my fire. Now, I am an accepted student at Cornell with their scholarship for students from India, a full ride! It covers my tuition, my room, my meal plan, my transport, personal expenses, even pays my SEVIS fee!

I\u2019ve always tried my best I\u2019ve hated the idea of a gap year because I always thought it was better to go directly to uni then take a break. I live in Canada so no one ever applies to US schools really ever except me. I saved up and bought an iPad for school because i love studying so much and I was in full IB I made it to year two which many don\u2019t. My life wasn\u2019t necessarily perfect as I\u2019ve struggled with anxiety for a long time but it was okay I was very excited to graduate at the beginning of the year but then I got sick during first sem. It was so bad I had to drop IB and my whole semester because I was too sick to attend school. I was devastated and took a few classes online to make up for what I missed and believed I would be fine going into second semester but I am suffering. All of the classes I need as prerequisites for uni I have really really bad teachers. In advanced calculus last semester I had a 95 becuase my teacher was god sent and I was ready to work and understood but this sem my teacher can\u2019t teach to save his life and I\u2019m at a sufficiently lower mark and I\u2019m not even being like the typical Asian teehee I only have an 85 lower it\u2019s actually quite low. Like how does that even happen?? I have no friends becuase all of my friends from IB ditched me and my bio teacher is convinced partner work is cheating and collusion. Like last week I went to ask her why she marked my a question a certain way then she accused me of changing my answers. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not going to graduate as I\u2019ve complete all the requirements and have enough credits (you need 100 and I have 120) I\u2019ve applied to a few different uni\u2019s in Canada and US and have spent almost all my money on it (I used to work and saved up) but I\u2019m having a really hard time and my parents think I should just wait to attend but I don\u2019t exactly want to do that becuase they\u2019re very strict conservative parents and I\u2019m a closeted kid and if they ever found out I don\u2019t even want to imagine what they will do and I just want to live my truth (I\u2019m not even talking dating I literally can\u2019t even watch drag race or something as PG as freaking pretty little liars out in the open). Bottom line I just don\u2019t know what to do and need some advice to not go crazy thanks. Sorry for the long rant. \n\nTl-dr: I\u2019m having a very hard time and am being forced to consider a gap year but don\u2019t really want to but am seeking advice. ",

I was also so broke I couldn't even get a ride to take the SAT's. \n\nYears after graduating; I just submitted my last application to transfer to a respected school and I just want to say thank you to everyone here. Whether you're a student that just asked a question or someone that answered, I learned a lot of stuff from this subreddit. You made this scary process easier and whether I get in or not, I hope everyone gets into their first choice. \n\nAnd if not, I know everyone here will make it, wherever they go. (:\n\n",

            "content": "Hola, I was browsing r/gradadmissions the other day and went down a rabbit hole which led me to this subreddit. I know this is an undergraduate specific subreddit but I figure my story might help out some people here.\n\nI was recently admitted to very competitive masters program at UC Berkeley. I am incredibly happy about this (and the majority is funded!) However, in high school I was a mediocre student at best and would have never dreamed of getting into Berkeley. I don't remember my specific stats but I did pretty good on the SAT/ACT, had a GPA of around 3.6 weighted, and a few APs. No amazing personal story, just a very unimpressive middle of the road application (although I am sure for some of you those stats might as well be straight F\u2019s). For undergrad I only applied to 2 schools; a lower ranked UC and a decent state school. I didn't get into the UC but I got into the state school. At the time I wasn't particularly upset about it, but I was at times regretful that I didn\u2019t try harder in high school in order to go to a higher caliber university.\n\nIn hindsight, I am actually very happy with how things turned out. During undergrad I worked very hard and really maximized my academic experience at the state school. I got a 4.0 cumulative gpa, did a bunch of research with profs I liked, joined clubs, and did lots of personal projects that ended up being super important for my graduate school admissions. At the time I was not even thinking about grad school but I was very focused on wanting to maximize my potential while in undergrad to avoid having the same regrets I had about high school. It was a little stressful to keep my grades up but looking back it was sort of fun to stay up late working on projects with friends and studying at odd hours. After graduating I ended up getting a good job but then applying to grad schools 2 years later and here we are - about to go to my new admit day at Berkeley.\n\t\n\nIf I could go give any advice to high school seniors, its that you shouldn\u2019t necessarily worry about not getting into a top school if that is your eventual goal. Obviously, you should try to go to the best school you can but there are still plenty of good opportunities even if you get into an unranked school. If you were like me and think that you missed your one shot to go to an elite school because you were lazy in high school, I hope this gives you hope! - however you need to work your butt off in college. At most universities (at least those without grade inflation) the classes can be quite difficult, especially if your are in a rigorous major. If you get good grades and have good contributions to class discussions you can be invited to do research in your professors labs which can further help you down the road. I am sorry for the rambling but hopefully this is helpful for some of you. Of course grad school isn\u2019t for everyone but it can be valuable depending on your industry and reputation of the program within the industry.\n\nTL;DR If you want to go to a top school but don\u2019t get in for undergrad, work really hard in your undergrad and you can probably do it for grad school.\n",

Unrest hangs in the air with a poignant silence. The statistics majors recently completed their medical examinations of the senioritis of our soldiers- Grades Progress-Reports, as the formal terminology goes. Luckily, I turned out free of contamination- A\u2019s in Lit, Econ, Physics II, Stats- but the same cannot be said for many of my comrades. The army\u2019s Propaganda ministries have used an effective combination of school announcements, rumors of revocation, graduation requirements, and appeals to school spirit to keep us at bay. Yet, even as I ostensibly bear the Falcon and sports shirts of my school with pride, I am increasingly disillusioned with the HQ. Massive segments of the Army have begun to defect to \u201cin-state safety schools\u201d; the revolutionary Armies of UT Dallas and Texas A&M have claimed the membership of almost all of Class Rank Squadron 100-200. They send their planes to drop fliers in our camps, using insiduous tools like \u201cmerit scholarships\u201d, \u201chonors college\u201d, and \u201cFAFSA forms\u201d to appeal to our current physical destitution. \n\n As a member of CR140, I am supposed to enforce heavy regulation of this mutinous behavior. However, I recently obtained a secret copy of college costs from the revolutionary army. I know I cannot trust anything from the enemy\u2026 but if the numbers are correct, the war\u2019s success may impoverish the soldiers through war-bonds (sometimes referred to as out-of-state tuition). I would be convicted of treason if this knowledge ever came to HQ- I fear to write about it further even here. \n\n In reality, the underlying fragmentation in the army lies in the occurances of the past few days.  No one expected what would happen as we marched on to the towns of Hope and Dreams. Both municipalities had been demolished- as did Hannibal Barca, three times over did Georgia Tech. It seems that the advance guard was completely annihilated. \n\n Ambushed. \n\n Headquarters had made a massive miscalculation. For every 100 soldiers we sent, only 14.9 \u201cyeeted the wheat\u201d, to use Army parlance. (I personally prefer the phrase \u201csecure the sourdough\u201d, and occasionally the literary term \u201cobtain the grain\u201d but this is arbitrary). Last year, close to double had made it through. We walked shellshocked through the town. \n\nScorched pieces of recommendation letters lined the earth. The only thing left was a note from the enemy. The Georgia Tech Admissions Officers, typical in their manipulative language, \u201cthanked us for our application\u201d, but stated \u201cdue to the large number of highly qualified applicants we are unable to offer admission\u201d.   \n\n The letter has further reduced the esprit de corps. As such, army leadership has decided to take a \u201cspring break\u201d before advancing forward to the West Coast and the legendary towers of the Ivy League. I am glad for a break, and await possible success at our efforts at other institutions with optimism. Nonetheless, the packets and propaganda of the Enemy sit heavily in my shirt pocket\u2026 I must stay strong.",

            "title": "None of the colleges appeal to me as a junior?",
            "content": "Just started serious college research. Literally all of the colleges I look at have some or many major flaws that make it so I wouldn't want to go there. Or, they have a few flaws and are otherwise just ehh. Also, I have no clue what I want, so I don't know if a big school is a major flaw for me or a tiny school would be horrible for me. I also don't know my major, so that doesn't help at all.\n\nI've been looking at big and small schools mostly within my state of California, and none of them are that appealing. UCLA seemed okay, but the dorms seemed horrendously small. I extensively looked at the 5Cs liberal art colleges, but they all have a MAJOR flaw...\n\nPomona: Mainly, they don't offer engineering which is a valid choice for me. Also have heard they're all rich white elitists, which... I kinda am too I guess but I would like more diversity in college, and I really don't want to be around snobby elitists. Also I heard their academics are difficult, and after 3 years working my butt off, I honestly don't want my whole life in college to just be studying and learning. I want to grow as a person, not just memorize facts. I don't want to be constantly stressed out and overwhelmed with work, and I already am in high school. \n\nClaremont Mckenna: I have heard it's a huge party school, which I haven't decided is horrible or not yet. I don't drink and don't plan to before 21, because I get anxiety about messing up my brain. I want there to be vibrant social life and parties... Just not with alcohol. \n\nScripps: All women college. Could be okay if you see enough guys at the other colleges since they're all together, but another big thing I want to do at college is finally date. And hopefully find a husband. I'm not going to college to find my MRS degree, but I really can't imagine how I'd meet someone I'd really like otherwise. Side note, my standards are way too high for dating as well as college. \n\nPitzer: Super liberal, and not as academic. This could be okay, it's currently my best choice out of the five. But I come from a conservative family and I'm worried they'll dislike me. I view myself as pretty left and liberal, but I still realize I have some conservative hangups because of how I was raised. Also I don't know if I'd fit in with their self proclaimed \"hippie\" ideal, I just don't think it fits me. And I'm worried they'd be smoking pot everywhere, which absolutely terrifies me. I'm terrified of getting secondhand high. \n\nHarvey Mudd: might not even apply because it's basically Caltech. STEM is a strong option for me, but I wouldn't limit myself. And I've heard the workload is killer. \n\nOne of the main things I know for sure is I want a super accepting, super loving, spirited student body. In fact this is my #1 most important thing. I want to grow and learn and become an adult, mature and develop at college, and not necessarily in the classroom but through fun experiences and memories. My high school is pretty accepting but rather cliquey. It's extremely hard to judge a student body, but I know I want a school that attracted people who aren't just accepting, but are extroverted and actively try to make friends with people and include everyone. At my school people are friendly, but I'm basically ignored.\n\nBut my main point is I think I keep picking out reasons to not like colleges. Just like with dating, I'm far too nit picky and high standarded. I just have to accept that no college will be that \"perfect fit\" I always hear about and resign myself to getting a decent college. But how do I do that? How do I let go of my standards? How do I figure out what to give up? How do I figure out what I want?\n\nEdit: Tl;dr: I have way too high standards for colleges, and I'll never find an absolutely \"perfect fit\". How do I accept this and let go of some constraints, and what constraints do I let go of? Am I sub consciously self sabotaging because I'm scared to go to college?",

My freshman year of high school, I earned a 3.7 GPA and desperately wanted to attend colleges like University of Michigan, UW Madison, Boston University or Northeastern. The summer of my sophomore year, I experienced a psychotic break and as a result- I missed all of my sophomore year of high school. When I said missed- I was out an outpatient facility in New York City until May, when I returned to school. However, as a result, my GPA was a 3.2. I was left mortified and in shock because I had worked so hard the previous year and now it seemed like I was going to get into a 'low tier' college. To be honest, I didn't try on the ACT and I earned a 24, but that was mainly because I was like screw tests (do not take this mentality). As well, getting involved in high school was difficult because OCD consumed me, but I managed to volunteer at my local library/5k run.\n\nAnyways, flash forward to senior year- I got accepted to UMass Amherst, Stony Brook U, Suffolk U, Temple U, URI and then some others that I can't recall.

On the other end of the spectrum, I was rejected from every full ride I applied too. Except one.\n \nI had to fly to another state for an interview, conpeting against 100 other finalists. Here's where I started to panic. I'm autistic. Wasn't diagnosed until the second semester of junior year, but it's very obvious when you speak to me that something's off. I'd read the interview advice tips, practiced mock-interviews, but after I interviewed I was convinced I'd bombed it. I was too robotic/soft-spoken/antsy, didn't make enough eye contact, weirded them out, etc, while everyone else seemed so charming and funny and naturally well-spoken. I had no chance. \n\nAnd I got the phone call today. All four years, full-tuition paid. For once in my life, I didn't screw up. I did it. I fucking did it. My future is mine to mess up, and I couldn't be happier. \n\nA special thank you to this sub for all the advice I found lurking. I  hope all of your college acceptance dreams come true <33\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the support. I'm trying my best to respond to every message and comment; if I missed you I'm so sorry! You've all made my day, each and every single one of you. ",

            "content": "First of all, this account is a disguise of my real form; some of my friends might recognize my actual account. So I guess it is safer to say everything here.\n\nThe college application process, as many of y'all know, is grueling. I do feel lucky that I am not one of many people who has not received an offer at all, but my current offers definitely are not satisfying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, there goes the story: I was rejected by my ED school; I did get in some schools but the ones I actually want to go to deferred me, then waitlisted me(for future reference, let's call it A). Today MIT and WashU came out and I found that I got rejected by both. So far, I have not received a single offer from any of my RD schools, which are the ones I will not feel sad going to. With fairly decent scores but not so good ECs, I do realize that the chance of me getting into a T20 school is very low. What makes me feel worse is that a lot of people that are similar to me (from every perspective) got into school A, where someone I am dating is going to attend for sure. (she is a really nice girl, not basic at all, always caring about other people and is actually smart. I can not think of someone else. I know relationship in this context is wack but it is definitely depressing thinking about how I would probably not see her ever in my life in 3 months)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, you might say that \"oh you will end up being happy wherever you are\". However, I do not really think this is the case of me, although my parents will be fine no matter where I am going. My parents are the best parents ever as they have done so much for me; words can not describe my desire to make them actually proud. Throughout my life, I have not really disappointed them but neither did I actually made them proud (personal view). My elementary school, middle school, and high school are never the good ones because our family is moving so often that it is hard to settle down in one place. This is probably why I want to show them that I can do something by getting into a good school. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of you guys will be despised by the fact that I want to use a good college to prove myself. However, being bullied in elementary school for being too polite (which I wrote about a little in my common essay), I sometimes have this \"hate\" desire to prove to other people that I am the best, although in reality I am really not. My personality is probably splitter into 2 parts(i don't really think it's a metal disease though), one part can think rationally but the other part is eager to \"revenge\" other people that hurt me in my life that I am better than them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess there goes my depression, ish. I thought about giving my mom a surprise so I applied to MIT and WashU secretly, hoping that I can show my admission to her and she would be like \"OMG \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*(my name) you actually applied there?\" But apparently, that dream vanished today. I also would not tell her the release date of each school because of the same reason. (she cares, but every time she asks me I am just like ok we will see or smth like that)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had a conversation with my mom today, asking what is I get rejected straight from 3 schools (which is exactly what is happening but she thought I only got waitlisted(which i regard as reject) from one). She told me that it is not going to happen. I then asked her what if I got rejected by all my top 20s and she said that oh you can just goto \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*(school name) because they have cash there, I wouldn't care and I am happy that they give you the scholarship. She seems to be totally chill with that, but it makes me more nervous: what is this straight rejection scene actually happened to me and I will end up going to that school which I would feel, ngl, ashamed of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess this is less of a peer pressure(although seeing other people's data and accept letters on various of forums is depressing) but more of a family and relationship wise thing. I do not know how to keep on pretending that I don't give a shit about admission. Other people view me as a chill and outgoing dude but deeply I know that I am emotional and depressed. With little hope left for the other schools (I can basically self-assess my chance for the other schools; I am not like other stupid overconfident dudes), I really afraid that this pressure will pass the threshold and engulf me at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA2C is a great forum, and I like everyone here. If you can, please give me some suggestions or motivations. Thank you very much for listening to my story. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

So many things prevented me from doing so...\n\nAnyway, I'm here to vent out and cry because for the past two days I have felt like shit on shit cake.\n\nI was rejected from MIT. My dream school. Ever since I was in eighth grade,  I was a horrible student. I got B's on my best day. But when my friends started attending national competitions and visited MIT, i got super motivated and vowed to get into MIT. Ever since then, I started working as hard as I possibly can to the point where my head just couldn't take it anymore; my head started to feel burnt out. One of my friends gave me an MIT hat as a gift and I took that hat and slept next to it throughout these 4 years to remind myself of the endgame. So that I wouldn't get frustrated over bad grades on a single test, over not scoring what I wanted on the AMC test, etc. My vision was very clear: I wanted to go to MIT. At this point, I became the \"underdog\" of my class.\n\nDecember 15,2018: I got deferred while all of my friends got accepted. I was jealous but also happy for them, but I kept thinking to myself \"I just have to keep fighting for a little while longer\". Since that day, I started a countdown clock to March 14,2019: The Endgame. \n\nMarch 14,2019: All throughout this week I had been having anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns but I always pushed through, praying to get in. March 14 was the longest day of my life. I even felt nauseated at one point. 1.5 hours before decisions were released I was staring at my countdown clock in tears of anxiety. But the thing is, this day was a very good one: I looooooooooooooooove the MCU and when the new Endgame trailer came out, I saw it as a sign. Before this day, I had also been accepted to Georgia Tech and George Mason, so I felt like I had huge momentum coming into this. Besides the endgame trailer coming out, i also got an email from GT saying that I got a scholarship and that they would be paying my trip to their open house. This sequence of events led to really buy into the idea that I was going to get into MIT and that this would be the best day of my life. \n\n30 minutes before decisions were posted: I started watching the Avengers: Endgame trailer on repeat throughout these entire 30 minutes and when 19 seconds were left on the clock, I clicked play on the trailer on the part where the \"Avenger Endgame\" logo appears. \n\n6:28 PM: \"I am very sorry to tell you that you are not admitted to the MIT Class of 2023.\" My dream... had just been shattered before my eyes. I am still feeling extremely depressed and embarrassed. Throughout these years exclaimed that I wanted to go to MIT to my friends and classmates, so when I read the rejection I felt extremely disappointed in myself and embarrassed out of existence. And I am still feeling like this today. Out the 6 students in my calc 3 class, I am the only one who got rejected. On monday, I have to walk into a classroom full of people who did what I set out to do and vowed to do almost every day to my friends, family and classmates. My world has been shattered. Destroyed. Annihilated. And I give up. Dont get me wrong: I am very very very very happy about Georgia Tech, but it stupidly horrible to be in the most advanced math class in my school's history and be the only student who didn't get in, despite all of my efforts and all the support I got. Everything I have built, has been destroyed. My endgame...resulted in failure. And there is no time travel, no redemption...there is nothing I can do to fix this. I have never been this depressed before. I am trying to move on, but as long as I am in that class, i dont think I will be able to. ",

I don\u2019t want that. I cannot envision being 40k in debt. I have never even held or seen that amount of money in my life. I feel like purely typing that amount is chocking me. Any tips? Am I overreacting? Please help. \n\nEdit: thanks guys for the responses so far<3. Some information that I left out: I am already working as much as I can as I have been doing for the past two years to support myself. \n\nI don\u2019t live my parents or any family since they aren\u2019t in the US. \nI am premed as well so my plan is not to go to grad school for philosophy. Medical school is obviously going to acquire a lot of debt as well, but that doesn\u2019t seem as terrifying since I know once I graduate I will have a job that is able to pay it back, however right now that is not a given. Also the advice that I get from most doctors is don\u2019t take out loans in your undergrad since you are already going to be in debt so much and you don\u2019t know for sure if you get in. \nI am trying to figure out how to balance, not being in debt, work as much as possible, still do all the EC s that I didn\u2019t have an opportunity for in CC like research and prepping for the MCATS. My mind is going in circles and I am so overwhelmed.",

Considering how fewer than 100 kids actually apply to Harvard, the chances of being one of the 25 are actually so high and I\u2019m mad at myself for not giving it a chance. \n\nI wish I had more faith in myself and applied to more reaches.\n\nI\u2019m just so sad, mad, and frustrated at myself for not trying hard enough, for not having enough faith, for all the choices I made in high school.

I was accepted into all but MIT. I am going into nuclear engineering, looking to go into particle physics or nuclear fusion research later in life, and I need to know what my best option going forward is. \n\nI am ready for a challenge. I want a challenge. The way I learn best is to be pushed to my absolute limit, and forced to succeed at learning a topic. From my previous research, it seems like Georgia Tech would be the best option to accomplish this, and if cost were entirely equal, I would totally go Georgia Tech. However, financials are also a huge consideration for me. My family does not make a lot, but we make enough such that I don't get any grant money directly from colleges. I am applying to as many scholarships as I can, but I do not find out about many of them for a while. Considering this, I have in state tuition from Madison, and out of state tuition for both Georgia Tech and Purdue. As it stands, if I go out of state, I feel like I should definitely go Georgia Tech, it doesn't seem to be worth it to spend the money to go to Purdue when Georgia Tech is really comparable. For now, unless someone can really give me reason to attend Purdue, I am counting that school out.\n\nWhat I am looking to ask is, will the education and opportunities I receive at Georgia Tech make it enough of an advantage to give up in state tuition at Madison?\n\nOther things to consider:\n\nMy family lives fairly close to Madison. I want to get away and finally not have my mom constantly berating me about literally everything.\n\nI have a girlfriend of a year and a half who will be a high school senior next year, she is highly achieving (valedictorian of her class of >400), and conceivably go anywhere where I do, she is interested in ornithology and city planning. I could definitely see myself spending the rest of my life with this woman if we make it through college.\n\nThanks for any advice anyone can provide. I'm just really lost right now. I'm super excited for my future, I just don't want to make a decision that I will later regret. Thank you.",

I'm an Asian male with the stereotypical parents culture wise, but they don't really care about my grades. I say I judge myself more harshly than they do. Of course, I do go to a really competitive high school, but that's probably another excuse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the summer of last year, when I was choosing my courses for the junior year, I was like, \"If I can take the most rigorous schedule this year then I can show myself that I can do anything.\" Of course, I didn't know what was about to come.\n\nQuick tangent that will be relevant later on.\n\nSo my school has double block schedule, which basically means every day you take only 4 classes, but these classes finish in half a year (18 weeks), so 4 in half a year +4 in the other half year = the 8 classes that most schools cover in a year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I picked (all AP)\n\nPhysics I 1/2 year\n\nPhysics II 1/2 year\n\nPsychology 1/4 year\n\nEnglish Language and Composition 1/2 year\n\nStatistics 1/2 year\n\nUS History 1/2 year\n\nCalculus AB 1/2 year\n\nCalculus BC 1/2 year\n\nand then just a SAT preparation course 1/4 year\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd so the first 18 weeks I was like \"This is the first day, ready to be super successful\" to\n\n\"I can handle this, doesn't seem too bad, I will have a strong mental to get through after the first week  to my first few grades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow granted, I never got amazing grades, but I was used to getting A or A- on most of my test grades and most of my quizzes.\n\nAnd then: B- in Physics quiz and B+ on derivatives test, and Book test over Scarlet letterwhere I got B+.\n\n\"that's ok, I will do better later on in the school year once I figure out how to study for these classes and get a better plan and idea of how these aps work.\"\n\nand as this pattern kept going, with virtually no improvement:\n\n\"As long as I keep going, I know I will be able to improve slowly over time!\"\n\nAt the same time my peers seemed to be getting everything that was going on, and some of them even did better than me while studying less.\n\nThen suddenly, wow, 9 weeks went by, I took the SAT, and managed to get all low- medium As. There were quite a few Bs on tests, but I tried to not let that affect me. However, in the back of my mind, I was panicking as I noticed my mental sharpness was going down while everyone else's was going up.\n\nThen the updated ranks came out.\n\nWow, I stayed the same, still X % of the class.\n\nThen a few friends were like, \"Nice, I improved a bit! wow! (They had 3 points higher than me in all classes that counted for GPA on average, and basically improved by Y ranks, but not quite to the rank I was at.)\n\nAt this stage, I thought \"That's ok, I'll wait for October SAT scores to come out, then I will see how I am doing before I judge myself based on grades.\"\n\nI take the PSAT 2 days after SAT, \"I felt good on SAT, and I **thought** I felt good on PSAT.\n\nAt this stage, I was still diligently studying for concepts I did not know about, and mentally was still quite strong, even though I took 2hr naps a lot right after school ended.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI noticed that my friends were able to work for a much longer time than I was, while I got easily distracted and made excuses as to why, such as \"I'm taking one more AP than you, and not taking a blow off class, so I get more time to take breaks\" and \"It's ok that I'm doing a little worse because of how my effort gets spread a little bit more thin since I am taking harder and 1 more class than others (Calculus AB vs no math for some.)\n\nAt this time (November) I have literally sweat through a few tests, and still  managing to do ok, which surprised me.\n\nI thought every test was hard in some way or another, but rationalized it by saying \"I am probably spreading myself too thin\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSAT results came out, I got xxxx score which would put into contention for Ivy Leagues, and an xx/24 essay that was quite good, even though I could still do better. However, if I took it again I don't think my scores would have been that good again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR at this point: My grade expectations were very high, while I wasn't able to understand the material completely now and was losing expectations for my grades. However, my expectations were steadily lowering. My self esteem still remained about the same, since my SAT boosted morale, but I started to panic a bit as people were catching up grade and knowledge wise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, I take midterms for the year (Finals for Physics 1, Psychology, Calc AB), midterms for English and History (I know it's complicated, but that doesn't really matter too much)\n\nI get mostly Bs and low As, nothing too different from my regular test scores at the time, so not too surprised, just glad I made it for winter break.\n\nI distinctly remember telling my physics teacher before break:\n\n\"I know I'm at an 89.3, is there a way you could raise that to an 89.5?\" I felt bad about doing this, but not to the point where I was ashamed of myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, so Janurary rolls around, and I start taking Stats, Physics II, Calc BC, in addition to English and History.\n\nRight off the bat, I still feel like I'm 80% mentally, and can make it to the end without much trouble, just same old thing and try to learn, it might be easier now that there's different classes.\n\nNow, I got C on first physics test, As for Calc BC and Stats tests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis progresses a bit further, and I have 3 straight Cs on the Physics tests that we have taken so far, But still an A in Calculus and Stats, plus As in English and History.\n\n\"If I spend effot to raise my grade a bit for Physics, it won't help me because my unweighted got screwed over now (I have 84 in Physics 2.)\n\nAt this point I am so tired of learning all these equations, z score, pressure, optics, Logistic growth, Correlation graphs, and the like.\n\n\"So many variables and equations and constants to learn every single day.\" We progress through a unit in each class in roughly 1.5 weeks, so notes every day over every class, 2 quizzes almost every day over these diverse and challenging topics. \"What's the point of school anymore? Many people on Reddit talk about how numerical doesn't matter much. Also, I have had so many classes already that my rank won't change much, even if my numerical goes down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sleep suffers, sometimes I sleep from 6pm to 9pm, and then again from 3am to 7:30am.  Sometimes I get 3 hours a day. Sometimes when I do notes, I can't even read what I wrote because I fell into a state of microsleep. Constantly drowsy, my eyes droop hard all the time, and I begin to not think much about sleeping a bit in class. \"I can just learn the material later, it doesn't matter if I grasp it fully, I'll get it by the time the test rolls around\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI barely can concentrate, and others are motivated to learn and get the 95s that they have been getting, while I struggle for a low A (C for physics). However, I do the bare minimum for homework, and cram work in the night before a test for something, and watch twitch streams over league for the days that there are no tests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to study for quizzes, but now think that it's not worth the effort, since the quizzes don't test exactly over the material and I'm not going to waste my time doing practice where it potentially won't help me (looking at you , physics)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPSAT scores come around. Wow, I got 1470. WTF.\n\nI always thought I would get National Merit, as my SAT would have predicted. Now I have no chance at financial aid for some schools, cool now time to work to make up for the lack of thinking that happened during the PSAT while my peers can enjoy life in college without much financial worry. Really low blow to self esteem, this stings a lot in addition to Physics Cs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI learn to laugh off the 50s and 2/10s that I get on Physics quizzes, \"this is the hardest class in high school, I'm not far off from the average\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last major grades come in for stats and physics and calc. I magically get a b in physics, but somehow get 70s on probability and Series tests.\n\n\"Wow I'm actually just a retard, it's not just the difficulty of the class.\" Everyone else is still getting Mid As, I'm barely holding on to a 92.\n\nKeep in mind that many tests are curved, especially the ones in Physics and the one series test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n27th week Midterms roll around, and ok, I got an A for physics, but that's not raising my 87 to an A.\n\nI get 10 points lower on my average for stats and calc, but that's ok, \"doesn't change my grade that much\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope my new investment into finding better business extracurriculars and getting connections through networking will make up for my lack of mental ability now.\n\nTo be honest, I am getting 5-10 hours of sleep in School when supposed to be taking notes now per week,days and 20-30 hours of sleep per weekdays.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a revelation.\n\n\"Colleges are going to notice my falling grades, I can't use hard classes as an excuse, because other people around the country are also doing the same thing as me without the excuses.\" \"maybe I can boost my extracurriculars a bit more and plan a bunch of stuff for summer so that I can feel better\"\n\nAnd I do. But only when I am at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I can't find motivation to get out of bed. Doing notes over parameters and magnetism doesn't feel as good as getting under the covers for more sleep. I can't write any more essays mentally, even though I just brute force my way through evertything.\n\nEvery single day is the same, the school is literally making me lose interest in other things as well, and the bells are just signaling when I have to wake up and think about where I am going to go, forcing myself to walk, forcing myself to take notes, forcing myself to find some meaning in school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, as AP exams are approaching, there are only a few more weeks of rigor in all of my classes before we are completely done for a few weeks to review for APs, where I can regain my sleep and review for classes. Also I hope my pursuits in extracurriculars will continue to expand, and not just be silly claims I internalize and dream about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am finding who I am outside of school, but in school I just feel like a robot who makes excuses.\n\nEvery test sucks a bit of life out of me, every bit of lead that I use takes away a bit of my self motivation.\n\nIt feels like senioritis, and my mom asks, \"When are you going to eat with Dad, Brother and I? I always have to reheat our meals for you at 9 pm and force you to wake up so the food doesn't get stone cold.\"\n\nI tell her, \"I can't wait for the weekend where I can feel human again and not live on a day by day, test by test basis.\"\n\nCaffeine is slowly starting to become a crutch where I can't get off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR I feel the worst I have academically, mentally, and health wise. However, I hope my interests in other things now like improving my corporate connections and helping disadvantaged people outside of school will be able to make me feel enough of a human to continue school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so grateful just to get this out. I really do think about the 5 assignments that I have to do today, without any time for breaks. It's so hard just to remember formulas for a subject when I just finished something for another class. I can't speak for others, but I am just wondering if anyone went through this phase. Like, I feel so energized to do things that I could do to further my career right now, but the schedule that I have built for myself has kept me in a prison where I can't break free of to freely pursue my passions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConstant worry about grades and the next formula I need to learn only result in me grasping between the bars to feel for the passions that I am slowly beginning to find more and more about.\n\nIf I can make it to the end of this week, it's a win.\n\nIf I can make it to the end of this month, this year, to ap exams, it's a win.\n\nIf I think about school,  all the life just gets sucked out of me.\n\nIf I think about learning more about business and consulting and relating with other people and helping other people and ranking up in League of Legends, I feel invigorated like no tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do think about if I just collapsed in the middle of the hallway during passing period, what would others think of me then? What would I think of myself? New thoughts about sadness, but also new thoughts about hopes and dreams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust had to get it out there.

They got upset when I asked if I could go because it was so expensive. I knew I was going to have to pay for college, but I just thought they could at least help me out. It didn\u2019t help that I knew I had to pay for college myself literally in late November, when all my applications were done. I just don\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t at least help pay for college when we make 80k a year. It hurts even more knowing that they\u2019re upset. I got a very generous scholarship to a local school but their nursing program is very new, like, it\u2019s only 2 years old new so I really don\u2019t want to risk it. I\u2019m just so frustrated since that they\u2019ve been telling me since forever that all I had to worry about was studying hard to get into a good college and that they\u2019d take care of paying for it. I just don\u2019t know what to do they even yelled at me when I cried after I got my Macaulay rejected.

            "content": "I'm an 18 year Puerto Rican Male.\n\nEver since I was young, I wanted to do better. I *needed* to do better. I was (and often still am) that kid that cusses himself out when he gets a 90% instead of their 99% minimum. However, I am scared I screwed myself over.\n\nWhat I have now:\n\n\\- 1260 SAT score\n\n\\- I studied Japanese, Russian, and French\n\n\\- 4.0 GPA in a low income school that has no AP courses\n\n\\- I'm gifted. I don't want to sound arrogant, but I managed to learn Algebra in a few weeks, French in about 5 months, etc. I don't think I'm some prodigy or genius, but I'd like to think I at least am able to leverage this to make up for my wasted time. \n\n**So, why am worried? I should be able to get into a good college, right?**\n\n**Simply put, I want to move forward.** \n\nI don't want to get A's, I want to get 100s and be the valedictorian. I don't just want to go to college, I want to go to a top 20 school (except Cornell, obviously).\n\nMost of all, I want to make the world better. I always dreamed of being that comic book super scientist that could invent the cure to cancer, flying cars, perfect VR and a self-operating toothbrush while I was bored. When I was younger, I remember walking through New York and being depressed because everyone around me was frowning. I made up my mind to make the world great enough that at least 10% of those people would be smiling, just happy to be alive. \n\nMy decision has been to major in Computer Sciences and Data administration, with a minor in business. I've spent the majority of my life essentially working on an idea to make the internet available worldwide for almost no cost to users. First, I want to make the internet widely available to almost everyone. Then, I want to use that to get involved in the education and financial systems. Anyway, I have a lot of things I want to do. \n\n So of course I came here, I read, I researched, I studied. I plan to retake and ace the SATs.  Ultimately, I'm scared I don't have a story.\n\nWhy would I stand out?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy family has an extensive history of mental illness. Schizophrenia, Manic-Depressive disorders, Depression, etc.\n\nI ended up getting diagnosed DID (dissociative identity disorder), manic-depressive states, PDD and have to try my damn hardest to tell what's in my head from what's out in the world. It's been a long road, and I've made a lot of progress. Yet, I don't think I've done anything. I've spent my years switching in and out of different schools, into home-school and out, making music and studying online. I don't feel like I've done anything worthwhile, despite that. So what? I've made some music, wrote a few stories and did some self education? Being world class is more than just being educated. I haven't done anything in the world, I haven't joined some prestigious society or club. If I really think back, my life story is just me switching between moods, screaming, being either so excited I can't sleep for days or so depressed I won't even get out of bed. I trapped myself in this chaotic internal world, writing, composing, and designing nothings and nonsense. Five years of therapy and such, and I just was trying to care enough to keep myself here and keep myself as *me*. And I didn't give a single moment to actually doing something outside of that. I feel like I've wasted every moment until now. Recently, my friend of 5 years died, and I made up my mind. I'm going to something, I'm going to try harder. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, I might be decently well taught and such, but I haven't *done* anything. I want to get into a top 20, but we all know that's going to take recommendations, achievements, etc. \n\nThe plan I've been recommended was to try going into a local school for 2 years and apply as a transfer applicant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Do I have a chance? I know there are easier routes. I know this isn't even totally necessary, but I want to be the 100th percentile of the 100th percentile, I suppose. Maybe that's my problem.** \n\nDo I still have time to make myself into someone that can stand with the people that get into places like Cambridge and Harvard? Where do I go from here? I'm lost in so many areas. ",

The fact is, it shouldn\u2019t matter at all. My dad was retired; we could not afford an expensive college. I earned a full-tuition scholarship and paid my own way. I pursued graduate work at an \u201celite\u201d engineering school and earned an advanced degree from a large university. Neither was inherently superior in terms of the education it delivered.\n\nThe college experiences that shaped my life the most centered around getting to know people from diverse backgrounds and learning to solve problems independently. Where or if a person went to college should matter far less than what a person has learned and become along the way in life.\" George Whittemore\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"A degree from a fancy school is like having a fancy suit. Delightful if you care about such things, but overpriced, overhyped and meaningless in our universal quest toward living a life we love.\" Philip Bowles\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My community college experience saved my life. After graduating from high school, moving around and floundering in minimum-wage jobs, I returned to my hometown to live with my parents. I was depressed and attempted suicide. During my recovery, I started attending the community college in my hometown. At first, I resisted enrolling in our local community college because I felt there was a stigma. But when I did, I found a menagerie of students from all walks of life and professors who were deeply passionate about their students.\n\nClass by class, the depression that had held me down for so long began to lift. I joined the honors program and then helped mentor other students. I presented at an undergraduate research conference. Along the way, I met my fianc\u00e9 and built a network of peers and mentors who helped me get where I am today.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough the importance of community colleges. Their support systems, small and tight-knit communities, and affordability are truly unrivaled. Today, I am working to destigmatize the college experience I owe everything to.\" Sarah Olson\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfrom reading these and other perspectives, it seems that the only true benefit of going to a top school is the security granted by its prestige--having easy access to new opportunities simply because you went THERE. it's totally ridiculous and unfair. but you have the ability to change that. you are brilliant, talented, and strong. no matter where you go, you will do great things--the passion and dedication are inside of you. don't push yourself down because of a rejection or two or three or ten. they don't define your success, or your worth. they don't define you.",

I felt like high school wasn't a challenge and that joining the military would be a good way for me to get experience in a field I liked (science/engineering) and give me access to have college paid for for my service. \n\nAll in all, I regret my decision. The Navy has been a gruelling beast and I feel like I have given some of the best years of my life to this organization (which I don't really care that much for) and it didn't really help me get anywhere with college. \n\nI graduated HS in 2013 with a 2.72UW/3.14W GPA. I never even tried to take the SAT. I just felt like I'd never be a good fit in college. I failed 3 SEMESTERS of English and almost didn't graduate on time. I didn't even get to walk in my own graduation due to how many missed days I had. Luckily, I scored a 92nd percentile on the standardized military aptitude test (the ASVAB) and went on my way to becoming a Navy \"Nuke\"\n\n I went through the Navy's hardest academic program (nuclear reactor training) which consists of 3 parts. The first two are classroom training environments where you learn in depth nuclear reactor plant operations and the third is a pass/fail hands-on training course with a real nuclear reactor. The 2nd part is considered by all to be the hardest and has the highest rates for attrition of any Naval training (with the exception of SEAL training).\n\nMuch to my surprise I was able to score a very impressive UW GPA of a 3.41 in the first part of my schooling. I had never had a GPA like that in high school, and this material was WAY harder. I actually had to study just to understand the material.. and it made me actually try to get it right and get good grades! I was proud of myself. I pushed myself even harder in the 2nd part (where everyone usually gets much lower grades due to the rigorous nature of the material) and got a 3.46 GPA! Stoked! \n\nI graduated, then went on to work in a submarine reactor engineroom for the past 4 years in Pearl Harbor, HI. It was the hardest 4 years of my life. I've never wanted to give up on life more than I have here in paradise. \n\nThis job is hard. It really sucks. If anyone is thinking about becoming a Navy Nuke DON'T. If you're worried about loans STOP. I would have traded places with you any day. I got the experience I wanted. I got the self discipline I wanted. I got the free college I wanted. And I'd trade it back for the 6 years of hell I gave to this job. \n\nI was so excited to get out of the Navy that I started browsing this Sub about 18 months ago. I've been stalking the threads, living through all of you, and reminiscing about what it was like in high school, imagining what my all of my friends were doing at your age when they were studying for SATs and applying to college and I was just sitting on my ass not doing anything. It made me sad, but motivated. Because I knew that I still had great opportunity ahead of me. \n\nAt 22 years old, when all of my friends had graduated college, I began to finally study hard for the SAT. It was rough, challenging, exciting, and the most fun I've had with academics in years. I'm proud to say I was able to score a 1440 690RW/750M. 98th percentile according to collegeboard. I was so stoked! Maybe with all this experience and this score I could get a really good college to accept me! \n\nBut I didn't know where I should even apply. I didn't know how I stacked up against high school candidates. I had a really good SAT but really bad high school GPA. BUT really good Navy GPA and worked on nuclear reactor stuff in the Navy! That should count for something, right??? I applied in engineering fields to a poor range of schools. Stanford/MIT/USC as my reaches, Purdue as my \"maybe\" (I'm from Indiana), and ASU/University of Houston (gf is moving to Houston) as my safeties. Take a moment to think about where I may have gotten in...\n\n\n\nI got rejected from every school except UH. \n\nBut, I didn't stop there. I made sure to ask admissions committees why I was rejected, maybe as some sort of way to find out if I've made a mistake (or maybe they did, who knows right? I've never done this before). Lo and behold, I find out that ASU never got my SAT scores. \n\nThey offer to take another look at my application once they got my SAT scores and wouldn't you know it, I got in for Astonautical Engineering with a $14,500/yr SCHOLARSHIP! \n\nI didn't think I'd ever make it this far and I'm so happy I tried so hard. It finally feels like it's paying off and I'm glad to say I'm gonna be a sun devil!\n\nTLDR: I got rejected everywhere then realized I didn't send the only safety I actually wanted to go to my SAT scores and they rescinded their rejection letter, accepted me, and offered my a nearly $15k/yr scholarship.

            "content": "Throwaway for obvious reasons, Long post inc\n\nA brief intro about myself:\n\n\u201cPoor\u201d Chinese male from a high-income SEA country. Gap year applicant who did the IB applied for physics.\n\nIB final: 41/45ACT 34/36 (33,35,33,36)\n\nSATII: Physics 800, Math II 760\n\n**ECs:**\n\nResearch Assistant at a local university\n\n* Wrote independent physics paper with a classmate\n\n* A leader of cultural activity (not specified because of possible identifying info)\n\n* Organizer of a youth conference with 40+ participants each summer from different countries\n \n* Filmmaker and photographer, 80K views on yt.\n\n* And several other smaller ones.\n\n\nI decided to take a gap year because admissions last year weren\u2019t so great, I was rejected/waitlisted from 14 universities, including a T10 school that I really wanted to attend. As a result, I took a gap year to reapply ED. In my gap year, I had significantly more time to spend on my essays and supplements. Countless days drafting and editing and sending them to peers at T10 schools for critique and suggestions. By November, I was confident, everything on my app was much better than last years, I even convinced my parents to let me fly in to visit the campus. Pressing the submit application button, I saw no reason to be rejected again, especially with this school\u2019s heavy ED bias.\n\nWhen mid-December came around, I woke up to an email: Status update. My hands trembling as I slowly entered my login credentials into the portal.\u201c\n\nI am sorry we are unable to offer you a place in the first-year class.\u201d\n\nI was sad, I was angry, but most of all, I was confused. To me at the time, I couldn\u2019t see why they would reject me, they wanted me to demonstrate interest, I showed the most any student could\u2019ve shown. I even took a gap year just to reapply! But soon, I realized it was perhaps the fact that I was requesting for a huge amount of aid, near full ride as a matter of fact.\nI wiped away my tears and proceeded to work on my Regular Decision Applications. This time, ED2ing to a T10 Liberal arts school, and RDing 7 other Liberal arts schools.\nYet once again in late January, I was met with an all too familiar\u201cI must regretfully inform you that we are unable to offer you a place in the Class of 2023 at X College.\u201c\n\n\nI was no longer surprised, after reading that letter, I began to come to terms with the fact that maybe I would never be able to attend a top university in the US, maybe because of my financial aid request, or maybe because of some other part of my application.I remembered that my safety school allowed students to change to ED2 until the 1st of February, so I did just that. 2 weeks later, I was finally accepted into my first US university. It\u2019s not prestigious or famous, but it was an acceptance.\n\n\nA few weeks later, I received an email from Wesleyan University, saying that I was selected as a finalist for the Freeman Asia Scholarship. (To those unaware, finalists are generally accepted to the university even if they do not get the scholarship, however, they would have to pay the full $70K). I was ecstatic, I couldn\u2019t believe it, I thought to myself that maybe this was finally it, my redemption arc if you will, after everything I\u2019ve been through, maybe finally I\u2019ll be accepted to a top university!\n\nReality is often disappointing, and indeed it was.\n\n\nI was waitlisted or Rejected to all the schools I applied to for RD, and yesterday, I received my decision for Wesleyan, I was not selected for the scholarship. Though I had essentially been admitted to Wesleyan as I was a finalist, I could not attend simply because of the price tag. Speaking to the other 3 finalists not selected, they were all still going to attend Wesleyan despite not getting the scholarship, I was the only one out of the five not going.\n\n**So that concludes two years of US Admissions for me:**\n\n* 20 Rejections/Waitlists\n\n* 2 Acceptances (if you count Wes)\n\n* And 1 school I am able to attend.\n\nReflecting back on my application process, some might think I got robbed, that I deserved better, or maybe my results were not surprising because of my aid request. I am slightly disappointed that I won\u2019t be able to attend a top university after all I\u2019ve done. But being chosen as a finalist for the Wes scholarship, I realized it wasn\u2019t my abilities or achievements that prevented me from getting admitted to a top school, but simply money and factors out of my control. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m satisfied, but I have come to terms with the reality of US admissions, especially for International kids like myself who need huge amounts of aid. Ultimately, I am disappointed, but nevertheless ecstatic for the opportunity to study in the states and can\u2019t wait to start school this fall.\n\nTo other international kids out there, don\u2019t give up, I was no spectacular student by any means, and I was so close. Maybe for you, it will turn out better. But I suppose, keep in mind that it is difficult, much more difficult for us, and at the end of the day, be realistic.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry that this post might not have been the miracle acceptance feel good post you were expecting, but it was my experience of the process, and something I felt like I should share.Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "So many of you on this sub are pretty smart but let\u2019s see if we can solve this...\n\nAlthough we know Sheldon went to Caltech for grad school, we cannot say for sure whether he went there for undergrad.\n\nThis raises the question, \u201cCan you figure out which college Sheldon attended for undergrad?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s see if I got it:\n\nSo from the episode (season 3 episode 13) where he experienced a break-in and leaves for Bozeman, he draws up a map for places that he finds the most appropriate to live at. Being an obsessive (OCD) kid applying to college at 11, he most likely would have done something similar and narrowed down his colleges to places he found nice. Therefore, we can only assume that his college choices were in the areas that he didn\u2019t cross out on the map from that episode...\n\nBased on the map, the states that he DIDN\u2019T eliminate include: North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, California (since he ended up going to Caltech), Florida, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, Tennessee and Washington. \n\nBased on this information, we can extrapolate some of the top universities for physics (since he\u2019s picky and wouldn\u2019t go to a substandard university) that offer at least decent financial aid.\n\nSo we have: Caltech, Stanford, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSB, University of Washington, Ohio State, University of Texas (Austin), Rice and Indiana university (Bloomington).\n\nFeel free to add more if I missed any.\n\nHe\u2019s already on par with all these universities (given his likely 2400+ SAT and 10.0 GPA)\n\nNow, given how Sheldon is pedantic about weather (he prefers particularly warm weather; after all, he grew up in Texas), we can eliminate Indiana university.\n\nSheldon would likely have chosen universities with insanely low acceptance rates (so he can pretty much exhibit how much better he is than everyone else). Therefore, we can remove universities with a >20% acceptance rate. This leaves Caltech, Stanford, UCB, UCLA and Rice.\n\nNow, Sheldon would likely extinguish the latter since it\u2019s in Texas where he lives and it\u2019s clearly mentioned in the episode where Tam comes back that Sheldon left Texas after high school (or middle school in his case).\n\nThis leaves the UCs, Stanny and Caltech.\n\nThen, lets get rid of UCLA since it\u2019s a huge party school and Sheldon detests parties (check that: unless they involve comic books, trains, physics, dungeons and dragons, or video games).\n\nThat leaves us with UCB, Stanford and Caltech. \n\nOf these 3, Sheldon could have potentially chosen any but to make the final decisions, we must consider his love for Nobel laureates and probability. Due to his massive proclivity towards achieving a Nobel prize, he would statistically want to attend the university that had the most Nobel laureates.\nSince I can\u2019t find data about university Nobel winners from the respective universities before year 1991, I\u2019ll assume that the data trend today matches that of \u201891.\n\nBased on statistics, of the universities above, their Nobel prize winners are as follows:\n\nUCB (107)\n\nStanford (83)\n\nCaltech (73)\n\nIn fact, going further, physics specific Nobel prize winners at these universities are as follows:\n\nUCB (33)\n\nCaltech (29)\n\nStanford (26)\n\nTherefore, we can conclude, based on as much evidence as my IB classes debilitated cerebrum could handle in the past hour or so, that Sheldon would have gone to...\n\nCalte...\n\nBAZINGA!\n\n\nUC Berkeley!\n\nThere you go. Let me know what you think and if maybe I missed something!\n\n\n\n\n",

            "title": "Is College Debt Worth The Freedom?",
            "content": "Hello all,\n\nIn a few weeks I have to decide what to do for college and I've seriously been at a crossroads. I have very conservative and traditional African parents and as a result, they oftentimes don't understand my mindset and we have differing opinions on a lot of things. My parents grew up primarily focusing on school (going, coming, not really going outside aside from that). As a result, I feel like they're trying to impose what they know on me when it's not truly who am I and what I want to do.\n\nI wouldn't say that I'm an extrovert but I enjoy being outside and just going out and experiencing things so much but they make it infinitely difficult to do so (I'm a grown, 6 foot tall male). Every time I ask to go outside I get met with either a 'no' or firm resistance. Lately they've been more lenient but it's only because my grandparents have come over from Ghana and my parents are unfocused. A few weeks ago they wouldn't even let me go to my friend of 4 years birthday, 10 minutes away, because they claimed 'I was going out too much'. Ultimately I did convince them to go but keep in mind I'm only allowed to go out on Saturday or Sunday, I have to choose one or the other most of the times.\n\nI talked to my mom about the birthday issue and her response was that she \"Doesn't feel comfortable with me going to to the birthday party of my friend that I've known for four years.\n\nI also asked my mom why she feels I go out too much a few days ago and her response was, \"You're only supposed to go out once, or maybe even twice a month. Anything else is too much.\"\n\nI get that I'm only 17 but it really sucks to just not be able to go out and to be able to meet people and just experience new things. I feel like I'm stuck in a cage and every week I long for the weekend because that's truly my only opportunity to go out and just go to movies or hang out at my friends house. They even have the location tracking app on my phone so they do know where I'm at all time and can see that I go and do what I say I'm going out to do. I've talked to them multiple times about this and every time I get the same answer, \"As long as you're under my health insurance (26 years old), we'll be in control of you\". I really do love my parents but it hurts me deeply to be trapped like this. It really sucks to see my friends going out and having fun while I'm stuck at home, in my room doing nothing.\n\nI truly do want to go out and make the most of my time in college. I don't want to stay inside and I want to go out every day and make the most of the resources the city has to offer (along with maintaining my grades and studies) I'm dead set on majoring Computer Science and in college I want to make connections, and make the most of all the resources that I would be provided with in Boston. I currently live in New Jersey right outside of NYC.\n\nIf I went to the nearby college I'd commute and graduate with only 12k in debt but if I went to the out of state one I'll have 60k in debt if I'm proactive in handling it while I'm in school. They're trying to entice me by saying they'll get me car but I know that especially with them, this will not equate to more freedom. I want to be financially smart but I know I will end up miserable and resent myself for not getting away from my parents. I really don't know what to do. My sister is currently committing to a college only 15 minutes away. She's 20 now and my parents still go crazy if she comes home late (like past 10) or gets a ride from one of her friends that they don't know. She doesn't hang out with her friends, goes to school, comes home, eats, sleeps and repeats daily. She actually admitted she was depressed a few months ago but is doing better since she got a job. I truly do not want this for myself. I know that college is what you make of it and I want to make the most of my time there both socially and career wise without chains on my back. I just want to go out and not feel anxiety or come home and feel guilt later on for not listening to the wishes of my parents.\n\nWould it be stupid of me to go to college and graduate 60k in debt (in computer science) just for this freedom? I feel like both the growth and understanding of who I truly am without the parent induced anxiety that I'm dealing with could possibly be worth this debt.\n\nNote: By going out I mean hanging out with friends, or just going somewhere for the sake of it (friends houses, hiking trails, etc.) I don't party or drink/smoke, that stuff's just not for me.",

Her grandma is dying and her nephew was just born though, so she really doesn't want to go that far; she's almost certainly now going to have to go to community college. She was SO SURE she would get into USC that she didn't apply anywhere else. Now she's going to community College, which is just awful because she's objectively one of the smartest people in the senior class. She put in so much work, only to get absolutely nothing back. \n\nFor reference, she got a 1540 SAT, National Merit Finalist, took 7 AP classes (a lot for our school), had a 3.9 unweighted GPA, all As except one B freshman year, and she has two brothers who both went/are at USC, who both got scholarships, one of whom got a full ride with similar stats to hers. She's also an extremely excellent writer and surely had great teacher recommendations. She was involved in theater and interned at a medical hospital, as she's going into Biochemistry/Biophysics, with a double major in Korean Language Studies, because she also TAUGHT HERSELF KOREAN over the past two years.\n\nI just don't get how she didn't get in?

If you don\u2019t receive the scholarship, you are still being considered for regular acceptance.\n\n*Late March* (March 23 5:00 PST): Reguar Decision notification date\n\n*Late March* (March 25 for me): You're notified if you got a scholarship :-)\n\n**Common App**\n\nYou'll need recommendations from a counselor, and two teachers.\n\nMy Comon App essay was about how my dad was running an illegal poker game, the ensuing police raid, and what I learned lol\n\n**How I went about my Supplements**\n\n*What is something about yourself that is essential to understanding you?*\n\nI wrote about one of the quirkier (ha), more subtle aspects of working at a grocery store. I transitioned my essay into how I worked to financially support my dad. Basically, I showed USC that I could see the funnier side of life, but also be serious enough to see the gravity of the situation at hand.\n\n*Academic Interest*\n\nThis was probably the essay I struggled with the most since I didn't have a lot of \"Why X School\" essay experience yet. (My USC app was one of the first apps I turned in since the merit scholarship deadline was in Devember) I'd advise that you spend a good chunk of time researching specific teachers and knowing a lot about your department, but also mentioning what drew you to like the subject of your major in the first place.\n\n*Describe yourself in three words.*\n\nI reinforced themes of my Common App.\n\n*What is your favorite snack?*\n\nI chose to tie in my snack to my ethnicity (Korean) but also add coffee. By the way, you can type in phrases--these answers have some room to wiggle around and you can type in a short sentence/phrase!\n\n*Favorite app/website:*\n\nI chose a lowkey/niche, funny site that has a specific focus.\n\n*Best movie of all time:*\n\nI connected this with my major.\n\n*Hashtag to describe yourself:*\n\nThis one's difficult. Like, what does this even mean? I just put something semi-funny/intellectual/pop-culture-y.\n\n*Dream job:*\n\nI aimed all the way up top since it's a dream anyhow, but lowkey I actually want to be a Supreme Court justice lol.\n\n*What is your theme song?*\n\nI chose something classic from the 90's that everyone knows, and it was kind of a fitting metaphor for my outlook on life.\n\n*Dream trip:*\n\nI tied this in with my major.\n\n*What TV show will you binge watch next?*\n\nI tied this in with my major.\n\n*Place you are most content?*\n\nI tied this in with my volunteering.\n\n**Overall, I countered the seriousness of my Common App essay with more light-hearted responses in the supplements.**\n\n****\n\n**Okay, stats!** \n\nDisclaimer: They aren\u2019t great--I really believe that my essays carried my application.\n\nGPA: 3.9 W, 3.5 UW\n\nSAT: 1560\n\nECs: Working at a grocery store, volunteering at a suicide prevention hotline and the library, participating as a leader for incoming freshmen, constitutional law team, freshman leadership\n\nHooks: I'm not sure if \"hook\" is the right word, but I come from a low-income household with a single dad.

I've lived with my black dad for 8 years.  Both of my brothers are biologically half-black.\n\nI get my decisions from many Ivy Leagues in two days.  I've already gotten into some \"top-schools\". \n\nOn the Common App many months ago, when asked \"what nationalities do you identify with\" I put African American and Middle Eastern, even though, deep down, I know I'm not biologically black.\n\nFor the last couple of months, I try to justify what I did.  I mean, yeah, putting down that I identify with black culture could make sense.  My dad is black, I've been around a good bit of black culture, and our socioeconomic status/my access to educational opportunities could have been \"better\" if my dad was white.  But regardless, deep down, I've been feeling shame.  I used my dad's nationality to help me get into college.  It's not even truly my own nationality or my own blood.\n\nToday while I was at school I was texting my mom and I told her that I wouldn't be happy or overjoyed if I got into any ivy leagues because I have a lot of growing up to do and problems of life to face.  I told her that there's a lot of warped logic that goes into Ivy League idealism.  She showed these texts to my dad and my dad was like, \"if she's not going to be happy to go to an Ivy League, she can just go to a state school, we're not going to pay for her to be mediocre about having an opportunity that 2/3 of the world doesn't have access to\"\n\nWhen my mom told me what my dad said, I felt so ashamed.  I told my mom that I felt like I didn't deserve to go to an Ivy League, that there were so many other people who are more accomplished than me and deserve my seat.  My mom told me: \"oh, I see, you're having a guilt complex.  I won't speculate about what you're feeling guilty over, I'll let you figure that out\".  Immediately I knew I was having guilt over what I did.\n\nHow should I think about what's happened?  How do I get over this?  How should I talk to my mom and dad?",

            "content": "I\u2019m super depressed rn and I know some of you don\u2019t care, but I\u2019m going to go on a rant. I\u2019ve fallen the farthest anyone has fallen this admissions season. First off I\u2019d like to start by talking about my school experience. I never was a good kid really until high school. I was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia when I was younger, sent to a children\u2019s mental institute for half a year, and had behavior issues. I messed up in middle school and failed all my classes, on top of that I was a special ED student due to my time in the institute. Woopty do another sad story. Just letting you all know I didn\u2019t write one of my essays on it. \n\nAnyhow when I transitioned to high school, the IEP I had was taken off on my own request. And I decided to start trying. Freshmen year was a bit rough. Got several A\u2019s and B\u2019s, nothing lower. I was finally proud of myself, I never felt so happy and fulfilled that I had a report card without a grade lower than a B. I gained a bit of confidence. On top of this I was promoted to a leadership role in my school marching band.\n\nThe following year I took my first honors level course: AP European history. I was apprehensive, yet aware that I could do it. This year was my roughest year and I was basically depressed all year. However, I still managed to get mostly A\u2019s and two B\u2019s which further built up my confidence. This same year I got another promotion in band.\n\nJunior year I decided to take 4 AP courses: Music theory, Environmental Science, US History, Psychology. I was sure I wouldn\u2019t do well but I continued anyways. By this year I was the highest ranking officer in my band, and managed to get straight A\u2019s throughout the year. This is when I thought I had potential. However, my SAT score at the time was low: 1220.\n\nOver the summer I decided to work my @$S off to pay for SAT prep which costed $1900. My parents don\u2019t support me going to college, they\u2019d rather me enlist in the military. Just a little background, my parents are very abusive and they\u2019ve kicked me out of the house at least once a month junior year. And I spent 30 hours a week in a F#ck&ng poke bar trying to make that money up some how, while completing the SAT prep. November of senior year comes, and I got a 1350... i was a little upset because I really messed up my English score (630), and usually it\u2019s pretty equal to my math score (was expecting a 1400).\n\nSenior year I realize my parents were being serious about kicking me out of the house when I graduate, so I got a job at a printer fixing place to get some technician work to help pay my rent while while I\u2019m looking for a job near my college. On top of that, I took 3 Ap courses (gov, comp sci, stats), and my parents decided to move 2 cities from my high school forcing me to drive an hour to school and an hour and a half home. \n\nAt this current time, I\u2019m living in a mess. My stats:\nWeighted 9-12: 4.05\nWeighted UC: 4.26\nWeighted Capped UC: 4.13\nSAT: 1350 (720 Math, 630 ERW)\n\n-8 total APs\n-many leader ship roles\n-founding president of Rotary Interact\n-President of Cyber Patriot Instructional Club\n-Coordinated many school events and even worked with interest groups\n\nBut guess what...\n\nBECAUSE MY MAJOR IS CS\n\nRejected: UCLA, UCSB, Cal Poly SLO\nWaitlisted: UCSD, UCI\nAccepted: SDSU CSULB\n\nI only got into my safeties. I don\u2019t even like them.\n",

I applied to CS/EE or a variant at all of them. I was also going to apply to Harvard, Cornell, Columbia, Princeton UChicago, Duke, and UMich, but it turns out that I never even submitted my applications.\n\nI've been rejected by every single UC (not even wailisted) except for Riverside. Berkeley hasn't come out yet, but I've honestly given up hope at this point. I was also rejected by MIT (that was expected though). I did get into all my OOS publics though, but there's no way my family could afford them. I'm still waiting on a few privates, but I'm also feeling quite hopeless. So yeah, I've gotten royally fucked over so far.\n\nI don't want to sound arrogant here, but I honestly don't want to go to Riverside. I feel like my junior year and some of my first semester senior grades aren't representative of me and that I didn't get a fair chance to share my circumstances, especially in my UC applications (the additional info section came out really bad). As I stated above, I spoke with my teachers and my recommendations were absolutely amazing (my English teacher said that she's indirectly known me since freshman year and she's seen me grow as a person and overcome a lot), but UC's don't ask for recs and I never got asked for a supplemental.\n\nMy strict Indian parents are now bashing me and telling me that \"my true colors have been revealed,\" however, they're also kind of clueless about the whole admissions process and do not understand that it's not just grades. We have talked about the possibility of taking a gap year. A whole year gives me a lot of time to work on my personal projects and I could accomplish some significant things. Additionally, I'll start my essays much earlier this time and apply to more privates. I could make my essays so much more compelling and write much better supplementals. Going through the college application process, I've learned that the UC's are extremely GPA sensitive, however, I feel like the privates are more holistic and I might even have a better shot there than the UC's.\n\nHere's the list of what I plan to accomplish (my spike is interdisciplinary and lies at the intersection of theory, engineering, understanding human behavior, and entrepreneurship):\n\n\\- I've just qualified for the ISEF and I'm working towards doing very well there.\n\n\\- will have two research papers published in relatively prestigious journals by this fall\n\n\\- very extensive maker portfolio\n\n\\- inviting UCI professor to lecture to lower-level math classes at my school. we have a whole invent planned out for this\n\n\\- work towards the usaco gold (or hopefully platinum) level\n\n\\- summer software engineering internship at mitre\n\n\\- make decent progress on my healthcare startup (i've already landed some very high profile meetings just by cold calling and plan to start clinical trials by this fall)\n\n\\- spread entrepreneurship nonprofit internationally (i've been working on this for less than a month, but we've already had some notable success). i'm working alongside a prestigious entrepreneurship organization on this. part of this involves connecting high school students across the globe and i might actually make this the theme of my essays (being inspired by other cultures and what we can learn from them).\n\n\\- organizing large entrepreneurship-themed hackathon\n\n\\- will still teach entrepreneurship and computer science at my school during lunch on a weekly basis\n\nI will also be taking a few more college math classes this summer so I can prove that I can do the work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I know that none of us are admissions officers, but I'm wondering if anyone has some advice here. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation or known anyone who has? Overall, do I have a chance of getting into a top school if I take a gap year and reapply? Can my ec's, essays, recs, and overall story outweigh my GPA?\n\nSorry for the grammar errors. It's fairly late right now.\n\nThanks anyways!\n\nEDIT: rejected from Cal and Penn",

So far I lost all of my motivation, haven't spoken to my parents since last night, have texts from my supporting friends (Thank you so much all, I love you guys to the moon)\n\nRegardless of my shitty story I am at a loss. I feel like every time I look at the purple banner I feel anger. I hate that I hate this school now. It's the school of my dreams and not getting in made me feel trippy. These past hours were non existent. I don't know what to do in general. I am so lost. I just wanted to get accepted and my stats were not decent imo: 3.77 gpa, 34 act, really good essays and really good recs. Also I feel like everyone who applied had a 4.0 and 1600....\n\nIf anyone is still reading this and is curious on the schools I am considering here is what I am thinking. \n\nI got a lot of money from Bing and into the honors college at Rutgers for engineering. These are probably my top two choices. However, BU wanted me to study abroad the first semester, but my parents couldn't afford to pay for that because we didn't get a lot of financial aid, so I got the guaranteed transfer thing to BU engineering. \n\nShould I just go to a college for a year and transfer to BU? I was thinking that if I am successful at school next year I probably could transfer to NYU or a better school, but IDK. If you cant tell I am really destroyed by NYU. I understand if no one reads this, but I really needed to type out my feelings because I am lost. ",

            "content": "My mom went to college for chemical engineering in Shanghai, where she was born. After graduating, the government made her work in a soap factory because communism. She was a manager because she had a college degree, but she wasn't actually using that degree. She made like $60 a month. She decided to get the heck out and so she studied English, and after years of saving, borrowing money, and studying, she had the money and the English to come to America to study. She applied to several grad schools but only got into the University of Mississippi with enough scholarship to actually live. Ranked 150, acceptance rate 79% for undergrad, so by no means did she go somewhere to a prestigious school. And of course nobody here in America knew anything about her college in China. \n\nShe got her masters in chemistry and became a US citizen. She worked in lab testing, then taught community college, and then worked for a big pharmaceutical company. She slowly worked her way up, gained experience, and helped support our family. Now she is self employed in a similar field, works from home (or binges tv shows, no joke) for the majority of the year, and makes more than my dad, who graduated from UNC CH and works full time. We don't qualify for financial aid so that's how successful she's been. \n\nI understand why we want to go to a top school. Like many of you, I reached high and came crashing down. EDed to Duke, deferred, rejected today. Rejected from all my other T20s too. I'll probably be going to UNC now (Dook sucks). Yes I'm heartbroken, yes I know it's the entire college experience, gorgeous campus, the fact that people have been telling you *these* are the schools you want, that makes the rejection hurt so bad. But I'm cautiously optimistic and I hope to have a fraction of the success my mom has had. ",

I took one apart when I was 7, I learned my first programming language when I was 11, I've created dozens of projects with many different languages over the last 7 years. Yesterday, I completed my AI which can diagnose heart disease in patients with an accuracy of 99%. I have a passion for Computer Science. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not just Computer Science though. I've always loved the idea of creating a business. Almost every single one of my projects was practice in creating and failing a business. I do it because it's fun and every single time I get better and better at it. I also value public speaking, and I'm ranked as the third best debater in my state. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlmost every person I meet is impressed. Not just my mom's friends but students I meet outside of school, my peers, every single person at the internship I had last summer (they told me I was so good at CS that they would hire me without a degree and a starting salary of around 100k). Every single interviewer I had called me brilliant by the end of it except two. One was fairly silent during the interview, but he was the parent of a kid at my school. One day the kid comes up to me and tells me, \"my dad told me not to tell you this but he's writing 'LumpyFoundation is not one of the best kids I've ever interviewed. He's the best person I've ever interviewed.'\" This was for the Princeton interview. I was rejected. The other interview was for Harvard, and I thought the interview went really well despite not being complemented by my interviewer. These people aren't just average people. The average ACT score at my school is a 30. My interviewers were high-level company executives. One was a CEO. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am an Indian male with a 3.6 UW GPA and 35 ACT. I have a 4.0 not including Freshman year, and I have a very strong upwards trend in grades. I wrote all of my essays in a way that was funny, not cocky (yes I know how cocky I sound in this post but I need to vent), and could be understood by an English major. My college counselor said it was the best Common App essay she'd ever seen. I showed my essays to so many people and put so much work into them. They were top notch. I couldn't see my LOCs, but my counselor said that they were fantastic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been rejected from 16 colleges:\n\nUCLA\n\nUC Berkeley\n\nNorthwestern\n\nMIT\n\nDuke\n\nColumbia\n\nCornell\n\nYale\n\nPrinceton\n\nUPenn\n\nVanderbilt\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nNortheastern\n\nUT\n\nUSC\n\nHarvard\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWaitlist\n\nBU\n\nUNC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccepted\n\nPurdue\n\nRPI\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't care about the Ivies. I never expected them, but USC? UCLA? Northeastern? BU? UNC? UT? A few of them I can understand, but all of them? I thought that maybe there was some hole in the application, but 4 other people have read it and haven't found the hole. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRPI and Purdue are great schools and I'm not worried about my future long term. Every skill I've cultivated has been designed to make me more successful in the real world. Every EC was legitimately something I was passionate in. I didn't just clean beakers for 30 hours a week, get my name as the 5th author on a paper, and tell all my colleges that I have published research. Many of my programming projects were too complicated to explain in one line on the common app or on an essay. I created a program using graduate level math that I taught myself. How can I possibly explain the scale of that in 600 words when it took me months of work and hundreds of hours to understand it myself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy application was good, but it far from captured me. I have a passion for Computer Science, and I've built up the business acumen to do something great with it. It's those colleges losses that they didn't see that passion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is something I haven't told anyone because I know it's naive for me to believe, but I do anyways:\n\nIn 20 years I'll be so god damn successful that those admission counselors will know my name, and they'll know that they missed out.

            "content": "Hey all! I know this is a long post but it would really mean so much to me if you gave advice. I also apologize for the formatting.\n\nI'm a high school senior who is pursuing a nursing career. Unfortunately, I was waitlisted from CSU Fullerton and San Diego State University's direct-entry nursing programs. I was accepted into pre-nursing at CSU Long Beach, biology at UC Riverside, UC Irvine (first choice was nursing), and UCSB, and pharmaceutical chemistry at UCSD.\n\nI am grateful that I was accepted into all of these schools from the University of California school system (UC Irvine has been my dream school for years). Although thankful, I am hesitant to attend these schools because I really want to become a nurse. I have considered the possible pathways I could take with a degree in the other majors I was accepted as, but I always return to the idea that I really want to become a nurse in four years! I could always attend CSU Long Beach as a pre-nursing student, but I would have to apply to the official nursing program in two years, which is very competitive. I have also heard that several people struggle in the pre-nursing classes at this school. I accepted my spot on the waitlist at both CSU Fullerton and SDSU, but unfortunately, my chances may be slim.\n\nI am now considering attending community college and have thought of several pros and cons for this decision.\n\nPros: \n\n* Saves money! (My family has Calvet so most of my tuition is covered if I attend a public California university, but I would save my family money via meals, groceries, housing, etc). \n\n* UC and CSU schools give priority to community college transfers (As explained above, the only schools I would transfer into would be either UC or CSU because of Calvet). \n\n* There are a local hospital and nursing home I could volunteer at during my time at CC!\n\n* I will get my CNA certification soon and can hopefully work while attending CC, allowing me to get experience and also add a little flair to my transfer application.\n\nCons:\n \n* I feel as if I won't be surrounded by like-minded people (I don't mean to offend anyone with this comment. Several people enter community college with different perspectives and this situation definitely doesn't apply to all CC's or even my possible future experience. However, I would enter CC purely out of hope to transfer, and I don't want to be around \"C's get degrees\" minded-people, which I believe I would see more of if I attend CC. In high school, I was friends with people who really pushed me academically, and I believe that's something that really encouraged me to do my best).\n\n * I would have to live with my borderline bipolar and abusive mother (I love my mom in many ways, but there are several days where she is borderline abusive, as she hurls insults at me and makes my life at difficult. I try to let this not get to me, but I really want to move out, especially as my dad and sister are often busy and not home). \n\n* It is still difficult to transfer, especially as nursing schools in California are increasingly becoming more popular.\n\n* I want to explore (Throughout high school, I was motivated to get accepted into colleges outside of my hometown as I feel physically stuck and confined. Although I want to get this college experience as soon as possible, I am understanding of the fact that I have to work hard in CC to get accepted into university). \n\n* In all honesty, attending CC would hurt my pride (Again, I don't want to offend anyone with this comment. I know that several successful people attend CC! However, attending a CC would honestly hurt my pride because I got accepted into other schools. I worked really hard in high school in hopes of getting straight entry into a college so I don't have to attend CC. I'm also an older cousin, and many of my aunts and uncles have expected me to attend university right after high school so my younger cousins pursue a college degree as well and work hard in high school. Furthermore, my club banquets often ask the graduating seniors to announce what college they will attend, and many people in my class have been accepted into great colleges and virtually no one is attending CC).\n\nTL;DR I got into many UC schools, but not with the major (nursing) I wanted. Should I attend CC in hopes of transferring to a nursing school in two years, albeit living with a borderline abusive mother and attending school with people with the \"C's get degrees mentality?\" (I don't mean to offend anyone with this comment but I honestly didn't know how else to describe it. Please read above for a better explanation).",

            "content": "I applied to 11 colleges, and I got into 2/11, one of which was my safety. Am I bummed out about it? Honestly, at the start of this process, I think would be depressed, but I think part of the process isn't just learning about getting into a school, it's about learning about yourself and growing from it. I was rejected from my state school which I thought was a match for me, I was rejected from basically all my reaches, and I stressed about every minute of it. \n\nI'm here now to talk about it all I've learned, and make sure the class of 2020 doesn't go through the same mistakes and pointless stress. \n\nI'm a middle/upper middle class Asian male, who applied computer science. \n\n1). Prestige is cool and all, but major matters so much more.\n\nYes, Ivy leagues will get you clout, and applying to them won't hurt you, but apply to schools based on YOUR MAJOR and what YOU LIKE. Listen, theres not a school that's objectively \"bad\". The top 50 schools dare I say top 100 schools in the nation are all amazing schools, and in the end it's not about the schools general ranking, it's about the stuff you can learn from the school. I applied to Vanderbilt for the name, but I should've applied to Purdue or UCSB for their amazing CS programs. I didn't apply to great CS schools like UIUC and UT Dallas because they were ranked low on USNews. Fuck that, don't do that.\n\n2). Research your schools and make sure your safety is a safety, your match is a match, and your reach is a reach.\n\nThis sounds weird, but schools change every year. One years safety is next years reach (NYU is a great example. Four years ago it accepted 34% of applicants, now it accepts 16%). Make sure your safety is somewhere you would be happy going to, and that you're 90% sure you can get into.\n\n3). Don't rely on stats/data from a prior year to evaluate your chances of getting into a college.\n\nLike I said earlier, colleges change and grow more competitive each year. Just because Billy had lower stats than you last year and got into X college, doesn't mean you'll get into the same college with higher stats. It's good to see the data and see where you fall, but understand that the data changes all the time. \n\n4). Start your essays early. Take that SAT/ACT/Subject Test one more time. Try to get that one point back from your teacher even if you know they won't budge.\n\nThe worst feeling, is the feeling that you could've started early on your essays, or that you could've gotten a higher SAT or a higher GPA. If you wanna stop that feeling later, step up now. You can always do better if you put your mind to it, so start those essays early, fight for every last point, and try one last time for the SAT.\n\n5). Write about you, don't write what you think colleges want to see.\n\nEssays are about you, not the ideal student for the college. Write about yourself, let the colleges see if you're fit. Write about your passions, whether it be a sport or Saturday Night Smash Brothers with friends. If you write so that you seem like an ideal fit for a college, they'll either sniff you out, or you'll get in and realize that you aren't actually a fit for the school, so write about your passions, and how your passion makes you different and unique.\n\n6). Reach out to your friends already into college.\n\nThey've been through the ringer already, let them peek your essays and ask them how they're enjoying college. Theres an infinite amount of knowledge to learn from them. \n\n7). Don't stress after you've submitted your apps.\n\nI did this a lot, and it's pointless. You can't change what you've submitted, and you're in your last year of high school, enjoy the free time. Whatever you've submitted, is your best work from the last four years, and ONE college will recognize it. \n\n8). No matter where you go, no college can make you experience as good as you can.\n\nJust because you get into Harvard doesn't mean you'll be happy. Just because you're going to your safety, doesn't mean you'll be unhappy. Make the best experience out of wherever you go. This process is truly a crapshoot, but in the end we all get into a place we want to go to and will inevitably enjoy. Don't like your first year at a college? Work hard and transfer. Things work out. \n\nTLDR: Start essays early, research research research your schools and make sure your safety is a safety and reach is a reach, prestige < a good major/program, and things WILL work out in the end. You're defined by what you do, not where you go. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus tip: Don't check r/chanceme, it's not good for you. Trust me. Also don't spend 24 hours on r/ApplyingToCollege, ask your question, use it for research, but don't compare yourself to other people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I wish I had seen this video before I started apps because it would've saved me a lot of trouble and stress: \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4zUDjzp6I8&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4zUDjzp6I8&t=2s)",

            "title": "My admissions story",
            "content": "During my sophomore year I was just not happy with where I was in life. I hated my teachers and there was no true learning in HS. I went to school out of it being an obligation. I liked science lab work, but none of the 40 professors I emailed in my area responded. Everywhere I went I was simply a number. Are you xx number of years old? No? But what does that have to do with anything? My maturity matters more than the date on my birth certificate telling ppl my age. Don't get me wrong, I loved the people at my school, but everyone just cared about career and college. I was fed up with everyone just doing things for a resume. Where was the joy in doing things? \n\nAnyway I had two options in my mind for the rest of HS that year, move schools or graduate. Frankly I had 0 clue what I was going to do. I decided one night to open up that good old program of studies and determined whether it was possible for me to graduate early. At first, I was told by my GC that it was not a good idea. But when she talked to me she understood my frustration and agreed to help. My family was apprehensive as well but I am thankful that they were supportive like my GC. Finally there were my friends who constantly doubted me and my motives. The same question came up again and again... why graduate? Couldn't you go to a better school than a state school if you graduated reg time? I knew I already wanted to study BME so to me spending a year taking useless classes for graduating made no sense. Every person I talked to was skeptical or at least it seemed that way. But I wasn't going to spend a whole year of my life taking classes that I wasn't even interested in. I had my decision\n\nSo yeah graduating early required a little bit of work, but not anything too special. The summer into junior year was a bit of a grind for me. I managed making money on the weekends with my gigs, 2 classes, and all the essay writing stuff required for college. I used a calendar religiously for the first time ever \ud83d\ude02  but it all worked out in the end.\n\nIt was September and I was still working on essays in between school and studying for SATs. That's when I realized I was also still a junior. Taking 4 APs 1 honors and 1 elective, while keeping up with college deadlines surely taught me a lot about myself. People say that you grow a lot during your senior year. To all you juniors: don't underestimate that statement. To all you seniors: I am sure you can agree with that statement. By November I had finished my common app essay and submitted my app to my state school and a neighboring state school. After, I finished the first round of applications I didn't think about apps until December 20th ( the start of winter break). I still hated school but it was a new battle. Every day I would come home exhausted and \"nap\" until 9pm. I'd wake up, eat something and work into the night occasionally falling asleep. I learned something about myself even in that moment. I wasn't motivated. I did it just to do it. Sure junior year is hard for everyone, but I wasn't happy doing what I was doing. What's the point of the grind if you aren't happy doing it?\n\nEveryday for 11 days I worked tirelessly drafting essays for T20 schools. Since I was young, I had wanted to go to Harvard, but was it realistic? No! My stats were not on par with other students. I just wanted to go to my state school, but my parents wouldn't have it. I poured my heart out on those applications with false hope in those T20s. Hope that colleges would see something different in me. Hope that I could finally do as I wished without all the red tape.\n\nBut yesterday, those hopes were crushed. I had been rejected to every single T20 school I had applied to. But now as I sit here condensing an otherwise long story in a couple paragraphs I realize that I am part of a brotherhood of others in similar situations. I see Seniors that have worked incredibly hard only for things to not work out in their favor. I told myself I wouldn't get attached to those applications. But I was attached. Each rejection made my heart sink, despite the number of times I told myself I had no chance. I hoped that the enthusiasm to go to college early and get started on my life would help me get my foot in the door for a T20, but I was wrong. Out of frustration yesterday, I committed to my state school and didn't tell my parents or my sibling. When I told them after that I committed, they were mad.  The decision I had made to commit to my state school without telling them was the best decision. My state school isn't at all bad (or so some ppl say as a means of coping with the rejection). But it's what we make of the circumstances and the actions we take that define us. I took action because I was unhappy. \n\nToday at school, I learned of 30+ kids getting accepted to T20s. Should I be jealous? Maybe? But am I jealous? No! Every one of them deserves the school they got for reasons I may not know.  I can say with certainty that I have accepted my circumstances and that maybe I am being told by the universe that I was meant to go to my state school.  So I guess my lesson here is what I have read 100 times on Reddit. College isn't the end all or be all at all. No matter where you go, we are more than the sheet of paper known as a diploma. You don't need a college diploma to succeed and taking risks pay off  Things happen for a reason. So to all of you seniors and juniors questioning worth, know that I have been there and I have done that. Put aside what society says about where you are going and create your own path. Be happy with what you have because things always happen for a reason. To all the seniors who made their dream school, I am incredibly proud of all of you. The work you have put in has paid off. \n\nIn short, don't be sad that you JUST made a state school or any school for that matter. If you made your dream school, CONGRATS! but to those of you who didn't, I didn't make my dream school... But I am hopeful we will all turn out fine. We took a risk. I took a big risk graduating at 16 without a plan B. It worked out for us no matter what you may think. We ended up in college and it doesn't matter where we go because life doesn't depend on the name of the school. Countless older ppl will tell you that, but take it from a fellow peer. ",

            "content": "Yesterday and today were probably the worst days of my life. I have no one to vent to this about. I'm too ashamed to tell my friends, my mom has stopped speaking to me since yesterday and is crying in her room, and I'm just so so so crushed. I got rejected from literally every single T20 I applied to including the ivies. I got rejected from UCLA and UC Berkeley (in-state). I got into all of my safeties and some mid-tier UCs (SB, SD, and Irvine). I know that's great and I should be grateful that at least I have the chance to go to college, nevertheless a great one, but I just feel like I have failed everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents immigrated from China for the sake of my education. My single mom gave up her entire career to move me to America so I can get a \"quality\" education. Her only request for me throughout these long ass years has been to get into an Ivy/T20 and I couldn't even give that to her. She gave up everything for me, worked multiple jobs, barely even enjoyed herself. She was tough on me in ways that many other people would probably think is unhealthy or abusive but I recognize her sacrifices and I'm okay with her expectations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI worked hard throughout high school and took advantage of every single opportunity I saw even though I wasn't given many (low-income). I had a 3.9 my freshman and a 4.0 my sophomore year and took the most honors and AP classes I could. I know junior year is probably where everything went wrong. My grandmother suddenly got very sick (prognosis was only a few weeks) and my mom flew back to China to be with her leaving me to live alone for a few weeks. In the few weeks, I got into an accident and was injured pretty severely. I couldn't go to school for multiple weeks and the accident left me with some lasting health and mental health issues. So my GPA suffered. Got four Bs first semester and two Bs second semester.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought the colleges would be able to look past this. I explained it all and so did my counselor. I thought the colleges would instead, look at my other achievements outside of school. I was Siemens semi-finalist (the research was later published), won multiple national awards for STEM, started a small business my freshman year that got so big by the end of my junior year that I was featured in the news. I had over 400+ community service hours as well as many other things like being President of a club I founded and Varsity volleyball for four years. On top of that, I worked a service job for two years to support my mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got straight As first semester of senior year taking 6 AP classes. The 3.78 UW GPA after my junior year is what killed me, I'm sure of it. (My weighted was around 4.40). I'm confident in my Common App essay and my LOR. I've been a writer for a long time and have won competitions so I don't think it was my writing that fucked me over. It probably wasn't my SAT either. I got 1570 on my first try and 800s on Math 2 and Chem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now I'm deciding between the UCs I listed above with probably the most shame I've felt my entire life. I have family friends, friends, and co-workers asking me if I got into my top choices and I've just been ignoring them. I can't bring myself to say anything. I am so disappointed in myself. I am so fucking regretful. My mom won't even look at me. I should've played the game better, done ED instead of REA to a school that now, in retrospect, I have 0 change of getting into. It fucking hurts so much to know that this is something I've worked for the moment I set foot in this damn country and it all came falling apart these last two days. It also fucking hurts that everyone expected me to make it big. I had family and friends saying \"you'll get into a T20 no problem!\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just feel like I could've ended up somewhere better if I had just played the game better. I couldn't afford a $20k college counselor and I didn't have parents who knew the process. I went into it pretty blind and got fucked over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm completely lost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far. If anyone has any advice, that'd be great.",

            "content": "I had an unconventional high school experience. In freshman year, I dropped out. I missed out on two years of high school. Some of the most formative years of my teenage life were spent wasting away at home, playing video games, watching movies, and making excuses for the endless anxiety I had over the thought of going to school.\n\nI wasn\u2019t thinking about my future. In fact, I had the polar opposite experience that most of you here on A2C had. I was blatantly ignoring the possibility of a future. I figured I had already wasted away most of my life\u2019s potential, and my best bet was living with my parents forever, never leaving my hometown, probably never working and never getting my license because of how crippled by anxiety I was. College wasn\u2019t even on my radar. Hell, finishing high school definitely wasn\u2019t on my radar, how could college be there?\n\nWell at 16 I went back. I went to the alternative high school. You know, the druggies, the pregnant girls, the delinquents, the stoners, those are the ones who need the alternative school. I thought, \u201cI\u2019m better than this place. I don\u2019t need to be here, I should be able to go to a regular public school. I\u2019m a failure for even ending up here.\u201d\n\nLittle did I know...\n\nI would go on to break the record of most high school credits completed in a year in my first year, my would-be junior year. 13 credits. Almost three years of school finished in less than a year. Then I got 10 more my next year. Enough to graduate. On time. As an 18 year old. I graduated alongside my old friends from elementary school, in a different colored cap and gown, but with the same damn proud smile on my face and tears running down my cheeks.\n\nBut before that, I had gone through my senior year struggling. I was trying to figure out the college search after basically six months of high school. It felt disingenuous. It felt like I never had time to fuck around and be a teenager. But worst of all, I never had time to figure out how to navigate it, and my alternative school didn\u2019t help too much. The counselor barely knew how to work a computer... no offense, Mrs. H.\n\nA year and a half ago, I began my college search by googling \u201cbest journalism schools\u201d after thinking long and hard for the past... well, six months... about what I might want to major in. Journalism seemed to just.. click.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I found my dream school. The number one school for journalism on niche: The University of Southern California. When I read the name, and saw the location, something in me clicked. The more I read about this school, the more I fell in love. It became my ultimate dream school (and of course that 18% acceptance rate didn\u2019t faze me)\n\nI didn\u2019t know the first thing about crafting a college application, but dammit did I TRY. I spent hours crafting those essays for USC. I applied early to try to get the merit scholarships. I painstakingly filled out every extracurricular spot with the clubs I had participated in for the last year... it didn\u2019t seem like I had done enough. I wrote my CommonApp essay as an explanation for my fucked up transcript... that was big mistake #2. \n\nAs I would find out in late March when my rejection letter came, big mistake #1 was not taking the ACT test until April of my senior year... thanks Mrs. H.\n\nRejected from the 3 schools I applied to, I felt like a failure all over again. My whole life was supposed to lead up to this moment. Sure, I graduated. I gave a speech that garnered tears and applause. I spent my limited time in high school excelling, but it didn\u2019t feel like enough. My anxiety had left a permanent mark on my life. I felt trapped.\n\nTaking a gap year was my only option, and damn, I don\u2019t regret it one bit.\n\nBecause I grew. So much. I didn\u2019t go straight from a spotty time in middle school, to a fucked up high school experience, to an elite college (or even to a college at all...) \n\nI traveled. I worked multiple part-time jobs. I gave more speeches. I made documentaries. I watched plays. I had time to finally dive headfirst into the college process for myself... retake the ACT... craft my extracurriculars and essays to paint a picture of myself that reflected who I am. But most importantly, I made friends. I laughed. I cried. I finally watched Stranger Things. I got to take a break, a real one this time. Not a \u201cbreak\u201d that was riddled with anxiety, hopelessness, and failure. It was the opposite, actually. I spent all my time obsessing over the future. It was one of the first times in my life that I\u2019ve ever been hopeful for what\u2019s next.\n\nAnd on March 23rd, 2019, I got a letter. From USC.\n\n\u201cDear Lucas,\n\nWe have arrived at the end of our application review period, and I am sorry to say that we are unable to offer you a space in this year\u2019s incoming class...\u201d\n\nMy heart dropped, although I expected it this time after reading those same words last year. Funny enough, with all the time that I put into this process during my gap year, I expected a rejection more the second time around.\n\nI closed the tab and put away my laptop. But something pulled me back. Something... didn\u2019t feel right. The letter looked too long, even though I hadn\u2019t read it all.\n\nSo I opened it back up.\n\n\u201c...Your eventual enrollment at USC is of great interest to us, so I invite you to consider the Trojan Transfer Plan...\u201d\n\nNO. FUCKING. WAY.\n\nTHIS IS IT.\n\nTHIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS ALL FOR.\n\nI don\u2019t know what, but something in my application shone through to USC. And I wrote this to reflect. Because it\u2019s surreal to think that a year and a half ago, I was a young 17 year old just beginning my college app process, and I found my dream school with a simple google search.\n\nMy dream school from 2017. The school I am going to transfer to in fall 2020.\n\nNo matter where life takes me next, I know one thing for sure.\n\nI am not a failure.",

            "content": "I went through this process last year \u2013 the writing, the revising, the waiting, the waitlisting, the SIR-ing. Things worked out like a dream, I was admitted to all the UCs and some privates, the most harrowing part was deciding which school to go to. Painless, congratulatory, fairytale ending to my four years of hard work, the expected product of the educational assembly line, I as a cookie-cutter Asian teenager achieved my dream of going to Cal.\n\nWe joke about our personalities (or our lack thereof) here. For one so generic, I was fortunate enough to have made friends in the year below me with passions and hopes, who shared what sorrow and laughter and companionship they could with a lost upperclassman during the loneliest time of my life. One was a dancer, another a writer, one was a thinker and an entrepreneur, another was more passionate about CS more than any CS major I've met at Cal. All loving, all kind, witty, funny, quirky, and beautiful humans, damaged like designer destroyed denim. True dreamers. Wanting to make an impact on this world. Knowing how they were going to do it. Purposeful. \n\nI read some of their apps this fall. They achieved more than I ever could \u2013 a successful business raking in tens of thousands of dollars a year, independent projects both small and large, with near-perfect raw and weighted GPAs and test scores, along with the standard sports/music extracurriculars. Their essays shone with passion and true love for their fields of choice, sparkling prose that was a joy for an avid reader to evaluate and appreciate. I guess I was naive \u2013 given how smoothly my college journey had gone, of course they'd get into almost every place they applied. \"Of course you'll get into Berkeley EECS \u2013\u2013 the adcoms couldn't ignore your passion.\" \"Of course you'll get at least a few privates to choose from, how could they turn away such a bright young woman as you?\" \n\nDreams turn to dust. Safeties passed safely, lower-tier UCs similarly. \n\nDreams turn to dust.\n\nTo dust.\n\nDust.\n\nI don't know why I'm sitting up late writing this \u2013\u00a0maybe it's to let out the guilt and pain, how I feel responsible for misadvising my friends, and how one friend especially won't be showing up to Cal as his snarky, tongue-in-cheek but beaming self on Cal Day because out of arrogance I assumed that his choice of applying EECS would be fine, how he didn't need to apply to the easier-to-get-into L&S CS. One tick box. \n\nThis thing is me-centric. It's selfish and irrelevant to the pain that they're feeling. I had to get it out somehow. And I guess this is a nod to the Stanford post about how adcoms don't see passion. After all, Cal accepted me, stats loaded and generic. \n\nTo the dreamers out there whose dreams were dashed to dust \u2013 I believe that you deserve these spots over all the kids in your class who you know have not tried, who you know have cheated, and even those who did things honestly but without passion or love, following the formula their parents and advisors set for them. I see you. I feel your pain. I have no words of consolation. You worked hard for these universities, and their rejection of your application is worth some shed tears, pain, and bitterness. Cry. Don't hold back your sorrow. It's only human to mourn. \n\nAnd, after some days or weeks or months, I want you to remember:\n\nYou dreamed. You dared to dream. That's more than what I could ever do. Keep dreaming. You are the light in this world of darkness.",

I'm certain we could work a long distance relationship out, but knowing that I can't help her if she's ever in trouble is something that would haunt me.

I graduated high school as a junior (mental health, blah blah blah, now I do lots of national level activism work((not to flex))after having a shitty barista job for a few months)\nI applied to quite a few schools but my dream school has been the Pratt Institute of Art in NYC since middle school. I applied last year but was waitlisted and finally got in this year to their communications design degree. I know for sure that I want this and would regret it if I didn\u2019t go. I was even featured in my high school\u2019s yearbook with a full 2-page spread of an interview, photos of my art and me talking about going there.\nThe problem: COST!!!!! It\u2019s about $70k/year for tuition/fees/housing/etc. I got some financial aid, but I\u2019ll still be getting a $38k loan EACH! YEAR! I hate that they put that in their financial aid and give you a \u201cyour total cost of attendance is $10k! :))\u201d at the bottom but if you really read more, you\u2019re signing onto nearly $200k in loans. But the degree I want is apparently in such high demand that I could be able to get a great job in nyc in that field. Average salary for a creative director is a nice $90k and I never plan of having kids and I don\u2019t mind living in the tiniest studio I can find. Mom and I did the math and I\u2019d pay at least $1100/month for at least 20+ years. If i accept it, I don\u2019t think my parents, especially my mom, will ever forgive me. She tells me that taking a gap year and dreaming about going to this school makes me lazy and stupid. She\u2019s a Hispanic immigrant mom and has the mindset of saving and never being frivolous. She wants me to move in with her sister and my abuela in Utah and go to Utah Valley University. I know it\u2019s what she would do if she were in my shoes, but her and I could not be more opposite. I\u2019d be babysitting for my 1000 nieces and nephews in all my free time, but tuition is only $28k. I\u2019d live my life free of debt afterwards and find some basic graphic design job with my basic graphic design degree. I know what\u2019s important is not the school, it\u2019s what you make of it, but I know the resources and opportunities are going to be so much better in nyc. I\u2019m willing to take the risk but I need some help to know I\u2019m not ruining my whole life. I\u2019ve also been accepted to an art school in Portland that costs $44k and is an okay program (not the best but not the worst either) but I\u2019d feel so guilty not seeing my parents every single weekend as they only live 45 minutes away. I know my mom would guilt trip me for it whenever I did see her and I really need my space after 18 years of being suffocated. Another option is Humboldt State University. I was born close by, my parents both went there, and I\u2019ve been accepted. My dad\u2019s side of the family all lives out there. I would absolutely prefer to go there over Orem, Utah. I love the redwoods, I have less family there so I wouldn\u2019t be horribly tied down and I know the area well enough to navigate myself around town without gps. It\u2019s the same price as UVU but I would end up with a fine art degree with an emphasis in graphic design instead of a true communications design degree.  I wish I could\u2019ve gotten into Emily Carr in Vancouver but I got accepted to fall 2018 and didn\u2019t defer, instead I reapplies and got rejected this year. It would\u2019ve been perfect distance to see family for holidays but not be attached and tuition\u2019s only $20k. Maybe I could go to HSU and transfer there? But then my freshman math/science/history credits would be a total waste of time and count for nothing at EC. \nThanks for reading this and I\u2019ll take any advice I can get.",

            "title": "Reflections of an Asian Male Applying in CS",
            "content": "My last college decision came out today, so I wanted to do a reflection on the college decision season, as well as look back on the past four years. First, my decision results and background.\n\n**Decision results, in order of my preference:**\n\n1. Stanford (CS): Rejected\n2. MIT (CS): Rejected\n3. Carnegie Mellon (CS): Priority Wait List (For a Non-CS Major)\n4. UC Berkeley (EECS): Rejected\n5. UCLA (CS): Wait List \n6. Georgia Tech (CS): Rejected\n7. UCSD (CS): Accepted\n8. Cal Poly SLO (Software Engineering): Waitlisted\n9. Cal Poly Pomona (CS): Accepted\n\n**Background:**\n\nAs the title states, I am an Asian male, and I applied for Computer Science for every school. I live in Southern California, and go to a fairly competitive high school. I come from a middle class family, and my parents are immigrants from Vietnam. I'll give a quick rundown of my stats and my main ECs.\n\n*Stats:*\n\nSAT: 1580\n\nSAT Subject Tests: All 800s\n\n8 AP Tests Taken: All 5s except one 4 (*Damn you, Physics 2)*\n\n4.76 Academic GPA, 4.81 10-12 GPA\n\nFull IB Diploma Candidate\n\n*Main ECs:*\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Independent Satire Publication (*sounds a lot more official than it is)*\n\nVice President of school's FIRST Robotics Team\n\nSinging and Playing Guitar for Leading Worship at Church Youth Group\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI'm gonna be honest, this college app season went much worse than I thought. After getting a 1580 on my first try junior year, I really thought that UCLA and UC Berkeley were good to set as target schools for someone with my stats. I didn't screw around on my essays or anything like that, so doing that didn't seem so unreasonable for me. However, as time started passing, and I learned more about the difficulty of being admitted to schools for CS, I felt much less confident in myself. If you haven't already noticed, I didn't have any notable ECs related to Computer Science per se, and everyone applying to these schools has similar stats. After getting rejected from Georgia Tech, a school I assumed was a bit below my target, I had a serious wake up call. I told myself: \"*Yeah, you're completely average. Don't get your hopes up.\"* \n\nI really thought about this. How many middle class Asian guys applying for CS with good stats are there? *A lot*. I changed what schools were targets and reaches. Preferences 1-5 on the list above became reaches, and everything below became a target. Of course, doing this doesn't do anything to your chances of acceptance, but it really helped me mentally. After being admitted to UCSD, I was extremely relieved. I landed at a school I'm actually happy with. I got accepted to Cal Poly Pomona previously, but I was happy that I made into the UC system, especially since I only applied to the ones that were hard to get into. \n\nIt's easy to look back and say: \"I busted my ass for four years only to get accepted to two mid-tier schools?\" (I apologize if I offended anyone by calling UCSD a mid-tier school). I really felt that way for a while. \n\nI know plenty of people who are quick to cry \"affirmative action\" and \"legacy.\" However, I never concerned myself with the policy which honestly affects a minority of students. Many will disagree with me, but overall, these factors don't negatively the other applicants. My title is kind of a bait then, lol. I really don't believe that me being an Asian male means much in the college app process. You can argue with me, but for most applicants, schools look for good stats, involvement in extracurriculars, and for the upper tier schools, excellence in an area. (Like one post said before, authentic passion doesn't really matter). So for a good while, I felt really inadequate, unqualified, and kinda depressed. \n\nBut I really thought about it. High school is 4 years. College is 4 years. One's career lasts for at least a couple of decades. \n\nNow, I don't think I wasted my high school. Why? Going to a high school known for being fairly difficult, I needed to actually learn how to study on my own. Since my parents weren't super involved in the minutia of my education, I learned how to manage my own time, have a good work ethic, and develop mental endurance. I know so many people who don't really have it so hard in coursework of the same name at their own school, which allows them to applying themselves more in impressive extra-curricular activities. Combine that with a sport, and that's the perfect combination for college app success. However, what I've seen happen to students in prestigious schools is when there's not as much structure and the coursework is actually difficult, they don't have the ability to stay afloat, leading to abysmal college GPAs, a stark contrast from their high school success. This is obviously not the case for all students, but this does happen.\n\nGetting into a nice university is one thing. Being successful and fulfilled as an adult is another. I'm happy that I worked hard in high school. I have come to the truth that a school like UCSD is not some mid-tier name. It's a university that provides an excellent education, just like the majority of universities out there, regardless of rank. I'm looking ahead to the future. I'll continue to apply and develop the same ethic and passion throughout the rest of my life. As high school students, it's difficult for many of us to look ahead further than a couple of years, but I suggest that every person really try to do that. What will be my situation is 5, 10, 15 years? I'm not talking about the degree(s) that you will have. I'm talking questions like: \"Will I be doing something that doesn't suck the life out of me every day?\" \"What am I doing to actually be fulfilled?\" These are important questions that matter much more than \"Is my life over because I didn't get into my dream school?\" \n\nLook ahead to the future. Every person in this subreddit obviously has concern about their future, and that concern for the future puts you ahead of many, many people. Look further ahead, and continue to care about your life. But, most importantly, don't forget about yourself in the present. Life is only so short. Investment is important, but even with time, there's a point diminishing returns. Spend some of that time on yourself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I got rejected from my top schools, even with good stats and decent ECs. It's alright though, because life is more than the years you spend in college.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "title": "Memoir of a Fuckup",
            "content": "Ok so super long post most likely so here's your warning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThroughout my entire schooling career I have been what I can best classify as a fuckup. Now the normal definition of this term is not exactly applicable to me because I would consider this as having everything going wrong. Unfortunately I have serious issues with procrastination, as well as straight up just not doing work. I wholeheartedly, and appallingly, cannot remember the last time I have studied for a test or done a piece of typical homework on my own. Now despite this I have been in every single honors and AP class that I could have been. I believe by the time of my HOPEFUL graduation I will have 11. (hopeful meaning my fuckupery has finally caught up to me and I am actually in danger of failing classes needed for graduation) Before my senior year I have always scraped by doing the least amount of work and tbh managing decent grades, especially on the weighted front. I am the embodiment of the hated \"smart kid\". We all know these people that seemingly do 0 work and perform better in school than those that sell their soul for their gpa. All of this shit attitude is capped off with a 34 act with 0 studying. Everyone was actually livid when I achieved this score because they felt it was unfair for someone like me to do that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow going along with last paragraph, this attitude inherently would be synonymous with teachers hating said kid. This was true for every single teacher of mine except my junior Physics teacher. If this somehow gets around to you Mr. De Sousa I love you. She was the sole teacher that understood me and everything that was wrong with my train of thought and etc. We had serious conversations about life and everything and I wish I could've been better for her. Obviously I had serious issues finding teacher recommendations, WHICH  I HAD NO IDEA HAD A BIG IMPACT ON ADMISSIONS. Apart from Ms. De Sousa, I had zero faith in any other teacher to actually write good things about me because essentially I shit on everything they do. I have had multiple teachers - to my face - tell me I am a waste of talent/potential, and I really appreciate them for their brute honesty. I'm sure I am the embodiment of the worst thing an AP/honors teacher can imagine. I do nothing in class, and although I am not disruptive in any way(which is a given for AP kids in my school), I do zero work and still pull of b's. AP classes should be for driven and bright kids to intellectually stimulate them and prepare them for college work. It should not be a kid who never opened any of his AP textbooks ever and gets 5's on the AP tests. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel so goddamn awful for being such a fucking useless person over these last prob 8 years. People would always voice their anger at me for visibly not trying and not giving a single fuck about grades or the SERIOUS ramifications that come from them. It wasn't evident to me how serious said ramifications were until a couple of months ago. All of my \"work\" in these last 4 years of high school has culminated itself into a 3.1 uw gpa. Now I am well aware of how atrocious this is, but I HAVE to blame at least some of this on my counselors. All kids at my ULTRA competitive high school would hear every year is that it is well worth it to take honors and AP classes even if it meant a 1 or even two letter grade drop. I took this as clear fax and never even considered taking easier classes than the hardest offered. Due to this, after failing a class finally, my weighted gpa is a 3.74. Now said failure should have been my wake-up call to finally do AT LEAST something in any of my classes, but miraculously it has perpetuated, maybe even enhanced, this downward spiral of shittery. Senior year I took 4 ap's and football first semester, and then 5 second semester. Now a torn up knee early on in the football season and threats of being kicked out of my house, along with paying for college by myself kinda fked me up although I like to pride myself as unbreakable and having no feelings. But through all this lemme just say although I could prob say i've had \"senioritis\" my entire schooling career, it jumped to a whole new level this year. It's honestly atrocious the things that I do and don't do. I can't remember the last time I took a calc test on time tbh  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af . \\\\\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright now for the colleges part after setting the backstory for this upcoming tragedy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk so like call me a hardo and a money chaser, but im ideally heading for finance jobs, and undeniably this is a prestige oriented field. When I started to look at colleges for this I was like wow ok a 3.74 is pretty good in the grand scheme of things its kinda just below average gpa at rly good schools. (thanks prepscholar for proving extremely accurate information OMEGALUL) It wasnt until I was finalizing my college list of some pretty damn good schools when I came across the idea of unweighted gpa. I was actually fucking baffled. I saw my gpa as just a little lower than average until this but then I realized my gpa that colleges will look at is actually a 3.1 lel. So in short, I found out that my weighted gpa is lower than the average unweighted gpa of the schools in which I wanted to attend. Now this obviously spurred some problems, and led to me probably learning and researching about more colleges that 99% of people on this forum could even name to try desperately to find out how to fix this problem. I spent hours on college confidential, various ranking websites, and wall street oasis tryna find schools that maybe are more lenient on gpa. I eventually came to the conclusion that I would apply to \"second tier ish\" schools to see if I could squeak in along with my safety OU. Now for results:\n\n* ED - Washington and Lee(LOVED THIS FUCKIGN SCHOOL) - Rejection\n* EA - UVA(had a connection) - Rejection\n* EA - IU - accepted \\*\\*\\* .01 gpa off auto admit to Kelley OMEGALUL\n* EA - U Richmond - Rejection\n* Rolling - OU - accepted (auto 12k merit) \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* probably will lose the gpa threshold YIKES\n* RD - Lehigh - Rejection\n* RD - Colgate(LOVED THIS SCHOOL) - rejection\n* RD - Wake Forest - Rejection\n* RD - Colby - Rejection \n* RD - Bucknell - Rejection\n* RD - Georgetown(had a connection i thot could maybe pull thru) - Rejection\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk so in hindsight these were all massive reaches regardless of my 75th percentile plus ACT. I always told everyone throughout this process that I def do not deserve to go to a school of this caliber and I have accepted that. Still I hoped some AO would be like wait I sympathize with this kid and he clearly has potential maybe we should give him a chance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSO, I got the bulk of these decisions within the last week, and I have yet to tell my family. My mother will tell me how useless I am and how all of these were a waste of money to just get rejected (already stated after the early round). God i hate her... w/e. But.. my dad is who im scared about because he is the only one in my family who was encouraging and supporting in this process. I don't have the heart to tell him his faith was totally unwarranted when I tbh knew this whole time this is probably the situation I would end up in. I kinda led him to believe it would be pretty low chance for me to get rejected from all of the schools that I actually want to attend and I just can't tell him i'm a fuckup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk enough about me, sorry for all the tangents because I wanted to write this to help others. TO ANY YOUNG-LINGS READING THIS AND HOPEFULLY IT GETS TO YOU: if you know someone like me, help them by showing them this damn rant and tell them to get it the fuck together or they will be semi-suicidial(dw im extremely happy in every other element of my life) and depressed come April of senior year. TO ANY OF THE \"me's\" READING THIS: get it the fuck together. Get in the habit of doing your damn work. I know you think you are too good to do \"meaningless and pointless\" work. I understand the school system is too slow for you and you feel it is unimportant to do well. I know that you are bored everyday and would rather be doing anything than sitting in school for 8 hours. BUT, even just a little bit of work will go a long way. Study for the tests, I don't give a fuck if you're confident you'll at least get a B. WHY SETTLE FOR A B or worse lel. If you believe you are of the smartest in your school, show it and let it come forth and be proud when you achieve a gpa that shows your full potential. DO NOT be a fuckup like me or you will severely regret it I promise. The 4 years of high school work is nothing in the grand scheme of things so keep your egotistical self on track and it will all be worth it in the long run. UR LRAS will shift right bub. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk the above paragraph got kinda edgy but that is basically what I would tell myself if i could talk to my fucktard 9th grade self. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk also just a general basis, but when a highschool kid acts like they have no emotions(like me) they typically have the most shit going on and have become immune to them. TALK TO THESE FUCKING PEOPLE. I would be so much worse off if I never met my best friend and she knows all my shit and holy fk dude she's the fucking greatest. I love you you know who you are. BUT REALLY talk to these people and show them you care and you will realize they are not the brick wall that they would love the world to think they are. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yeah my name is Max and this has been my tedtalk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. transfer gods (if i go that route) pls be kind",

            "content": "Hello! :)\n\nIt's been a pretty brutal college admissions process for me (like most people), and after hearing back from all the schools I applied to, I have to make a decision between UMD College Park and Northeastern.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings to Consider:\n\n\\-I am planning to major in computer science, and that is the major I've been admitted to for both schools.\n\n\\-I am not receiving any financial aid. UMD will cost \\~23k/year due to me being in-state and receiving a 5k/year scholarship from them. Northeastern has given me a 22k/year scholarship, but I have National Merit Finalist status, so I should be able to bump that money up to anywhere from 27-30k/year from what I've heard. Therefore, Northeastern would potentially cost me about 40-43k/year.\n\n\\-I've had a rocky relationship with my parents the past few years that only got worse after I was diagnosed with anxiety and major depression. It's honestly been hell living with them, and I've dreamed about escaping to college out of state. However, because of my shaky mental health, I dropped from being a straight-A student to getting six B's junior year second semester, and that has greatly impacted my college admissions results\u2014I was rejected by all of my reaches and all but one of my match schools (Northeastern).\n\n\\-I visited UMD and really liked the school, and they have an especially strong CS department, but I'm scared of staying in-state and being left under my parent's thumb. They've been emotionally abusive and destroyed my self-esteem, and I don't know how I will be able to survive being near them another four years. At the same time, I'm really not convinced that Northeastern is worth the extra tuition\u2014I've heard good things about the co-op program, but very mixed reviews about the school in general (they seem to have an especially bad rep on this subreddit). I'm not excited about the prospect of paying extra money for a school that has a bad reputation and provides an unenjoyable college experience.\n\n\\-I would also like to hear some advice about potentially transferring to a more prestigious institution after attending one of these colleges for a year. After applying to colleges, I've worked hard at improving my mental health, and my grades have slowly improved as a result. I'm on track to get straight A's this semester (except for one B in my differential equations class). I know that prestige is not everything, but it's been really depressing to work so hard throughout high school and not see it pay off due to breaking down right before the finish line. If I continue to work hard and return back to my previous performance for the rest of my senior year and the first year of college, do you think that colleges would look favorably on my ability to persevere despite hardship? Would transferring even be something worth considering?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease let me know what you think is best\u2014ultimately, I just want to be in a place where I feel happy and fulfilled for the next four years.

I applied to about about 18 schools and got rejected from most of them, but got accepted to some good schools including George Washington, UCSD, and Penn State. Thanks to the GI bill and the yellow ribbon program I am very fortunate to have my tuition covered.\n\nWhen I was 18 I didn't even think I was going to college. I had gotten expelled from a private school that had been kind enough to give me a full scholarship and then dropped out of my local high school my senior year. I started doing drugs and got arrested multiple times. Once I got my shit together I realized I needed to go to college and it looked like the only way pay for it was through joining the military and getting my GI Bill. The only branch that would take me with drug charges was the Marine Corps. \n\nLast year, before I could even think about applying, I realized needed a high SAT score. Not only to show a more recent score to colleges, but to show them I could do even better than I did in high school. I used all the resources available to me (if you're active duty PM me because you have a ton of free resources) and raised my score by over 200 points to a 1380. I studied for three months, all while on deployment, mostly at night underneath a tarp in the jungle. \n\nApplying was pretty emotionally draining. Having to go through, in detail, all the mistakes I'd made in life that had led me to that point was sobering. More importantly though, it gave me the opportunity to show my resolve and commitment and ability to overcome adversity. Senior officers wrote me glowing letters of recommendation which helped my application immensely. My essay told a unique story and I tried to steer away from the sob story of my life to something more lighthearted. \n\nIn February my dad called me and told me he got my acceptance packet from the University of Maine for Aerospace Engineering. It was my first acceptance letter and I started crying in front of my buddies in the barracks and they all made fun of me but I didn't care. I didn't care that UMaine has a 92% acceptance rate either, it's a great school and I was pumped to have the opportunity to go there. It's been extremely emotional, but I knew my work had paid off when I got into UCSD and GW a couple weeks ago. Those schools were beyond my wildest expectations, and I'm absolutely blessed that they were able to see past my former misgivings and give me a chance to finally go to college. \n\nTo all veterans and non-traditional students thinking about college: YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN FUCKING DO IT. It's going to be REALLY hard and you need to start RIGHT NOW but it can be done. thanks for coming to my ted talk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "title": "An Article With 3 Steps About How to Get Into an Ivy that Isn't Really About How to Get Into an Ivy",
            "content": "# Introduction\n\nDo you know *how fucking badly* I wanted to get into a Top 10 School? \u00a0I was planning my high school extracurricular activities in the 7th grade. \u00a0I started editing my essays to Stanford in 10th grade.  I read hundreds of blogs and watched too many YouTube videos by accepted students to Top 10 schools, hoping that by doing so, the secrets to getting in would slowly diffuse into my fucking brain cells. \u00a0\n\nI know most of you juniors are like this too. \u00a0I can see it in your \u201cChance Me!\u201d posts, your overflowing speculation on College Confidential, and your anxiety-filled comments under college vlogs. \u00a0You have so much faith in admissions committees.  You give them so much power, so much authority, in deciding who should be accepted, that you forget AdCom is still *people.* \u00a0People who *make mistakes,* all *the fucking time.* \u00a0And you don\u2019t realize this because you want to suck a Top 10 school\u2019s dick so. Fucking. \u00a0Badly!\n\nWhy do I know you want to suck an Top 10 school's dick? \u00a0Because I wanted to as well.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve gotten into college, I realize how wrong I was. \u00a0You can\u2019t plaster the words \u201cGoal: Get into an Ivy\u201d across your wall, thinking that you can work toward it every day! \u00a0That\u2019s not even a fucking goal!  There\u2019s too many situational factors at play: too many brilliant minds, too many teachers who write like Maya Angelou about their students, too many heart-breaking, shining, and evocative essays. \u00a0There\u2019s just too many beautiful people in this world that other people are wrong about.\n\nSo instead of telling you how to get into a Top 10 school, I want to tell you how to become a better person. \u00a0Because that\u2019s what part of the purpose of life is, right?  For when the goal of getting into an Ivy becomes your framework during high school, you\u2019ve already lost the game. \u00a0But if your goal is to grow into the human you\u2019re meant to become, when you fight against the clock every passing day to do what you love, to help those you love, to become a better person-- that\u2019s when you win, no matter what.\n\n# Step 1: Becoming Passionate\n\n>*\u201cIf you don\u2019t know what you would die for in this world, then you aren\u2019t truly living\u201d* \\-Me, Bitch!\n\nPeople like to throw this phrase around a lot. \u00a0\u201cTo get into an Ivy, you must *become passionate* about something.\u201d \u00a0\u201cTo be successful in life, you must *become as passionate as Steve fucking Jobs* holding an iPhone in his fucking grubby hands.\u201d \u00a0\n\nPeople equally ask: \u201chow the fuck do I even become passionate about something. \u00a0I\u2019m a fucking sloth.  I don\u2019t know what I love.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what I tell them: there\u2019s two mini steps to stop grieving a fuckton that your fucking soulmate hasn\u2019t fucking arrived yet:\n\n* **Ignore all advice**\n\nYes. \u00a0You need to ignore all the advice about careers anyone has ever given you. \u00a0Ignore Mom who told you that since you were a little girl, you were going to become an amazing scientist. \u00a0Ignore the advice of your \"Career Cluster Finder\" quizzes on the internet, which advise you to become a social worker. \u00a0Stop thinking about your teacher who advised you to become an investment banker instead of a teacher because teaching makes 0 benjamins.  If the words of everyone around you starts flooding your head, your conscience will be flooded with \"what ifs\" and \"or maybe nots\" every time you pursue something. \u00a0After just one failure in something you pursue, you\u2019ll shrug your shoulders and say \u201cWhelp.  Guess that wasn\u2019t my passion.\u201d  Bull.Fucking.Shit.  You\u2019ll never discover what *you* want to do until you start focusing on only *you*. \u00a0Don't think about anyone's advice. \u00a0Beg your parents to stop recommending jobs and careers to you, if it helps. \u00a0Rid yourself of all the preconceptions you\u2019ve heard about careers and majors. \u00a0Start with a clean slate.  Start with absolutely nothing.\n\n* **Accept anything and everything wholeheartedly.**\n\nAfter you think you have a completely clean slate, dedicate months to you teaching yourself anything and everything. \u00a0If your classmate asks you to join the physics club, don't say \"oh no I hate that shit\".  Get over there!  Get excited about it! \u00a0If your government teacher gives everyone a pdf of the Syrian Civil War, even if you feel bored as fuck, read it and make yourself love it. \u00a0Drown yourself in everything you do.  Fake it 'till you make it.  And every inch of free time you have, make yourself teach yourself new things. \u00a0Self-teach football for a change.  Go horseback riding.  Study Plato.  Once you get the hang of it for a couple of days, things will just fall into place. \u00a0You will start to understand what felt most fun and what felt least fun.  Maybe studying football wasn't as fun as reading about the Syrian Civil War.  Maybe Plato felt like a cooler person to hang around than Nikola Tesla. \u00a0Then, when you have more free time, continue to do more of what you think was most fun.  Don\u2019t use your free time to pursue more trash.  Yeah, you know what trash I\u2019m referring to: Netflix, social media, YouTube.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, those places are great creative spaces for the authors, but relative to the amount of value that learning and pursuing your passion provides you, they\u2019re worthless. \u00a0Instead, print more pdfs about Plato or the Syrian Civil War.  If you find that physics club was the most fun, read more articles about physics.  If you like weightlifting, start a club!  Maybe you'll find that you actually love reading about non-fiction articles in general than actually learning the physics.  Maybe you actually want to pursue English.  Keep pursuing.  Keep going.\n\nOf course: there\u2019s a trap. \u00a0As soon as you start thinking: \u201coh gosh, I can\u2019t wait to start a weightlifting club-- *that\u2019ll get me into Harvard\u201d* you\u2019re done. \u00a0It\u2019s over.  Erase those thoughts from your mind. \u00a0Remind yourself that the goal isn\u2019t Mr.IvyLeague, it\u2019s you. \u00a0Enrich yourself like you love yourself.\n\n# Step 2: Becoming Humble\n\n>*\u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it simply, you don\u2019t understand it well enough\u201d* \\-Albert Einstein\n\nYou know who I think the best person to ever exist in this world is? \u00a0Maryam Mirzakhani.  No, not Albert Einstein, I knew you were thinking that, and he's a great guy too, but I'm an opinionated bitch and I think Mirzakhani is cooler. Ever heard of her?  She was the first woman to win the Fields Medal. \u00a0And she died.  Early.  Like all the good people in this world.\n\nMirzakhani went to the MIT of Iran, and then to Harvard, and then went to teach at Stanford. \u00a0And yet, despite her academic brilliance, she was the most humble person on earth.  She never went to parties and shunned recognitions because she knew that her work was most important. \u00a0When questioned as a child about what she would do for her career, she said, \u201cYou know I love math but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m good enough.\u201d  When she left this world, she told her husband not to cry too much for her, for there were other, more brutal things in this world than her to cry about. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a couple of things I\u2019ve learned. \u00a0When we start to know that we\u2019re smart, we become arrogant assholes without even knowing it. \u00a0We become the opposite of Mirzakhani.  We tell our classmates in English class, while laughing, that we just *\"ended up reading the whole book assignment\"*, and they\u2019ll laugh along too, but you\u2019ll know that the only reason you said to them that was to showcase your intelligence. Even when our friends never fucking ask, we\u2019ll tell them we\u2019ve been reading Nietzsche lately.  Or maybe we'll tell them the length of our penis. \u00a0**Pro-tip: unless they ask you about you, they don\u2019t care.  Instead, ask them about them.**\n\nHere\u2019s some more tips:\n\n1. Stop picturing yourself on a podium with everyone clapping. \u00a0Stop envisioning yourself reading Yale\u2019s acceptance letter.  It'll make you arrogant.  You\u2019re supposed to be working.\n2. Stop using big words in class that normal people need a dictionary for. \u00a0If what you\u2019re saying is meaningful, it can be said with less complexity, just ask Einstein. \u00a0Don\u2019t worry about your teacher not thinking you\u2019re smart enough to use big words and then writing a lackluster recommendation. \u00a0They\u2019re sagacious, perspicacious hominids.  And regardless, you shouldn\u2019t be worrying about their recommendations anyway, you\u2019re trying to develop yourself not your stupid college application, right?\n3. When your classmates and friends win a prize, or become teacher-favorites, or get into Ivy, everyone around you will know you\u2019re secretly bummed about it-- unless you\u2019re actually not. \u00a0Instead of secretly feeling bad about yourself or feeling mad at others because this time, you didn\u2019t win, take some advice I heard from a Saudi Arabian businesswoman on a TED Talk yesterday: strive to lift *each other* up, not just yourself. \u00a0Or as Southern Africans say: \u201cUbuntu.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI Am because We Are.\u201d\n\n# Step 3: Becoming Yourself\n\nWe\u2019re high schoolers. \u00a0As Mark Manson would say, us high schoolers have *wayyyyyy* too many fucks to fucking give. \u00a0So stop giving a fuck.  Stop giving a fuck as to what your teachers think about you. \u00a0Or what your classmates think about you.  Because when you\u2019re surrounded by other students who care way too fucking much about being aggressive, opinionated, or strong-- the most energizing thing is to be just that: aggressive, opinionated, and strong. \u00a0Step into any high school class discussion and you\u2019ll hear everyone suddenly become the middleman on the topic: abortion, whether women being housewives is okay, philosophical utilitarianism.  Instead, be an opinionated sass bitch.  Point out the bullshit in other people\u2019s logic. \u00a0Be opinionated.  Tell them abortion sucks and should be banned.  Or, conversely, demand that no one has a right to a woman's body.  *Even if the topic is boring as fuck*, like whether the United States should get rid of pennies, find a side and stick to it.  Be interesting.  That shit\u2019s likeable.\n\nOf course, **what I\u2019m not saying** is that it\u2019s okay to be the crazy liberal or insane conservative in the room who says opinionated nonsense, shuts down other people\u2019s sassiness, and doesn\u2019t let other people point out *their own* bullshit. \u00a0Be graceful about accepting criticism back and be okay with saying aloud to the entire class, \u201cactually, you\u2019re right. \u00a0You got me there.\u201d\n\nAnd aside from just developing your own opinionated-ass ideas, develop other unique aspects of yourself too. \u00a0Instead of wearing the classic sweatpants, sweatshirt, and uggs to school everyday, what if you wore business pants and a professional looking blouse?  \u00a0Or perhaps plaid with a bright yellow hat?  Or a 40s hairstyle?  Try new things out.  And instead of reading billions of accepted Ivy League essays, stressing over whether you're going to write the perfect essay too, **why don\u2019t you just write** ***whatever you wanna say***, for fun?\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBack then, when there was an idea of something called the *pursuit of happiness*, led by the United States, American teens cared about such a thing, and did what they were passionate about. \u00a0They treated themselves like someone worth loving and developing.  It\u2019s not too late for American teens to do this again, to veer away from the glorified abyss called Ivy League idealism, in order to become more beautiful, humble, and colorful human beings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For more posts like this, check out: \"[How to Get into Stanford....By Someone Who Didn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/aqqtys/how_to_get_into_stanfordby_someone_who_didnt/)\", which was written several months ago.",

I am currently planning on going into business but I think there is a good chance I end up switching majors because honestly, I have absolutely no idea what I want to do so I just applied business in case (I think I may be drawn towards either CS or Psychology). I also know the party culture is likely different at each school and while I am planning on partying at least a decent amount (I mean think about these 3 schools' reputations) I also don't want to just be partying every weekend, I want to be able to go out and do other things. Luckily I am blessed enough to have my parents paying for my college (and are willing to pay no matter where I want to go) so I am not going to factor money into the decision. I know academics are super important but I'm also heavily weighing my quality of life and the atmospheres of each campus because I do have to live there for 4 years after all. I'm a guy if that matters for anyone's opinions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways here is pretty much the reasons I would/wouldn't want to go to each school. (My stats at the bottom for reference)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.IU Kelly\n\nPros\n\n\\- Direct admit to Kelly\n\n\\- If I end up going for business I would say this is obviously the superior school\n\n\\- Closer to home (doesn't matter much to me other than travel time)\n\n\\- Parents would likely be more happy due to the caliber business school\n\n\\- Kids in the business school seem to be very bright people and would be good to be around\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCons\n\n\\- SO MANY people from my high school are going here (including my step-brother same age) and I honestly don't think I want to have a repeat of high school\n\n\\- Majors outside of the business school aren't as competative in my opinion\n\n\\- Not much to do around Bloomington, honestly a fairly boring setting\n\n\\- Seems pretty much just like a bunch of frat guys who sit around every weekend and drink\n\n\\- Seems to me that Kelly is pretty separate from the rest of the school (Kelly kids seem a bit elitist)\n\n\\- Even though I just said that it seems like most of the kids outside of Kelly are not as smart which is a bit worrying\n\n\\- Would likely have to work in the midwest/Chicago after school and I kind of want to get out of Chicago\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. CU Boulder\n\nPros\n\n\\- Direct admit to Leeds\n\n\\- Campus setting is amazing, I literally love everything about it (right at the mountains) Boulder is beautiful\n\n\\- Seems like the student body is much more active/does more than just partying (skiing/hiking/going on lots of weekend trips even when it's cold)\n\n\\- I would be in the top 25% of students their (based off scholarship I received) which would hopefully allow me to get better internships/jobs after college\n\n\\- People at Boulder seem very happy/friendly and it seems like they all are honestly just fun-loving and looking to have a good time\n\n\\- Majors outside of business seem to be pretty impressive (especially engineering) and they have a pretty good psychology program\n\n\\- Would really love to work in Colorado/California after college\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCons\n\n\\- I'm in the top 25% of students leading me to believe that there will be some not as smart kids there (I know a lot of people go there just to party, nothing wrong with that but I want to be able to party and do well in school)\n\n\\- Not a particularly well ranked business school if I do go that route\n\n\\- A bit worried about getting good jobs out of college from here just because it isn't as well ranked\n\n\\- Pretty much know nobody going here from my school so going in pretty blind (honestly not that much of a con)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. UW Madison\n\nPros\n\n\\- Best ranked overall school out of the 3\n\n\\- Overall student body (Smart school that parties hard too + very good school spirit)\n\n\\- Good majors/programs outside of business school\n\n\\- Have a couple friends going here but not too many so I would know people but also meet tons of new people\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCons\n\n\\- Pre-business not direct admit\n\n\\- It's cold af, which is fine, but there isn't really much to do other than be inside and drink when it's cold\n\n\\- Honestly was never really considering UW other than because it's well ranked\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Stats: 32 ACT (33 Super-score), 4.1 W Gpa at a very competitive High school.\n\nAP Bio: 4, AP Lang: 4, currently taking AP Econ, AP Gov, AP AB Calc and took AP Physics C Mechanics 1st semester (dropped 2nd semester as at my school 2nd semester is AP Physics C Electricity and Magnetism)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther schools: Tulane (waitlist), UCSB (waitlist), Santa Clara (waitlist), Denver, Iowa, Depaul\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly didn't get into most of the schools I really wanted to go to so I'm kind of picking from my safeties/less exciting schools imo. I would go to Santa Clara/UCSB if I get in off the waitlist. Also am considering a gap year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I was terrified and having so many panic attacks and bouts of depression. I'm first generation, so my parents don't know much about the process and I was super stressed out, and just throwing my eggs into literally all of the baskets.. fast-forward to like a month ago, I decided I wouldn't stress about money (that was my biggest concern, debt), go to community college, and then transfer after two years... I felt free and calm and at peace with my decision. I got accepted into most of the places I applied, but all the mail piling up and the information that kept flooding me in my emails and the MOney I kept thinking about.. It was just too much. It was way too overwhelming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*BUT THEN YESTERDAY I CHECKED MY ACCEPTANCE LETTER TO CMU*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI only stumbled across it by accident, stumbling through my 100's of neglected emails that I've been ignoring. I thought \"why not check it, just for the hell of it.\"\n\nI was waitlisted... HOWEVER, according my my financial aid packet, They're offering me 68 fucking K in grants  out of the 74k it costs to go there, as well as an opportunity for work study if i get in.\n\nI know that it's highly unlikely to get in off of a waitlist, but I applied priority and I'm saving up for the 800 dollar deposit if they accept me. It really brightened my mood and I feel a little bit more confident in what I can do I guess? I applied to CMU out of kind of a-girl-can-dream sort of way, because my SAT's and ACT's aren't super impressive and my gpa is a 4.0 but that's not like super high in comparative to what most people going to such competitive schools get. I don't have a bunch of extra curriculars because most of my time goes to helping out with my family, so again, sized up to a lot of students my portfolio isn't amazing. But just the fact that the most competitive school I applied to even is slightly considering me, I dunno gave me a bit of hope.. it's been a fucking terrible week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I have a lot to think about and I would be so grateful for any advice. So, I have 6 top choices for college. I honestly don\u2019t know what would be the best choice for me. This is not to flex or anything, I am clueless and stressed about this and I could use any/all advice possible.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve been accepted into all of them except for the CCS program (\\*\\*I\u2019m still waiting on that but i want to count it as a factor so I can have a good idea of what to do in case I do get in).\n\nMy top choices are:\n\nNYU (Honors Program)\n\nUSC\n\nHarvey Mudd (Presidential Finalist)\n\nUC Berkely (EOP)\n\nUCLA\n\n\\*\\*UCSB (With CCS maybe)\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing/looking for with undergrad:\n\nI\u2019m a physics major and I plan on getting my PhD in theoretical physics (still not sure what branch) and I want to start a research company or reach a head position at a research facility (like NASA or SpaceX or CERN or something)\u2014 so I\u2019m strongly considering double majoring or minoring in business and dealing with some businesses\u2026 and I want to stay heavily involved in music while all of this is going on\n\nHere is what I\u2019m looking for in an undergrad (these are all equally weighted):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I want to get into a really highly-ranked grad school like MIT or Stanford or something for my PhD. and get a lot of research experience so I would like to go somewhere where I have the opportunity for a lot of research and the ability to lead some projects\n2. Experience\u2014 I want to enjoy my life on top of all of this stuff and have a generally nice student life (having fun on & off campus)\n3. Entrepreneurship/ Business opportunities: lots of students and people nearby that are interested in starting businesses or making ideas come to life (very important for what I want to do)\n4. Study Abroad Programs\u2014 can I take my normal classes during this and will the aid travel with me and what options are there for me?\n5. Nice location\u2014 i can have fun here and I\u2019m near a lot of cool people\u2026 I\u2019ve lived in southern California all my life and though I love it here, at the same time I would also really love to explore something new and live in the city for at least one time in my life and i want to go on somewhat of an adventure for the next four years and see what I like :) sooo I don\u2019t know what to do\u2014 and if anyone has any experiences with moving far away for college, what is it/will it be like? I want to keep that in mind.\n6. More of an open-type curriculum where I can take more classes that would help me than just GEs and things like them\n7. Community: I would really prefer to go to a school where i feel a strong sense of community rather than just feeling like a number, I want to have pride and foster strong connections with alumni, current, and future students\n8. Connections: I want to have good connections with alumni, current, and future students (like I said earlier) but also I want business and internship-type connections\n9. Housing\u2014 I can\u2019t really afford to find an apartment off campus at any point during my college career, especially since I won\u2019t have time for a job\u2026 so guaranteed housing is very important (but it doesn\u2019t completely factor any school out of the equation)\u2026 this being said, I have guaranteed housing for 4 years almost everywhere but the UCs I\u2019m pretty sure\n10. Most importantly actually\u2014 Happiness: I want to live in an environment where the students are kind, driven, and work with manageable levels of stress\u2026 where they can have fun every now and then and aren\u2019t dying from the work load or stress or competitiveness\n\nQuestions about the colleges I have:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. What kind of resources are available at these schools? (Like music buildings, finances for low-income students, housing and job opportunities\u2026 & anything else that you can think of\n2. WHAT ARE THE LIBRARIES LIKE AND HOW LATE THEY OPEN (and other study places on/near campus)\n3. Does anyone know anything about the Dean\u2019s Scholarship and Honors program thingy at NYU? I got that but I could hardly find anything about it online\n4. Does anyone know what EOP at berkeley does or helps with?\n5. Can anyone tell me a little more about CCS?",

Go Tartans!!!!\n\nWhen I first started this process, I was absolutely obsessed with prestige and the mythical ethos some of these schools commanded. After visiting, touring, and talking with students, I soon ditched that mindset as I fell in love with some of the colleges (particularly CMU and Harvey Mudd). In the end, I chose CMU because they offered met full need and because of the nerdy culture there; when I first visited, I was wearing a naruto shirt, and I had a student approach me, and we hit it along perfectly. In the end, I'm grateful for where I have gotten accepted too, but I also realized life is more than just the shadow of your ego. I hated colleges because they shrunk us down to our numbers, but I realize we do exactly the same to colleges despite them having drastically different personalities and atmospheres. As long as you are happy (and financially secure I should add), colleges are just new beginnings that you can choose to adventure and explore. At the conclusion of everything, happiness is just a state of mind (excluding mental illness), and your future is up to you to decide. I'm going to grind my ass off at CMU, and I hope you all do the same regardless of where you're going. Colleges don't determine your self worth.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nI think I made good use of my time in high school, and I'm happy for that. I did the extracurriculars I loved, and I feel well rewarded for my time studying late at nights and during lunch breaks. I feel truly elated that my family doesn't have to pay for my college, and I will continue to strive for greatness. I think I made a good impression on my siblings, and hopefully they have a good life too (I'm counting on you Akio, love you little bro) However, I did see quite a lot of hatred. My school is competitive, and many students were toxic to me since I was a minority, presumably because word got around that I got into some top schools. I want to feel proud I got into these schools, but I also understand my racial background helped me get into them as my extracurriculars weren't particularly astounding relative to my peers who were denied or waitlisted. Overall, high school is the first mile in the long marathon of life, and fuck if it wasn't hard, but damn was it rewarding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR I got into my top schools, and I feel justified that my high school work paid off. I feel bad it may be because of my skin color, but I will continue to grind in college regardless of what my peers think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love you all! Have an amazing 2019! and go Tartans!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "content": "What's up guys, this is gonna be quite an embarrassing post, but I am in need of some advice and figured this might be a friendly/good place to go for some ideas or any advice that you guys' might personally have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dropped out of High School in 9th grade, for reasons that would be far too complicated to get into. To make a long, complicated story short, I was in a very chaotic environment in terms of my living situation. I grew up with parents who were victims of drug addiction/alcoholism, as well as being very financially poor. This caused a burden on my mental stability, as well as my self confidence, which in turn affected my education dramatically. I am not blaming this all on my parents, because I know they tried their hardest and were at a position where they could not control their diseases. Due to my living situation growing up and the lack of finances/personal resources, I was very isolated, anxious, quite, and rather embarrassed of anyone knowing about my life. I kept everything inside, and it was almost a full time job trying to keep my personal life disattached from my social life at school, and to not allow anyone to know what was going on at home/that my house was very small/that my family was extremely poor and rather broken. I never got any help with any mental health resources, never saw any student counselors, and never spoke on any of this really with any of my friends (Though some did know, and the very smart observant folks in my high school could tell by paying attention to my body language/my socializing and by the lack of outfits that I had to wear).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never got my GED, never took my ACT/SAT, and I averaged a 1.40 GPA throughout my life (from middle school until high schoo), but my GPA got as low as 0.80 at times. I only have gotten above a 2.00GPA one single time in my life, and this required a plethora of effort on my behalf. I think that the PTSD I had from my childhood affected my social/focusing skills and made me subconsciously lash out on my education. I was rather reckless and didn't care at all about my grades, never did homework, and flunked a majority of my tests. Deep down inside, I have always been far more intellegent than my peers, and I have always known this, but I still lacked the intuition and confidence to show what I had to put to the table and never put it to use in my education.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am now 22 years old, jobless, and I am rather tired of living such an empty life. Hopping from dead end day job to day job making just enough money to get by, if that. I also have drug issues, with 3 years of drug abuse in my life span. This was influenced partially by my upbringing, and just by my day to day life and personal relationships. I have it under control now, and I would say I am mentally stable. I got to learn myself over the years, what triggers me, what to stay away from, what to stay around, etc. I have finally decided that I think I may want to attend a community college and take some classes, and figured out what I think I truly want to do with my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI aspire to work with troubled youth, such as juvenile kids that come from dark upbringings/are in need of stable environments. A social worker of some sort maybe in a juvenile facility or a foster facility for the youth system would be relaly really cool to me. I think it would be inspiring to help the youth, because they are our future at the end of the day. So this is what I'm thinking of looking into once I schedule an interview to see a student counselor. I am located in California and will be signing up for FASFA. I currently live with my mother and father who are separated but live together in an apartment lease in a rather bad area, and they both work full time and are currently supporting me because I am not working right now. So FASFA will help tremendously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother idea I had in mine was working in the music industry, as maybe a music engineer, journalist, etc. Anything really that is involved with the music industry. I am an avid music fan and have been collecting vinyls just about all my life. Inspired by classic rock, alternative music, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was just looking for any advice you guys might have for attending a community college. What to expect? What you advise me doing in advance? I have not attended school in about 9 years, so this si gonna be a completely different transition in my life but I believe I am genuinely ready for this approach and I refuse to allow myself to live this boring, dull life I have been accustomed to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you guys for reading and any comments are truly appreciated.",

I have a variety of motivations, most of them intellectual:\n\n\u2022 I want to be surrounded by bright and curious people that are just as enthusiastic and serious about mathematics + science as I am.\n\n\u2022 I figure that my prime years should be spent on investing in my own brain before I lose the edge that youth brings me.\n\n\u2022 I want to get into a more research-y type role in the future, eg AI research rather than a product/business oriented role.\n\nI'm thinking of studying either Mathematics or Physics as both of these subjects interest me, will challenge my reasoning skills and will make it easier for me in the future to self study mathy topics as needed. The main complication is that I didn't do good in highschool, mostly due to motivation and untreated ADHD.\n\nI'm willing to retake the SAT + SAT subject tests and to independently study for AP subject tests, I've already taken a variety of MOOCs to strengthen my understanding of mathematics (so far I've taken linear algebra, calculus, mathematical thinking, proof theory, logic, number theory along with the CS theory I've learned through MOOCs + mentorship). When I took the SAT in highschool I scored in the 90th percentile for critical reading and closer to 40% for mathematics though I suspect I can get a much better score if I were to retake it now.\n\nI'm wondering if AP + SAT test scores as well as my resume would be enough to offset my highschool record for an application to a great university. Community college is an option, but I'd like to avoid it due to it's relatively long timespan, lesser flexibility on my work schedule and because I figure that I should focus on building the intuition I'll need to succeed in the actual subjects I want to study.  I'm thinking MIT, Stanford, Urbana Champaign, Carnegie Mellon though I'd also be willing to go international \u2014 funding wouldn't be an issue if I got into a great uni.",

I should be receiving my AA by the time I start my undergrad (meaning my undergrad could only take 2 year but I\u2019d probably stay for at least 3) and will be majoring in Anthropology in hopes of becoming an Archaeologist working with like the Smithsonian or National Geographic. I also want/have to go to grad school which would pay for my PhD.\n\nSo now here\u2019s the issue:\nI have 2 schools that I have wavering between. \n\nOption 1: the one I actually truly want to go to, I would have to take out loans for, but would allow me to remain sane and happy.\n\nHas a great Anthropology Department, Club, and is affiliated with the national organization for Anthropology (the AIA). They also have a ton of experience in field research (which is something I want to do to be a good candidate for grad school). I would have to take out loans for housing for at least the first year which adds up to about 6-7,000 after scholarships. I would not be given the car I was promised if I were to go here.\n\n\nOption 2: results in me staying home for the 2-4 years of undergrad but I would be unhappy and loose my mind and never want to be home.\n\nThey have my major but it\u2019s more of a track for the Sociology/Anthropology Major. Even so, my degree would still just say Anthropology. It\u2019s not a bad school, they do offer some research. Since I would live at home, I wouldn\u2019t get any loans and actually result in me having money in my pocket. I would also be given a car if I stay since I would have to drive to campus and back home.\n\n\nBoth colleges are in the same state. One is just 30min from home while the other is 3 hours away.\n\nHowever, at this point, my parents have gotten very hostile towards the whole situation: threatening to cancel family events that were already planned, saying I\u2019m a disappointment because I want Option 1, saying I\u2019m an idiot, making me feel guilty for any argument they have with each other, giving me anxiety and stress anytime I realize I have to talk to them about anything college related. They have abolished the fun and excitement out of choosing colleges. It has gotten to a point that I do not feel safe for my mental state in the house. I have started to have mental breaks and anxiety/panic attacks more frequently when before they RARELY happened.\n\nMy parents asked me to sacrifice and go to Option 2 (their choice), saying it\u2019s not my choice (even though they said it was at first). \n\nSo, do I make the sacrifice or follow my aspirations??\n\nTLDR: I want to go to a school that I will have to take loans for housing but it has more opportunity than the other but my parents are threatening me and mentally abusing me into their choice of school ",

I was rejected by 13 colleges (1560 SAT, 3.6 UW GPA if you all care about my stats), my grandfather suddenly passed away, and I was ditched by my prom date, and expelled from my high school all in the span of two weeks. At this point in my life, I saw myself and my entire existence as a total failure and fell into a deep depression. I became overweight, I couldn\u2019t sleep, my entire face was covered in breakouts, and my hair was falling out in clumps from the stress. I saw my life was a complete and total failure - I had wasted four years of my life stressing over APs and SATs and ECs which I hated, and I had to go to my shitty state school. I was very close to ending it all on the train tracks. But I'm so damn glad I didn't.  \n\nFast forward one year. I ended up taking a gap year, and that was by far the best decision of my life. Day by day, I rebuilt myself. I got a gym membership and busted my ass, and I now have a six pack (most of the time lol). I went from being a virgin to a being pretty sexually experienced dude in just a few months. Right now, I literally have nothing in common with me from a few months ago. The soul-crushing anxiety is gone, my relationship with my family and friends have improved, and I love the life I have. I am thrilled to attend my \u201cshitty state school\u201d later this fall. \n\nYour happiness is infinitely more important than the flawed decisions that admissions officers make about you. Because they don't define you, YOU define who you are. \n\nYou got accepted to your dream school? Congratulations, but that doesn't mean jack shit about your success in life. \n\nYou got rejected by your dream school? That doesn't mean jack shit. You can succeed regardless of where you go.

Go kill it at a community college or your most affordable option. \n\nThis might sound cliche, but it really does get so much better. I wish I could go back in time, and slap my narrow minded idiot past self in the face. I wish I had focused on doing things I actually enjoyed in high school. And I wish I had reached out for emotional support earlier when shit hit the fan. \n\nI highly recommend taking a gap year if at all possible. You don't have to study abroad or anything (unless you have like super affluent parents or something). The way I view the world has changed so drastically, and I am so much more happier and mature than before. The suicide prevention hotline is there if you need it at 1-800-273-8255. Don't ever, ever, ever, give up. It really does get better. \n\n\n",

            "content": "An update to [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/85dzxa/friend_is_only_applying_to_4_schools_yale/)\n\nOriginally he was going to apply to 4 colleges: MIT, UChichago, Caltech, and Yale, but he dropped Yale and added Princeton and Berkeley. He had a 3.86 GPA, a 32 ACT, and his only EC was being co-captain of our school's SciOly team, along with me. He also volunteered at our local library, but only our senior year. He's an ORM, not poor, and has no hooks. So, what happened to this guy?\n\nWell, let's start chronologically. He applied to UChicago early decision: rejected. This slightly freaked him out. He thought it was a pretty sure thing. After all, both his sister and his mom went to school there (his sister's a junior right now), and he had been in love with their physics program since like 7th grade. \n\nAfter this, he quickly applied to the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Colorado Boulder, Colorado State University, and the University of Wyoming, all of which were still accepting applications. These are all local colleges in our area. He didn't want to apply to any \"mid tier\" private/out of state schools. \n\nSo, RD decisions roll around. MIT... no. Still somewhat optimistic. Then Caltech, Princeton, and Berkeley... all no. This won't shock any of you, but my entire school was pretty surprised. The general student grossly underestimates how competitive they are nowadays.  \n\n\nHe did get accepted to all our local colleges though. However, none gave him much scholarship money, except for our state school (UWyo). His parents are upper-middle class and could afford out of state, but they weren't going to pay for an out of state school that they said had essentially the same name value as our state school. Also, they aren't *that* wealthy. My friend would have needed to take on some not-insignificant debt (about 30-50k total over 4 years), which he also didn't want to do. \n\nSo, he enrolled in the University of Wyoming as a physics major, with the determination to either transfer to a better school or get into an elite grad school. \n\nAt least he won't be in debt. \n\nTLDR: Rejected from UChicago ED, he freaked out and applied RD to 5 of our local colleges. He got into all those but was rejected by the other 4 \"elite\" colleges he applied to. He will be attending our state school.\n",

            "content": "It reads as follows:\n\nTo whom it may concern,\nI have a message for your admissions officers:\n\nHey you. Yes, you! Kindly finish eating that burger and start reading (KINDLY READ TILL THE END). My name is _______ - a student and former class of '23 applicant to your humble institution. \nA few months ago, I made the foolish assumption that I was an especial individual; I mean, I always had that feeling that I was that 1 in a billion but after countless hours of reviewing the ideal GPA/SAT scores for top universities from prep scholar, spreading myself thin to achieve said scores while still maintaining my daily schedule of extra-curricular activities and trying to be myself amidst all the chaos, I had a moral epiphany that perhaps I was unique.\n\nThen came the time for university applications; I wouldn't want to lie that Stanford was always my top choice because frankly speaking, I never thought of Stanford as my dream school. That is, until I realized how truly breath-taking it was to study at the institution. Don't get me wrong, you're still pretty expensive (On behalf of all students, tone down the educational expenses down a little \ud83d\ude42 ).\n\nAlas! I just had to choose Stanford for my common-app, didn't I? \n\nFrom that moment onward,  I spent hour after hour researching the most unique prompt answers, attempting to fabricate similarly eccentric ones. Yet, after all that time, all my debilitated cerebrum could muster was moot.\nStill, I never gave up; I gathered all the creativity, intellect and semantic expertise I could for this momentous endeavor. I must say, it took near sleepless nights to engineer the ideal responses for my 'magnum opus'.\n\nAs such, I was confident as ever (believe it or not, I made a bet with one of my friends to shave his head bald should I be accepted to St. Anford).\nNearly everyday post-application, I would go to the A2C sub-reddit and read each post. Trust me, the sub was filled with amazing, unorthodox individuals who, for the most part asked relevant, amusing questions. I even met some people on the way - one of which who was accepted to Stanny during the restrictive early action period. In fact, there was a theory lingering about the date change on our Stanford portals. Apparently, the date change was a bad sign indicating rejections whereas an unaltered date suggested acceptance. FYI, it left lots of us mesmerized.\nNevertheless, the worst time was on 28th March (29th at 2:00 AM for me because I live in _____)\nI had already been rejected by the ivies - I'm sorry? Did you think the farm was the only university I applied to? Naw...\n\nAnyways, the point is that I could barely sleep before those decisions because the uncertainty in my head left me feeling both excitement as well as discomfort about my potential decision at dawn.\n\nGuess I should've believed the latter and just slept soundly since my astonishment at the wonderful rejection letter I obtained was axiomatically (forgive my sesquipedalian nature) unmatched by any moment in my life. I suppose I'll see you guys at Grad school then...\nSeriously guys, couldn't you have even wait listed me? I mean, I don't blame you; I honestly think my massive faux pas lied in my own undoing. I had sent my application in delectation without realizing how truly flawed it was. My essays didn't reflect me at all but rather the person I've always wanted to be. I guess I overlooked that teensy-weensy flaw, huh.\n\nToo bad second chances don't exist with undergrad admissions because I've learnt my lesson. As traumatic as the #MarchMadness experience was and despite not getting into my top choice (You \ud83d\ude1e ), I can candidly say that it really was an eye-opener and expressed just how much I have yet to learn.\n\nNow then, if you've made it here, you're either really bored or you just love my writing (probably the latter but if it's the former, take a break and perhaps consider joining my Call of Duty team? It'll be fun). But on a more serious note, you may have seen this fairly inordinate message as a rant - which it may very well be - but I see this as a meagre opportunity to say the phrase \"Thank you\". Even after the false hope and undoubtedly painful rejection, I have to say thanks since, due to your hard work and unfaltering determination, you ended up choosing students who would better represent the class of '23 than even I would. In retrospect, you've not only shortlisted arguable the cream of the crop, but have carefully and rightfully chosen future leaders, innovators and game-changers who offer holistic judgement and fascinating expression, which is an impressive feat altogether.\n\nThat said, I'll end with the words (in the ultimate trifecta of CAPS, BOLD and UNDERLINE):\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\nP.S. If you'd like a thank you postcard, just say the word \ud83d\ude42\n\nP.P.S. Kindly send this message to everyone who participated in making undergrad applications decisions because you all deserve the utmost gratitude.\n\nCheers,\n\n_______",

A lot of these students from these two other schools will end up going to the local community college, and it's also a reason why I'm not interested in going.\n\nI just want to have the normal college experience and although I have a couple more years to decide what I'll be doing, my sister is pressing this idea on to me so much, and I feel discouraged that I won't be able to go to a school that I can be capable of going to, because of my financial status.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nlet me know your thoughts, and experiences as well!

This is why I am planning on majoring in Music Production for my first 3 years, and then engineering at either CalTech or Columbia.\n\nMeanwhile, I will be studying Mechanical Engineering UCSB. I know that this is definitely what I want to do, going to UCSB.\n\nHowever, my mom wants me to go to Oxy for the sake of transferring to CalTech. The problem here is, I don\u2019t think I will be getting the \u201ccollege experience\u201d that I want at Oxy and CalTech. I feel like the 5 years in this program will destroy me, both inside and out. I know CalTech\u2019s curriculum will be super vigorous, and I\u2019m not sure if I can keep up with it.\n\nI am planning on going to graduate school, so there\u2019s something else to consider.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice for choosing one out of these two, or even dissuading my mom away from Oxy.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nP.

            "content": "Hi!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a current first year in Australia studying medicine through an undergrad MD pathway - we start our academic year in February, which is why university has already started. I was also fortunate enough to recently be admitted to Penn's class of 2023!! However, I'm now faced with most certainly the hardest decision I'll have to make in my 18 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStudying in the US has been my dream for all four years of high school - it was what drove me to work so hard. I've always wanted to live in the US, experience the traditional American college experience, try out all the amazing food, watch NBA games, travel around to so many iconic states, and study whatever I want at uni under the liberal arts education system. The greatest thing of all was that my parents were always supportive of me throughout these four years - driving me to sporting competitions out in the middle of nowhere and even allowing me to live alone in my grandparent's house (who were overseas) for the entirety of senior year just so I could focus entirely on myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYet, we disagreed on what my future would look like. I loved maths and wanted to study maths in the US, and wanted to complement my degree with some sort of computer science to boost my employability - that would be my ideal life. My parents, however, wanted me to be a doctor. They immigrated to Australia knowing very little english, and established themselves here through unimaginable dedication and perseverance, and so, all they want for me is to have a secure, well-paying job in the future that can never be replaced - just so I would never have to live my life like they did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe did come to a compromise though - if I was admitted to an elite school in the US, they would willingly pay for my tuition and let me study whatever I want. If I failed, I would have to listen to them and become a doctor in Australia. Now that I'm in my position, they're backtracking on their words and are pushing hard for me to stay, and I can understand why. I'm the only child and it'll be hard on all three of us if I go overseas. There's too many variables if I study in the states, especially regarding career prospects and job security - becoming a doctor is obviously much safer. Also, even though they can afford funding my studies, it'll put immense financial strain on my family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI regret not applying for financial aid so much since a large portion of my decision hinges on my guilt for asking my parents to pay so much. At this point it seems like I'll have to give up on my dream even though I've already made it. I don't even enjoy medicine that much - I love maths so much more. Do I really want to live out my parents' dream rather than my own? I don't want to live my life being their puppet - I have my own dreams, aspirations, and beliefs. Money isn't the most important thing to me - I don't want to be super rich, all I want is enough to get by happily. To me, the most important thing is living a happy life, doing what I want and feeling like my life is my own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would appreciate it so much if anyone could offer me any bit of advice. Is it worth trading off my guaranteed future as a doctor for an uncertain future in the US?",

            "title": "Juniors/Underclassmen, Here's What I've Learned the Hard Way",
            "content": "Brief Context: I am officially a member of the Carleton College Class of 2023, after sending in my fee last night!\n\nI also got waitlisted by Williams College after becoming a proud Ivy and UC-Hicago Reject. Pretty good, right? Especially considering I was pretty much navigating this process blind, and made plenty of stupid mistakes.\n\nRight, y'all. You're up next at bat, and while I've got all the faith in the world in you, here are my takeaways from this stupid process, for what they're worth:\n\n\\-For the love of all that is good and green in this world, do not use USNWR unless you're looking at rankings for your specific major (And even then, Shanghai Index is more reliable\u2014though, it still has anomalies and mistakes) as a starting spot for your search. Just, don't. Look anywhere else.\n\n\\-You are allowed to hate \"prestigious\" schools, schools that are good for your major, or your parents'/beloved aunt's/favorite teacher's/coach's alma mater. Bearing that in mind, you are also allowed to really love schools you really didn't think you would.\n\n\\-Juniors\u2014start those applications as soon as you finish your testing in May. Take a breather, but start drafting essays over the summer. Common App and Coalition App release their prompts fairly early on, and college prompts (Especially \"Why X College\") don't change much year to year, most of the time. Once your senior year starts, time available to work on applications is going to decrease exponentially. Make sure the lion's share of work is done before school really kicks in.\n\n\\-Freshmen/Sophomores, make sure you study for not only the SAT, but the PSAT\u2014especially if you live in a state with a lower cutoff for NMSF. Colleges love to see National Merit stuff on your applications, and money can often get thrown your way.\n\n\\-Speaking of the SAT: whenever your scores come out, keep an eye on the news in case nonsense like what happened last year with the June SAT's curve, particularly if your scores are lower than what you expected (By this, I mean your raw scores don't line up with your final scores according to the conversion charts floating around). If history repeats itself, you'll want to know so you can figure out if you want to take the test again. DO NOT use this as an excuse on your applications.\n\n\\-Don't just have a safety or two that you really like\u2014make sure they're FINANCIAL safeties as well. Look for a college that offers not only your major, but automatic merit that you KNOW you can get, like the University of Oklahoma, UT-Arlington, or Baylor University (Apparently, Texas is great for auto merit). This way, worst comes to worst, you know you'll have somewhere you can afford.\n\n\\-When figuring out what's a match for you, don't just look at last year's acceptance rate, but how much application numbers increased by year to year. A couple schools' acceptance rates plummet every year as they become popular, and you don't want to get burned by a school that would have been a match for you two years ago, but is now a reach.\n\n\\-If you want to apply to an Ivy or school with a comparable acceptance rate (Or even \"Stanford\"), do so with the mindset that you're essentially burning that application fee money (Or waiver). Put all the time you want into them\u2014heck, I used my Hicago essay prompts as a decompressor from the million other \"Why X\" essays I had to write\u2014but don't send off your Duke or Pomona application with the expectation of anything other than a rejection. If you get in, fantastic, and congratulations!\n\n\\-The blame game never works. Take a day to mourn your losses in this process, and move on. Bitterness will get you nowhere. Hold your head high, and move on.\n\n\\-Keep your freaking grades up. Some B's (Or grades a letter lower relative to your average) are okay senior year, but don't screw around. Do the work you need to.\n\n\\-Lastly, I know everyone's said this a million times, but it can always be said again: *this process is a fucking crapshoot.* After sending your applications in and doing your interviews and sending in your mid-year reports, don't try and apply logic to your acceptances and rejections beyond a very limited point. I got into Carleton College, but wasn't offered merit from my state flagship (UMD), was waitlisted for an honors college at a school with a \\~60% overall acceptance rate, by Boston University, and by Williams College. Also, I was roundly rejected by Cornell, UC-Hicago, and Princeton.\n\nThis process isn't a reflection of your self-worth, at all. It's a question of how prepared and lucky you can be. I *was* lucky, and was accepted to an amazing school that I'll be attending in the fall, silently thanking that AO who saw something in my application the whole time.\n\nAnd if you get rejected during this process?\n\nMake those schools regret turning you down (In the good, non-destructive way).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: Adding what u/sciecne says below: \\[I am paraphrasing\\]\n\n\\-Get very serious about your college essays once your senior year starts. Don't be afraid to ask multiple teachers to revise and look over your essays before submitting.\n\n\\-Practice for the SAT by taking full practice tests, and look at what concepts overall (Particularly math) you're missing in sections. Then, review with class materials to study basic concepts. This can really help your scores overall, instead of just doing \"hunt-and-peck\" studying with individual questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: Adding what u/Xenofuscus says below: \\[Paraphrased\\]\n\n\\-This applies to all of high school, but especially junior second semester and senior year: do your best to take care of your health and yourself. Sleep and exercise regularly; it'll work wonders for your motivation and energy, especially on knocking out classwork and apps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Also, if things really get bad your senior year (And this should be done with great caution and scheduling): coming from me (OP), I would say take a mental health day, if you feel terrible. If you won't miss anything terrible, take a day off from school. Sleep in, catch up on homework, knock out a college supplement or two, and maybe watch a movie on Netflix. You should only do this once or twice a semester (If you feel the need for more, you should probably see your counselor or doctor), but mental health days  are good things in limited quantities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 3: I mention it in a response below, but make sure to fill out your FAFSA and/or CSS Profile or any school-specific sheet as early as possible as well. Don't be afraid to cajole your parents about this, as it saved me so much time and pain during the process. You'll have your finances squared away, and it'll make it easier to get your package (Or even a bigger one) or to appeal, if necessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 4: Adding what u/jjss8 says below: \\[Paraphrased\\]\n\n\\-Regarding deadlines: be extremely careful of \"hidden\" deadlines, where scholarship deadlines are before actually application deadlines, such as schools like Georgia Tech and USC.\n\n\\-Send in your SAT/ACT/SAT II score *ASAP.* They take time to arrive at schools and be processed, so take advantage of the free score reports offered, if any.\n\n\\-Ask your teachers for rec letters early (Before September of your senior year, if possible); odds are, the teachers you ask are also being asked by multiple other students, and you don't want to be caught at the end of a list.\n\n\\-Check your portals once your application has been submitted for any missing documents or other components.\n\n\\-Don't stress out more than you have to! This process can be sort of fun, especially with some of the quirkier essays, as well as helping out your friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 5: Wow, thank you whoever gave me my first gold, made my day! Right, so brief (And final; this post is getting *long)* additions from the comment sections. Underclassmen, there are a ton of seniors giving brilliant advice in the comment sections, really take a look through, there's a ton of useful stuff. Just a few quick highlights:\n\n\\-As mentioned by u/creddit_where_due, r/SAT and r/ACT are very valuable resources to check out, as well as Khan Academy, UWorld, and [1600.io](https://1600.io). They're all great resources, and they mention in their post another post in r/SAT where legal downloadable tests can be found.\n\n\\-As mentioned by u/Allupual, while making sure you have financial safeties, do make sure you can see yourself going there for four years (Or at least doing well there until you can successfully transfer), and that you like it.\n\n\\- u/hellaharper talks about it below, but: they got into a school usually not high on many people's lists, and were offered a ton of money, as well as great dorms and a hella cool exchange program/ Financial safeties can offer you more than an \"elite\" school might.\n\n\\-It's mentioned more than a few times overall, but don't forget to really dig into the difference between the ACT and SAT, and don't assume the SAT is the default. The ACT curve is less harsh, and there is a good chance you may do much better on it.\n\n\\-Last things, as talked about by u/Petrol_Oil below: breathe. Shoot for the moon if you can, but make sure you shooting for something you can realistically land on. This process is completely nonsensical, especially once you start looking at schools whose acceptance rate dip below \\~40%.\n\n\\-Also, as they say: work hard on your apps, of course, but don't throw so much of yourself into them that you resurface some time later to find high school's passed you by. Some people are perfectly fine with that, but make sure you get a chance to make that choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegardless of how it all turns out, good luck, you guys. I believe in you, and this entire subreddit has got your back.\n\n&#x200B;",

Keep trying.  \"Attain that grain\", as you kids say.  But also, try to have a little fun along the way.",

            "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am currently a student at a pretty good LAC who due to a variety of issues including health issues, financial issues, lack of desired major, and loneliness really hates it. I applied to transfer. I picked 5 schools because that\u2019s all I could really afford. I just received my first rejection from Williams. I\u2019m going to bet that the rest of my decisions will be rejections because looking back at it I\u2019m not really a unique candidate. I had no idea what I wanted to major in going into UG and know that I do know it\u2019s my last shot to transfer (rising junior) to pursue that major.\n\nI\u2019m having a hard time getting over this. I really wanted to enjoy college and I know I am so extremely lucky to have gotten in anywhere. When I see most people else having a good time at college and getting what they want academically I feel like such a failure. I can\u2019t stop watching videos of people getting into the schools I want to go to and instead of jealousy I am so delusional that I still think I have a shot. I have a high GPA and am super involved but feel very listless. Does anyone have any advice on how to stop letting the college process consume them and just be happy? How do I stop romanticizing the college admissions process and start seeing myself as a valuable person despite the fact that my dream schools don\u2019t want me. This may seem preemptive but all the schools I applied to only take a handful of transfers and I feel like Williams\u2019 decisions was fair honestly.",

My parents are super anti-Mental Health; they're pretty much the anti-vaxxers of getting help with those kinda things. I went through elementary & Middle school with counselors and teachers begging my parents to have a ADHD evaluation, but they wouldn't budge. I started HS (which is actually a pretty good Prep school) with a 1.9 Freshman year, which only increased slightly in the next years. \n\nAlmost exactly halfway through junior year, I (without my parents knowledge) had ADD/ADHD evaluations done, and started taking meds like Adderall. That next semester (and about the same for 1st sem Senior year) I got a 3.6 UW with an AP and other harder classes, so things have definitely started to turn around for me.  \n\nDue to that 2.6 though, I ended up only appling to 2 local U's (which are pretty alright; I wont post the names bc I don't want to be identified but one is unnaturally good at basketball and probably destroyed your brackets :) ). I obliviously would like to do better, and figured transferring would be the best route.\n\nDoes anyone know what steps/activities/EC's/etc. I should do to make myself most competitive? Obviously maintaining a high college GPA, but what other things can I do to really stand out, like publishing research papers, work-study etc. Also, what school should I be looking at to transfer to? obviously it would be super beneficial if they just straight up didn't look at your HS transcript, like USC. Also, given a college GPA of 3.7-4.0, what place could I look to transfer to with those HS stats?\n\n(other info that might be useful: \n\nI'm committed to a private 4-year university rn.\n\nI haven't taken the SAT. I've only taken the ACT once and got a 31, but if it would help with my transfer app and if I can, ill take the sat/act again because I didn't study, didn't get accommodations and was pretty sleep depraved when I took it.\n\nI currently hold an externship which I hope will make me more competitive (Its a judicial clerkship at my states Court of Appeals)",

            "content": " \n\nLet me start off by saying I grew up in what I and many people considered to be small town. It was very safe, had about 100k people, not a lot to do but go to the movies or mulligans, and everytime I went to the mall or Walmart, I would always run into former classmates who I ignored to avoid having to exchange the awkward hellos. I was burnt out from HS and needed a change because even though I lived there since I was 5, I never really felt like I fit in even though I met some nice people and made some good friends.\n\nMy college goals were to get a degree from a school with nice academics and finally have a nice school experience. High school was pretty bittersweet and even though I've never been that popular, I was hoping to meet a nice group of friends consisting of 3-5 people who treated and care for me like family. And maybe if I was lucky enough maybe finally get into more of serious relationship with a special someone. I just wanted to have a fun and fulfilling college experience because I was a really homebody in HS mainly because I had no car and license and plus my parents are viet and hella strict so going out was never option for me.\n\nOriginally my plan was to go study International Relations at San Francisco State because it had the major I needed because I wanted to go to into foreign policy and what city could be more fun than San Francisco. Everything seemed to fit into place until my parents crushed my dreams. My parents show me more love than most asian parents do for their children but their love can be really clingy and toxic. Plus they're conservative, so they didn't want me to go SF because they were worried being around so many gay people would make me guy which is stupid because I grew up in socal. Plus they had a problem with it being so far.\n\nSo I was forced to attend UCR because there was no way in hell my parents were going to put me on a plane to SF. Plus it was 35 minutes away from my hometown too.I know that I'm an adult and should be able to make my own decisions, but it's hard when you're financially dependent on them. I tried to be positive because I was going to a UC and honestly I thought I might like it better because UCR was 30 percent asian and had way more vietnamese people compared to my hometown which was conservative and majority white. But, my attempts to make close friends became futile each time. I tried joining clubs like VSA(Vietnamese student association) and even got a big, family and everything, but my Big wasn't the best person for me and VSA felt too cliquey and I felt so isolated from everyone. I rushed for IFC frats and Asian frats, but I couldn't go through the hazing process for asian and got rejected easily from IFC which was no brainer because a lot of the guys are attractive in the IFC and I'm so ugly.\n\nNow going into my 2nd year I got put into a student apartment with randoms who are alright personality wise, but they are so fucking messy like left a cup in the sink and it started molding messy. I have no close friends that hit me up and I'm too shy to hit anyone up because last year I kept trying to make plans with groups of people, but they never had time and I gave up out of embarrassment. All the people who I tried getting close to last year just used me by taking advantage of kindness to buy them food and birthday gifts. The only time I get any social interaction is when people asking me for notes and help for assignments. I feel like such a freak because I just want to come off as a chill and fun guy, but no gets my sarcasm or dry humor and just assume I'm being serious and rude. Everyone seems to joke around with each other, but attack me for it when I try. I tried joining other cultural organizations like CSA or a pre law fraternity but I don't feel like I fit in either club. I've never been so depressed in my life until I came to UCR like I went from being excited my 1st year in the fall to crying late at night in dorm hallway because I couldn't believe my life has gotten so terrible in the spring.\n\nMy depression has cleared up mostly going into current spring quarter because I got my acceptance to UCSB. But I'm worried I'll be like UCR. I have no problem with leaving UCR because i'm already done with it honestly. I see no hope in trying to make close friends as pretty much everyone else especially those in my year have already established their own friend groups and wouldn't want a loser like me anyway. I partied and yack too much my 1st year, so everyone that knows me has pretty much already gotten a negative vibe and impression from me. Plus, I'm tired of wishing that i'll get better when I know at this point that as long as I stay at UCR it won't.\n\nI'm sorry that it was long and for those of you who read it until the end, thank you because I really do appreciate it. I'm not trying to kill anyone's mood with my depressing post, but I thought it was important that I give you guys some background information on my mindset. I just really want a fresh start at UCSB. I'm not sure where i'll live but I'm leaning toward the santa ynez apartments. I just want these last two years to go well for once because I'm worried that my worst fear will come true which is that I'll finish college with no real experience and no real close friends made. And that concerns me because if I can't make it work in college socially then how will I be able to handle life after college? Oh yeah also I'm coming in as a Global Studies Major and I was political science with a concentration in international affairs at UCR.",

            "content": "Hi all,\n\nNot sure if this kind of post is allowed, if not, feel free to remove.\n\nAbout me--I started college in 2014. I had a good time and got what I needed out of school, but I\u2019ve also felt lonely and made mistakes. Here\u2019s what I wish I could tell my freshman self. I know a lot of this may not apply to others, but I wanted to share in case it helps anyone else. Good luck to all of the incoming students :)\n\n1. You aren\u2019t having an existential crisis; you aren\u2019t taking care of your basic needs. Good sleep, good diet, exercise, social contact\u2014a lack of any of these things will mimic the symptoms of depression! Seriously, take care of these things first, always.\n2. A class cannot be called \u201chard\u201d unless you pay attention during lectures and put honest, good effort into doing practice problems, homework, and reading the textbook.\n3. Undergraduate classes are not that hard. A reasonably smart person will be able to get an A in most of them with EFFORT. If you are not doing well, then something is going wrong with your study habits. Find out what it is so you can fix it.\n4. When people say you have to choose 2 out of Grades, Social Life, and Sleep, they\u2019re wrong. You have to choose 3 out of Grades, Social Life, Procrastination, Sleep, and Wasting Time on Social Media and Netflix.\n5. There is nothing shameful about being poor; likewise, there is nothing shameful about  having your parents pay for your needs. Instead of pretending to worry about money, show your parents how grateful you are to them.\n6. Your new college friends care about you a lot less than your parents do.\n7. You need to wash your sheets, towels, and comforter cover. At least once a month.\n8. Buy a trash can with a lid and empty it regularly unless you want your room to smell like trash.\n9. Your apartment or living space needs a \u201cdeep clean\u201d every so often. Buy heavy duty cleaning supplies early on, and use them. Don\u2019t forget the bathtub.\n10. You should put pride in your appearance. Your outfit and surroundings affect your behavior. If you wear PJs to class, you\u2019ll act like someone who wears PJs to class. You don\u2019t have to wear collared shirts or makeup, but you should put in a modicum of effort.\n11. Roommates are not worth it. The privacy of having your own space is invaluable. Housemates strike an ideal balance between companionship and privacy.\n12. You CAN have long lasting and meaningful relationships in college. You can find your life partner when you\u2019re 18 or 38. The former does not make you immature or white trash. Love and companionship is underrated for young people.\n13. Stop drinking once you feel the effects of the alcohol.\n14. Don\u2019t take dating advice from people who aren\u2019t happy in their relationships.\n15. Don\u2019t be friends with people who don\u2019t respect you.\n16. The mental states of the people around you will affect you more than you affect them. If you spend time with people who are unhappy or anxious or overly competitive or narcissistic, you are much more likely to become those things.\n17. Think about what kind of career you want early on.\n18. It will all go by so fast, enjoy it as much as you can.\n\n  \nEDIT: \n\n19. Remember that any job will consist of the repetition of similar tasks. School is the only time in your life you will only be tasked with learning a ton of cool information about a subject of your choice. Savor it!",

            "content": "Ok I am FREAKING OUT and I need advice!! Hopefully this is the right place to ask. This is gonna be a bit long, please bear with me. Basically I'm wondering if theres any chance in hell that I'll be able to get into a good college.\n\nBackground info: I'm a junior with severe anxiety and depression and high school has been hell. I've spent my whole academic career suffering and because I've done fantastic academically/was always incredibly well behaved and polite, no one really took my parents worries seriously. This lead to me becoming completely overwhelmed by my freshman year, and I stopped going to school altogether. I stayed locked up in my room and was eventually hospitalized for my mental health. I finished 9th grade over the summer with the help of tutors, and from then on out my school day looked incredibly different than everyone else's.\n\nFor sophomore year I tried to reintegrate back into normal classes but it was too much, and I began avoiding school again. So what ended up happening was that I spent my days in the school psychologist's office working on my own. The teachers would send packets of work and books for me to read, and I'd teach it to myself. The only exception was math, I worked with some fantastic tutors, and for the first time ever I actually enjoyed math. \n\nThat lead me to my junior year, which started off with me working largely on my own, just as I had done in 10th grade. However, my parents found this private school that specializes in working with kids who have a lot of the same issues I do. I was accepted in, and after months of waiting I was finally able to start. That was 3 and a half weeks ago. \n\nFor the first week I did great, I went every day for the whole day, which I hadnt done since early 9th grade. The second week didnt go as smoothly, but I still went the majority of the time, even if I was an hour or two late. For the third week I didnt go at all, and now it's spring break. \n\nI guess I've always had in my mind that it isnt like I'm going to live to 18 so what's the point in trying? Except I'm going on 17, and still kicking. That fact hit me like a ton of bricks yesterday, and I went into full panic mode. Have I fucked up my entire life? How can I possibly get into a good college? And I finally realized that I DO want to go to college, I love computers and I really want to get a degree in computer science. \n\nIf the only thing colleges looked at was how well you did on your SATs I wouldnt be worried at all, the one thing I pride myself on is my intelligence/ability to think critically, and I've always aced any standardized test thrown my way. But that's currently ALL I have, and that doesnt cut it. I'm behind in the classes required to graduate (and that's not even taking into account the other classes colleges will look for), and the only extracurricular I have is a job that I just started around the same time I started at my new school.\n\nNow, my current school is VERY one on one, theres very few students so you have your own teacher assigned to you for the different subjects. You also get credits per productive hours spent on the subject, and the school can go through the summer, so it isnt only possible for me to graduate on time, but maybe even graduate early. As long as I get my ass in gear, that is. I also get my diploma from my local high school, and as far as my transcript is concerned, I'm still a student there, so I dont believe any college will be able to see my struggle unless I made it clear.\n\nSo I guess my questions are what should I do about extracurriculars? I never took the PSAT, should I? Will I be alright if I dont take the SAT in my junior year, or should I attempt to take it in the summer? I didnt participate in any extracurriculars in my freshman or sophomore year, so is trying to start now pointless? Have I essentially doomed myself already, is there any way I could possibly get into a decent college?",

            "title": "Columbia University - A Student Perspective",
            "content": "Hey guys, after reading all the pros and cons of different colleges I\u2019d like to share my perspectives as a student at Columbia, so I made a \\[another\\] throwaway to post \\[repost\\] this. Yes, I am reposting this to share my experience again. And yes, this is only ONE perspective. I'm sure not everyone would share my experience. \n\nI\u2019m a Hispanic female and right now I\u2019m a senior at Columbia. I was valedictorian of my high school and had a 2360 SAT score. I\u2019ll focus on the cons of Columbia from a student standpoint because I assume that you hear all about the wonderful pros of Columbia all the time through the college\u2019s own marketing, and that the pros of Columbia can be easily found on their website. I am going to be candid and open, and will honestly tell you guys what I think are the cons of the school, so forgive me if this is a little blunt.\n\nI\u2019ll start by saying that there is a lot of pressure to fit in. This is probably true at a lot of prestigious universities, but since Columbia\u2019s in New York it sort of adds to the superficial mindset of a lot of people here. You can always see girls holding their designer bags to class, and there are some snobs who refuse to talk to anyone other than people of their own race and socioeconomic background. Some people like bragging about how much money they have and what they spent it on, like casually telling everyone that they spent $3000 on a jacket or bag. Because of the high percentage of wealthy students here situations like these are more common than you think, and a lot of them like looking down on those who don\u2019t come from a family background like theirs.\n\nA huge draw for a lot of people who choose to apply to or attend Columbia is obviously New York City. New York is an amazing city because there\u2019s so much to do and it\u2019s one of the most vibrant cities in the world. But this also means that a lot of the students here like going off-campus with their own friends and doing their own activities, instead of participating in events on campus. This also makes the Columbia social scene especially cliquey, where groups are split by race and wealth. I guess some people appreciate this type of freedom to go off campus with their own group of friends and to plan their own activities, but for those of us who don\u2019t come from money a lot of these activities are just out of reach. The cost of living at New York City is extremely high. There isn\u2019t as much unity as I would\u2019ve liked because of this access to New York City, and it\u2019s really common for the campus to be quiet and almost empty on a Friday night where people are either out with their friends or in the library studying. Some people may find this scattered social life appealing, but I wish I had a tight-knit on campus community during my college years. There is barely any campus life because of the proximity of all the different ventures in the city, and because a lot of people simply do not feel connected to Columbia to participate in campus events/are too busy studying to care.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t much school spirit in Columbia compared to a lot of other schools and Ivies. Football games aren\u2019t a big thing here at all and many people just don\u2019t care enough to go to them (which is kinda sad tbh). There\u2019s a reason why Columbia\u2019s alumni giving rate is so low (13%), whereas other schools have much higher alumni giving rates. (Williams 53%, Wellesley 47% Princeton 46%, Dartmouth 44%, Bowdoin 44%, Brown 29%, Yale 28%, Stanford 28% etc. I\u2019m basing these percentages on  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/schifrin/2014/03/27/the-50-top-roi-colleges-2014-the-grateful-grads-index/#753dc6b140d2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/schifrin/2014/03/27/the-50-top-roi-colleges-2014-the-grateful-grads-index/#753dc6b140d2)  which is a few years back but the numbers remain relatively the same today) The Columbia alumni reunions are barely attended compared to a lot of other schools too. I think a large part of this is again traced back to the fact how New York basically becomes a part of the students\u2019 social life here, so students and graduates don\u2019t feel much of a connection to the school itself to really have much school spirit or school love for Columbia. Also, students just don\u2019t seem to be that happy at Columbia, if I\u2019m being very honest, so they may have just not really enjoyed their Columbia experience to give back.\n\nThe stress levels of the students here seem to always be at an all-time high. So many people are falling into depression because of the school and the academics, and when I see people walking around campus I don\u2019t see much happiness or enthusiasm. Everything is a competition because there are only so many high grades awarded in a class. People literally hope that other students fail in the class just so they can get a leg up. Obviously students are going to experience stress at top colleges with rigorous academics, but the stress levels at Columbia are just absolutely insane, and the Core Curriculum adds to it. I\u2019ve cried from time to time when it\u2019s 4am, and when I\u2019m cold and alone trying to finish up a million papers and studying for midterms or finals. There have been classmates of mine who fell into depression and simply dropped out or transferred out of Columbia. The stress really gets to almost all of the students here and depression is typical. The city fuels this stress too. Columbia\u2019s atmosphere is crazily intense, and it\u2019s very, very, depressing.\n\n[http://nypost.com/2017/02/02/suicide-wave-grips-columbia/](http://nypost.com/2017/02/02/suicide-wave-grips-columbia/)\n\nHere are some more links for more insights into life at Columbia.\n\n[https://www.vice.com/en\\_us/article/going-to-an-ivy-league-school-sucks-400](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/going-to-an-ivy-league-school-sucks-400)\n\n[http://features.columbiaspectator.com/eye/2015/10/22/a-shout-in-the-darkness/](http://features.columbiaspectator.com/eye/2015/10/22/a-shout-in-the-darkness/)",

            "content": "Warning: hellllaaa long post ahead lmao \n\nHi y'all, recently I've gotten into Bowdoin, Middlebury, UCLA, and Berkeley, and I was hoping that the wonderful minds of A2C could help inform my decision. Here's some info about me:\n\nI applied as a Neuroscience major (biological sciences for Cal) intending to minor in Chinese. I'm a stem gal that loves science (neuro? ochem? astronomy? physics? *quantum* physics? bio? *human* bio? bops and bangers, period.), and I hope to go to school that allows me to explore and take a wide variety of courses both in stem and in other fields such as philosophy and sociology. Having a good language program is also really important to me, and I might even want to start learning a new language on top of Chinese. In terms of career, I might want to do something medical but honestly have no idea. Also, cost is not too much of an issue. I can luckily afford to go to a private university, but I'm a CA resident and it'd be nice if tuition leaned closer to $30,000 rather than $70,000.\n\nSome things I like: music/playing guitar (pls school have a good music scene and opportunities to jam pls plsss), skateboarding, streetwear, nature, good food, and people!! The people are honestly the most important part of a school, and I want to meet all different kinds of people from all around the world. Skool is cool, but I'm pretty laid back and hope to be a part of a community of cool, interesting, friendly people who don't necessarily take themselves so seriously all the time, ya know?\n\nYes, I know I'm choosing between schools that are basically polar opposites, but I just don't know what to go with. Ultimately, the thing I'm really struggling with is choosing between a small LAC or a UC, so I'd really appreciate any general insight into the difference between those experiences. As a preface, I'm from LA and have been meteorologically and culinarily spoiled in my beachy city life. I was initially set on going to a small school very far away (bowdoin was my top), but now I find myself backtracking and seriously considering the UC's. Okay, let's break it down:\n\n**Bowdoin**: Pros: I've heard nothing but good things about it. I like that it's undergrad only and professors are known to be fantastic and personable. The size would provide better access to research and other opportunities, and it'd be cool to pretty much know everyone. I like the prospect of being in a community where students are all so excited and passionate about what they study. It seems like the community is very collaborative and that people there genuinely want everyone else to succeed. I do feel like I'd benefit from having a school with such extensive support systems for their students. Stem is also supposed to be pretty good at Bowdoin and the food is *nice*. Portland also seems pretty cool.\n\nCons: Smaller schools usual appeal to me, but having \\~1800 students is starting to feel *really* small. I've gone to a small school my whole life and I've had a good experience, but having a diverse community is really important to me; I can't even imagine how many interesting people you'd find at ucla or cal, and I'm a little worried about general diversity at Bowdoin bc I've heard it can be white and preppy (but if the people there are mad cool, lmk. I really want to be wrong about this). Weather ain't the greatest but whatever. The campus could be better; I know that it's not really that important but I just wish there was more color, interesting architecture, or art around. Overall I'm just curious whether it feels isolating or not.\n\n**Middlebury**: Pros: Similar to Bowdoin. I like that it's a bit bigger, but still question the diversity. Language department and programs are a *huge* plus, and I love the international community it attracts. Not sure if it's quite as collaborative as Bowdoin, but still reaps benefits of being a small school. J-term and the ski mountain are also super cool.\n\nCons: Same as Bowdoin. Concerned with diversity and feeling isolated. I also don't know much about academics outside of language and environmental science, and I'm curious as to how they compare to bowdoin.\n\n**UCLA**: Pros: California weather, beautiful campus, big international community with every type of person imaginable, and also a big asian community which is cool. Basically has access or connections to any and everything in LA. Don't know much about UCLA dining but it's got LA food (westwood village? HIT me with that boba and mr noodle). Lotta things to do at all times. Alumni network seems like it'd be a plus, and the school spirit would be fun.\n\nCons: It's really damn big. I've never experienced being at such a big school, so I don't know how I'd feel about it. I don't want to get discouraged/lost bc of feeling insignificant, but maybe it's not as bad as I'm making it out to be, Classes will be huge and it'll be hard to stand out, but maybe the competition will make me bust my ass and work harder. I also don't know how easy it'd be to \"find my ppl\" in such a huge community. I would really love some insight into the big school experience. Also, as great as LA is, I've lived there my whole life and would prefer to change it up.\n\n**Berkeley**: Pros: Still California, UC diversity. It'd be nice to have Berkeley and San Francisco to explore bc Nor Cal has always appealed to me. I'm sure food is good, and the alumni network and school spirit are good too. Honestly, I know very little about Berkeley so....\n\nCons: I've heard that it's super, like, cutthroat competitive and can be a really stressful environment. Same goes for UCLA with competition pushing me to do better, but it still worries me. I've also heard housing is an issue and that you can get really fucked over with your classes. Oh, and riots. Not sure how often that happens. Again, I'm not that familiar with Berkeley someone pls educate meeee :(\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time!! I apologize for writing so much, my brain has stopped working and I no longer know what I want in my life so what do we do? type vigorously on the internet. In truth I know that I'll be completely fine and happy at any of these schools, but I want to make sure I make a well informed decision. Thank you all in advance :)))\n\np.s. I'm laughing that in the midst of an extensive and somewhat neurotic post I took the liberty of calling myself laid back....the college process rlly fux w/ you y'all",

            "content": "This may end up turning into a gigantic blog post but please, bear with me.\n\n Going through the process of admission for colleges, I can\u2019t help but feel I have been transformed into an incredibly disgusting individual who can\u2019t be happy for anyone else. Whenever I see someone who got accepted into a better college or one of my dream schools, it fills me with an indescribable hate towards them, but also myself for even having that emotion in the first place. It\u2019s seeped into every facet of my life causing damage to my personal relationships and causing myself an indescribable scourge of mental affliction. I became livid and temporarily cut off a close friend because he got accepted into NYU. I can\u2019t listen to Vampire Weekend, one of my former favorite bands, because they formed at Columbia university. Every single time I see a bumper sticker, college jacket, school mug, or instagram post of my crush posing next to Tommy MF Trojan with her acceptance package, I want to scream at a mirror. I know I am here because I didn\u2019t try in school. I got a 1490 SAT and a 3.3 unweighted GPA with an EC that any college admissions rep could see was a junior-senior summer last ditch effort to make up for 3 apathetic and lackadaisical years of involvement. I can point fingers at difficult circumstances like the tectonic-shift-like pressure I got starting from age three where my parents would tell me \u201cYou\u2019re gonna go to Stanford!\u201d , or how I had a rough start freshman year because I abandoned an incredibly tight knit sport, or how I sacrificed my academics for competitive video games so the one group that pitied me enough to let me sit with them at lunch would finally accept me. In the end however, it is all my horrendous decision making. I have made this bed and I get to sleep in it. I failed the Darwinian battle royal of college admissions and have nothing on my plate but schools reserved for students who are pathetic, lazy, but oh so affluent. I could have been so much more with the support and opportunities given by my incredible high school, my loving family, and the wealthy position I am mind blowing oh lucky to have found myself in. But I still screwed it up worse than Custer did at Little Bighorn. All of it. So yeah, I am bitter. I am a walking salt mine because every single time I see success I am reminded of my fiasco. I am envious of my friends to a point where I will let it demolish my relationships. I am going to crappy, mediocre schools compared to what I could have been. And I can\u2019t even say that I put in the effort towards it.\n\n Rant over.",

            "content": "First off, I would like to thank A2C for all of your love and support these past few years. You all have helped me get to where I am today, and I am forever grateful. I am asking for one more favor. The following are all my humble opinions, so please take them with a grain of salt.\n\nI am deciding between UCLA or UCB with Regents. I am planning to major in economics, but if I went to Berkeley then I would apply to Haas School of Business (30% acceptance rate). I visited both schools and enjoyed UCLA\u2019s \u201cwork hard play hard\u201d vibe, while somewhat disliked Berkeley\u2019s cutthroat atmosphere, less social environment, and largely academic focus. UCLA seems to have better sports, more school spirit, and happier students (mental health issues seem to be notoriously prevalent at Cal due to the extreme rigor). UCLA is much closer to home, but I am in-state so Berkeley isn\u2019t too far either. At Berkeley, I will have priority class enrollment, 4 years of guaranteed on-campus housing, and a faculty mentor. Berkeley arguably has more worldwide recognition, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me much. Even with the scholarship, my financial aid turns out to be about the same for both schools, so money isn\u2019t the deciding factor. Overall, I believe that I will be happier at UCLA and more stressed out at Cal, but have an advantage in terms of my career graduating from Cal.\n\nI would like to enter a career in business/finance or law. My dream job, as of now, would be to work in investment banking or something of that sort. Obviously there is better recruitment out of Haas, but I am wondering if going to UCLA over Berkeley will significantly decrease my chances of securing prestigious business/finance internships and job out of college.\n\nCould any current college students, alumni, or business professionals please give me some advice? \n\nI would greatly appreciate your wisdom. Thank you!",

So, I'm asking here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI apologize in advance if this sounds ignorant, but I've been having trouble getting my parents to comply with paying for college.\n\nI have college coming up, and the application fees add up to be at least $1600 in total. It's not much, honestly. Where I live, that's how much parents pay to buy their kids shoes. My parents have the money, but they'd rather spend it on their other kids.\n\nYou see, they don't want me to go to college at all. My mother especially is narcissistic, and she doesn't want me to be independent. She feels more powerful if she has control over me, and she knows how badly I want an education.\n\nI am only 17, and they wouldn't let me get my license, nor would they let me get a job so I can make the money to pay for it on my own.\n\nI'm not worried about affording college itself because there are programs for that, it's the app fees I'm most worried about.\n\nAs of now I'm trying anything I can to earn money, from tutoring to selling feet pics online.\n\nAnyways, my main questions are,\n\nWhen you get a part time job, do they pay you in cash?\n\nAm I able to get a debit card without a bank account?\n\nIf I earn money online, how can I put it onto a card to pay my app fees?\n\nIf my parents refuse to pay the fees and I can't come up with the money, is there something similar to FAFSA to help me out?\n\nAre application fees paid in cash or online?\n\nThank you in advance. Any help at all is much appreciated.\n\nEdit: My English goes out the window when I'm nervous and I'm freaking out right now. Sorry if this sounds rushed, desperate, or annoying.",

My GPA is approximately in the 2.5 range. However, while I have not taken the SAT yet (I\u2019ll be taking it next month), my Pre-SAT score was in the top percentages in my school. Furthermore, I have a huge amount of extracurricular experience that I\u2019m hoping to use to my advantage (being one of the leads and managers on several music teams, and the founder of one of them, as well as having worked as a musician on a couple indie games and at least two fairly popular internet webcomics. Not only that, but I used to go on church mission trips and I have been participating in school plays for half of my school career). How much do you think this kind of stuff will matter to the college I hope to apply to (especially since I\u2019ll be majoring in music, which most of that stuff is relevant to)? On top of all of this, I have some circumstances to help explain my \u201csenioritis,\u201d including recent homelessness, a stressful job (which I have managed to hold for more than a year, for the record), a broken home with my mom\u2019s bf being fairly abusive, and on top of all that, my biological father died just a few months ago. Obviously, it\u2019s been a rough year. Do you believe that those extracurricular and personal projects, as well as those tough circumstances, might together outweigh at least a little bit of my bad grades and GPA? I\u2019m not trying to get into a crazy competitive college (the acceptance rate is above 80%), but the average GPA for it is above 3.0. My dad was in the Navy so my college tuition will be paid by a hazelwood fund, so money isn\u2019t an issue here. Any advice or suggestions would be really great.",

I'm feeling really bad about it, but I knew the odds going in (2% acceptance for internationals) and I know that I did my best. It made me wonder though, since Stanford has similar acceptance rates for undergraduate admission, should I apply to Stanford EA or focus on somewhere more realistic? I'm posting my stats just to get a sense of where I stand relative to everyone else in my position. I'm an international, just starting my senior year btw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nACT: 35C, 36M 36E 36S 30R (I suck at reading)\n\nGrades: 41/42 IB 11th grade final score, class rank 1 for the year (we don't have GPA), pretty good before that too but this year was my  best\n\nClasses: (I'm doing the IB diploma) Math Physics Chemistry HL, Literature Economics French B SL\n\nExtracurriculars: \n\n1. Debating: I am fortunate to go to a school with a very strong debate team. After many years of trying out, I made it to the A team, and in the last three years I have won many national tournaments, either as part of a team or individually (I'm from India btw). Last year I went to a really big international debate tournament in Europe, and my team came 3rd out of over 30 teams (some of which were national teams). I also have the responsibility of training the debate society, along with the other 3 members of the A team.\n2. Coding: I started programming when I was in middle school, and I completely fell in love with it. The strong CS is kind of why I wanted to go to Stanford. I have a GitHub page full of random projects, mostly mathematical visualisations and stuff like that. Lots of games too. Not much useful stuff, sadly. In terms of actual work, I made an information portal for my school where announcements are posted. I did an internship in Chennai with a big data science company, and am currently writing a research paper on neural networks with them. My dream is to one day become an AI researcher, and machine learning is probably my favourite area of computer science right now.\n3. Mathematics: This is the thing I love more than anything else. My math grades have always been perfect (sometimes at the expense of all others). I read lots of books about math, and I spend a lot of time solving problems and learning stuff outside the classroom. My main concern is that I don't really have a way of quantifying my knowledge in mathematics. In my school, there's basically no competition math, and to be honest I didn't even know math contests existed until last year. My math teacher, who I have a really good relationship with, sent me for a fairly big national contest, along with a senior of mine. I won a bronze medal out of 100 people, but the competition wasn't that prestigious, nowhere near the level of the IMO. However, I do know a fair bit about math, and I bet I could write some nice essays on it.\n4. Music: This is the other thing I'm obsessed with. I've played the piano since I was a child, and I've reached a high level of certification in it. I've performed with the school band and been for a few competitions, but mostly I just play for fun. I have a few original compositions, and I'm planning on uploading them to YouTube just to see what happens. I've been playing the guitar for the last 2 or 3 years, and I'm writing songs on it as well. Music isn't really an extracurricular tbh, it's more of a coping mechanism for stress.\n5. My non-profit organisation: I started a cool thing with a friend of mine from school. It's a website that allows people who can't afford/don't have access to digital marketing to upload information about their small businesses. The platform is modelled after social media, with sorting by category (furniture, art etc). I coded the website, and I guess I'm co-CEO? Our aim is to have 100 businesses on the site by July.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm an Indian male, my parents aren't poor, and my life has mostly been pretty tragedy free, which I'm very happy about. I have no hooks, is what I'm trying to say.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason I wrote this post is to get some perspective. I want to know if I'm going in the right direction, and if I stand a chance.

            "content": "**Tl;dr at the end.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m not good at talking about my feelings, so I\u2019ll just type everything out. I\u2019d appreciate it very much if you read till the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m in my senior year at an international high school in Asia and this year has been a mess on so many levels. It all started with the college application process. My high school is hyper-competitive (and I really do mean it) and we usually send a lot of students to top colleges in the US/UK and Canada to a lesser extent. As such, senior year was going to be very stressful anyways. What made it worse was that our college counselor is not good at her job. Our school has kept her for many years despite getting tons of complaints from parents and students about her inefficiency. She has ridiculous internal deadlines (The UK university application deadline is the 15th of January but she sent all of ours on the 14th of December \u201cto ensure that \\[she has\\] a stress-free holiday with \\[her\\] family.\u201d The head of school allowed us to submit it after the counsellor\u2019s deadline, but the counselor was adamant that she had to have our essays in by the evening of 14th December or she wouldn\u2019t send our documents to universities. This led me (and other students) to write our entire UK university personal statement in like 2 hours. To be fair, this was partly also due to time mismanagement on our sides, but the fact that the counselor has such stupid rules irks a lot of students. Also, our counselor imposed a new limit of 11 university applications this year. My family and I had started planning for university since sophomore year, and I had a list of 21 universities. I was forced to cut this down to 11 universities literally a month before I submitted my ED application, leading to even more stress. She also said that she guarantees her job I will get into one of my top three university choices because she believes \u201cmy application is that strong\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy top three choices were T10s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I told her that international students\u2019 acceptance rates are very low, she said that those are \u201cjust rumours\u201d, despite many universities\u2019 admissions statistics proving otherwise (check MIT\u2019s admissions page, very large disparity between domestic and international acceptance rate). It was things like this that heightened my stress, and after I got rejected from Duke ED (where I was led to believe I had a solid shot), I lost all hope. I had IB mock exams after Christmas break, and I took those with like 4 days of revision because I genuinely couldn\u2019t bring myself to do anything at all during Christmas break. On my mocks, I was 6 points off my predicted score, which is a worrying difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started feeling better gradually until March. After I got rejected by most of my other universities in March, I was incredibly fortunate to get into a T30 in the US, which I will be gladly attending next year. I thought this would cure my sadness, but it only temporarily made me forget that I was sad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am the kind of person who worries about many things. Some of them are serious (my college counsellor saved my Duke ED agreement as a PDF and accidentally sent it to all of my colleges online), but some of them are trivial (I was once worried about how Duke would react to my 690 SAT Maths 2 score even though I got a 780 on my second try). Consequently, it was only a while after I got into my university before I started worrying about another thing: getting rescinded for not meeting my IB predicted grades. I have been studying, but like I said, I worry about everything and there\u2019s a part of me that wonders how my parents will react if I get rescinded. I won\u2019t lie, the T30 I got into was a super-reach for me and I\u2019m surprised I got in, which makes me wonder whether they\u2019ll be less hesitant to rescind my admission if I don\u2019t get my IB predicted grades. Right now, I\u2019m looking at around a 4 to 6 point drop from my predicted, which is not looking good at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, other things had to go wrong as well. My friend circle has started leaving me out of their social plans (for what reason I don\u2019t know). I\u2019ve always been the quiet kid who gets walked all over by his friends, and while I am very aware of my situation, I generally still try to be nice to my friends (because they\u2019re friends for a reason, right?) For the past months, I guess I\u2019ve just started seeing how badly I\u2019m being treated by them, and I\u2019m trying to avoid them. But without them, I have no identity. I can be a loner in high school, no problem (we\u2019re only here for a few more days), but what will I do at university? I do not want to be the same person I am in high school. I don\u2019t want to be everyone\u2019s last choice. Now I\u2019m worried that university will just be a repeat of high school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere\u2019s this girl that I\u2019ve had a crush on for quite a while now, and people even used to say that we should date (we used to hang out all the time). We haven\u2019t been that close for a few months now, and I\u2019ve only just found out that she is dating one of my best friends. Granted, this was most definitely my fault. I was too scared to make a move (mainly because I\u2019m insecure af about many many things), and I never thought she would start dating someone else. It did hurt when she invited most of our friends to her birthday and didn\u2019t invite me though. But knowing that the girl I have a crush on is dating one of my best friends is a heart-wrenching feeling, and I wouldn\u2019t wish that upon anyone. It doesn\u2019t help that I think I\u2019m actually in love with her, and that it\u2019s not just a crush.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing that has been bothering my lately is my increased stuttering. I\u2019ve had a stutter for pretty much my whole life, but it was always quite subdued. Recently, however, it\u2019s flared up and my parents, who always knew about my stutter, have been paying more attention to it. Yesterday, I was telling my father something and before I could finish my sentence, he had left my room and started talking to my mother, ignoring me. Cheesy as it sounds, I was reminded of a quote from Diary of a Wimpy Kid: \u201cFriends may come and go, but family is forever.\u201d But when even your parents turn their back to you, who do you go to?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I got home from school today, I cried in the shower. Even with the sound of the shower, I couldn\u2019t cry too loud lest my parents hear me. I felt slightly better after crying, but I\u2019m still worried about all these things. Like I said, I\u2019m also super insecure so I always feel like blaming myself for everything that goes wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKind regards,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nG.R.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Friends are leaving me out, which makes me feel bad. This is made worse when I find out the girl I have a crush on is dating one of my best friends. My parents also don\u2019t seem interested in what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll continue letting people walk all over me at university. Any help is appreciated.**",

I personally like dealing with money because I saw all the issues we faced with money over my childhood.) My other biggest issue is that I am plagued by mental illnesses. I have major depression, anxiety, psychotic disorder (possibly schizophrenia), OCD, insomnia, Dissociative identity disorder (I\u2019ve never met anyone else who genuinely has this either :/), Bipolar disorder, General personality disorder/Avpd/bpd, and probably something else I\u2019m forgetting. I\u2019m tired all the time from the six or seven medications I take, and I struggle at school. I really want to be good at school, but I\u2019m normally very exhausted, not to mention my mom also has mental illness and physical illnesses, she\u2019s home bound too.\nAnyway, my question is- should I even apply? We have NO money upfront and I\u2019m wondering if I could get along with learning online by YouTube/video classes, and just try to work freelance, or would it be possible to succeed in the art world without a degree?\nThank you for any help whatsoever, r/applyingtocollege \n-Ruben",

            "content": "Hey all, I'm in a predicament right now trying to decide between attending SJSU as a Software Engineering major or attending my local CC (Diablo Valley College) and applying as a TAG transfer to Davis and retrying at selective schools like Berkeley, LA, SD etc. \n\n**PROS FOR SJSU**  \nSJSU has a great SE program with great job placement and getting internships is not a problem either with the location. Pretty much if I want to go to college get a degree and start working at a respected company it seems like a great option.\n\n**CONS FOR SJSU**  \nSJSU as good as the job placement is just doesn't seem right. I've heard a boatload on how it's a commuter school and how social life is limited compared to traditional college where the vast majority of students live on campus. Why this bothers me is I've never had much of a social life in high school and changing that is a monumental task only made harder if those anecdotes I've read about SJSU are true. Also graduating in 4 years for an SE student appears to be a difficult task which is something I don't want to deal with. Another concern is that the school might be a job factory. I want to do research in college but not going to a UC puts a damper over those plans. SJSU has a partnership with NASA for some summer research internships but that's it. The school itself apparently doesn't do much research. Price is also a concern to me. $30k a year (including boarding) sounds insane especially when compared to some other schools. \n\n**PROS FOR CC**  \nCC gives me a fresh start at mending the mistakes I made in HS. I can retry at some of the reaches I'd wanted to attend since middle school and the prospect of that is very intriguing. Also the TAG program seems like a gift from above honestly. It seems to good to be true. The fact that I have to get a 3.3 in some courses and I get guaranteed CS at UC Davis sounds amazing. Also pricing is significantly better.\n\n**CONS FOR CC**  \nEarlier I mentioned social life was something important to me and at CC there is basically none. Also I really fear if I end up attending CC it will just be a repeat of HS where I enter each semester in high spirits and brimming with optimism but eventually have that crushed after each test that passes slightly lowers my grade until it's something I don't want regardless of all the time I've put into it. Also I said I wanted to graduate in 4 years and if try to meet all the course requirements I may end up staying there 3 years just to meet them because of the lack of overlap in a handful of courses between some of the UCs. Also acceptance rates at schools like UCSB, SD, and LA seem even lower than the undergraduate acceptance rates so it seems the competition will not be any different in CC and I quite frankly don't know how I'll fare when looking at how I did in HS.\n\n**TLDR**: SJSU doesn't seem appealing because of course impaction and lack of social life but it has good job placement. CC gives me fresh start and the TAG transfer is an absurdly amazing deal however I fear it might be a repeat of HS where I underperform when compared to how many hours I'm putting into the coursework.\n\nThank you for your time and sorry if there are any typos I typed this out on a stress induced whim :]",

It\u2019s a good school, but no top 10. I got a yes from this school a few weeks ago.\n\nIn preparation for any outcome, I sought out a willing PI at this school (a few months ago) who wanted to work in this subfield, came up with my own research project that I\u2019m pretty excited for, and submitted a few grant applications as I was told they didn\u2019t have funding for my particular project. Along the way, this PI became really excited about my project, too, and is willing to support me regardless of the grant outcome. In addition, I wrangled a co-advisor in my current field who I meet with tomorrow who is also excited about my project. Additionally, I\u2019ve established a small connection with a local company that is doing some pioneering work in this field for internship opportunities.\n\nI\u2019m proud of me! Regardless of the outcome for the other two schools (both very competitive top programs), I\u2019ve carved a path to follow my science dreams.\n\nPush for what you want, ask questions, influence others, and make it work for you no matter what the outcome is!

A methods project (programming open source software) and an immunology project (mouse sepsis model). My data was the main support for an NIH grant application.

            "content": " \n\nHello, I am in need of help and I'm not sure where to ask about this (I will be seeing the admissions officer soon). I would also like your opinions. Thank you so much in advance.\n\nI'm a 23 year old Canadian student, studying at a Canadian university in a specialized honours sociology bachelors program. I started school when I was 17, in 2013, but in a program I absolutely hated. My parents essentially forced me to go to school by threatening to kick me out (I wasn't financially stable due to financial abuse--but that's a whole other story, but will touch upon this later on in the post), so I enrolled into a program I thought I would like, but ended up hating it. My dad was very abusive during that year, and I was also in a very abusive romantic relationship. This is all in conjunction with suffering from diagnosed low-functioning ADHD and accompanying depression and anxiety. After my first year of university I had to feel my home because my safety was being threatened by my family. I took a year off, and then started and completed a 2 year college diploma from 2015 to April 2017. After that, I returned to university in September 2017 and decided that sociology sounds like exactly what I'd like to study after thorough research into it. I have been attending ever since, with my graduation date estimated at April 2022. Since I began university again I decided to seek help for what I was experiencing, and upon reflection of my first year of university, I realized that I may have ADHD. I have been getting help for my ADHD since then, and it has really shown. My first year of university grades consisted of two C's, a C+, and an F. However, the past two years, the lowest grade I've gotten was a B+ (gen eds), and for the last two years of school I expect to be getting no lower than A's, as I only have program specific courses left. My inquiry for this subreddit is regarding grad school applications, admissions, and the fact that it will take me 8 years to finish my bachelors. Will this affect my application? I believe that I could be successful in grad school because I have the ability to (considering my grades now), and an immense desire to. I love academia, and I especially love writing, as it's been my passion and hobby, so I believe I could do it, and it is my main goal in life currently. I'm worried that because it took me twice as long to finish a bachelors that it would affect my application and admission into a program. In Canada, most grad schools only look at the grades from the last two years of your program, but I don't know if they'd question why I took classes in 2013. I estimate that my GPA for the last two years of my program will be now lower than in the high 80's. I will also be completing an undergraduate honours thesis, as well as have references from professors in sociology. I don't know what to do about this situation, and how I would go about explaining or justifying why it took so long. I feel extremely lost and I really need advice.

I almost completed a BS in biology, but during my sophomore year I had an accident and I ended up needing 3 surgeries and since it left me immobilized to an extent, i went into a severe depressed/unmotivated state which lasted way too long. During this period, I collected a set of Fs (13 in total, 2 of them are from incompletes) and 3 Ds. I didn't get kicked out, or put on probation because the semesters I got the F's I also got A/B grades in my studio classes (a different situation, but I had a great set of studio professors who were familiar with me, so excused my absences as long as I produced quality work)\nI was initially projected to graduate may 2017, but obviously with all those failing classes, I didn't meet graduation requirements. After talking to an advisor, she encouraged me to just retake the classes and take more bio classes to just finish up my degree. By this point I needed 3 classes to graduate, so I continued in the bio program, but I ran into the same problems. I didn't think i could do it so i started self sabotaging myself, mainly because I just got tired of everything (my parents are very strict when it comes to being the best, so they essentially refused to admit that I was failing and they didn't even acknowledge I might need some help through therapy or anything). To no one's surprise I failed and I just didn't care anymore. Eventually, I switched to a psychology major and somehow got into a psych research lab. I actually enjoy psych and psych research, so I'm thinking of going into grad school for psychology and continuing psych research.\n\nTldr: I fell into a deep depressive period after an accident and grades took a huge hit, and I can't recover. \n\nMy overall GPA is 2.4 and my psych GPA is 3.5. Even if I get straight A's next semester, my UG GPA will be trash. \nAs for experience:\nI have TAed for a couple of bio and non-STEM classes.

I'm a 36 year old and I've worked in IT for the past 13 years since I completed my 2 bachelor's degrees (Computer information systems & Business administration). \n\nI'd like to pursue a master's degree (probably economics, but possibly public policy or political science).  I started going back to school last week taking undergraduate intermediate microeconomics, intermediate macroeconomics, and retaking calculus I (it'd been 17 years since i last took it) so I can take calculus II later this year. I'm prepared to take 1-3 semesters of classes to better prepare myself for graduate school and improve my competitiveness in applying to programs. \n\nI've been studying for the GRE and planning to take it next month and then at the end of February apply to master's programs for Fall 2019.  Unless I pull off an awesome GRE score (currently only getting 158 on v/q on practice tests) I don't expect to get into the programs at better schools due to both my low GPA from my 2006 degrees (3.1) but also my lack of math past calculus I.  If I did get into a program, like say at the University of Illinois in Champaign/Urbana I'd go straight into that.  If I don't then I'd continue taking more undergraduate classes at a local university in Fall 2019/Spring 2020 and earn a 3rd bachelor's degree this time in economics. During that time I'd reapply to master's programs after Fall 2019 grades came in.\n\nI'm wondering if having to apply multiple times is really worse than just waiting to apply or if it doesn't make much of a difference. My wife doesn't think it matters but I wanted more experienced input.\n\nI've searched online some for perspective but eager to get more. So far most things I've found indicate it's not a big deal.\n\n* [1](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/82098/is-it-bad-to-apply-for-the-same-masters-degree-program-in-consecutive-years)\n* [2](https://www.thoughtco.com/reapplying-to-grad-school-after-rejection-1685878)\n* [3](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-ok-to-apply-to-graduate-school-a-second-time)\n\nThanks!",

I'm devoting this spring and summer to my research internship, GREs, classes, and a potential research fellowship. I'd like to get into an R1 or an R2 school in the northeast (especially NYC or somewhere in Massachusetts) or California by the ocean in a city environment. I expect to have great letters of recommendation and thoroughly worked/advised upon personal statements.\n\nThe problem is, I have a list of schools I'm interested and I feel intimidated, anxious, and inferior. Should I apply to more R3 institutions or, as a last resort, consider more locations (even though my boyfriend/eventual husband is a business major and we'd like to live somewhere urban)? I have a limited income and would like to apply to a ton of places but that's not an option for me.\n\nI'm also considering paying for a tutor for my GREs although I expect to have no financial support from my family after graduation. It's hard for me to get motivated to do anything, especially with ADHD and depression, and I know I'll spend more time worrying about my GREs than I do actually studying if I don't hire a tutor. Is this a good idea? Do you guys have any suggestions?\n\nI'm trying to keep my head up because I know that I can handle a lot. I know that this is what I want to pursue, but I'm so nervous and stressed. I've gone to my academic counselor for help as well but I figured some people in this sub would have had similar experiences.

Also, I don't want them to think badly of me as people have received acceptances from most of my schools and I haven't, so I might have to apply next year and I don't want them to auto reject me because they think of me a spoiled brat who thinks he can get it because he has money. The truth is, I am really passionate about what I am doing and I willing to work work, TA and RA without compensation if needed just to get a chance to conduct research there.

I am applying for a Public Health PhD program, and was invited (with full trip funding!) to attend a weekend tour of the school/program with opportunities to engage closely one-on-one with faculty. I am beyond excited because this was my number one choice, so I feel like my chances so far are good. I am aiming to impress, as I have come up with thoughtful questions, have picked out my outfits, and I have become more eloquent in expressing my research interests. \n\nHowever, there is one issue that I am torn on. I have bright pink hair. My current  job works closely with children, and I find that it has been helpful in a classroom setting. Kids absolutely love it.  They are so receptive to the lessons, I am more approachable, and children are eager to engage with me because of it. However I am  not sure if it is something that might alter faculty perceptions of my professionalism and/or my fit for the program. The thought of changing it back to my original color breaks my heart, but a PhD has been my plan since undergrad. I have an average undergraduate GPA, great graduate GPA, and ok GRE scores. But bottom line, I do not want to rely on these to save me if my hair leaves a bad impression. I cannot afford any missteps.\n\nHowever, if my hair goes over well, then it would be a great way to stand out from the crowd. But regardless, its still a risk I would have to take since there is no way for me to know if the faculty would react positively or not. \n\nAlso, if its worth anything, my hair is professionally colored. I take very good care of it and my skin, and I coordinate my clothing/colors around it. So all around, I think it looks good. But it is expensive. If I go back to my natural color, it will be a long time before I can go back to pink due to hair damage and financial constraints. This is another factor in my hesitancy. \n\nThe school is in the southwest. I am not very familiar with cultural perceptions of modesty/alternative hairstyles in that region, so its a bit of a toss up. Has anyone else experienced this before? Any advice?",

Well I got into graduate school and I got offered the job.\n\nThe subject matter of the job isn't exactly what I want but it is the job I was hoping to get after graduate school. I also got into some really good graduate programs and despite most master's programs not offering funding, all the programs have given me scholarships (probably because I'm at the experience level of a PhD applicant but to do program management you only need a master's so I didn't see the point in doing extra school).\n\nMy current decision is to take the job. It makes the most sense because I could potentially make lateral moves into my field of passion. I'm just worried not getting a graduate degree will limit me. Engineering has always been my passion but I was talked out of it before college and when I looked to switch majors, they said it would be about 1.5 years more of school, so I decided a master's made more sense than 5.5 years of undergrad.\n\nThis is the case of too many good options and being unsure of what to do. I always assumed I needed graduate school to get the job I wanted, but somehow I landed an interview and got an offer for something I'm technically not qualified for (most program management jobs require a master's degree).\n\ntl;dr: Got into graduate school in my field of interest but also got a job offer for my dream job, but the subject matter is not exactly what I want.

I'd rather have the ability to stay in the city I like, earn a higher salary, and not have to deal with publish or perish, or the struggle to get on TT. \n\nSince graduation, at my current place of employment I've become more interested in data analytics, and I plan on pursuing this as a career path.\n\nI've taught myself a fair amount of Python to the point I'd say I'm \"proficient\" \n(Made a text-based adventure RPG with background images, music, inventory system, locked door systems, etc., made a script to automate and record file movements at my job)\n\n and I've begun learning SQL recently which honestly is moving along very quickly as it's pretty intuitive. \n\nThe thing is, in my final year of undergrad my adviser pushed *HARD* to take CS/Programming courses.\n\n I totally understand why, it's the future. The skills are in crazy high demand no matter where you go.\n\nUnfortunately, I had absolutely *0* experience with any programming languages at that point in time.\n\nSo I took a course in Programming for the Behavioral Sciences, focusing on MATLab, and a Computer Science 1 course focusing on Processing, which is an offshoot of Java.\n\nThe professor for the MATLab course is a brilliant researcher, but it was their first semester every teaching. Hell, it was the first semester the course was offered.\n\n It was extremely apparent that they were not prepared to teach the material to a class of students with absolutely no exposure to a programming language. \n\nShe would often quickly brush by or introduce concepts that were very basic, but no one had ever been exposed to before, as if we should have already known them.\n\n I don't begrudge this *at all* because when you know something very well it can be hard to take a step back and realize how much you have to break it down to someone who doesn't know it *at all*.\n\n About 4-5 weeks into the course she basically realized how above our heads what she was trying to teach us was, and had to reorganize her entire plan for the semester and put a huge emphasis on allowing us to collaborate. In this course, I received a B-.\n\nThe Processing course was a whole other nightmare. In the MATLab course, I was with other psych majors. The Processing course was entirely CS students. The professor was a nightmare. \n\nLesson plans were literally ripped directly off of \"practice processing\" sites on the internet.\n\n She had never used the language before and would teach herself how to do the projects we were assigned the week before assigning them. \n\nAt one point another CS professor had to come and explain how something worked because she literally did not know how to do it.\n\nSo I received a C in this course. \n\nI was also going through a rough time during this year. Many of my friends, and my girlfriend at the time, had left school, and I was feeling very isolated as well as having some family issues which definitely affected my motivation and ability to focus, but I don't like using my personal life as an excuse.\n\nAt this point in my life I pretty much thought \"Well, I suck at computer programming.\" and didn't make any more attempts to learn until after graduation. \n\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long and winding rant about my past experience. \n\nOn to the main point of my post:\n\n\n**If these low grades in these CS courses are brought up in an interview, aside from bringing up my later progress with Python and SQL, how should I best explain them?**\n\nI gave you guys my honest answer, it was just bad timing + lack of experience + poor professors.

Specifically, how (or if) I should address blemishes in my academic history.\n\nAt 16 I developed a severe drug addiction, dropped out of high school (as a sophomore), and spent the next year and a half homeless until getting sober at 18. I got my GED and did year at community college before transferring to a public research university. I struggled initially, switching majors several times before landing on political science. Pretty much everything I knew at that point was self taught and, unsurprisingly, I struggled in most areas outside of liberal arts--which my grades reflect. I finished with a 2.94 overall gpa, 3.9 last 60 and 3.8 major.\n\nMy stats otherwise, are decent. I knew I didn't stand a chance at PHD admission so enrolled in a masters program where I'm in my final semester with a 4.0 gpa, two publications, and a few conferences under my belt. My GRE scores are 170V, 6AWA, and 151Q (I plan on retaking).\n\nI'm mostly concerned with how to address my past in my applications. I'm well aware of the stigma surrounding recovering addicts. Even with 9 years clean, I am worried that it could be the deciding factor in an admissions decision. It doesn't help that the responses I have received so far have been mixed. One of my undergrad professors and my uncle, who is the dean of a medical school, suggested that I craft my entire SOP around my personal struggles and how they have lead me to this point. In contrast, my graduate advisor thinks I should stick to how my research interests and career trajectory fit with each department. Personally, I prefer latter for two reasons. First, I didn't get sober to be sober, I got sober so that I could live my life as a functioning adult and because living on the streets is a nightmare. Secondly, it just feels like a cheap attempt to elicit an emotional response, and that is something I would like to avoid. But then again, I'm also worried that I will look like an irresponsible deviant if I don't address it.\n\nIn short, I'm struggling to find a healthy median between the two and am looking for perspective, which I am hoping I can find here.",

My rapist was in every single one of my classes (due to the small size of my school), and I stopped going to class because I couldn't bear to be in the same room. I thought I could deal with it myself and get over it. I ate and drank heavily, gained 40 lbs, and hated my co-op, only caring enough to barely make it through the semester. Then, the fall semester of my junior year, a friend of mine asked me to take a trip to a graduate school fair, which I did on a whim. I ended up meeting multiple professors and graduate students who informed me that yes, that passive, extra curricular research I do in my spare time could be a career. Sure, I thought it was fun, but never thought anything would come of it. One graduate student urged me to apply to REUs for the summer if I was even remotely thinking about a career in research.\n\nI didn't like where I was at or where I thought I might end up after graduation, so I took a big risk in quitting my co-op (and virtually my chance at full time employment post graduation) and applied to REUs with a 3.08 cumulative GPA. I was determined to do everything I could to make it happen by reaching out to professors and learning more about their projects. I studied harder, exercised more, and went to counseling. I ended up at an REU at a Top 10 university that summer, and my spring semester junior year GPA soared. I applied to six extremely ambitious universities for fall 2019 with a 3.31 cumulative GPA, two D's, a withdrawal, and a 155Q/159V/4.0W GRE. I reached out to professors, set up Skype or phone calls, and even visited some campuses (finances permitting) in an attempt to make myself stand out and prove that I was capable.\n\nI received a lot of interest from POIs, but never thought I would receive an offer from a top choice. I'm so happy I've finally found what I'm passionate about, and what I've overcome. It appears the POI seemed to recognize my ambition and genuine reasoning for wanting to earn a PhD. Anyway, I've done a lot of crying and slapping myself to make sure today wasn't fake, but thanks to anyone who reads this. I wish you all the best, and never lose hope!",

            "content": "TL;DR: Made a social faux pas with a professor in my first semester. My initial supervisor and I had a falling out with her refusing to write me a reference letter, and vaguely telling me I had other issues with her as her TA. I haven't been involved as much in graduate social life as I'd like to be and only started doing so now. I fear that this is too late. I feel like I've left a bad impression of myself with the department especially with PhD admissions coming around the corner.\n\nI'm in my second semester of a one year M.A. program in philosophy. I already feel sort I've failed to leave a good impression of myself with the department. Although I finished my first semester with A minuses in all of my courses, I feel like in reality, my performance has been half-ass and maybe I just had professors who were very lenient.\n\nTo start, in the first month of school, I made a social blunder by walking out of a graduate seminar mid-class. I had an anxiety attack, and I felt that it would be best to leave. The professor for that class told another student, who told me, that the professor thought it was like a \"big fuck you\" to her. I later apologized to the professor and explained what happened. She was receptive and accepted my apology and assured me we were OK. I recently went to a dinner with her this past week and she was very nice to me; though I'm not sure if this is sincere, I appreciated it.\n\nNext, for a professor that I had hopes to be my supervisor, we had a falling out. As her TA, I failed to inform students with enough notice that I was changing my office hours. This resulted in some students attending the original office hours and finding out I was not there. My potential supervisor called this a \"screw up\" in an email and subsequently berated me. I apologized to her and held extended office hours on my own time to rectify the mistake. But ever since then, she had been very combative in her interactions with me. She refused to write me a reference letter, when I asked, for my upcoming PhD applications. She cited that my performance as her student was not \"robust\" enough. I was confused since I did end up with an A- and I remember distinctly participating at least once in every seminar.\n\nI was set to have an independent study with my potential supervisor this semester (a one-on-one class with just me and her), and that went abysmal: She refused to answer any of questions concerning my thesis chapter until after we've met up. She would then cancel some meetings with me without citing reasons. When I did send her another email asking a question about my thesis chapter, she would demean my questions as \"fairly basic,\" and then recommended me to drop her class so that I could take other classes on the basis that I needed \"greater faculty exposure.\" When I responded to her email about why I had \"fairly basic\" questions, I merely replied by telling her that I had finished most of the hard revisions and was having trouble with the minute details of my chapter. She sent me a very aggressive email stating that I failed to address her with proper salutations in that email--(note: the initial email I sent her had proper salutations, and though I acknowledge my response to her in the following email did not include those, it made sense to me since it was part of a conversational thread). She also said that I had other \"issues\" with her as her TA which she did not specify in the email. I subsequently apologized and ceased my interaction with her. Since then, I made a post about this and Reddit users recommended I find a different supervisor and drop her course. I did, and I have found another supervisor who I find more charitable with her time; it's too early for me to really gauge the direction of our relationship, but so far it has been well.\n\nThe problem is that I feel like I've already marred my reputation with the department. I've applied to the PhD program at this school and though my initial potential supervisor is not on the admissions committee, I fear the above instances may have soiled my reputation. On top of this, I feel like I haven't been as social as a graduate student. I've done the bare minimum expected of me such as attending class, and going to one departmental colloquium per week. I only recently started to attend an extra reading group. My justification for not being overly involved is that I was focused on studying. Other M.A. students, I feel, have transitioned beautifully. They seem to have been involved in a lot of graduate social functions and have fostered healthy relationships with professors. By contrast, I only seem to have really bonded with one professor in my first semester, and I foresee possibly one or two new relationships by the end of this semester.\n\nI guess I'm writing this because I sort of feel like a failure that these things have happened. I feel disappointed that I haven't situated myself well into graduate life. I'm also very nervous since the department is coming out with PhD admission decisions in the next two-to-three weeks and I'm not sure I have a good shot at getting in. I do have one reference letter from a professor who is directly on the admissions committee, but that's as far as my reassurance goes. If I don't get into the PhD program here, I feel like this will only confirm my thoughts of being a failure. Plus, I was heavily banking on continuing my graduate studies since I truly do want to pursue this discipline and can't see myself doing anything else.\n\nAny advice or comments would be greatly appreciated.",

I got an email from them to visit a month ago but no offer to fund the trip and it's across the country and in a remote area, so I passed on going to it. Also the same weekend my second choice (where I got accepted) offered to put me in a hotel when I visit. I'm slowly going crazy trying to find out if I got in or not. The other schools had less than a 1 month turn around from when I submitted my application to when I was accepted. A month ago (I applied January 1st) I was checking online daily and calling weekly, now I've just accepted that I'm on some arbitrary wait list. Graduate applications are just so much money. Visiting is so much money. I'm also going through the background process to get a job I want probably more than going to graduate school. I found out I \"tentatively\" got it after I applied everywhere which makes things complicated. Everything feels like a waste because I've been talking to a PI at my top choice since May 2017 and she told me to wait to apply until Fall 2019 instead of Fall 2018 because she didn't have funding for the upcoming year and she wanted me in her lab (based off my CV and our phone chats). I was just hoping to get in so I have a concrete backup choice if I don't get this job for whatever magical reason. If I got in, I wouldn't be spending the money or time to visit my secondary program choices. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Does it take more than a month to hear back about acceptance? No?

I often read in this community about students and applicants dreading rejection and thinking their world will be over if graduate school doesn't happen for them right away. I want to tell you all that you will be okay and this is not the end. Take your rejection and think about why it happened to you. Strengthen your application. Gain more experience. You can get in! You can do it. \n\nMy undergrad GPA where I got my BA was 3.55 (3.72 if you count the courses from community college that satisfied the general ed. Spoilers: most asked for the 3.55 GPA). My GRE? 156 V (73%), 152 Q (46%), 4.5 AW (82%). I'm 30 years old now. I'm telling you this because I was rejected 2 years in a row for grad school. I finally received an offer this month for a psychology PhD. I'm still awaiting post-interviews for a couple neuroscience programs. I kept at it! Those scores would not let me into grad school, I had to work for it. I've been in my lab since April, 2016, working on posters and manuscripts. I think this persistence really helped my application this year.\n\nIt's difficult to remain optimistic when you're told no and no again and again. But... we're resilient creatures. We're adaptive. Humans are amazing at problem solving. It's a temporary problem not to be accepted. If this is really, truly, what you want and where you want to be, keep trying. Keep working. I don't suspect it will be easy for everyone, but I want to try and shine a little light for those who feel hopeless right now. Use that beautiful brain of yours to find work in the interim IF you're even rejected this cycle. You're good enough.

I've worked 40+ hour weeks since my sophomore year (conveniently my freshman year GPA was 3.5 before I started working) and I've been constantly running off no money, no time, no food, and no goddamn sleep for all my college career. Obviously, when you're at school 7-3 and work 4-12 and doing work until 3am and then having to wake up 3 and a half hours later, it really drags on you. Maybe if I was a perfect person I'd get a 3.8, but I'm not. I was stressed, depressed, and tired. And i still am, as a senior. And I tried hard, I really did. I squeezed work in the 15-30 minute intervals between classes and went to class religiously -- but I still only left with Bs. Along with having virtually no time, I was barely able to get any research experience in. Wherever I applied for summer and winter internships, I wasn't competitive enough. And I'll add -- I'm never ever going to use this as an excuse because it's already happened, so now what's left is making a comeback, but I don't know where to start. \n\nI feel like it's all against me. I don't know where to go other than forward. My first guess would to be to annihilate the GRE, which I plan to do this summer, but what do I do for research other than a part-time unpaid position? What do I do for my GPA? How do I dust myself off while still being able to feed and house myself? I feel like I'm powerless unless I had the convenience and time of Mom and Dad's money and support -- which I don't have at all.  \n\nThey say \"go back for a post-bacc and redo classes\" but some people say that's useless and I should just go for a Masters (Assuming I even have the money for that) -- but a Masters won't even take me unless I get some experience in, and no one will hire me cause I have no experience and a crap GPA. I'm running in circles and I know there's hope but I have no idea how I'm even going to compare to other applicants , 3,4,5 years down the line... \n\nCan someone with ANY insight please, please help me\n\n&#x200B;",

            "content": "Hi everyone, so Im writing this post in the hope that it resonates with someone out there, as I am sure many of you may be worried and stressed about your applications at the moment.\n\nI was recently accepted into my dream program at two top notch schools(think one of the top business schools in Europe and USA). It is a joint degree program in management and business. To be honest given my GRE score, I really didn't think I stood much of a chance. My GRE converts to a GMAT score of <600 and after reading about multiple stories online, the general consensus was that the universities in question wouldn't even take a look at your score if it was under 700. I had spent nearly $3000 on the GRE and I had studied for about 8 months for it, so I was extremely deflated(especially considering my quant score was low) but I decided to reach out to admissions officers to discuss whether I should still apply for the program. Admin reviewed my CV and set up a Skype session with me to discuss my concerns, which is something I truly respect. The long and short of it was that they told me to not worry so much about my GRE score, as the rest of my application was quite good( in their eyes at least). \n\nHaving reflected on the admissions process now, here are a few pointers I would like to give to people that I think helped me. Hopefully this resonates with some of you out there.\n\n1. **You are more than a test score**\\- I think one of my main takeaways is to not let a bad test score prevent you from applying to a university you believe is the ideal fit for you. I think it really is just one component of the application. Whilst sites such as GMATCLUB serve a useful purpose, some of the comments can be extremely disheartening and are simply not true i.e. \"if you dont get x on the GMAT you'll never get in\". The truth is YOU CAN, obviously doing well in every part of the application is ideal, but it can definitely be overcome.\n2. **Show that you care**\\-  A major part of my success lay in the fact that I took the time to thoroughly review the university(courses, extracurriculars, news articles, reaching out to past alumni). I really wanted to go to both these schools, not just because they were \"recognised schools\" but because they offered a program that I found immensely interesting and that would help me develop both professionally and personally. In addition, both schools had values, beliefs and extra-curricular activities I actually cared about, which made it easier to speak about in my interviews.\n3. **Reach out**\\- Most schools want you to succeed, if you are uncertain about applying ask the admissions officers if you can set up a Skype session or ask if they can review your CV. It shows you care about the program and I think many admissions officers will take the time to meet you, or at least give you some sort of reply.\n4. **Highlight your achievements succinctly**\\- Try and quantify your achievements in a clear, short and concise manner. \n5. **You don't have to be perfect-** To get into well recognised programs, people think you need to be some sort of superstar who has a 4.0 GPA, has founded a company that was sold for $5m down the line and has cured some rare illness in his spare time. YOU DONT, trust me, I'm a pretty average dude. My extracurriculars are somewhat different and I've been doing it for a long time but I by no means have excelled at it, I think commitment to one thing is far better than trying to impress people with multiple things.\n\nI hope this helps some of you and gives you the courage to apply to your dream schools, trust me...if I can do it anyone can :) \n\n&#x200B;",

            "content": "I think I've lost the will to continue to try to get into a PhD program for Clinical Psychology. When I finished undergrad in 2014, I immediately applied to 12 programs and was rejected by all of them. This was somewhat expected, as my undergrad grades were not the best, so I set out to get some real-life research/work experience and decided I would try my luck again the next year. When applying for the 2016 application cycle, I applied to 10 programs, and was again rejected by all 10 of them. At this point I fell into a spiral of depression and alcohol abuse, isolated those that love me most, and nearly lost my job. Fortunately, I was able to get back on my feet and quit drinking after going through outpatient rehab. My experience in rehab increased my drive to continue pursuing my academic career so that I could help others like myself by conducting important research on mental illness, addiction, etc. I applied to and was accepted into a Master's program where I excelled and was working full time in a research laboratory.   \n\n\nAfter completing my Master's I was sure that I now possessed the qualifications, papers, etc. that would jettison me onward to a PhD program. I decided to apply to only five schools this year, trying to tighten up my applications and really work on making good matches with professors. I've now been rejected from 3/5 schools this year and I don't feel like my chances of getting into the other two programs are good. I feel dejected and lost. I've had this idea in my head for the past decade that I'm meant to be a clinical psychologist or psychology researcher, but given my results this year, I think I may be done. I just don't have the drive I once did. My depression and anxiety have increased, I feel aimless and restless working at my current job (even though I love my PI) as the research isn't related to my clinical interests at all. It's good experience, but I no longer feel like I'm gaining anything from the work.  My entire life, I was raised in a family that placed an immense importance on helping others, but now I feel that my pursuit of that type of career will only result in my continued failure and dejection.   \n\n\nHonestly now I'm thinking about getting out of academia entirely and pursuing hemp farming on some land I own back home.  I just don't feel like the time and effort I've been pouring into my current line of work is panning out. My father and grandfather have always been of the \"Choose a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life\" mindset, and I thought I had found what I loved doing. I love learning, I love research, and I love helping others, but I'm so emotionally exhausted now I'm no longer sure this is the correct career path for me. I feel like I've squandered my time, resources, earning potential, and sanity pursuing this dream of mine that will never come to fruition.",

            "content": "Hey Everyone, \n\nThis is a late post, but I kind of feel like I need to say it for those people who are lurking, debating whether they should even attempt going back to school...\n\nInitially when I came on this sub I was looking for any tips on how I could manage to get back in school. I was a B.A. poli sci major with an undergrad g.p.a. 3.3, and that's where my qualifications mostly stop, my perceived \"not a chance list\" begins:   \n\nI'm 29, graduated back in 2014 but really had no plan. I also have cerebral palsy, which has made getting  work/ employable experience really difficult. I have been trying various ways to get work and or experience for years, but nothing has panned out. Definitively stuck in what feels like an inescapable situation.  At this point, I know what I want to pursue (an MPA), and I know why, but I couldn't stop that negative voice in my head. I'm gathering my recommendations, all my materials etc, and that voice is telling me \"why bother?\". I'm keenly aware of my own un-impressiveness at this point and am very close to scrapping the whole thing. But I figured why not, and I applied to the only school that had all the courses I wanted, the accreditation I needed and the cost I was comfortable with...and I got in last summer! (to my genuine shock).\n\nI'm posting this so that others who may feel like it's not for them, or they're not good enough. Don't listen to that voice. Send in those apps, see what happens.\n\n(For those curious It's a nationally accredited, online, top 40 MPA program) ",

            "content": "Throw away account because I don\u2019t want any possibility of this story getting back to my boss or future PI. This is a very long one, buckle up. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI\u2019ve been in industry for 5 years after a MS in a STEM related field. I am one of 5 women in a 20 person group at a medium sized biotech company. My manager and I have gotten along for the most part, but in the last 2 months I\u2019ve fully realized that he treats me differently than my male colleagues to the point that it has been detrimental to my career and my future.\n\nThis year, I had a really cool project that I was very excited about and saw it as a great opportunity to grow my career. I kicked ass and, in my opinion and the opinion of my colleagues, I knocked it out of the park. I accomplished what I set out to do, and presented my work in two interdepartmental talks and at an internal poster conference. In August, the project priorities changed because of clinical results. For 6 weeks in meetings, when I asked what I would be working on next, I was told I could go \u201chelp\u201d my male coworker on a different project. Red flag #1. Helping out my teammates is just fine, but that was the only option that was planned for me. I was about to take on managing a 4 person team at a contract manufacturing organization in addition to the continued work on my year long project, and now I felt like I was being demoted. \n\nAfter our regular 1:1 meeting, I brought up how my boss\u2019 language bothered me and asked that he present it in a different way and that we have a plan for my work that is more clear moving forward. I was laughed at, mocked, and told to grow thicker skin. Red flag #2. \n\nThe grow thicker skin comment was insulting and impacted me for the next week. In a meeting that next week, I asked again what the plan was for me on this project. My boss sarcastically looked me in the eye, and said I could do \u201cinsert bullshit monkey job\u201d and rolled his eyes. I said something to the effect of \u201cI don\u2019t want to do just that, I want to contribute more to the work!\u201d And apparently this pissed my boss off and when I went to speak with him the next day, I overheard him complaining about me to a coworker saying \u201cNo Research Associate (ie someone without a PhD) should act like that!\u201d\n\nA meeting was scheduled by him for the following week. He had no clue that the \u201cgrow thicker skin\u201d comment was insulting and rude and broke basic management rules (management 101 - don\u2019t mock your employee when they come to you with a problem). He tried to spend the entire meeting going bullet by bullet through all of the times I disagreed with him throughout the last year. Red flag #3. I stopped him and steered the conversation towards his grow thicker skin comment and eventually I brought up unconscious bias. I told him very clearly that I think he has a bias against me as a woman. He consistently treats my male colleagues differently (I have always gotten told to be softer in my communication style, my male colleagues have not). He said he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s true, but that he\u2019d think about it. The chat ended on a positive note, and I thought all would be well.\n\nA few weeks later, my boss, myself and a male colleague were in a meeting. My male colleague flew off the handle for about 30 min arguing about something with my boss and I. After the meeting, I mentioned to my boss that it was an intense meeting and all he said was \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, he\u2019s just defending his work.\u201d Red flag #4. \n\nThe next day, I mentioned that he ought to consider how he would have treated me if I had acted like my male coworker in the previous days meeting. He said \u201cYou know, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been thinking about it and I just don\u2019t expect a woman to be like that.\u201d Red flag #5.\n\nBy now, you\u2019d think I\u2019d be aware that having this man write me a letter could be a bad move. At the time, I trusted and respected him. Overall, we got along really well. When he said red flag #5, I took it as a step in a positive direction. He\u2019s becoming aware! Or so I naively thought. Two months later, he wrote my LORs.\n\nFast forward into January of this year. The grad apps were submitted, my boss was really supportive of my goals for graduate work, I thought all was well. But when I got into my first graduate program (more on that below), he wasn\u2019t very excited and when I said how excited the PIs I spoke to were about having me, he said \u201cOh, they\u2019re probably just blowing smoke up your ass.\u201d Wtf? \n\nThat aside, there was another issue with our groups director. He doesn\u2019t think I work full time, and it has been brought up multiple times to my boss who has communicated the concern to me. I put in my time, I work my ass off. I have no clue how he got that impression. I have biweekly meetings with the director, and he said to me \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in the lack of progress on your project\u201d - to which he was referring to my year long project that I switched off of for TWO MONTHS due to business reasons. Of course there was no progress. He\u2019s so out of touch, it\u2019s ridiculous. I set the record straight and went to my boss to express my concern with the director\u2019s lack of awareness about my work.\n\nIn this meeting, my boss proceeded to shit all over my work from the last year and alluded that I was lazy and that I lacked motivation. He asked me in the meanest tone \u201cOn a scale from 1 to 10, how hard do you think you REALLY worked last year?!\u201d I defended myself, and left that meeting seething with anger. I then had the thought about my letters and the recommendation he gave me. The next day, he apologized for being an asshole, cool. I asked him if I should be concerned about my LOR, and he said \u201cno, I would never do that.\u201d Meaning he would have told me if the letter was going to be negative. Ok, cool. He\u2019s an asshole but not that much of an asshole. \n\nDuring my meeting with our HR rep to discuss my departure (starting grad school in June), I was asked if I had anything I wanted to share about any issues I\u2019ve had. I ended up telling her everything that I\u2019ve written above. Turns out, this was taken as a bias complaint and escalated to an official investigation about bias against me from my boss. Great!\n\nThen I got my compensation statement (bonus, pay raise) and it\u2019s all based on last year. I got shafted compared to my other coworkers. Everyone was pissed for me. I was frustrated about this, went to my boss, and he yelled at me that he refused to speak with me about it and that \u201cWe\u2019re done. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore. I have my opinion about last year, you have yours. We\u2019re done! Go ahead and go to HR!\u201d That is the last time I spoke with my boss. Lucky for me, I already had a scheduled meeting with the bias investigator the next day. More fuel for the fire.\n\nBack to the grad program that I got accepted to. Before applying, I reached out to my local university and said I was interested in a specific subfield. I knew no one there was doing the work I\u2019m interested in, but I have several reasons to stay where I am now for my PhD. I figured I could find a willing PI, and propose my own project. I did just that and wrote an NSF GRFP grant. By the end, the PI had tested me out and I had tested him out through this grant process, and I knew we were a good match. He was stoked about the project. Sweet! If I don\u2019t get into my top choices, this is a great option. Now, it\u2019s important to note that the PI was on the adcomm for my program option. I knew I was in. I got my acceptance letter a few weeks after submitting my app.\n\nBack to the present moment - I\u2019ve received rejections from my top choices (I only applied to 3 schools). I knew they were competitive, but given my experience and my stats, I figured I\u2019d have a good shot. I was certainly disappointed but not surprised to get a no. \n\nWanting to get involved with my future scientific community, I went to a regional conference with my future PI and his students. This guy is going to be an awesome boss. We talked about management style and expectations. Later, he was talking about the challenge of hiring female faculty members and the conversation steered towards unconscious bias. I mentioned that I was dealing with some of that at work, and he asked \u201cwith your boss? Yeah, I could tell by the letter he wrote you. What\u2019s going on?\u201d I told him the whole story. He said \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t tell you this, but he wrote some things that made me roll my eyes.\u201d I pried a bit, and he said it was a lukewarm letter, good things were said, but that my boss said I was difficult to manage.\n\nWow. Now I know why my top choices rejected me (most likely the shit letter) and that my boss lied to my face when I asked him about the letter. Fuck this guy. Had it not been for my awesome future PI and him being on the adcomm, I might not have gotten into any school. This shitty LOR also impacts my NSF grant. I have 6 weeks left at my job, I hope this investigation teaches this fucker a lesson. I don\u2019t think this post demonstrates my rage and sadness at what happened, I just wanted to get this off my chest. Fortunately, it\u2019s going to work out for me with my grad program. But, I could have had a shot at the best program in the country and now I\u2019ll never know if it was because of the letter. \n\nMen, pay attention. Check your bias all the time. You have no idea how insidious and pervasive this bullshit is for women in science and in general.\n\n*TLDR* My boss has a bias against women, I didn\u2019t realize it until too late, he said he wrote me a good letter, I found out that the letter was not good (some good things said, but said I was difficult to manage). He lied to my face, and could have prevented me from getting into my top programs, and might prevent me from getting funded for my project at the school I luckily got into via PI connections. HR is doing a bias investigation as I leave my company. Fuck unconscious bias.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThanks all for your kind words and helpful advice. The HR representative told me that she was looking forward to getting the \u201ctruth\u201d in her investigation- meaning that anything said behind closed doors (right where the bias occurs) will not be useful in this case. At most, my boss will get a stern warning.\n\nFuck that. I am seeking outside council for advice on my options here - one thing I did not mention as it was not relevant at first, is that my leadership violated the National Labor Rights Act when they directed specific employees to not share pay with me. I have a hard copy email of our group director disseminating this advice to other senior members. It has been given to HR, but I can file my own complaint. \n\nAs another poster mentioned, I have an option to file a complaint for pay discrimination under the EEOC. I will also be seeking advice into my options there. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it is worth burning bridges, as biotech is a small world. I risk losing employment opportunities in my future if I go through with something like this. I risk burning all of the bridges. People in my group may go to other companies, and complain that I am a troublemaker. This could be really bad for my personal future - ugh. ",

            "title": "A \"kind of\" Success Story",
            "content": "Hello, r/gradadmissions. I've been on this community for a while now and have read many posts, each inspiring me or motivating me in their own ways. First off thanks to everyone here. Literally everyone. This story isn't exactly a typical \"success story,\" but it is in its own way for me (at least for now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm currently in my final semester of undergraduate life at a school in Korea. I've been wanting to go abroad for my master's (and eventually PhD + post-doc) abroad to the US, but prospects were looking dimmer and dimmer. I wanted to pursue a degree in computer science, but I didn't exactly have the background. I switched majors to CS quite abruptly and that has negatively affected my GPA. I wasn't able to get any research experience either as my decision for graduate school was rather sudden.\n\nRecently, though, I've been looking into schools in my own country. I've always had a biased perspective (as do many Koreans and possibly anyone) that schools in my own country were subpar and that I needed to get into an American program. Many people around me - including my parents who are professors themselves - have advised me that \"you don't need to go to MIT or Stanford or Harvard or the like. It's what you want to do and who you do it with that's more important\" but they fell on deaf ears for quite some time.\n\nI was getting a bit depressed about the thought of me not being able to go to a \"dream school\" and that I'd be going into debt to attend a mediocre program. Fast forward a few months and I recently met a girl who actually graduated recently with a master's degree from a lab that a professor who I actually really liked is running. I happened to take this professor's course last semester (machine learning) and actually learned a lot in terms of theory and practice. I asked her for her contact information because it seemed like they were doing a lot of cool research/work and I wanted to ask some more questions.\n\nSure enough, some of the projects that they were working on fit in exactly with my interests (machine learning/statistical approaches to analyzing financial data). I immediately contacted the professor, telling him that he probably doesn't remember me but that I took his course and am really interested in meeting and discussing details about potentially entering his lab while I also pursue studies at my own school He didn't reply at first. I was getting anxious, but I decided that once semester started I would visit his office during his office hours. I emailed him before though just in case and he actually did reply and we set up a solid appointment.\n\nI brought my resume with me when I went to meet him, and he seemed impressed with my taking the initiative and at least some of the stuff that I've been trying to get going (e.g. I organized a study group/seminar for machine learning to study with more people rather than alone). He offered me an undergraduate research position on the spot and said that if I'm still interested in pursuing graduate studies then I could naturally transition and continue my research. Apparently I'll be getting paid and won't be paying tuition either. He also advised that it might be better to do a combined Master's/PhD program because those are (theoretically) faster and then I could go for my post-doc in the US if I still want to.\n\nI'll be applying for graduate school next month, and he said that he'll see that things work out as discussed and planned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I guess things worked out one way or another. Some things that I learned throughout the past year is that it really doesn't matter where you go to school, as long as you're doing something you're passionate about and the people you work with feel the same. I've also learned that as long as you're learning and growing then it's a good life (under the assumption that you're not starving everyday).\n\nI'm extremely happy about how things have worked out for now, and just wanted to share my story in case anyone in a similar position feels the same.\n\nGood luck everyone!",

You never know unless you try, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy stats + background:\n\n* B.A. in English (local university in Ukraine, somewhere in the top 90-100)\n* GPA 3.93/4.00\n* Rector\u2019s Scholarship at university\n* DAAD Scholarship for an academic and cultural exchange in Germany\n* Quite a few awards and certifications (contests, volunteerings, and a bunch of other stuff related to my field)\n* 4 years of experience in tutoring English\n* 2 years of experience in ESL Curriculum Development (freelance)\n* TOEFL 108/120\n* (didn\u2019t take the GRE cause I didn\u2019t have time to prepare for it + money is tight; that\u2019s why I applied only to 3 schools/programs, since they didn\u2019t require the GRE)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, here I am almost 6 months later, accepted to ALL schools I applied to:\n\n* Top choice \u2013 Ed.M. in TESOL (Boston University) \u2013 offered a 36k scholarship, will be applying to positions on campus\n* M.A. in Education (Villanova University) \u2013 no funding, applied to positions on campus\n* M.S.Ed. in Reading/Writing/Literacy (UPenn) \u2013 offered an 11k scholarship, will likely decline\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still can\u2019t believe that I got accepted to ALL 3 schools. I\u2019m happy, proud, and quite anxious. At this point, I can\u2019t afford it. This is a huge accomplishment for me since my confidence was pretty nonexistent at the time of applications. But still, being admitted isn\u2019t enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m desperately looking for employment opportunities on campus (can\u2019t work off campus as an international) and waiting for the responses from the positions I\u2019ve already applied to. This has been such a roller coaster of emotions, that I need to remind myself that I\u2019m not a failure and there\u2019s still hope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to wake up in a month to a letter in my inbox \u2018Congratulations! You have been offered a job/scholarship/etc.\u2019 and with a silly grin on my face go on about my day.",

If I\u2019m not accepted to the school with the late date application I sent in today, I\u2019ll likely request a deferral. I will then use the time to apply elsewhere and  hopefully widen my pool of options. \n\nOk so. \n\nI have done four apps. One is being sent in this week (I know. But they had a really late deadline so I prioritized). \n\nI was rejected from all three ivies which was something I prepared for but had middling hopes my unique story and research interest would make me a more viable candidate. I received a few emails from professors and faculty telling me how much they loved what I planned to do and felt my research was really interesting and important. This gives me hope and makes me feel like I\u2019m on the right path. Anyway. \n\nI expect to be admitted to CAU (you never know but it looks good) although no clue about funding there. The idea of an HBCU is really building for me because 1) I\u2019m a WOC 2) my research is focused on race and 3) it\u2019s centered around the very personal discovery and subsequent actions related to my race. \n\nI was accepted to a large southern state school, not really highly ranked in my field (sociology), funding options are pending. They\u2019re really seeming pretty stoked about me in general. I got an early admission, unanimous decision and personal phone call from the dean, and nominated for a fellowship that should really help with funding. Visiting next week for an accepted PhD student function. \n\nSo all told I\u2019m looking at ONE MAYBE TWO acceptances. Both are very far from where I live now and I\u2019m not totally sold on moving to either city. The school that\u2019s accepted me is in an especially undesirable location for my personal feelings. Not the biggest factor but still. It\u2019s a big long term commitment. \n\nLet\u2019s say I visit next week and it\u2019s just NOT for me. Not feelin it. Do I wait for a result from CAU and go there if they accept me?  Do I use what I learned from this cycle, wait a year, and make more informed choices applying again (potentially with improved GRE scores)?  So few HBCUs offer PhDs but there are more options. I\u2019m 36 already but I guess what\u2019s another year. \n\nI just feel like I shat the bed a bit and now I\u2019m left going wherever will take me vs choosing the right place for myself and my research. Sorry this is so long and rambling it\u2019s been a WEIRD DAY I\u2019m tired and my stomach has me considering permanent relocation to my bathroom floor at the moment. \n\nTl:dr - go with whoever takes me in the 11th hour or wait a year and shop around more?  Help me not ruin my life.  ",

            "content": "Hey guys! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little bit of my background - \n\nI'm an international student from a West African country. Went to med school abroad (not the US or UK) and graduated last summer with my MD degree. Always wanted (and still want) to match into a residency training program in the US, so I've been studying for the USMLE - United States Medical Licensing Examination since my final year of med school hoping to take the first exam (Step 1) this summer (July/August). It's a beast of an exam and as a foreign grad, the pressure is overwhelming to score in the 95th-99th percentile. Upon graduating med school, I didn't enrol into the residency training programs in the country I went to med school and also didn't upon returning to my home country. I did, however, spend 3 months in the US doing a clinical externship and that was definitely the highlight of 2018 for me!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK, now to the present. I decided a few weeks after returning to my home country to apply to Masters Programs abroad so that I'm not totally useless, sitting at home and studying for hours on end daily. It also wouldn't look good on my CV to have a huge gap after graduating without any clinical experience, work experience, or any other form of post-graduate education following med school. I was initially interested in Biomedical Sciences and Neuroscience, since they don't deviate far from my MD and they're subject areas I'm genuinely interested in. Applying to SciencesPo knowing it's mostly for political and social sciences was.... I don't even know, but I sent in my application.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to Wednesday of this week when I get the email congratulating me that I've been accepted into the Masters in Public Policy - Global Health! I know this school is considered an elite university for the top 1% in France and I honestly don't know how I made it! I'm just super excited! I'm currently waiting on the results for the Emile Boutmy scholarship which I applied for alongside the Masters Program. I also have an interview from EUR - Erasmus University Rotterdam for Masters in Neuroscience coming up in a few weeks, but I haven't studied the chapters from the textbook I'm required to study from for the interview. Now, with the news of my admission at SciencesPo, coupled with studying for Step 1 (there are 3 Step exams) of the USMLE, I've lost all motivation to prepare for the interview.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsidering my medical background, I was wondering, in the event I decide that I don't want to go into clinical practice, what career opportunities are there for me with a Masters in Public Policy? Has anyone here changed career paths from medicine to policy making? FWIW, I've always wanted to be an ambassador or have a significant role in international organizations like the UN, WHO, UNICEF, etc and from what I gleaned from SciencesPo's website, their students have opportunities to intern at the UN. That's exciting! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading my wall of text, guys. Keep your fingers crossed for me on the Emile Boutmy scholarship. And I'm open to any and all pieces of advice concerning studying at SciencesPo, moving to France, career opportunities with a degree in MPP.",

            "content": "Hey guys, I completed my undergrand in July last year (2018) and then spent my next few months trying to pursue my passion (music) and preparing for all my necessary exams to go abroad (the English proficiency and GRE). I am from South Asia.\n\nI was always an average student in high school but managed to grind it out in undergrad because I knew it was a fresh start and I could prove that I can score decent marks. Fast forward to three years, I had an average GRE (V157, Q161, AW 4.5) and I wish I could just retake it or hold my loo for longer that day and I'd have comfortably made my target of 165 quant. Anyway, that's the past and on me, I had WES evaluate my undergrad scores and they gave me a 3.7/4.0 GPA which I feel should be enough to get my application to the reviewer's desks to at least consider once. I check this sub everyday, grad cafe, edulix and some google searches and I REALLY WANT to go to grad school and want to do something for myself. I still live with my parents and in my country it's perfectly normal but I have an itch to go out and do what I want to. I spent a couple of months writing my statement of purpose around October and I thought I had real promise in that, and I still believe in it, I have spent a lot of time studying and understanding the field I want to take up my master's in (Behavioural Economics) but recently everything just feels stale. Maybe it's because I fell heavily ill for 2 months where I couldn't move from my bed but I still really long for that grad school. So far I have filled up 6 applications but only 2 have been completed as my teachers are taking some time with the recommendations for the other 4, but the deadlines are still at least 3-4 weeks away so I am not panicking. I have already got one rejection from LSE. (very ambitious to even apply but it was my number 2 priority.) The point of all this is that the LSE rejection has really put me off, it was my second choice and one of the only few institutes which actually had a full course for Behavioural Economics, I still can't find many master's courses for the same and thus my application list is more ambitious than it should be and which is exactly what worries me. I never got around a relevant job relevant to my field as it's a very selected field and my country doesn't really have a lot of internship or job opportunities regarding the same and although I have finally found relevant internships, I can't add them to my CV just yet and this is all that bothers me, a weak CV and a rejection from LSE makes it feel like the Statement of Purpose that I hounded for and worked day and night to create something that I cannot find anywhere else and discussed thoroughly with the best Economics Professors in my city and approved as great original and promising content from the same professors. (including those who I don't know) and before I know it, a graduate admission looks like a mountain to climb. I feel like after working so hard and carefully for the application period, I still don't feel confident enough, and to top off everything, I don't' have a job because my Bachelor's In Economics has little to no value in the job market and my internship is going to be minimum stipend too (100$ a month), so I am stuck with no option but to pay for the applications from my dad and I just don't feel right. Here in my country, that's always been the case, that parents pay for your education but seeing my dad not earn any money for 6 years (farming is tough) and still giving me a wide smile when I apply for colleges breaks me. They keep telling me they've enough saved for me to get a good education abroad but they want me to apply to like 10 more universities and I'm not sure if I should be spending another 1000$ of his just to get a generic reply to my application. I believe in my statement and I would sit down and love to explain it to anybody if I get an interview call but what if nothing works out. I have put in too much effort to let go at this point and I don't know what to do, I am just writing this here because I love you guys and how enthusiastic you always are, I really like this sub, I just wanted to vent out a little and I am already feeling better by letting all this out.  \n\n\nTLDR: I love every one of you.  \n\n\nThank you for reading this and take care fellas, best of luck for your applications, it's a long road.",

            "content": "I really made this throwaway just to get this out of my chest, because I feel like I might combust if I don't write this down and share it to someone. I feel like I'm always on the verge of an emotional breakdown, today being the worst.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off: I'm not American, and I come from a \"developing\" country. I'm doing work in the development sector, and my pay is measly (around USD400 per month, and that's being generous). I really saved up money to apply for grad school, and my angel of a boss was kind enough to help me out. She really thinks I deserve to go to grad school and that I'm ready for it, and I'm thankful, so so grateful for her. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have been able to take the GRE and the TOEFL (required for a third-worlder like me, even though I've been speaking English my whole life with ease).\n\nI had okay college grades (3.40/4.00 GPA), good GRE scores (162V/165Q), and I was only able to apply to 3 schools by priority deadlines because it's all I could afford. Even the fee waiver process for schools is a menace. Around the first week of March, when I saved up more money, I applied to three more schools, but that's past their priority deadline.\n\nI still haven't gotten results from the 5/6 schools I applied to (understandable for the ones I applied to just this month, really). I heard back from one, and it's seriously one of the best schools for my field (in the top 20 consistently), and I got accepted. But no scholarship. Not the first time (I applied before to another good school, and got accepted, no scholarship.) I tried writing a letter to have it reconsidered, since I'm also not eligible for loans (again, I'm not American), and if I were, I can't do it because I wouldn't want to drown in debt, and I for sure wouldn't be able to pay for the loans if I continued working in my country.\n\nI'm just very, very anxious, stressed, and tired of all of this. It breaks my fucking heart to think that I have what it takes to get to good schools, but I'm just too fucking poor to be in them. I know I just have to wait it out and hope for the best, but I'm just feeling so tired. So so tired. Paying for the application fees and thinking about grad school finances seriously trigger my anxiety and depression. And then I see fucking Aunt Becky cheating her way to get her daughters into college. I have to laugh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that was a ramble. I pray for the best and expecting the worst (probably why I'm so anxious in the first place). Save a little prayer/wish for me that I get a scholarship. You guys are great, and this sub has been extremely supportive to everyone. Just really wanted to let this out.",

So now that the experience has concluded for me, I'd like to share my stats and results in the hopes that they'll be helpful for others. Obviously there's no way to completely predict which programs you'll be accepted to, but this can at least be a starting point. I'm also happy to share my thoughts and experiences interviewing at these various programs for anyone who's interested!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Stats**\n\n* B.S. double major in Neuroscience and Molecular Genetics from an R1 state school\n* GPA: 3.99\n* GRE: 166Q/167V/4.5AW. Did not take the subject test.\n* Demographics: Female, American citizen, not a minority\n* Research interests: Neurodegenerative diseases, especially from a translational perspective\n* Research experience: 4 years during undergrad. Completed an Honors Thesis and had a first-author manuscript in prep. Published 3 literature reviews including one as first author. Summer research internship in Switzerland. After graduation spent 1 year as a post-bac researcher at the NIH.\n* Awards: Goldwater Scholar, Astronaut Scholar, ThinkSwiss fellow, a few others from my university\n* Misc: Lots of extracurricular stuff including Editor-in-Chief of an international undergrad research journal, and starting my own science blog (though to be honest I don't think this stuff mattered much for my applications).\n* Application: Put a lot of effort into my SOP's including several rounds of edits with various faculty mentors. Strong rec letters . Did not contact any POI's beforehand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Applications**\n\n* Stanford Neuroscience\n* UCSD Biomedical Sciences\n* UCSD Neuroscience\n* UNC Chapel Hill BBSP\n* MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences\n* Harvard Neuroscience\n* UCSF Biomedical Science\n* Scripps Research Institute\n* NIH/Johns Hopkins joint program\n* U Penn Neuroscience\n* Boston U Neuroscience\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Results**\n\n* *Rejected without interview:* Harvard, MIT, Scripps. Harvard and MIT were reaches for me, so not that surprising. I think the Scripps rejection was probably because I didn't take the Biology subject test, which their website says is \"viewed very favorably.\" Might also have been a fit issue.\n* *Rejected after interview:* UCSF. This one caught me a bit off-guard, as I felt like I had a pretty strong interview.\n* *Offered an interview, which I declined:* Boston U, NIH/Hopkins. I already had 6 interviews lined up by this point and these were lower on my preference list, so I decided to decline.\n* *Interviewed and waitlisted:* Stanford. I decided to accept another offer while I was on the waitlist so it's impossible to know whether I would have gotten accepted in the end.\n* *Interviewed and accepted:* UCSD (neuroscience and BMS), UNC Chapel Hill, U Penn.\n* *Attending:* UCSD Biomedical Sciences\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reflection**\n\nOverall I'm very happy with how things turned out. UCSD was initially my #2 choice after Harvard, and now that I've visited the school I feel very confident that it's the perfect fit for me, in terms of research, program culture, and location. Although I only ended up with four acceptances (a lot of my friends were accepted everywhere they applied), I don't regret aiming high. To be honest, I expected to get in more places than I did, since I feel that my application is pretty strong overall. Word to the wise: If a faculty tells you that you're definitely going to get accepted to schools like Harvard/Stanford/etc, don't take them at their word. These programs have gotten much more difficult to get into in the past decades, especially for neuro. No one's a guaranteed in. Definitely throw in a \"safety school\" or two.\n\nIf I could do it over again, I think that I might have applied to more Biomedical Sciences umbrella programs and fewer Neuroscience programs. Because my research is disease-oriented, I often fit in better with BMS than with neuro programs, which tend to focus more on the cognitive/behavioral aspects. Also BMS programs tend to be a bit less competitive to get into.\n\nI will also note that geographical location was a major consideration for me in choosing a program. My fiance works in the biotech industry and I'm planning to do the same after grad school, so I really wanted a program that was located in a major biotech hub. I also love being outside, so weather is important for my happiness as well. Luckily San Diego checks both of those boxes nicely.\n\nThat's about all I have to say! Happy to clarify anything or answer questions about these programs.",

I\u2019ve known I\u2019m going to go to grad school and be a scientist since I was 8 years old. I am an international in the US. I didn\u2019t go to a fancy school back home (india). I didn\u2019t graduate from the IITs. All I knew was I wanted to be a good scientist and spend my whole life doing research. One this I was tired of was being affiliated to a small, lesser known or unknown schools. It DOESN\u2019T matter - and I know that now. BUT - I was tired of being looked down upon because of that (the indian community works that way). So this year, I decided to only apply to Stanford, MIT, UPenn, Georgia Tech, Johns Hopkins, UMich-Ann Arbor and Duke. I told myself \u201cif I don\u2019t get in, I will work another year and apply for more schools next cycle\u201d. In hindsight, I should have applied to at least one safety school to save myself from all the anxiety when schoools started rejecting me. First came Stanford, then MIT, then Johns Hopkins. I had a great plan B, to stay back in my current lab and continue as lab tech - but I couldn\u2019t help feeling useless with all the rejections. \n\nThen, I interviewed at an Ivy League school. And then I got accepted! This had been my top choice all along! I am still to hear from other schools, and by this time I have given up hope. But i accepted at my top choice and I\u2019m happy to say I am starting graduate school in fall!!! \n\nThis is a bit of a rant - so here\u2019s some bullet points I took away from this:\n\n1. It\u2019s okay to dream big. \n2. It\u2019s okay to have had just one interview invite.\n3. It\u2019s okay to be starting grad school at 27.\n4. People will find ways to look down upon you all the time. One guy at work literally said to me \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of getting just one interview- you should at least have a choice\u201d. Screw those people. \n5. Believe in yourself - and try hard to be happy. I bought myself a ukulele in the mean time, watched a lot of movies, powered through my experiments in my lab, spent time with my family.\n6. No one is allowed to bring you down. Do not let anyone do that. \n7. I don\u2019t like to brag but I am secretly really proud to have come from \u201cnothing\u201d to an Ivy League school. \n\nFYI - Although I contradict myself by saying schools don\u2019t matter, and aspiring to be in a big school - I still stand by the fact that your grad school experience is what you make of it. To me, getting into a big name school was mostly because I wanted to prove to the condescending community around me that I have the ability to get into a good school, and no, I don\u2019t have rich parents, I got here solely on my capabilities. \n\n\nDisclaimer - this is a rant - I am just excited. Please don\u2019t mind. I would appreciate if you keep the negative comments to yourselves - and only project your positive vibes and share the positive energy with all our fellow grad school applicants. \n\nI would love to hear similar experiences and how you are going through it all!\n\nGood luck, y\u2019all!

Any help would be  appreciated deeply. I'll post on [r/Iwantout](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iwantout) too, for sheer volume, but might have over info here.\n\nI  believe that my degree may be the equivalent of a 2.2, but it's a  double degree BA/LLB from Australia and it was a six year degree. And  it's very close.  I am a dual AUS/UK citizen with plenty of close family  in N Ireland and Scotland (both place I have plenty of family to form  initial support networks).\n\nDuring my  degree I was diagnosed with bipolar II. It affected my 2014 study year  and I never really got round to doing anything about it because I was  focused on learning to manage it. It's entirely manageable today.\n\nI'd  be paying international fees and willing to pay them. Since graduating  in 2015 I've been working in administration, project management, and  pastoral care roles for my university, the ANU. I've always wanted to  get back into study and get out of the UK, after a recent breakup of a  long term relationship I wholeheartedly want to break out and pursue a  MA, take it seriously. I want to change career path and I want to change  location.\n\nRelated to my BA I'm  fervently keen on Public History and, or, Museum Studies taught masters  programs. Especially those at Queens Belfast and Glasgow University.  I've identified York and Aberdeen as back ups so far (sticking to cities  I have firsthand knowledge of at the moment), but am open to other  options as I search.\n\nI've begun by  emailing Queens regarding my degree, and I'll try other institutions  too. Queens is top priority. The course looks great, I love Ireland, and  I have access to free accommodation while I get settled about 20 minute  commute from campus.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* Will  this long double degree be read differently/appreciated? Most  conversion/equivalency sites I have looked at talk about 3 and 4 year  degrees\n* I  know this one has been asked, but how fucked am I with a 2.2? I don't  have work in the field, but have taken time out to work and mature and  refocus, could this be a positive for me?\n   * If not, would moving to work in a \"history\" related field for around 12 months and applying be worth it?\n   * Is there another way around? Should I do six months/year of a grad certificate to illustrate my seriousness/get better marks?\n* Are there other great institutions out there that you know that run great Public History, History, or Museum Studies programs?",

            "content": "Ok folks, I need some advice here. I know only I can make this decision but knowing everyone's opinions would help...\n\nMy situation:\n\n36 yr old (will be 37 in a couple of months) married guy, foreign national on a visa, no kids, living in the US. \n\nBeen working 10+ yrs as a software engineer, bachelors (from native country) and masters (from the US) degrees in computer science. I had been accepted twice into PhD programs in the past but turned them down, once because I was sick of being a broke grad student and wanted the money, and again because of visa complications.\n\nCurrently I'm making decent money, as is my wife. We live quite comfortably, we're on the market for a house and we plan on having kids soon. \n\nI've always regretted not going for a PhD before; I love research, I have a couple of patents and publications and I'm yearning to go back into it. I don't see myself joining academia at all, I'd rather be in industry after graduation. \n\nI know it won't be easy; our income will be more than halved; we'll have to move to a smaller apartment; we'll have to deal with 4 more years of financial uncertainty, we'll have to worry about being able to afford the best care for kids, we won't be able to buy a house for a while and the list of cons go on. I know my wife is secretly worried and disappointed at the thought of 4 years of stress, but being the awesome person she is, she knows it's my dream and she's encouraged me and driven me to this point. \n\nI'm somewhere in the final steps of admission to my dream program. I had a final round of interviews a week ago where I met my prospective PI and we hit it off really well. I can see myself working well with him for four years, so given an admit it would a dream come true.\n\nI should mention that the PhD will be fully funded and comes with a little stipend.\n\nDoing the numbers, I don't think I'm going to make up for 4 years of lost income on graduation. My current salary is pretty much at par with the median salary of PhD grads in industry, but of course I'm sure PhD holders have a steeper career progression path.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPast, current and future grad students of Reddit - what do you think? Am I crazy (and selfish) to put my family through this to fulfill my dream?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - 37 yr old guy making good money considering giving it up to go in for a PhD in Computer Science - is he crazy?",

            "content": "Hopefully, this post won't come off as self-congratulatory - I just want this out as info for those who may have similar circumstances in the future.\n\n**Background**: I didn't think I'd apply to grad school until midway through undergrad. As a precaution, I took the GRE in the middle of junior year. A year after that, I was 99% sure I would apply since all the jobs I liked required a master's or PhD. Right now, I'm 22 and finishing my bachelor's in mechanical engineering at NCSU - relatively good school for the price, but not the best.\n\n**GRE**: 165 V/169 Q/4.0 AW. I'm pretty sure I panicked on the first essay and got a 3, got it together on the second one and got a 5, and got a 4 as a result. I also missed the very last question in the quantitative section because I forgot to square both sides. Regardless, I was very pleased with my scores, especially with only one attempt. For those attempting the GRE during undergrad, I suggest doing it either in the summer or at the beginning of a semester, when you have nothing going on.\n\n**Undergrad Stats**: 3.589/4.0 at time of application. I was helped out a lot by my psych minor classes, my major GPA is around 3.1. Also, I went god mode my first year, which I think helped out my later issues with lack of motivation. But overall, nothing special.\n\n**Extra-curriculars**: I have an Emersonian deal about clubs and such - I tend to stick to very few things, but I all-in on those opportunities, making sure I do as much as I can there. Upon submitting my resume, I had two main activities that I listed. \n\n* The first was a community garden run by students at UNC-CH that I started going to my sophomore year of high school, and eventually stopped by sophomore year of college. There wasn't anything particularly special, it was normal garden stuff. Not the greatest asset to engineering, but I like the interdisciplinary nature of things. It also showed my commitment to things, I guess.\n\n* The second activity I had was a god-send, and was probably the reason I was considered by the big honchos. About a year ago, I got accepted to work on a new project started by a grad student - essentially, we'd be doing statistics/data science research using data from an API for a game. As of now, I am one of three people out of about 15 actually getting paid to do this work, because we're all awesome. I have now learned Python (Pandas, NumPy, Bokeh), basic SQL, D3.js, and some general knowledge about data science and good data visualization. I currently have two articles posted on our website which I listed as publications - they have a very humorous tone to them since I like writing that way, so I was worried about whether the admissions people would take that the wrong way. Hopefully, they didn't. The point is, this research opportunity saved me. \n\n**Recommenders**: I had my boss from research write a letter. He's a PhD student, so if you're wondering whether to ask a grad student or not, it's fine if he/she knows the scope of your work and what you're capable of. The other letters came from his advisor who runs the whole shindig, and my own academic advisor. They're all aces.\n\n**Other stuff that might've helped**: I listed that I spoke French at an intermediate level. Not entirely useful, but you never know. I also was part of a deep learning reading group comprised of people from my research group, where we read/discussed papers on neural nets and the like. Very informative and useful, but I didn't say much about it on my resume. I also am working on two design teams right now - a mechanical engineering design team, and as a mechanical engineer working with an electrical engineering design team. Very stressful, but good to have on an application.\n\n**Essays**: I'd like to think that my essays were above average, especially for engineering students, but not incredible. I wrote about my research, and talked about the deep learning reading group I was in in greater detail. Overall, I tried to highlight the highly interdisciplinary nature of my studies (and how I have no direction), and showed them how much I've ventured into other fields as opposed to mechanical engineering, in a soft way to excuse my average grades in my major. This probably worked out since I'm applying for robotics specializations/majors, which tends to be an interdisciplinary field. May not work as well for other degrees.\n\n**THE SCHOOLS** (What you all probably wanted to see and skipped down for):\n\nSome general notes: I applied only for master's programs, since I don't have the willpower for a PhD and I like money. I applied for mainly mechanical engineering programs, with robotics specialization if I could. A few programs were robotics programs.\n\n**North Carolina State University (MAE Department) - Controls specialization**: Applied January 15th, **accepted** \n\n* Notes: NCSU only allows you to be accepted to one program at a time. I turned them down in favor of the ECE department. While I like the major and most of my professors were good, the department's infrastructure and how they run things (particularly senior design) is so garbage that if I was a first-year again, I would've picked a different major.\n\n**North Carolina State University (ECE Department) - Robotics specialization**: Applied January 9th, **accepted**\n \n* Notes: First program to reply, probably because same institution. Will most likely decline. \n\n**University of Washington (Seattle) - Mechanical engineering, robotics concentration**: Applied December 15th, **accepted** \n\n* Notes: One of my recommenders didn't give them her letter until like February (she was very busy), so it took a little while for them to reply. Also declined, as I felt NCSU benefited me more than they could. However, they seem like a good program, particularly if one is into bio-engineering and the like.\n\n**Duke University - Mechanical engineering, robotics concentration**: Applied January 30th, **accepted** \n\n* Notes: Was very excited when I got in, has decreased significantly since then since their program isn't actually that great (relative to Duke's reputation). Also, Duke is evil and expensive. Will most likely decline.\n\n**UC Berkeley (M.Eng) - Mechanical engineering, robotics/controls concentration**: Applied January 7th, **accepted** \n\n* Notes: No funding, but still my cheapest offer overall since it's a one-year program. Very tempted by the offer, but not sure if a one-year program will give me the resources I'd like. If I were to go, I may end up applying for an AI residency program or something for the following year. But still a very good program, with good starting salary upon graduation.\n\n**Columbia University - Mechanical engineering, robotics concentration**: Applied February 15th, **accepted** \n\n* Notes: They had me do a digital video interview, where they ask you questions and you're recorded as you answer them. I'd never done one of those before, so my butt was sweating the whole time. I also said \"that sounds like a lotta work\" in reference to an obstacle I had to overcome during one of my questions. Very good program, with Ivy League connections, but very expensive. They also expected a decision today (7 days after I got accepted), so I asked for an extension. While I was writing this they actually did it, so I have until April 5th to decide. Still may decline, as it's so expensive.\n\n**University of Michigan (Ann-Arbor) - Robotics**: Applied January 15th, **rejected** \n\n* Notes: I'm like 70% sure the reason I was rejected was because I submitted my official transcript so late (literally ordered it the day after they sent out their first admissions). Not too disappointed since I have other offers, but they better watch out when I build my Death Star. They ruined my perfect streak.\n\n**Northwestern University - Robotics**: Applied February 15th, **accepted** \n\n* Notes: I was asked to do a video interview (Skype) with them, where they talked about the program and what it entails, and allowed me to ask questions. Time slots are only 15 minutes long, so it was quick and casual, no pressure involved. It's also a one-year program, but more expensive than Berkeley's. But since there's only 15-20 people in the program I'd likely get a lot more 1-on-1 attention. Still will probably decline, but a very good program nonetheless.\n\n**Johns Hopkins University - Mechanical engineering, robotics concentration**: Applied December 15th, **accepted** \n\n* Notes: I applied to them first, and they took soooooooo long to get back to me, I thought they were just going to never reply. I think what they do is they go through PhD applications first, and then offer admissions to the master's program to those that they reject but think are good enough for master's. Then they get to degenerates like me that don't want a PhD. Also very expensive program, but can finish in 3 semesters which helps some. I'm also a big fan of their open curriculum deal. Front-runner option, especially since they're on par with Columbia but they're not rushing me to make a decision.\n\n**University of Virginia - Mechanical engineering, cyber-physical systems?**: Applied January 15th, **have not heard back** \n\n* Notes: They offer $23,000 a year to a lot of MS students, so that's a positive. A professor there e-mailed (then texted) me wanting to talk, but it wasn't entirely fruitful since he was pretty much trying to convince me to go for a PhD. Still not a fan of their program (and they haven't gotten back to me), so I dunno. Will probably decline.\n\n\n**DECISION**: I haven't actually made a decision yet. Big contenders are Berkeley, Columbia, and Johns Hopkins. I've already officially declined NCSU's MAE department and Washington. The main problem is figuring out the educational downsides of a one-year program vs the crippling debt of a two-year program.\n\nI hope this may answer some questions or quell some doubts over whether you're \"good enough\" or what you should do to prepare for grad school. Everyone's circumstances are different, so don't do everything exactly as I did. For those applying next year, I wish the best of luck.",

I had a very awful semester in the first semester and the class wasn't the right fit and the topic didn't quite align as I thought. It was idiotic of me for not dropping it early-because I was worried it would reduce my credits and I couldn't afford the tuition if they would take away partially my scholarship. When end of semester came around I dropped the ball and didn't file for incomplete in time. \n\nI struggled through out the program because of personal issues. And didn't re take or had the mental focus to fix that grade because I could not get myself to power through the topic after time had passed. The rest of my grades looked fine. I had a withdrawn on a language class I intended to take but didn't have time for. I actually have another low-pass which is a pass but not a high pass for a class I did not submit documentation for. This was also from the first semester- my projects were fine and gave results but I didn't submit the write-up because I could not focus to do the non hands-on work. \n\nI eventually want to get a PhD as I really want to teach / become a lecturer and most of them require one. I do have some past experience teaching already and I have been good at it and my peers do agree. But if I want to teach at more rigorous places with more research resources, I need to get a PhD degree. I know I need more work and research experiences and prepare myself before applying for a year or so which I will. I just want to understand the general treatment of an F in a transcript from a master's program, and if there are things that will help compensate from that flaw tremendously.\n\nPlease advise. I got a master's from a school in the US and will be applying for a PhD some time next year in Europe. Hopefully Germany, but anywhere with low fee or/and offer stipend would be considered as well. I don't plan to settle anywhere yet but I don't want to remain in the US since it's been a long time living here already. \n\nThank you in advanced. I'm super worried...

How much does undergraduate GPA, letters of recommendation, research experience, community engagement, etc. outweigh the quality of the program? What steps should I take to improve my application?\n\nBackground:\n\nI am attending a medium sized state university for a second bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science.\n\nI was a dual-enrolled student and earned 2 Associate degrees at 17, a bachelor\u2019s degree at 18, and a master\u2019s degree at 20. My major was Interdisciplinary Social Science and fields of study were Public Administration and Emergency Management, Sociology, and Psychology for my bachelor\u2019s degree from FSU. I maintained high grades and graduated magna cum laude, with a 3.962 cumulative GPA and a 3.88 from the FSU.\n\nMy Master\u2019s was at Liberty University, something I\u2019m not happy about because I didn\u2019t do as well (3.44 GPA) in a much less prestigious program due to severe medical problems and family turmoil (deaths, changing environment, constant arguing, etc.). Furthermore, I only felt compelled to attend for family reasons, which only compounded my misery during those 2 years as I was seriously questioning the path I had chosen/been given. I earned most of these degrees online to work with my family to create a program that helps dual-enrollment students in our local community. As a volunteer since I was 15, I have tutored and mentored students in the ACT/SAT and freshman college courses. I\u2019ve helped about 25-30 high school students their Associate degree and 200+ students prepare for the ACT/SAT. I treated it like my job and worked on my school work during my off-time until very recently when I started working part-time as\u2026 a tutor.\n\nThe program is doing pretty well now, the family issues are resolved, and I am recovering pretty well (I lost 22 lbs. and I am still missing 10 of them). Since things are on the up-and-up, I have started to advance my career in my preferred field, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. However, I am out of federal loans and have to attend a local state university. It is classified as a Regional University from the South and ranked #107-141 from US News. While I am excited to finally be able to finally be able to create more meaningful relationships with my professors, I am concerned that the quality of the program will hurt my chances at a top Computer Science PhD program. I am involved in the university\u2019s undergraduate research program so that I can have more research experience when I apply to a PhD program. \n\nI wanted your opinions on the matter.

            "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster. I was incredibly lucky to get into a couple PhD programs this cycle, and I'm currently down to good two schools. The choice is weighing on my conscience to the point where it's always on my mind - and besides the stress, I'm frankly starting to run out of time to choose. Some background: went to an ivy for undergrad with a degree in sociology and ethnic studies. \n\nThe two schools are as follows:\n\nSchool 1: large, well ranked but not the Very Best\u2122 state school on the east coast for an American Studies PhD program. Much closer to my family (which is relevant not only emotionally but honestly in terms of money as well) and my close friends both from undergrad and high school. Cost of living is okay. Instant connection with the faculty and prospective students. An inherently interdisciplinary field of study, which is relevant to my work. Funding is about 30k a year, which is pretty good to live off of in this part of the country, but no official summer funding.\n\nAmerican studies is obviously a less \"popular,\" i guess, field of study. The program still has a very very good placement rate, all things said. \n\nSchool 2: large(r) west coast school for a sociology PhD, one of the very best in the country in its field. I will be incredibly far away from my friends and family, but of course I can make new ones with time. Hopefully. Connection with faculty also pretty darn great, but less of a perfect click. Less funding at 26k per year but includes additional summer funding. Cost of living is much, much higher. Has obvious prestige\u2122, and as far as the incredibly precarious world of post-phd job prospects goes, I'm almost guaranteed to get some kind of job post graduation. Sociology, of course, has slightly more rigidity as a discipline but obviously this isn't a turn off, just something to consider as I think about where my work will go in the next couple years.\n\nOn paper i think the choice is clear, but in all honesty I'm concerned about a. my mental health (grad school is no walk in the park, and having support systems is important to me) and b. money. I had a difficult time in undergrad in both regards, and I identify as a low-income student of color. Not first gen by definition, but only one of my parents went to college and no one in my immediate family has ever gotten a phd.\n\nThis got really long, and I know at the end of the day the choice is mine and stuff, but if anyone has any thoughts or advice, or has dealt with this conundrum  themselves, I'd appreciate any comments. I'm excited to have such a \"good problem\" but I'm so stressed out, yall.",

I have gotten a lot of good advice from this community, so I wanted to share my experience, so that maybe it can help or motivate someone else. \n\nUndergrad:\n\nTop 20 Public School\n\nMajor: Molecular &amp; Cell Bio \n\nMinor: Art History\n\n3.3 GPA with a positive upward trend\n\n3.4 Major GPA with a positive upward trend\n\n* There are some legit weaknesses in my transcript as I suffered from physical illness during part of my undergrad. \n\nNo formal laboratory experience\n\nExtracurricular:\n\n* Worked two jobs and a seasonal job. \n\n* Leadership positions in two different clubs. \n\n* Wrote and received research grant to do an oral history project. This was completely unrelated to science.\n\nI was interested in a career in science after graduating, but I was finding it difficult to get a position as a tech in industry. I ended up finding a post-bacc position in a structural biology lab at an Ivy League institution. I also applied to an NIH post-bacc, but turned it down because my parents live near this particular Ivy League institution. \n\nI realized shortly after working there that I had an interest in pursuing grad school. I was very interested in the link between protein structure and function and, in turn, became very interested in viruses. After discussing with my mentor and PI, I decided to apply to grad school. \n\nI took the GRE and the Biochemistry and Molecular and Cell Biology Subject Test in preparation of the application cycle. \n\nOn the GRE, after 2 attempts, my best score was 165 Verbal and 152 Quant. I was upset about the low quant score because I succeeded in Calculus I, II, and III in college. I did horribly on the subject test as well and did not submit it anywhere. I am just a bad standardized test taker. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYear 1:\n\nI started preparing my application in October \u2014 a little late, in my opinion.\n\nI had about 12 months of research under my belt. I had been working on my own project for about 4 months when I started my apps, so I didn\u2019t have much to say about my project because I was still optimizing a number of aspects. \n\nI applied to 8 schools \u2014 a mix of upper and mid-tier schools. I chose not to apple to any \u201csafety\u201d schools because I was advised by many people inside and outside my institution that name is very important in industry and academia. I applied to mostly umbrella programs or microbiology tracks within umbrella programs. \n\nI had four letters of recommendation. Two from professors from undergrad, one from my PI, and one from my research mentor, a post doc in my lab. \n\nI submitted my GRE scores to every school. \n\nI didn\u2019t get in anywhere. \n\nAfter reflecting (and speaking with someone at Admissions at a few of the schools), I realized that I was burned out from working so much (50+ hour work weeks) and trying to apply to grad school. My lack of motivation definitely came across in my apps. I had a weak personal statement. It focused too much on my personal journey, as opposed to the research I was doing. My independent project at that point was in its infancy and I didn\u2019t have much to write about. I also realized that I wasn\u2019t applying to the right kinds of tracks/departments to do the type of research I was interested in. While I certainly would have loved to start grad school then, I feel that I have matured a lot in the past year and the rejections from grad school were a catalyst for that change. It was hard to see the silver lining when I was rejected, but, reflecting on the experience, I can see it now. \n\nYear 2:\n\nI had a full two years of research under my belt with 1.5 years of experience working on an independent project. No publications. \n\nIn September, my post-bacc contract was up, so I decided to take some time off to apply for grad school. I figured I would know if I got any interviews in Jan/Feb and, if not, I could start getting serious about finding a job. I moved back in with my parents and got to work on my applications in mid-September. Being able to focus solely on my applications (as opposed to working a 50 hr work week) allowed me to be more motivated in applying. \n\nIn this time, I worked a lot on my personal statement. I tried to talk about my journey through the lens of my post-bacc research and the experiences I had in that lab. This time around my statements were much more research-focused, especially because I had more to talk about in regard to my project. I had a lot of people, including my research mentor and my close friends, critique and edit my statement, asking them to help me with my writing sounding professional and concise. I also personalized each statement for each program \u2014 I tried to highlight techniques, experiences, and intentions for research that were best suited to each program.\n\nI also studied for and took the GRE again, but ended up with the same score. However, in this application cycle, I would say only 25% of the schools I applied to required the GRE. I did not submit the GRE to any school unless it was absolutely necessary. \n\nIn this cycle, I only used three letters of recommendation \u2014 one from my PI, one from an undergrad professor, and one from my research mentor. My research mentor, currently and at the time of submitting the letter, transitioned into a new job where he is a group leader at a big pharmaceutical company \u2014 he said that his letter held more weight with this new title. \n\nI applied to 18 schools \u2014 again, a mix of mostly upper and some mid-tier institutions. I took a lot more time to find programs that were a better fit for my research. I delved deep into department and faculty websites. I looked for programs that had at least three faculty who were doing biochemical, biophysical, or structural research on viruses. I applied to a number of umbrella programs, but I also applied to a variety of individual departments. \n\nI interviewed at 3 schools \u2014 two of which were top 10 in NIH funding. Additionally, a professor from a fourth school (upper tier) reached out to me and told me he put me on the waitlist for interviews at his institution. \n\nI prepared A LOT for my interviews. My PI used to grill me in lab meetings about my work, so I was expecting to be grilled about my research as well as faults in my application. I knew my research inside and out \u2014 there were only two questions during the whole interview process that I didn\u2019t know how to answer. I also went through the master question list from this sub and tried to prepare answers for all of those questions. Then, when I got my interview schedule, I looked up each professor and read some of their papers or some of their abstracts, depending on my interest in working with them. \n\nI had a really fun time at all of my interviews, though that may be because I consider myself an extrovert. Most of them were a conversation about my research and my personal background, though there were a few where the interviewer turned their monitor towards me as soon as I sat down, threw on a powerpoint, and started talking about their own research. I interviewed with a total of 18 people. Out of all the interviewers, only two interviewers brought up the weaknesses in my transcripts. I was expecting to be asked this question, so I had an answer prepared. After the interviews, I had a few faculty and many of the other interviewees point out that I asked a lot of good questions about the program, funding, and living in that area. I was happy to hear that people noticed this because it was important for me to personally gauge how I fit in with the program, the labs, and the people. \n\nAfter every visit, usually in the airport, I sat down and made a pros/cons list and wrote a bit about my gut reactions. This helped me make a decision later on when I received offers. \n\nI received offers from each of the schools I interviewed at and received a rejection from the waitlisted school.  The first school I was accepted to sent me an offer and asked me to respond in two weeks. I asked for an extension, since I hadn\u2019t finished interviewing yet and they granted me one. \n\nI accepted an offer a few days ago and I am very excited about taking this next step for myself and my career. \n\nI would be happy to answer questions about my experience or what I would have done differently, etc... at any point in time. So, if someone sees this months from now, feel free to comment or PM me! \n\n\n",

            "content": "I thought I'd make a formal results post since it seems like most of the people doing these have 3.9+'s. I applied mostly by cities I wanted to live in, namely Philly, NYC, Boston and Chicago. I applied to a lot of reach schools and in retrospect shot too high and wasted a decent amount of money but I wanted to be sure I wouldn't get in lol. I am in my fifth year of undergrad currently so keep that in mind (the double major necessitated it). Also, I stole /u/AlzScience 's formatting hope she doesn't mind.\n\n**Stats**\n\n* B.S. double major in biomedical engineering and computer science & engineering from Ohio State\n* GPA: 3.46 **EDIT:** Oh and I should note my transcript is not pretty, like there are some C+'s, B-'s and 1 D in classes that I should not have gotten those grades in. I've also retaken 3 classes, 2 of which I did much better in 1 I got a C+ in again. I kind of wung a lot of exams which isn't always the best idea but ya know, shit happens.\n* GRE: 164Q/160V/5.0AW\n* Demographics: White, male, American\n* Research interests: computational biology/bioinformatics (most interested in process/cellular modelling and simulation), also said interested in AI/ML but that's more of a secondary interest\n* Research experience: 3 years during undergrad, working on an undergrad thesis, no publications, no meaningful presentations, and most importantly **research is in BME not CS(E), so rather irrelevant**. I did not have the time or foresight to switch into CS research since I decided to change career trajectories somewhat late in the game.\n* Awards: Nothing nationally noteworthy, but decent amount of OSU specific scholarships and an award & patent from my senior capstone project (it was pretty cool not gonna lie).\n* Misc:  Software dev job part time for about a year, have graded a course for like 3 years, officer in a couple of engineering related clubs on and off.\n* Application:  To be honest I wrote my SOP over like 3 sittings at a bar and did not have anyone but my girlfriend read it. I think it's fine but I didn't put that much effort into it. Letters of rec from my PI who is noteworthy in her field but it's not CS, my boss for grading (lecturer in CSE) and the prof who advised my capstone (fairly young and in ECE). Did not contact any POI's beforehand.\n\n**Applications**\n\n* **Very Reach:**\n   * NYU Liberal Arts\n   * Northwestern\n   * Upenn\n   * UW Madison\n   * UChicago\n   * Columbia\n* **Reach:**\n   * Northeastern\n   * Boston U\n   * NYU Tandon Engineering\n* **Not Reach:**\n   * CUNY\n   * Drexel\n   * University of Illinois, Chicago\n   * OSU (for an MS, just to be safe)\n\n**Results**\n\n* *Rejected without interview or ghosted:*  All \"Very Reach\", Boston U, NYU Tandon\n* *Rejected after interview:* Northeastern (interview didn't go great, was my first one, she kept asking about my sad stats background), CUNY (interview guy also didn't like me, mainly because I didn't give him a 100% firm \"I will attend CUNY if you accept me\" response).\n* *Interviewed and accepted:* Drexel, I'm very confident UIC would have accepted me but I withdrew my application after accepting Drexel, OSU but it was for MS like I said (they didn't even interview me)\n* *Attending:* Drexel\n\n**Reflection**\n\nI would say I'm happy with the results; I was hopeful when I got an early Northeastern interview (like second week of January) because I prefer Boston to Philly but what can you do. Drexel offered me a pretty good stipend with healthcare included so can't complain. The PI I'll be working with also seems like a really perfect fit which at the end of the day is probably the most import thing. He does geometric modelling of various things and I will likely start working on modelling some facet(s) of cellular behaviour. Some people in his lab also do ML/AI stuff so that's another possible. For anyone extra curious, my current goal is to move to Boston or NYC post graduation/post possible post doc and work as a computational researcher in the pharma industry. Hope this helps future people with not immaculate stats try to gauge where they stand on things, good luck everyone!",

            "title": "In complete disbelief .. top STEM PhD program!",
            "content": "I applied to grad school on a whim. I was tired of working in the Quality Engineering side of the aerospace manufacturing industry and I wasn't getting the mental satisfaction that I needed to keep me happy either. I knew that the roles that I could have grown into didn't  have any potential in my eyes either.  Over time, I ended up getting too comfortable in my roles and the money was nice but as time passed I realized I could not do that for the rest of my life. I continued to apply for research oriented jobs in my field for 3 years, but after never even being offered an interview, I knew I needed to obtain a PhD to pursue a career aligned with my interests and one which would keep me engaged and motivated. \n\nI have always psyched myself out from applying. I have a Fail on my transcript, a low GPA of 3.19, and I didn't think any professors thought highly of me due to an event that I am sure stained my reputation in the department's eyes. For three years I didn't think I was good enough, but this past fall I thought to myself that I could honestly no longer live another year in manufacturing. I wanted to do science!  I perhaps contemplated even applying for too long and didn't actually start studying for the GRE until October really. Most of the schools I applied to had deadlines of December 15th. I rushed to cram and take the GRE twice but did better the first time than the second--a literal waste of 200$ and a month of intense preparation. I was initially content with my first scores but thought that I should cover any gaps in my application with higher scores, so I took it again to no benefit. To be fully transparent I got a 162Q (80) 159V (83) and 4.0AW (59). \n\nI had previously talked to some professors about a year after exiting my undergrad about applying to grad school. I even once actually started the process and commenced the conversations with them but never followed through with forwarding letter requests. I tried to approach them this year (two years later) and was grateful when they agreed. One of the professors I asked for a letter from had actually moved schools and changed emails as she was only an adjunct in the department when I was there. I initially freaked out and could honestly not find her contact information anywhere but came across an old link that thankfully helped me locate her. I had taken her intro to polymers course and asked her to supervise my literature search while completing my senior year of research. She wasn't the greatest teacher but she was, and continues to be, an amazing and inspiring mentor. I liked my meetings with this professor and we always ended up sharing personal anecdotes. I told her about my struggles as a queer Latino from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background in the Ivy League and she would tell me stories about her own struggles as a Black woman from similar circumstances in academia. I learned so much from her and am sure she wrote me the strongest letter possible. \n\nOne of my other professors I asked a letter from I had taken two of her classes and did decent in one and poorly on another. The class I did poorly in, though, was one of my favorite classes in undergrad, Crystallography (for any into solid state physics..). I would often go to this professor's office hours and actually ended up building a relationship with her and hearing her own struggles as a refugee fleeing the Iranian revolution. I would like to say she wrote me a strong letter but she also explicitly requested from me to waive my rights to all letters that I ask her to submit for me, so I am not sure exactly what could have been on her letter. My last professor I had the least connection with but I took his class and got an A as well as having minimal interaction with him overseeing the senior class' year of senior research. I met all three of these professors in person about a year and a half after leaving undergrad when I was on a business trip in NYC. \n\nAs for my statements of purpose and personal history essays, I think I am an above average writer for someone in STEM lol. I think I had a lot of positive emotion and enthusiasm in both my essays. In my personal history essay I briefly opened on my background as the child of immigrants and was open about financially supporting myself throughout college due monetary circumstances in my family. I often worked 20+ hours a week just to feed myself and have some kind of money to live in NYC. I also disclosed a negative study abroad experience and how that had a major influence on major depression that I developed following that. I didn't really know how to explain a very extreme downward trend in my grades but I knew I had to masterfully walk ad comms through why I had a FAIL on my transcript. I think I did a great job at tying all the important elements together.. I did not want to have my essay sound like a sob story but also disclosed my father disowning me for coming out. I tried to use these events as proof that I could go through hardship and turn it into a positive experience. \n\nI really just wanted to post my story on here for others to see and know that having a below average numerical profile will not disqualify you from graduate school. I don't know what role my identity played in my admission but I will say that I think I am at least deserving of great scientific training. I have received offers from UC Irvine, Rutgers, Stony Brook, and today I received an offer from Johns Hopkins. I am still waiting to hear the interview results from Georgia Tech, and would have a very difficult decision to make between Hopkins and Tech if it really came down to that. I am leaning more towards JHU due to the social atmosphere that I felt there as well as it having colder weather, which I strangely prefer considering I am from the west coast.. I also really appreciated that Hopkins' graduate program had an even distribution of men and women and it was very apparent that they were sincere in their efforts to diversity their cohorts--this is really important to me, and think it will be my deciding factor if it would to come down to Tech vs JHU. Both schools have great research that fits with me, and while Tech does have more prestige and research facilities, I am not sure how my mental health will fare over 5 years in an atmosphere that I feel is somewhat isolating without even considering the additional pressures of the grad school workload. \n\nOverall, I am really just glad that my days as a paper pusher are numbered and cannot wait to quit and start grad school!! This morning's offer is huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I was mainly worried about not being the best fit for the other options I had prior to that and was mentally preparing to commit to something as April 15th is almost here. Thank you to this forum for all your stories and inspirations--they really kept me going!\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr top 20 STEM PhD program acceptance & waiting to hear back from a top 10 school. GRE: 159V 162Q 4.0AW, GPA: 3.19, Ivy league undergrad, 1 great letter, 2 either great or good letters. 1 year of research, 1 REU. 3 years of non research related industry experience. Great SOP & sincere, but risky personal history essay.",

Only thing is... they won't tell me over the phone, only through email. I'm waiting for the final reply, either today or tomorrow. Happy thoughts everyone, this has been the most stressful three months ever.\n\n\\*\\*\\*UPDATE TO THE UPDATE\\*\\*\\* It is April 11th. I applied on January 10th. As of today, I am officially accepted. Very pleased with the results, still salty about the process. Overall feeling: f\\*$#ing joy. \n\n\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\* The wait continues. The international admissions team in the school I'm applying to is utterly inept and at this point, I've given up on spending emotional energy worrying about it. The person in charge of figuring out what my degree path means is coming back from her 2-week vacation (!) next Wednesday. Apparently, she's the only human in the entire office who can determine a response to my application. Wonderful.\n\nIn the meantime, I will be contacting my prospective professors at that school to talk to them about my situation and just ask, point blank, what my chances are of acceptance. I did this when I applied to other institutions and it worked out well for me. If their answers are positive, then I will speak to them about my application for the full-scholarship/bursary available for that program. There's only 1 bursary and I want to maximize my chances of receiving it by figuring out exactly what they're looking for and how I can become that applicant. I'm taking this weekend to collect my thoughts and figure out what to say when I call my professor, whom I've been stalking on social media since I've learned about this program. Also, that bursary application is due by April 30th so.... I've gotta start doing this now.\n\nI am also keeping an eye on plane ticket prices since my acceptance would prompt me to book a ticket for April 22nd (coming up!) to visit the London campus and meet with people personally and investigate my future institution. I also will be meeting professors to finalize my essay for the scholarship and show how serious I am about the opportunity, etc. Also, I am eager to be with my significant other who is studying in the UK since September (last time we saw each other), so there are a lot of emotions tied up in this potential acceptance.\n\n\\*\\*\\* I want to give a shout out to anyone who, like me, is still waiting!!! Never give up hope and never stop believing that you are the awesome human being that you are and that good things will come to you when it is time. I made the mistake of not contacting my professors sooner than now, but if you're in this position and haven't called ANYONE, I advise you pick up the phone and start dialing numbers so you can start figuring out answers. K, that's all I have for now. Keep wishing me luck (every little bit helps) and I'm wishing anyone luck who is also in this position!",

            "content": "I'm posting for a friend who doesn't have a reddit account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nURGENT HELP NEEDED:\n\nHi all, I am in a bit of a pickle and need some serious advice on how to handle this\u00a0**grad admission**\u00a0situation. About 3 weeks ago I interviewed at my top school and met with my top pick for an adviser. While I was there I got the impression that we were maybe not the greatest fit (nothing happened just intuition and what I heard from other students). While I still find this person\u2019s work interesting I found another person in the department\u2019s work, personality, and lab more to my liking and it seemed to be a better fit. It's important to note that both professors work closely with each other.\n\nOn Monday of this week I heard back from the first person (the one I don\u2019t feel I jive with) that I was first on the wait list and could work in her lab if I wanted to (through direct funding). I waited 3 days to email them back because I felt I needed to think about this and make an informed decision. Do I want to go into a lab I didn\u2019t feel fit my needs or stay at my perfectly fine, although not research focused, job (Lab Manger at a good university, good pay, benefits, could potentially lead to options for a masters or PhD but in a different field that I would love to be in)? I send an email Thursday morning to them saying thank you very much, but I have decided to explore other options before committing to a PhD program and have decided to postpone my graduate studies.\n\n**THEN:**\u00a0Three hours later I got an email from the director of the program telling me that I was still a high priority for them and that they could find a way to bring me in even though I wasn\u2019t offered a direct spot into the program (i.e. a faculty member would bring me in, not the department). I though okay, this is just the director\u2019s version of telling me I could work in the first person\u2019s lab if they got funding for me. I chalked it up to bad communication (which I still think was the case)\n\n**BUT THEN:**\u00a0I got an email two more hours later from the faculty member who I really enjoyed and who\u2019s project I was very, very interested in, and she is adjunct in a department I am very interested in so there could be the opportunity to do a broader, but more interesting PhD.\n\nThe problem is that I still am not 100% sure I want to get a PhD (**is anyone? I am seriously asking**). I can think of a lot of reasons not to but also a lot of reasons to do it. It would be really interesting and fun and might get me a cooler job someday. But there are a lot of draw backs (would need to quit recently acquired job, break lease, partner would need to find a new job, we would be poor). Not to mention I already told this first faculty member I was delaying my PhD studies. But I didn\u2019t think this other person would offer me a position. Clearly the department is not communicating well with each other about who wants what students (I know very few departments do).\n\nAs a professor how would you feel if you had been denied by a student who said that they just generally weren't sure about doing a PhD but then the student started a PhD with a close collaborator? If you were a student how would you handle this? Would me accepting the second persons offer damage my relationship beyond repair with the first person (they were very understanding of my email this morning)? I\u2019m truly confused about what to do or how to handle this situation.",

            "content": "Hello everyone. First and foremost, thank you for reading. I just found this subreddit and had a chance to read the not-so-gentle guide and boy, does my ass feel chafed on pursuing gradschool. \n\nSo to start, I went for my bachelor's in 2010. I pursued the wrong degree and halfway through college realized my mistake and chose to make the most of it and double major. My family is poor, equal parts academic and idiotic, and I chose to go the academic route. I also did not take a gap year which I heavily blame for part of my circumstance but not all. So double major puts me a year behind and I graduate in 2015. By this point, I have had my ups and downs but I did it. My last semester was 1 required course and so I decided to retake some classes to bring up my gpa. I did well and now I need to order my transcripts, but there's multiple issues.\n\n1. I suffer from Impostor Syndrome more than the average person. \n\n2. Luckily, I found my true calling with my second degree which is global studies. The problem is that I want to pursue Language/Linguistics and everyone I know says do not. \n\n3. I went to a small state school and am severely limited on knowledge of how to even go about doing the whole Master's then Ph.D without taking heavy loans. \n\n4. Really this one is 3b, but whatever. I'm poor, work for a prestigious college as staff, and really want to find a way to go back to school and keep my current job. \n\nNow the positives of this story are mingled right in there. I've always been really good at finding the silver linings so here's a few:\n\n1. My transcripts are cheap to access. \n\n2. I work at a prestigious school with some tuition remission even if it isn't fully what I was imagining it would be. Still grateful for what I get. \n\n3. I have a drive for more education and just need to apply that invigorating energy in the right direction. \n\nMy questions to you wonderful folks, is the field of language and linguistics really looking that bleak? \n\nSince I dream to be a future college professor of language, should I pursue my master's in something other than a specific language? \n\nWhat are your best places and tips to get started? I only ask this question because I feel I'm getting lost looking in all the wrong places. And I have been losing my hope over the past few months as I am getting the itch to return to education. \n\nThank you so much for reading. Im typing this while exhausted so if you need clarification or have questions in my direction, please let me know. I just lo g to talk to others about their experiences and how I can get the fire under my ass to advance. Thank you much.",

            "content": "Hello everyone.  My transcripts are terrible.  I mean, God-awful.  I had an amazing high school record (valedictorian, clubs, 4.0, all that jazz), started undergrad right out of high school, and due to multiple stints of mental health issues and family drug problems which were forcing me to job hop and residence hop, my academic performance tanked.  I would always register for classes with excitement and purpose and then these things would happen and I would be forced to take a different job or move away for a short period of time just to continue to not live on the street.  This has resulted in transcripts with upwards of 20 W's and a couple F's.  I finally gave up on my degree.  Fast forward years later, and my family's drug issues have been resolved (for years now!), I had found a job that I progressed through in order to become a senior manager and actually make a living for myself.  So, a year ago, I contacted a professor I know personally, he and I sat down, judgement-free, and figured out my remaining credits to graduation and I graduated in two semesters with a BS in Forensic Science.  \n\n\nI feel like a completely different person.  Forensic Science isn't even what I want anymore, but I was so close that just having the degree meant more to me now.  I have 7 years of managerial work experience (in the beer and wine industry) under my belt, and with no further advancement opportunities I have been looking to grad school.  Considering my professional experience and industry certifications, I am considering either MBA or some type of Master's in Supply Chain.  \n\n\nHow realistic are my chances of being accepted anywhere?  My GRE scores are great: >90th percentile on both verbal and math.  I have 7 years of managerial experience and 14 years of experience at a premiere volunteer program as an upper-level staff member.  I have two powerful letters of recommendation - one from a professor and one from a supervisor.  I just can't shake the dread that I will never be accepted anywhere (or at least, anywhere DECENT) because of my atrocious amount of W's, the couple F's, and the <2.7 GPA.  \n\n\nThanks in advance for any comments and insight.",

            "title": "Journey to 10/12 acceptances - Master's in Robotics",
            "content": "**Background**: \n\nI applied to 12 schools, partially to keep as many options open as possible, and partially because I knew so little about the experience going into it. About a month and a half ago, I was convinced I was going to get 12 rejections. When the end of February finally rolled around, I got my first acceptance and I could not believe it. As March passed, I was continuously blown away that I kept receiving more acceptances. My goal of this post is to talk about my experience going through the admissions process to help someone who will be in my shoes next year (plus getting some advice on which program to choose would not be the worst thing ever).\n\n**About me**:\n\nI am a senior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering for my undergraduate degree (GPA 3.8x/4.0, GRE: 165Q/165V). The most interesting side of robotics to me is the controls side, but I would love to get a broad robotics education that encompasses ML and CV as well. On the other hand, I am interested in the business side of robotics, and I see myself in a management position leading a team of robotics engineers in 5-10 years. I had a job offer as a Software Engineer after graduation, but I wanted to do research to see if graduate school would be the best option for me. I decided that I would be able to get a job that blew me away and accelerated my career by getting a Master's in Robotics. I personally know that I am not ready for the time commitment that comes along with a PhD, so I only applied to Master's programs. One other consideration I have is the two-body problem. My girlfriend has pretty solidly decided on law school at Vanderbilt, and I plan on joining her in Nashville after I get my Master's. \n\n**Acceptances**:\n\nUniversity of Michigan Ann Arbor\n\n* MS in Robotics. Submitted 12/28. Accepted 3/14\n\n\nUC Berkeley\n\n* MEng in EECS - Robotics and Embedded Systems. Submitted 1/4. Accepted 3/14\n\n\nUPenn\n\n* MS in Robotics. Submitted 1/2. Accepted 3/22\n\n\nUCLA\n\n* MS in ECE - Control and Optimization. Submitted 12/13. Accepted 2/26\n\nJHU\n\n* MS in Robotics. Submitted 12/13. Accepted 3/11\n\nGA Tech\n\n* MS in CS - Vision and Perception. Submitted 1/9. Accepted 4/1\n\nVanderbilt\n\n* MS in EE - Robotics. Submitted 12/24. Accepted 2/26\n\nUSC\n\n* MS in CS - General (Not accepted to Intelligent Robotics). Submitted 12/13. Accepted 3/24\n\nCornell Tech\n\n* MEng ECE - Signals and Systems. Submitted 1/12. Accepted 3/29\n\n\nUW Seattle\n\n* MS ECE - Signals and Systems. Submitted 12/13. Accepted 3/15\n\n\n**Rejected**:\n\nStanford\n\n* MS in CS - Real World Computation. Submitted 12/2. Rejected 3/15\n\nHarvard \n\n* MS in EE - Robotics and Control. Submitted 12/8. Rejected 2/22.\n\n**My Decision**:\n\nThis decision feels extremely rushed, but as of now I have been able to narrow my search down to three schools: \n\nUMich - MS Robotics\n\n* Duration: 1.5 years\n* Total Tuition (All 3 Semesters): 71k - 10k fellowship = 61k\n* Pros: 9-10 great technical courses, coolest courses offered IMO, amazing alumni network, 1.5 years seems optimal, world-class research, great career services\n* Cons: Weather, not much near Ann Arbor not related to UMich\n* Personal Note: I went to visit in the summer, so I emailed a Robotics prof, and one of his PhD students was kind enough to show me around. What I thought would be a 20-minute meeting lasted 4+ hours. I went from lab to lab and was blown away by each and every one. A world famous professor told me to push his robot and it wouldn\u2019t fall over, and I had a mini heart attack when I pushed the robot. I loved Ann Arbor and every minute of this visit.\n\n\nUC Berkeley\n\n* Duration: 1 year\n* Total Tuition: 56k - 15k fellowship = 41k\n* Pros: Technical classes are very high caliber, business courses in addition to technical courses, year-long capstone project great for interviews, connected to many companies, prestige of Berkeley name, weather, can take MBA course \n* Cons: 1 year seems too short, I would learn half as much in terms of technical skills, how much capstone can you accomplish in a year, job connections don't seem as strong outside of Bay Area\n* Personal Note: I went to visit and got along very well with the people I met. Berkeley also sold me that 4 technical courses would probably be enough, but I am worried that the capstone projects did not seem related to my interests.\n\nUPenn\n\n* Duration: 1.5 years\n* Total Tuition: 71k\n* Pros: Reputation, my robotics classes show research from these labs, 1.5 years is optimal length, attached to Wharton which is the best ranked business school in the country\n* Cons: They dismissed me when I asked to visit - that's the opposite of the response I got from the other two schools. \n* Personal Note: In my opinion, discouraging me from visiting is a big red flag, but I know I should still consider this program due to its prestige\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nRight now I'm pretty torn between Michigan and Berkeley. I'd say I'm like 60% Michigan 40% Berkeley because of the fantastic engineering education aspects of Michigan compared to the business aspects of Berkeley. I'd appreciate any advice, and I hope this post helps someone in the future. Also, feel free to let me know if you have any questions about the application process or my softs.",

The final nail in the coffin just hit me today, where I was rejected from my number one program after waiting almost three excruciating weeks. So basically I have nothing, EXCEPT I happened to apply to an MS in Neuroscience (no funding offered, but there are opportunities for TA/GA-ships, etc.) which accepted me a month ago. I\u2019ve been keeping it on ice until I made sure I wasn\u2019t going to start a PhD program, and I\u2019m wondering if I should really take the jump into the MS program. It feels like my only hope for advancement in my Neuroscience career for several reasons: (1) I\u2019m no longer interested in my research field after working as a lab tech in a related subfield for three years, (2) it\u2019s taken three years to even get close to 1 publication, and (3) I only have a BA in Biology from a top 3 US university but which I sabotaged with several bad grades leading to a not-super-competitive GPA.  I\u2019ve spent the past four years trying to make up for that GPA but it seems to have not worked, and that\u2019s another major reason I think I should just take the MS and do my absolute to rock it, increasing my odds of making it to my Neuro PhD program at the end of the MS. \n\nTo the fine and helpful individuals on \nr/gradadmissions, what\u2019s your take on this?

            "content": "Hi :)\n\nI recently been accepted in the Post-Baccalaureate program in Computer Science at Mills College, with work funds and a small scholarship awarded to me. I applied to the MAs in Interdisciplinary Computer Science program because it seems like a good fit for a sociologist wanting to enter herself in the CS or UX world like me, but considering I have pretty much none background on discrete math or programming, I ended up being accepted in the post-bac, having the posibility to continue with the MAs once I finish the prerequisite courses.\n\nAt first I was all about leaving Chile and going to study in the US but i'm having second thoughts about it considering my scholarship is small and the cost of attendance is high (60k) and i would have to ask for a loan in order to finance it. Also, I would like to have the opportunity to work there after finishing the post-bac but it seems like that option is very limited due to visa stuff. One part of me wants to go and give it a chance, but I gotta be honest: it's difficult to do so when you're not sure if the investment you're making will paid off in the future (better job opportunities). I also thought about going, finish the post-bac and applied for a scholarship in Chile that allows me to finance a MAs program in Europe or somewhere else, but its a tricky option considering I might or might not win the scholarship. One thing I'm sure of is that I want to leave Chile for at least a couple of years and have the experience of studying/working in another country, but I'm not sure if this opportunity is the right one. I even consider work and holiday (i'm 26) but is my least favorite option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to post about it before making the decission, it's always good to have other opinions.",

I want to get a PhD from the UK. \n\nI have a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s in electrical and electronics engineering from average universities in my country (not \u201celite\u201d schools). I had 78% in my bachelors and 82% in my masters. \n\nCurrently I\u2019m working at a research lab that works in underwater robotics. But due to lack of funding etc, the quality of research work in my organisation is really poor. I have worked here for two years but I don\u2019t have any publications (other than presenting one review paper about some computer vision techniques at a conference here). \n\nI am the only female (and the youngest; though I am 31 years old) in my Lab and I am quite interested in getting a PhD. My colleagues (all males) don\u2019t seem to like the idea and often try to keep me busy with silly tasks so that I don\u2019t get time to write papers or do publication-worthy things etc. \n\nRecently I applied for a research fellowship (not for PhD; predoctoral research for one year) funded by the Swiss government but I did not get it. It was my first attempt at a scholarship. It was a global scholarship and they had 200 grants. I was devastated. I desperately wanted it. I felt bad informing my Swiss supervisor also. It\u2019s been two weeks since I found out and still feel bad.\n\nNow I have brushed myself off and ready to go for my big dream - PhD. But since the scholarships are so competitive I want to make sure my application is solid. \n\nI feel insecure about the fact that I don\u2019t have any significant publications yet. I have taken up computer vision as something that I would like to develop my expertise in, but since my Lab has never worked on vision, I feel a lack of guidance and direction.\n\nSo for now, my questions are:\n\n1. What can I do to make a strong PhD application CV/profile for competitive scholarships?\n\n2. What can I do to make up for the lack of \u201celite\u201d school names on my CV?\n\n3. What can I do to make up for the lack of publications and work experience in computer vision when it is the field I would like to get my PhD in? \n\nApplications open in August and close in December. This year I would like to apply for many scholarships. \n\n4. But shall I apply for multiple scholarships to get into one selected university? \n\n5. What do people do when they apply for multiple scholarships? Do they find multiple potential supervisors but keep the research proposal common?\n\n6. I would like to apply at Imperial College London first- too big a dream? Is it a big risk?\n\nThank you very much for reading.\n\nThanks.",

My illness went into full remission, my brain is back and better than ever, and I'm gearing up for nursing school which starts in a few weeks for me.\n\nThere are other reasons my grades were lower back then. Back then I didn't feel like anything I did made a difference (due to my upbringing), and I didn't take school seriously enough, both of which I do the opposite of now. The point is, all that is changed now, and with my functioning brain I'm putting in half the effort to my nursing prereqs that I did into college the first time around, and I'm getting all A's, with the exception of a few B's that I got from doing accelerated courses while having to work full time. It's really amazing how easy it is to take your brain for granted.\n\nMy GPA, when only counting the grades I've gotten from the past year and a half, is around 3.7-3.8.

            "title": "For future Geosciences/Geology graduate school applicants",
            "content": "I recently completed an admissions cycle for Masters and PhD programs in Geosciences/Geology. I thought I'd share a perspective that hopefully will help future applicants:\n\n**Personal Stats**- I am 32 years old, male. \n\n**Experience**- BA Physics (Conferred May 2009) with 1.5 years of physics/engineering based research resulting in 2 publications listing me as 2nd author. 6 years experience teaching high school physics, geometry, astronomy, and calculus post-college. In Fall 2018, I enrolled full time at a local community college to take Intro. to Geography, Python programming, ArcGIS, and AutoCAD to better prepare myself and demonstrate that I was serious about returning to school. \n\n**The Numbers**- 3.24 GPA for BA, (4.0 in my post-BA community college classes). GRE: 159Q, 162V, 4.5AW.\n\n**Program Applications**- I applied to 4 programs overall, two masters programs and two PhD programs. Program rankings were not a huge factor in my choosing to apply, instead I focused on schools where I could do the research that interests me.\n\n**Statement of Purpose**- I spent probably 2 months writing, editing, and rewriting my statements of purpose. I sought feedback from my wife, my undergraduate institution's career services dept., and an acquaintance who has a PhD in my intended field. Since I would be an older student, I felt that my statement of purpose needed to succinctly highlight exactly why I wanted to return to school, what I wanted to research, and why my physics and professional background qualified me.\n\n**Professor Contacts**- I successfully started a dialog with professors at two schools to which I applied and had phone interviews with them long before the application deadline. Both conversations went well. I prepared for these conversations by writing talking points and questions ahead of time. \n\n**Admission Stats**- I was admitted to one Masters program and one PhD program. Both programs offered full tuition remission and graduate assistantship stipends. Additionally, I was offered a fellowship by the PhD program. The other two programs rejected me outright with no interview or dialog. \n\n**Acceptance Package**- I accepted admission to begin a PhD at a major state university. My package included a $22,000/year fellowship for 4 years and $14,100/year graduate assistantship with tuition remission for 5 years. This will allow me to live in reasonable comfort in my school's location.\n\n**Final Thoughts**- I believe my statement of purpose was hugely important for my admissions. The two programs that accepted me were also the two programs to which my SoP highlighted exactly how I would be an especially good match. I spent a lot of time researching the nuances of those programs and reading the graduate handbook and, when possible, I included specific details as to why these programs were good fits for me. I was a bit more lazy with my SoPs for the schools that ended up rejecting me. \n\nI also was admitted to the two schools where I had successfully contacted potential advisors to discuss research. From my experience and what I've read, beginning a dialog before admission with potential advisors is hugely important in the geosciences. I recommend that any student hoping to enter this field start making contacts a few months before the admission deadline. \n\nMy test scores were also strong, or at least strong enough for my programs. My scores were well above the minimum acceptable scores published by these programs. I also think having a physics background helped because the programs could be confident that I was capable doing high level math and problem solving. \n\nLastly, I think my 6 years teaching high school were helpful in my admissions. The programs likely could feel confident that I was a capable teacher and likely would not struggle too much with TA duties. \n\nI was also worried that I would be considered \"too old\" for graduate school. When I visited the institution that I will be attending, I met several current graduate students who were older than me! Of course most students were younger, but I would in no way be thought of as \"that old guy.\" \n\nGood luck to all future applicants! I hope that my experience helps you in one way or another.",

            "content": "EDIT: Just received my acceptance letter to the program! :) \n\nFirst hand experience that if you ever find yourself in a similar situation, it is NOT the end of the world and is not the end-all-be-all to your application/grad journey! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: had a lot of stressful shit going on in my life, interviewer asked a question I didn't anticipate, ended up talking about a time I was sexually harassed at work and broken down for most of the interview; still got positive feedback from the interviewer but not convinced it's enough to save myself from humiliation / gain me admittance to the program.\n\nI applied to a prestigious MBA program in Canada and I had been in close contact with someone on the admissions team (had met for a coffee chat, reached out to them for advice throughout the application process). I was told I had an impressive resume for my age (24) and a high enough university GPA (3.6 on 4.0 scale) and an adequate GMAT score (total 650 but I was told this was comparatively weak for the program). I wasn't exactly a shoe-in but the admissions coordinator told me I had a good shot at being admitted if I interviewed well.\n\nI prepared as much as I (thought) I could for this interview, knew pretty much everything about the program, came up with different answers for all the typical interview questions and prepared a number of work examples that could fit a number of different questions that could come up. unfortunately my (romantic) partner was in a car accident and I spent a lot of time either taking care of them or working, which really threw me off my game, and at the time I knew I was extremely stressed out but I was too stubborn to admit that I wasn't in a good head space to take this interview.\n\nDuring the interview, first half went well, gave all the answers I had rehearsed to all the typical questions (tell me about yourself, etc). Then the interviewer hit me with the question, \"can you tell me about a time you had to work with someone that had a different working style to yourself, and how did you adapt?\" this really threw me off because I hadn't really prepared anything for it at all (in hindsight, seems like a pretty typical interview question I could have / should have anticipated). Only thing I could think of on the spot was my experience with sexual harassment in the work place and, well, that's when I pretty much started crying uncontrollably. Honestly, can't say if I really still felt awful about the sexual harassment case (which was eventually resolved) or if I cried because of the culmination of the stress I had been dealing with for the past few weeks... also probably didn't help that I had only been getting \\~5-6 hours of sleep per night for a couple weeks at this point.\n\nThe interviewer was VERY nice about the whole situation, said that it showed that I had experienced adversity and had been strong enough to deal with it, and I was only human and it was a stressful situation. I told her that I was very nervous and it had happened relatively recently, but nothing else about my personal life. Can't really remember the rest of the interview very well besides trying to hold back my tears and keep my composure, I vaguely remember just trying my best to get through it but my answers after breaking down (I think) were way more vague and less what I had rehearsed, a lot more disorganised / word vomit. At the end the interviewer told me that I had done a great job and that they'd get back to me in a week.\n\nHonestly, couldn't even keep my composure walking out of the interview and pretty much cried all the way home and cried the rest of the day, completely convinced I had fucked up my chances of getting into this program and that the interviewer would perceive me as weak and damaged or not ready to take on the responsibility of an MBA. Honestly, really just posting on here to vent and maybe get some constructive / outsider feedback on this, obviously everyone close to me says that everything will be okay and that they still think I will be accepted, and I try to believe them because it is really what I want, but I am also a realist and I just feel like there's no way in hell at this point.",

            "content": "Thanks to /u/AlzScience for posting about her neuroscience application process; I posted my stats in the thread but I thought I'd wait a bit and post mines here for all the early-birds looking into applying to neuro grad programs for next cycle. This post will be most helpful for those, like me, with low undergrad GPA's that are looking to find ways to enter schools for neuroscience. The short of it is that I followed the guide on the sidebar but, unfortunately, even that wasn't enough (for my field, specifically).\n\nI'll try to include as much detail as possible and I'm willing to share all my materials: application essays, transcripts, emails to potential PI's, etc if you PM me. Disclaimer: I am a sample size of 1 (and have only applied once) and I probably over-learned many things in the process.\n\nAlso, my results seem to be the result of a **neuroscience Ph.D. in the U.S. at top-20 program specific problem** so extrapolate with a grain of salt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Stats at Undergrad Graduation**\n\n* GPA: 3.13 in Math (2.8 in major) and Biochemistry (2.9 in major)\n* GRE: 167/163/6.0 V/Q/W 98th/83rd/99th percentiles\n* School: top-200 liberal arts college with an 88% acceptance rate in the PNW\n* 3 years undergraduate research experience; 2 summer REU's at R1's\n* Asian-american male\n* Interested in computational neuroscience\n* Awards: small travel awards\n* Misc: none\n* LoR's: one great one from PI, two mediocre from academic professors\n* Posters/Pubs: One 2nd author SfN poster, one 3rd author submitted manuscript\n* Networking: none but I wasn't planning on applying anyways\n\n**Additional stats at time of application (3.5 years later)**\n\n* GPA: 3.7 in an MS in Applied Math (80% done)\n* School: top-10 worldwide public university\n* 0.5 years tech at R1; 3 years tech at leading neuroscience research institution\n* LoR's: One great one from undergrad PI and now also manager (neither well-known); one good joint letter from PI's\n* Posters/Pubs: 3 published (3rd author small journal IF of 4.0; large # author mid-author eNeuro and eLife); 2 manuscripts submitted (large author # mid-author Nature (yes, Nature Nature), 2nd-author PLOS ONE); 2 manuscripts in prep (1st and 3rd); four posters at SfN (one first, one third, two mid-author)\n* Networking: emailed 2-4 PI's at the top 10 schools I wanted and corresponded with a dozen; skyped around 4 PI's and met 8 PI's at SfN in person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schools applied to**\n\nApplied: UW, UO, UCSF, UCSD, Stanford, Columbia, NYU, CMU/Pitt CNBC, Princeton, Stony Brook, BU GPN, MIT, Harvard\n\nInterviewed: UO, Stony Brook, CMU Biological Sciences, BU GPN\n\nRejected after waitlist: CMU Biological Sciences, BU GPN\n\nAccepted: UO (with $20k fellowship), Stony Brook (with $15k fellowship), BU BBC\n\nAttending: BU BBC\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reflection**\n\nQuite shocked to be perfectly honest. I had spoken with several neuroscientists that had served as PI's years ago and some that had just graduated their PhD a year or two ago and some even served on admissions committees; all of them said that, despite my low undergrad GPA, I'd be fine and I should be getting into top-tens. Even people here said the same (see my post history). I thought I had truly done enough to be getting easily into top schools despite my GPA but I don't feel like I came close; the only other things I was missing were a first-authorship or an LoR or two from a big name. I love the research project/program I am about to enter (BU BBC is direct admit to the professor) but I had far less options than I anticipated. You might also notice that I was interviewed at a program I never applied to and I was admitted to a program I neither applied to nor interviewed at: one professor wanted me enough at CMU to swing me into interviewing at CMU Bio a month after the deadline (but I was ultimately rejected) and another wanted me enough at BU that they admitted me to another program after getting waitlisted at GPN.\n\n**What I would've changed**\n\n* **Applied to more biology programs**: as far as I could tell, top neuro programs were getting >500 apps each and admitting around 20 (for class sizes around 10) whereas bio programs were far less selective. Friends were interviewing at top-50 neuro programs and at the same time top-10 bio programs.\n* **Networked even more**: Both CMU and BU I was \"golden buzzered\" into and interview or acceptance because there was one PI who wanted me an exceptional amount. Both I had met in-person and chatted about how I'd fit into their lab. I should've had at least one of these people at every top-choice but this is understandably a tall order and up to luck.\n* **Not been so specific in my interests**: My feedback for CMU and BU GPN was that I had interests that were too specific and they felt they could not accommodate my interests. I thought it advantageous to talk extensively about a specific project in mind and how I would structure it but I think the PI's didn't \"get it\" and thought I wasn't a good fit. I was too focused on neuroscience for CMU Biological Sciences (which I resent because they're starting a neuroscience institute this year and it was my top school among everywhere I applied).\n* **Talked about my undergrad GPA and sleep disorder**: I thought it was a bit of a cop-out to talk about how I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder (Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder) which made it difficult to focus in my 8 a.m to noon science/math classes (my major had all their classes in this time frame) or talked about my brief depression after losing a best friend in a car crash. Maybe talking about these wouldn't have mattered but I think I should've at least mentioned it.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThe application process turned my whole sense of self-worth and my outlook on academia upside-down. I hope I'm wrong about this but I came to a terrible realization throughout: *it really doesn't matter what you look like on paper if you don't know the right people.* When graduate programs have over 500 applications each, they become reliant on things like undergrad GPA for first-pass filtering and weigh less things that take time to evaluate like statements of purpose or content of letters of rec (but not who is writing them). By most readings, my application was stellar sans my undergrad GPA and I was told as much by literally everyone I spoke to but it seems that there's been a paradigm shift in the neuroscience application process in that *everyone* looks perfect; now, the only way to stand out is to have letter writers that are part of the \"in-crowd\" of neuroscientists. I say this because, of the friends I have that got into every top school, they had letter-writers that were top- to just-below-top- neuroscientists in the field (and some of them had sub-3.5 GPA's) e.g. Anne Churchland, Adrienne Fairhall, Nancy Kanwisher, Sam Gershman, etc. People who are notable PI's at R1's or Group Leaders at research institutes. Also, all of my friends who got into top-schools had any publications but yet I had three published and two in review which signals to me that it's really not important (unless you have a first-author) as a differentiator. I think that my undergrad GPA was not outweighed by my MS GPA largely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions! Being honest, the few months between early December and mid-April were some of the worst of my life (second only to the death of a close friend) and if I can help someone else avoid some of the pain of this process, it will have been (somewhat more) worth it.",

When I have my degree I will have gotten my undergrad and grad degrees from the same university here in the states but I can't help but wonder If I wanted to get my Ph.D., I think I'd want to get it abroad. I was looking at some universities in the UK and found the University of Sheffield. It seems really great. After I graduate with my M.S I will (hopefully) be certified to teach in NYC and having gone straight from my Bachelor's to my Master's, I can't help but think that I should do the same with my Ph.D. I'm still not 100% on getting it but I wonder if it is something I should seriously consider. If I were to do Doctoral work I'd want to do something with Early Childhood (Which they have at the University of Sheffield) with focus on ADHD. I have ADHD so it is something close to me that'd I want to do research in (this thought has always been in the back of my mind). So, I don't know what's the better choice. Get my degree and certification so I can teach (at least up to the standard 5 years AND THEN go get my Ph.D.) or just dive in head first of the deep end and go to get my Ph.D. abroad. I'd like to clarify that I have experience abroad (Study abroad twice in undergrad so I'm comfortable in Europe) but for 3-4 years is a totally different story. I also think something holding me back is money. If I taught for 5+ years I could save up money to go get my Ph.D. rather than go in first with nothing (My aunt would help me out I'm sure but still). I'm just hoping any of you have advice in this matter and maybe have experience with something like this? Thanks, Reddit!",

So here's the deal, I graduated from college in 2016, have basically \"slacked off\" for the past 2 years working in bars, craft beer and wine stores, as well as a congressional campaign. This past November I decided that I don't want to slack off anymore. So I applied to graduate school. I also spoke to a Navy Recruiter about admittance in Officer Candidate School for Intelligence jobs. So far so good. He is currently reviewing my medical info and about to send it to MEPS. \n\nAs per grad school, I got into Georgetown for the Masters of Public Policy program. The loan amount is ridiculous (about 80k per year, but only planning on accepting 60). But If I defer now and don't get into the Navy then that will be another year until I can go back to grad school (they don't take spring admissions). I know that if the Navy accepts me that I am willing to drop everything and go to OCS. Should I tell my recruiter that I just got accepted into Georgetown and that I am accepting the offer of admittance? I was planning on giving him a call this week anyways. Should I speak to someone at the school and tell them about my plan to join the Navy OCS should I get the acceptance? I haven't signed anything with the Navy, but I was hoping that I could serve in the Navy first, then attend grad school and have them cover it (or partially cover it) so that I don't go into the scary amount of debt I'm about to go into. \n\nI feel like I'm just getting too much into my head about this whole situation and that I should just let things roll, stick to the mindset that I will be attending grad school until I hear back from my recruiter. Adapt, survive, overcome. I just wanted a third party perspective to help me see if I am being irresponsible, naive, underprepared, or too much in my own head about any of this. \n\nThanks, \n\nYour local, friendly lurker",

I figured some context would help, please let me know if I should separate them, then I will.\n\nI have a BSc in Genetics and Molecular Biology. Then I got into a Genetics Phd Program right after in NY. This was very rough because I could not secure a lab with funding after 4 rotations. In retrospect, I also admit I kept aiming for big labs with experienced PIs, not having a lot of experience myself to be independent enough (but it was *their* research that interested me). Anyway during the time though I realized: I hate pipetting, I hate wetlab/tissue culture. I did way too much of it and I do not enjoy it and was getting depressed. I accepted defeat and left the program with a Masters in Biological Sciences instead in 2017.\n\nThen I got a 9 - 5 job in one of the top CROs (clinical research organization), thankfully not labwork. Now I am in a predicament. I am on a student visa despite growing up in NY, because my parents were political asylees and moved here when I was 2. I get to work 3 years on the student visa after graduation (Feb 2021 my time is up - so I finished 1 year already). This is called the STEM-OPT (international students know this struggle). Within this time people try to get the H1B visa (work permit). I was hoping my company would do that, but my department is on a budget. I am trying to shift departments/get a new job so I can apply for this next year at least.\n\nNow my other option is to go back to grad school, plan to apply at the end of this year for Fall 2020.  I am kind of excited about because I've always been the straight-A nerd, and my 9-5 job pays great but I gotta admit - it's boring as hell and doesn't stimulate my brain. And I always thought I would be the grad student anyway until life happened, seems like I am getting a second chance! But I am trying to shift majors...Few questions on this process:\n\n1. I've always been interested in computer science, it was one of my choices when I was applying to undergrad, so I was thinking what if I did something that would make me pick up more coding/programming and eventually I just shift focus and leave highly molecular research and the bench. I cant go completely into a Phd in Comp Sci, of course, it's too late I don't know enough languages and probably can't learn fast enough for my timelines. Considering genomics/computational biology as my best bet. **Any Comp Sci/Comp Bio/Genomics grad students, please advise how I can prepare for this in the sense that I have little prior experience.** I am willing to learn new languages/software for research. Even thinking of reaching out to PIs in my previous university to volunteer in their labs so that my grad application looks good... **Please advise what I should learn or what I should do?**\n2. Should I aim for **lower ranked universities** because it seems like my application isn't very academically heavy iygwim (or maybe I feel this way now ever since the Genetics PhD program broke my confidence...T\\_T)?\n3. I gotta admit the application process is kind of extra daunting actually having been gone through it once lol. What about getting recommendation letters after this big gap?? **Please advise, rotations did not work out, so who would recommend me, but on the other hand, I am looking to leave the bench anyway? I can reach out to coursework professors... Would my employer be a good one?**\n4. This is one option I have, could sound crazy but I don't know. I am 27 and my life experiences have taught me a lot of things and I just know a lot more about myself than I did in undergrad. I am considering even a Ph.D. in Psychology, particularly neuroscience... It was always an interest, but in my free time I have always looked up psychology stuff as a hobby and now I do it all the time and it just hit me recently, also one of my loved ones got diagnosed with schizophrenia and it hit me hard - if *I am shifting majors...*  why not go all out, plus I would like a fresh start? **Question to Psych Majors: Please advise, how would I go about preparing for this, given all of the above (as in different background in Bsc+MS??)? Should I reach out to a Psych PI at my previous university?  Or is it too late for me to do this all together?**\n5. **Any other majors I can pursue that align with my interests (Comp Sci, Biology, Psychology, Genetics) you can suggest?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you so so much. You can also just tackle one question, you don't have to tackle all of them.",

I decided against school and have been working (as an engineer, not aero or nuclear related) as I focused my energy on repaying my loans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started a new job recently; the company offers a \\~$5k per year education reimbursement program and I want to take advantage of it. I would be eligible *just* *in time* for the Fall 2019 semester so I kicked into high gear doing research on graduate engineering programs, including MS/MBA (my indecisiveness has often pushed me toward dual degree programs...). But I finally settled (am settling?) on MSME. There is no graduate engineering programs near me physically so my options are limited to online curricula. I found that most programs cost $1000+ per credit, which would limit my pace to 1 class per semester (and having to pay out an extra $1k per year, since I am not confident in landing a scholarship). I did not want to take so long to complete the program and luckily found one that would allow a pace of 2 classes per semester. I also thought about applying to more \"prestigious and reputable\" programs, but this all happened in the span of a month and and it occurred to me that it was *very* unlikely I would even be considered at a top-notch program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this past weekend, after delaying it for 2 weeks due to my lack of confidence, I came out of the GRE feeling like I did.... maybe just barely enough to get into the affordable program. The official report doesn't come out for another 10-15 days so I don't know my percentiles yet. I fervently researched scores for a typical engineering program and apparently I did better than I felt / thought I did - to such an extent that I now question whether I remembered my scores correctly. My unofficial scores are 157V / 169Q (or 159V / 167Q....or something else). The more I read, the more I am realizing that these scores can open up doors for me and suddenly top 50 or even top 30 seems maybe doable. This makes me think whether I should continue going for full time work / online MSME part time, or if I should seriously consider a competitive research program, maybe even full time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nIn conclusion, my stats are:\n\nGRE Scores: 157V / 169Q (unofficial...*possibly* incorrect)\n\nUndergrad GPA: 3.20\n\nSeveral years of work experience as engineer\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are my prospects for a competitive MS program (maybe even a thesis-MS)...and/or grants and scholarships?

I aim to get at least one recommendation letter from someone working at my desired program (the other two, I would ask my master's advisors) during my work as a volunteer. Is it often to people aiming to overcome limitations such as low GPA to voluntary work in labs to get letters of recommendation and research experience before applying to any Ph.D. program?

            "content": "Hello. \n\nI\u2019ve been considering applying for the AAS MA program at either UCLA or SFSU (two primary schools I know about that have a solid reputation; if there are others you\u2019d recommend, please let me know!) for awhile now, however, I\u2019ve been a bit apprehensive for awhile now. This post will give a detailed explanation as to why. If you have any related information and advice, I\u2019m kindly requesting your help. I\u2019ve contacted alumni from some programs and have contacted the department, but I wanted to see if I can collected any additional information.\n\nThe key factors that are holding me back are the following: financial situation, eligibility, and general anxiety. The latter is vague, but the thought of going into the program and exiting without any solid career prospects is alarming, especially considering the amount of student loan debt I currently have.\n\nBackground: I got a BA in English with a concentration in Creative Writing (3.75 GPA) in May 2018. Where I did my undergrad, there were no Asian American Studies courses offered. Still, I\u2019ve taken Asian-related courses (which is not the same, I understand) and have read books by Asian American authors in literature courses. I\u2019ve been involved with Asian organizations from high school to college to even now at a professional level (currently working in Marketing). I\u2019m wondering what steps are necessary to qualify, and even have a more grounded understanding in the field, for the program. I\u2019m passionate about advancing and cultivating a critical understanding of Asian American culture, history and experiences.\n\nQuestions:\n1) What financial assistance opportunities are available? What about for students who aren\u2019t in-state residents? (I\u2019m hoping I can eventually gain in-state residency status and qualify for in-state resident-specific scholarships/grants)\n\n2) Am I eligible to apply, even without doing Asian American Studies during undergrad? Is my GPA high enough to be a competitive candidate? What are some things I can do to strengthen my acceptance rate?\n\n3) What types of careers do alumni work in afterward? (Wealth isn\u2019t my focus, however, being able to financially sustain myself provides me with reassurance. I want to immerse myself in this field because to me it is essential. It drives me forward. It helps the entire community\u2014each community across Asian American Studies, especially some of the more \u201cinvisible\u201d ones.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve read all the way through, thank you so much. I appreciate the time you took to read this. I look forward to any helpful information I can get, so I can finally begin the process of making this next step in my life.\n\nTLDR; I want to do a MA in AAS, but I\u2019m in awful need of any help/info/advice I can get. I have reached out to alumni and department staff, but I wanted to see if I can gain any additional insight. Thank you!",

I majored in Neuroscience, during my 2nd-3rd year I had three family members diagnosed with cancer. One of which passed away and knocked me out of the right headspace. I cut my courses down to part time during that time and was struggling to focus in class, I made some overall bad decisions. I finished my 4th year with a much more positive outlook on life but was only able to get my GPA to a 2.2 (I know..). \n\nAlthough! After I started picking myself up, I began doing research in an Alzheimer\u2019s lab where I gained some experience doing qualitative and quantitative analysis work. \n\nI also worked as a clinical assistant which involved administering cognitive and psychological tests to patients. \n\nI was a clinical research assistant which dealt with recruiting patients for a study whilst helping with REB submissions.\n\nI\u2019m also in the midst of writing two papers with another PI. One of which is about multiple sclerosis and I\u2019m the first author on this paper, the second being a paper I\u2019m co-authoring regarding Alzheimer\u2019s. \n\nAdditionally, I completed an independent research course in my final year. This involved writing a literature review with the supervision of a professor I worked closely with. I\u2019m currently assisting in his lab as well. \n\nI also have a plethora of other hobbies such as long distance cycling , marathon runner (42K), competitive tennis, etc... \n\nI have not written my GRE yet but have been studying vigorously for it. On practice tests I\u2019m getting around 96th percentile scores but want to continue to study until I feel comfortable. \n\nNow! I was wondering what would be the appropriate steps to take to perhaps land a PhD or even a Master\u2019s program in the States. I want to move back, specifically California but want to know what I should do to perhaps improve my chances ? Would schools even take into consideration of the events that happened during my undergrad? \n\nThank you for anybody who reached this part LOL",

            "content": "I've been accepted onto a PhD program in mathematics here in the UK, but I'm worried I'm making a big mistake by accepting it. I finished my undergrad a year ago, and I decided not to go straight into a MS/PhD program because A) I was burnt out and I was suffering from mental health issues, and B) I was very unsure of what I wanted to do, so I didn't want to jump into a big commitment like that.\n\nHowever, over the last year I've done very little, which hasn't helped my mental well-being. I worked in a financial role for a couple of months, but I hated it and left after I was recently offered a PhD at my old university. But now I'm worried I accepted it impulsively as a way to get out of my job and to make sure I'm doing something, otherwise I'm scared I would fall into a pit of depressed inertia and end up doing nothing for months or even years.\n\nI'm already in my mid-twenties, and I've been advised by PhD graduates to do it as soon as possible while I'm still young and don't have too many commitments, plus while I'm not tempted away by higher paying jobs.\n\nThe pros of the PhD program are:\n\n1. It's well within my ability, so I know I will be able to complete (i.e. it's a safe option).\n2. I was accepted onto it without a Master's, even though the min requirement was an MS (in the UK a lot of PhD programs require an MS, and even programs that officially don't require one still in practice only accept applicants with MS's, but the supervisor already knew me so they bypassed that). I doubt I'd get this opportunity again.\n3. I know the area quite well, and I already have a social network there.\n4. The area is pretty cheap, so I can afford to live pretty comfortably in a one-bedroom apartment (I'm pretty introverted, so I need to get away from people at the end of the day).\n5. I already know the supervisor and get on with them pretty well.\n6. It'll mean I'll only be in my late twenties by the time I finish, rather than being 30+ by the time I finish if I do a MS first and then do a 3/4-year PhD program at a higher-ranked school.\n\nThe cons are:\n\n1. I already spent 4 years there, so I may feel bored, trapped or missing out if I stay there for another 2.5 years (I'll probably live elsewhere while writing up my thesis). It's a pretty small town, so there's not much going on outside the university.\n2. The university's research ranking for mathematics isn't very high (it's not even in the top 30 for research quality in the UK). I've been told that the subject/research ranking of the university doesn't matter as much as your supervisor and their LoR, and after 5 years no one cares where you went. But I've also been told that there is an unspoken preference for higher-ranked schools in academia. Also, while no one may care about where you went years down the line, going to these schools may give you better access to academic connections in the first place, which propels your career forward while everyone else is left with the scraps. I've also heard that industry cares where you went to an extent, although the quality of your work is more important. I'm interested in working in the US in the future, so this might turn out to be a massive barrier.\n3. I'm worried I'm not reaching my full potential. I have the grades for more 'prestigious' universities like Cambridge, Oxford, Ivy League in US, etc. (I got 85%+, which is equivalent of a 4.0 GPA), though this would mean I wouldn't finish until my early 30's if I went down these routes.\n\nAm I making a mistake by accepting this? I doubt I would get onto a program like this again without doing a Master's first, so should I just accept the safe option? Or would it be better in the long run to do a MS first, then get onto a program at a higher-ranked university?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I\u2019m currently at one of the \u201cbig four\u201d tech companies in the Bay. \n\nI feel confident about my SOP so far, as well as my recommenders. But I\u2019m curious if I have a chance at a school like Berkeley or USC with my current stats and my undergrad institution? It\u2019s by no means a top school.\n\nWould appreciate anyone\u2019s thoughts... thank you!",

I don\u2019t worry about enjoying the process (I love school) I worry that it would ultimately not help me and delay the inevitable: that I have to take a PT Archives job to get my foot in the door (even with the degree!!) and hope and pray something full time opens up....\n\nThanks in advance for any insight!",

My gpa at graduation is around a 3.6, but my gpa for art history is around a 3.9. However on my transcripts, it doesn\u2019t parse out the gpa between the two.\n\nI\u2019m interested in applying to Cambridge\u2019s MPhil in History of Art, if possible stay there for DPhil or go to the States for a PhD. I\u2019ve narrowed a couple of possible advisors in the UK, although my dream job person and academic works in Poland.\n\nQuestions/anxieties:\n\nMy overall GPA is weak, as my school produces incredible amounts of 4.0 (with deflation) going straight to US/UK for grad school. Will admissions committees be able to focus mainly on my history of art courses?\n\nBy the time I start my MA, I\u2019ll be 28/29, and a good 5-6 years removed from my BA. This gap was due to a horrible health crisis during the first three years, but also I used the time to work on the languages needed for my region. I have work experience in art history, and will have 2-3 years of work in a globally recognized art gallery. However due to my health reasons, personal reasons, and my current minimal vacation allotted in my job, I have never been to this region I would like to study and have no direct on the ground experience. I hope to go there this year and establish more academic and professional connections but I just get stressed when thinking others might ask \u201cwhat took you so long\u201d? Am I too old for grad school?\n\nFinally, my ideal and very niche area of interest mixes IR and art history beautifully, which makes me feel I have to defend my 3.3ish IR GPA. My upper year research and area-based studies were all 4.0s, I just sadly have a few terrible courses in some of my core requirements. Should I then maybe get my master\u2019s first with strong grades, before I bring up my actual interest and dissertation topic for PhD?\n\nI will have strong LOR\u2019s from both academia and the museum world, certified foreign language testing/instructor history, decent work experience, and of course what I hope to be a strong PS and possible standardized testing scores.\n\nThank you!",

            "content": "Hey all, I\u2019m essentially at the peak of an anxiety crisis and I need some help making a decision about whether or not to apply this admissions cycle.\n\nAbout me: \n\nI was a chem major, graduated with a 3.3 GPA overall, but 3.7 for my last two years. I started research as an undergraduate at UCSB and secured a solid letter of rec from a prestigious PI during my 2 years of undergrad research in Bioengineering. I then was hired by UCSB as a research associate in their biotechnology department. I have spent the last year essentially running a research lab at UCSB, teaching undergraduates and collaborating with other labs to produce publications. So far I have my name on 2 papers which are out for review as we speak. Through my research job at UCSB, i secured another letter of rec from an emeritus prof here at the university who I\u2019m told is a huge deal across the globe. Finally my third letter of rec is from another superstar who is the head of the bioengineering department here at UCSB and is the most cited analytical chemist as of 2014. Weakness: really just my low GPA, i also got a D plus in differential equations, but this was during my first crappy two years at uni,  however once I was in upper division courses I truly excelled. I plan to apply for BioChem PHD programs as all my research has been in BioChem/Bioengineering. \n\nReasons I dont want to apply: My main issue with applying this cycle is that I\u2019m happy. I grew up pretty dirt poor in a desert and now I\u2019m living comfortably in sunny Santa bArbara with my best friends. I really just want to take some time to breath and enjoy my current living situation. Also I feel as though I\u2019m applying to schools simply because I know them. For example I want to apply to UCSB, Stanford, UCLA, UCI, and UC Berkeley,  MIT,  and UW but why? Some Just cause their in California. Don\u2019t get me wrong I have specific labs that interest me at each school, but I feel as though there are sooo many schools/ labs that I am potentially missing out on applying to because I haven\u2019t seen them/ have only been searching schools for the last 6 months. I spent a lot of time researching schools, but Ive only ever been in California so I\u2019m not too sure what\u2019s out there. Also with more time I\u2019d publish more papers and be even more attractive from an admissions stance. I feel I need to travel and really nail down my research focus. \n\nReasons I should apply this round:\n\n-My current PI, and arguably strongest letter of rec, is pretty old. Around 75 ish and I worry about him dying before I apply. He seems healthy, but you never know. \n-my brother is mentally handicapped and i know that if my parents die ill have to care for him so its important I am as successful as possible before that happens. (Parents are relatively healthy tho 50 ish) \n\n\nMy questions to you: based off my stats am i a strong candidate for grad school? Also, should I wait another year and apply in 2020, or say screw it and just send it now?\n\nI really appreciate any feedback, I feel so lost right now. Ive been struggling with this idea for soo long and its always on my mind.\n\nThanks a ton and I hope you have an excellent day.",

            "title": "What I've learned as a US student applying to UK - financials and prospects",
            "content": "I am a US student and I've just accepted a 1-year MSc offer in the UK. The program costs are high and I don't have funding since it's very difficult to acquire it as an international student. Nevertheless, I want to offer some encouragement to anyone who is pursuing an international degree in the fall or who are thinking of applying for one in the future.\n\nI'll start by listing the factors that motivated me to make this choice from most important to least important. I'll go into some detail as to why my list is organized this way. I'll then define what my plan is now, focusing on the financial aspect of it.\n\n* Advisor in my program whose research/specialty aligns with my own interests\n* How well-connected that advisor is to other members of the community, worldwide\n* The institution's reputation and agenda - ie, whether the institution has an overarching mission or leans towards a certain direction. Ex, plant conservation research. Reputation means how established are they within the community.\n* Resources at that institution/in the program\n* The community at that institution - how students and researchers feel about their work and how they collaborate with one another\n* Opportunities that are available at that institution. Ex, PhDs, postdocs, employment, etc.\n* Location and accessibility to things outside the educational experience - is it a city or the middle of nowhere?\n* Cost of tuition and cost of living\n* Availability for funding\n* Application costs and required materials for admission\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The most important factors fueling my choice have to do with my advisor and their work in the community. I was lucky to find someone who specializes in my field of interest and who encourages the success of their students. That person is also recognized within their community. If I decide to come back to the US after this UK MSc, I can approach my future PhD advisor with a personal connection despite having an international degree.\n\n\\- The institution's reputation is very important. Basically, a program can be fantastic but if no one has heard of the institution, that may be poorly received by employers or other institutions. I vouch for myself in a world that values names and connections by aligning myself with an organization or a university that represents certain values and achievements.\n\n\\- Resources are key to doing great work. If I'm investing money in my education, I want to make sure it pays off.\n\n\\- The community is also essential. At 24, I can't ignore social and emotional wellbeing. I've been through enough to know how important this factor is in fueling my motivation. If current students enjoy the program, then it's an indicator to me that it's worth it. If professors feel good about the program, then it's an indicator that it will pay off in the future because we can actually gain skills to collaborate with them.\n\n\\- To put it mildly, 2020 will be an exciting and interesting year for the US and the UK. As I monitor the situation here and overseas, I'm thinking about where I should do my PhD for the next 5-6 years. There are many things to consider as I look towards my future, so it couldn't hurt to know that the place where I make connections and study might also have potential opportunities for me after I graduate.\n\n\\- I can't stress location enough. My field is in the plant sciences and I do NOT want to be in the middle of Iowa someday. Period. Again, from personal experience, I know that I need the city life but also a way into the wilderness when I need it.\n\n\\- Finally, I get to the costs. You might be wondering why this isn't higher up on my list of priorities. I do care a lot about funds, however, my field is so narrow that I had to commit to an opportunity that will propel me forwards, regardless of the sacrifice. If all goes well, I will have a job that I enjoy and it will allow me to pay off my debts over time.\n\n\\- Applying to UK universities is much easier than applying to US universities. First of all, applications are often free. It's rare to pay for a UK or EU application. Second, GRE scores are not necessary. I didn't have time to take my GRE's before submitting my app, so that effectively barred me from applying to US universities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's my current financial situation:\n\nTuition, cost of living, etc: $45-55k.\n\nAs I said before, I don't have funding. I applied to one source - a full scholarship available through my university - but I didn't put my bets on getting it. I wasn't awarded the scholarship, so my plan is to take out a full FAFSA Graduate Plus loan. These are standard loans and most students are awarded the full amount. I can choose to take the full amount or not; I am still figuring out my budget and taking into account the conversion rate and the economic projections given the political climate.\n\nI considered applying to scholarships, but given my major there aren't many major-specific ones out there and competition for these and all others will be high. Applications are also a major time drain. I went through the process before and I came out feeling that it wasn't for me. I still have a lot of work to do this summer before starting this program, so this option isn't realistic.\n\nOk, here comes the fun part. It's a pie-in-the-sky idea, but there really aren't any other options for funding besides this one. Essentially, I decided I was going to network. I intern at a relatively prominent institution with a new director. He's nice to interns, knows us all by name and encourages networking. When I heard about the outcome of the scholarship, I immediately set up an appointment with him. My plan is to approach him with my situation, explain what I'm aiming to do in the future and see if he knows anyone who might be willing and able to help me out. I have never tried this before, but I have 2 friends who were successful in acquiring some funding this way. It really can't hurt to ask.\n\nI actually do have a somewhat similar experience. When I applied for my undergrad, I had 10 offers and I compared offers between institutions to get a competitive offer at my choice school. In that case, it's critical to note that my bargaining chip was me. I had awards and achievements to back up my requests, and the institutions that gave me more money valued what I was offering. In this case, I am relying on three factors to back me up: the first is my previous experience, the second is the outcome of my summer work (I'll be presenting this to the board of trustees that funded my internship in late August), and the third is the reputation and the promise of the institution I am entering. I'm keeping an air of realism here and again, not putting my bets on this working out. Still, I thought I'd share this idea with the community since it technically could work out, if executed properly (and with a great deal of luck and positioning).\n\nAnd that's it. I'll leave an update on how this goes. I'll be contacting several organizations I've been a part of, not just this one. I encourage questions or advice as I move forward with this. I hope this might help someone or encourage someone to pursue international study as an option, despite the challenges. Traveling really is an important experience.",

            "content": "I'm currently an undergraduate student graduating Spring 2020 and am hoping to start an MS in Computer science in fall 2020. Here's my school stuff:\n\n**Degree Programs**: BA in Economics, BA in Computer Science on partial scholarships from a state school.\n\n**GPA**: 3.70, **CS GPA**: 3.6\n\n**GRE**: Have not taken yet. Taking twice this Fall.\n\n**Work experience**: Substitute teacher in public education and a stadium usher for 2 years until this summer started.\n\nI'm a bit concerned about my chances of getting admitted to any program. I was originally intent on going for engineering when I started high school. However, when I was a freshman in high school, my dad cheated on my mom, causing a lot of family trauma for my high school time and I couldn't focus. I went away for 1st year on a partial scholarship mostly to leave behind the family trauma and was an undeclared major, so just got an AA and stayed in my dorm most days.\n\nWhile I was away at school, my dad had lost his job and was out of work for a year and I couldn't afford to stay away at school. I also had a family member fall ill, she was broke and my family is small, so that sucked until she passed away in December. I had to come home and work these 2 jobs up until now because my parents didn't have a car to give me. For most of my time at school, I really didn't know what I wanted to do. In high school, I wanted to do engineering, but I had some poor experiences in clubs and stuff that made me unhappy.\n\nHowever, last summer, I took a first-year CS course that i did well in and enjoyed, so I decided to do an extra degree in it since I was already on track to graduate in just 3 years. Although it's a CS degree, I'm a little concerned because it's a BA and it isn't ABET-accredited, bit it's the same as my school's BS just without physics, science electives, and Calc I, II, and a stats class. I already have Calc I and II from AP credits though and I took a stats class in undergrad and got an A. I'm also taking linear algebra next spring, so I'm a little less worried in the math sense.\n\nI don't have any research and work experience in CS and it also concerns me. I was hoping working as a teacher could maybe help make up for that as I really only got into CS last summer and haven't had much free time until now. I'm kind of running out of time to apply for fall internships too.\n\nI don't really know if I'm a good candidate for research because it kind of intimidates me and I really don't have any close relationships with any professors. I would like to do research, but I just don't see myself as competitive enough and I don't even know like how to approach it. I've applied for some research assistantships for the fall, but I was thinking maybe I should try to focus more on internships. I have a friend who might be able to help me secure an internship this fall.\n\nIf I did want to go for the accredited BS, it would take 2 more semesters and cost me like $12k because I wasted a lot of classes in undergrad since I didn't know what I wanted to do until last summer.\n\nI'm hoping to just get a Masters because I would finally be able to focus on my education only at that point and I really do enjoy CS. I've thought to about teaching undergrad courses since I've got teaching experience. But at the same, I don't really know if that's a good letter of intent.\n\n*I'm sorry if I sound self-indulging or full of excuses.* I have a small family, and my dad screwed me up badly a few years ago. My family is small and got smaller after someone passed last year. It all kind of made me really like lose belief in myself. I kinda really wasn't so badly affected by this until like a month ago. Like this whole family trauma kinda came back now as I see others graduating and securing internships. It's just been hard for me recently to just get out of bed and sit down and do work. I've been borderline hanging with the wrong crowd too, lately. Like I just look at others going far and then I look at me and I just feel I can't do it at times because I've seemingly wasted like 3 years just to pick up after my dad and my parents have struggled just to keep their jobs since I started college, it's not like they're doctors and engineers. I'm not really intent on applying to any top-tier schools since I don't think I stand a chance and I am not really intent on doing loans since I could stay local for free if I am admitted. I'm trying so hard to still believe I have a chance at a graduate admission and just in education in general as I actually would like to be a very talented software engineer, but my circumstances have made me think otherwise. I just really don't know where I stand as I've made other posts where people say I actually am looking better than most, but I'm not too sure.\n\nSorry for the long post. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

I still have no idea if I want to do a Masters program first, or just jump into a PhD. I plan to apply to in-state schools that are involved in research I find interesting. \n\nThe main reasons I am considering a PhD over Masters are 1) I\u2019d get paid to do research instead of paying a similar amount for Masters, and 2) one of the local PhD microbiology programs have a faculty member working on a subject I find VERY interesting, but according to the schools website, no Masters degree in microbiology is offered. This subject is extremely interesting to me and is also directly related to the area of microbiology I want to focus on in the future. I feel like this is absolutely perfect for me, but sometimes I second-guess myself when it comes to confidence/dedication regarding school or the lab.

Came back home to take care of my mom and get my shit together at a CC. Now am enrolled at a local university. \n\n\nUNDERGRAD INSTITUTION:\n-Completely average. Not awful but definitely nothing special. \n\n\nGRE:\n-Have not taken yet. I am a good test taker and had a high ACT score in high school, if any of that means anything. \n\n\nRESEARCH:\n-Have been apart of the same lab since the start of the 2018 academic year. Mentor wants me to stay in this lab until graduation (05/2020). \n\n-Completed two separate research programs offered by my university. One during the entire 2018-2019 academic year and another program I am currently completing this summer. \n\n-Both programs included proposals, poster creation & presentation at symposiums, seminars, workshops, and networking. \n\n\nLEADERSHIP:\n-Got accepted to be a peer mentor in the upcoming academic year for a group of students doing research through the university program I finished in May.  \n\n\nJOBS: \n-Several miscellaneous blue-collar jobs while in school, including a 4-year long summer job I started in high school. \n\n-Currently mow grass for a local golf course\n\n\n\nOne huge part missing in my application will be a lack of certain science courses. I took advanced chemistry my freshman year and haven\u2019t had to take a physics course. Will that play a large role in whether or not I get accepted to either program?

The nearest unis are both about an hour drive from me.\n\nI have received a job offer working with youth in an education setting (I want my focus to be in child clinical or something of that nature). It\u2019s also about an hour drive from where I live. Recently, I started reaching out to professors at the unis closest and I\u2019ve received 2 offers to do research, though one of the labs is hardly related to the research I want to be doing (again, involving youth and MI). The other lab is a decent fit, it\u2019s a health and aging lab and they just received funding for a youth-focused health program project. This faculty is willing to pay me for part time research, which is good.\n\nThe thing is that I need to work to make a living. My significant other has a really good job and says he can pay for things while I focus on getting what I need for grad school, but I feel guilty and I'm the type of person who does not want to be dependent on others financially. I\u2019m concerned that if I take the job, I won't have any time to dedicate to research since it'll be full time and a drive from where I live, plus a drive to the research sites. But the part time research position most likely won't pay me substantial amounts of money, though it would be really good experience for me.\n\nI'm just not sure what to prioritize for getting into the clinical psych programs. I know research is important, but should it be my priority here?",

            "content": "I will be applying to PsyD programs this upcoming fall.  I am at a loss who to realistically ask. \n\nBackground: My undergrad was non traditional in the sense that I had to take 2 breaks (one spanning a semester and one spanning 4 semesters) due to illness. My mom was released from prison my sophomore year after a decade, so I spent my time outside of class spending time with her to \u201cmake up\u201d for lost time.  And my junior year I lost my mother, I found her and it greatly affected me for the remainder of my undergrad. All of these events during my undergrad resulted in my not spending much time committed to doing extra-curriculars and no research (aside from a basic intro to research in psychology course). I dabbled in some clubs such as NAMI and disability advocacy on campus. I\u2019m currently taking a gap year, I am working as a mental health tech with adolescent youth with mental health and behavioral issues for the past 8 months.  My GPA is 3.9 overall, with a 3.96 in my psychology courses. I graduated with a BS in psychology, minoring anthropology. My GRE scores are Q:158, V:156, and have yet to receive my writing, but am expecting a 5-5.5. \n\nSo, basically I never needed help from professors and due to life circumstances I didn\u2019t take a huge effort to see them out of class. I know I am memorable in the fact that I attended school with my assistance dog, should I mention that in emails to the professors I chose to ask for LoR? But, I did actively participate during class, such as answering questions and asking questions. And always sat near the front and was obviously attentive, and never missed any lectures.  \n\nBasically my question is should I just randomly chose a couple that taught my psychology courses and just see what happens. Another issue is that many courses were taught by graduate students which I\u2019m unsure the appropriateness to use them as references. And should I mention circumstances of why I wasn\u2019t actively involved in office hours, research, etc., to them or inappropriate?\n\nOne professor who I know was impressed by me was during my freshman year when I was biology major at my first school (transferred after freshman year), she actively recruited me to be her assistant in grading papers. And i attended all her evening study sessions she provided and was very active in helping other students. She was my reference for when I transferred schools. This was in 2012, would it be too long ago or inappropriate to request from her. Also, she is a biology professor, not psychology. Would it be okay to hypothetically get one from her and get the remaining two from psychology faculty? \nAlso, my manager at my current work place is out of the question, they are notorious for giving out bad recommendations and claiming they don\u2019t know you to avoid you leaving the company due to their chronic understaffing. I wouldn\u2019t trust anyone their to something as important as letters of rec.\n\nThank you for any advice given.",

            "content": "Hello,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I have just recently graduated with my undergraduate degree. I had a really great undergraduate career. I started off pretty roughly in undergrad due to family issues but was able to then grow as an academic. I excelled and did well in my classes and was even inducted into the honor society for my major. A semester before my final semester in undergrad I was kicked out of my house because my parents found out that I was gay. This really shook me and it affected my grades in my last semester. I ended up graduating with a 2.8 GPA when I had a 3.0 before and was planning and trying to raise that. While I was in undergrad I was heavily involved and held various leadership positions and was well known on my campus for being someone who works hard.    \n\n\nNow since I was so well known one of my professor recommended me to apply for a Masters program with the same university that I completed my undergrad with. I was recommended to the program by my professor and was contacted by that department. Since I was so eager to continue my education I applied and was accepted with some scholarships. The only thing is this Masters programs is in an area that I can do well in and have some interest, I would rather study something else. But since this was basically my only option especially so late in the year already I took and applied. All the other deadlines ti places have passed and I wouldn't even be considered.  \n\n\nMy question is in order to be accepted into a Masters program of my choice, with an assistantship or fellowship that would pay for me to go, should I do a year in this Masters program and work hard and get high marks then look to transfer to somewhere else? Will having a graduate level GPA help me to prove that I am ready for graduate programs, will having that high level graduate GPA show that my low undergrad GPA was only due to the external misfortunate that happened to me. Will this help to show that I am hard working and serious about my academic career?  \n\n\nOr would it be more beneficial for me to focus on getting a job, work hard in my job and work on writing publications and conducting research that I can present at conferences and hopefully get published to improve my academic resume that way. So this way I would still be improving my academic resume but outside of the classroom.  \n\n\nWhich would be more beneficial for me to do in order to be able to apply and get accepted in my program of choice will full funding preferably?   \n\n\nI'm really torn over this and just want to do what's best in order for me to continue with my academic career and pursue what I love learning.   \n\n\n\\[I am studying communication/media studies - I am in the humanities / social sciences field - not a med or engineering or business student just to clarify in case that helps to understand my questions more.\\]",

            "content": "  \n\nHi! I really hope this is the right place for this. \n\nI was hoping to apply to PsyD/PhD programs for the fall of 2020, but looking at some of these stats, I\u2019m realizing that I\u2019m not a particularly competitive candidate. To have a shot at the kind of school that I\u2019d like to go to, I am going to need to get an MA/MSc first. However, I do not know where to begin. \n\nI am not finding many MAs or MScs in Clinical Psychology; there are even fewer that interest me. I do not plan to practice with a master\u2019s degree, and I am not at all interested in the populations that they seemed geared towards (ex. school counseling or marriage counseling). I am hoping to get more research experience, some posters, and hopefully some publications under my belt. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that I am very poor (like, I live off of welfare), and funding is very important. I am willing to take out loans, but I am not willing to get into 400,000 dollars of debt (I\u2019m looking at you, University of Denver). \n\nI need to be a very competitive applicant and I was hoping for some advice on how to beef up my CV, where to apply, and whether or not I even have a shot in the dark at some of the better MSc/MAs. \n\nStats: \n\n**Anticipated graduation**: May 2020\n\n**Majors**: Psychology\n\nEnglish\n\nClassics (concentration in ancient Greek language and literature). \n\n**GPA**: 4.0 (although it might drop to a 3.9 after I\u2019m through with this advanced research methods course; I anticipate an A-, but I am working for an A)\n\n**Undergrad institution**: Middling. It will neither help nor hurt my chances, I think. \n\n**GRE**: My GRE was bad. I am retaking it in September. My verbal was 168, but my quantitative was dismal. Shooting for a 156 (63rd percentile). \n\n**Research experience**: I am currently an RA in a psycholinguistics lab which focuses on language acquisition in infants. I will start as an RA in a depression research and treatment lab in the fall (I am already hired, but they didn\u2019t need me over the summer). \n\nI have been accepted into my university\u2019s \\~honor\u2019s psychology program,\\~ which is fairly competitive. I will be designing and conducting my own study in the psycholinguistics lab on errors in accented speech, and if my results are significant, I plan to submit for publishing (which is probably irrelevant, since applications are due well before I'll finish my thesis). \n\nMy lab supervisor told me today that he would help me get authorship on a poster during the fall semester, but it is unlikely that it will be official in time for applications. \n\n**Clinical experience**: I am currently interning with a community housing program that works with SPMI populations and the chronically homeless. I work directly with clients in the intake process, as well as attending home visits. I will have 120 hours of clinical experience by the end of the summer. I am in the process of becoming a crisis counselor for crisis text line.\n\n**Honors**: Phi Beta Kappa, Dean\u2019s list, blah blah blah. I have won a lot of awards in the English and the Classics department, but I can\u2019t imagine those are even remotely relevant. \n\n**Misc**.: I worked in the writing lab as a tutor, and I presented at a conference in 2018 (but the topic was translation and transmission in Sappho fragment 31, so it isn\u2019t all that relevant). \n\nI want to work with SPMI and trauma. I am particularly interested in the biological underpinnings of Bipolar 1 (I love neuropsychology, but I do not have a strong background in biological sciences). \n\n**Complications**: an entire semester of medical withdrawals in 2015, and two Rs on my transcript (Chaucer and Latin 101, which I retook and got an A). I am also a new psychology major, so my transcript may seem a little...unfocused. \n\nHelp; I am an anxious mess about this at all times and I do not know where to go from here ;o;",

I did not really do well in my other classes either, and ended up with a sub 3 GPA. I decided to work in the service industry for a few years while I saved up and could afford my own schooling (my parents paid for my previous school and were pretty controlling over my education). I started school again 2 years ago to try and finish my degree and I\u2019ve been doing pretty well, right now with a 3.82 GPA while working full time to support myself, and can potentially raise this to a 3.9 if I get straight A\u2019s for the rest of my time in undergrad.

I want to do something in psych, so a master's is kind of a must in the field.\n\nWeird thing is, is that I almost felt better being in undergrad than I do right now because I had so many resources through the university. One of the main reasons I even went to college was to get out of my hometown and away from my family, but now I'm back with my family. I can't live away from my family without being in school or having a higher degree so I can get a better job. But seeing how my undergrad went, I don't want my main motivation for grad school to be just to get out of here again. It feels like a weird catch situation where I can't afford to live away from my family without grad school, but I'm not confident I'd be able to handle grad school without getting away from my family first. It seems better to just save up for a year and apply for next year so I can just get started and get out, hoping that I can handle it all with a few months of preparation.",

I am interested in data storage and security which this program has a lot of courses in, how do I go about expanding on that. I also tried looking for research the faculty in this program has done and haven't found any, I couldn't even find what courses each professor teaches or even which professors teach the graduate courses, just which professors are in Informatics department in general.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My SOP**\n\n \n\nShortly after my bar mitzvah had passed, the thought of what I was going to do with the rest of my life as a \u201cman\u201d was rattling around in my brain. My parents had always pushed me to become a doctor or a lawyer but for whatever reason, that just wasn\u2019t resonating with me. I had always been, to put it mildly, a tad idealistic. My primary concern when deciding on an occupation was not how much money I would make, but on how big of a scale I could affect peoples lives and on how quickly I could start. Since I was only 13 and had very little money at my disposal the best option I could find was being a programmer. \n\nWhenever I look back on my life as a programmer I tend to divide it into 3 segments, each segment is comprised of a major project I have worked on surrounded by new skills, languages, technologies, and experiences I have picked up along the way. My first segment (13-15 years old) was centered around building a website where small businesses were able to post job opportunities for low skilled workers. This segment was perhaps my most informative and my most sobering of all. Throughout these three years, I had been introduced to fundamental database architectural and core UI principals such as simplicity of design and seamless navigation. My second segment (16-19 years old) was centered around an on-demand delivery startup I had created in my area. I had spent these years educating myself on the importance of data storage and encryption, streamlined efficiency, and managing as well as working alongside a team. My last segment (20-Present) is something that I am currently in the midst of. I had recently finished the making of an iOS application that allows users to store and organize content from all other apps in one location. These were perhaps my most challenging years as I had just been introduced to Object-Oriented Programming for the first time, JSON databasing, integrating 3rd party libraries and APIs, and data analytics.\n\nIn my most recent years I found that I grown more and more interested in data analytics, storage, and security. We are approximately 50 years into the age of information and we can clearly see the effects of using or misusing data to skew non-suspecting users to make decisions without even realizing they are being coerced. Google and Facebook are able to manipulate users to increase usage of their products by analyzing the data of how users operate and what they respond to. User data is the backbone or AI and machine learning software which is being utilized by growing businesses every year to increase sales and keep customers coming back. Holding such a powerful resource like data is bound to have a lot of malevolent actors looking to steal it, we\u2019ve seen this with the hacking of Equifax's servers. I am no stranger to the importance of data storage and analysis. The success of my most recent work, my iOS application, is heavily dependent on the conclusions I can derive from how my users use the app. Aspects such as response time, conversions and retention rates, repeated viewing of certain pages, content stored, etc. are all informative measures that help me improve, add or remove various features for an overall greater experience. \n\nAs a student at UAlbany I found that I had a fairly easy time completing the course work for most of my classes relating to my major and for my other, more challenging courses I was anything but discouraged when facing a difficult topic. I found myself almost effortlessly excelling in classes relating to web development, OOP, data management, database architecture, and Agile methodologies. Unfortunately, my initial transition into UAlbany was a bit of a challenge to say the least. Due to this I experienced poor grades my freshman year which had a lasting impact on my cumulative GPA. However I would like to point out that I averaged a 3.87 and a 3.38 for my Junior and Senior years, respectively. I had also averaged a 3.49 GPA for my Informatics and Computer Science courses in my final two and a half years. Transitioning from high school to college, or more accurately from teenager to young adult, was definitely a struggle for me. But if I learned anything as an undergraduate it is that responsibility, self-reliance, and time management are not qualities to be taken lightly. I understand how it feels to make up for past mistakes and I do not plan on making those mistakes again.",

            "content": "I obtained a 4-year undergraduate degree in biochemistry last year (Spring 2018). The most enjoyable aspect of my program was completing my honors thesis, so much so that, in my fourth year, I began to be neglectful in most dimensions of normal independent living. I would remain in my office to research, copy-edit, and proofread late into the evening, which, in addition to my labs and coursework, resulted in \\~14-16 hour 'work' days for several months. In this final semester, I had considered myself focused, clairvoyant, and invulnerable, and I figured that if I desired a future in academic research, I mustn't neglect any opportunity to advance my understanding of an interesting subject. To my despair, a dear friend shockingly committed suicide in the summer of 2018, which distressed me greatly and left me in a state of considerable guilt of negligence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents and I agreed that a \"mental health\" break was apposite. I'm now 23 years old, and I've had no further education, employment, or training since last summer. In the immediate-term, financially speaking, this was no issue, as my parents had agreed to pay my bills. However, in the past year, my depression was exacerbated by a recrudescent sleep disorder associated with exceedingly painful headaches. I attempted suicide several times because of this. Last month, I was prescribed an effective medicine for this disorder, and have since made a partial recovery. Although I'm still reeling from the events of this past year, I now hope to pick up my education where I left it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is simple: how do I explain this situation to a potential supervisor? I'm concerned that few would *take a risk* on a student prone to mental health issues.  I believe in myself and I have the grades, recommendations, and strong statement of intent to back it up. I want to be transparent and honest about my background, but would prefer not to put myself in a position where potential supervisors are hesitant about accepting me because of it.\n\nThank you in advance for your responses!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those who care: I'm currently interested in the physics of complex biomolecules like RNA, more specifically in single-molecule force-extension experiments, kinetic proofreading schema, and structural folding intermediates of functional RNAs.

In chronological order, I volunteered for a psych lab for a summer and a semester where I coded experiments, I would have continued but then I had my first mental breakdown.

Then I volunteered at a lab for a year and a half but the only duties they gave me were clerical in nature like ordering supplies, taking inventory, and scheduling.

Forgive the lengthiness but I wanted to be thorough about my situation for better guidance!\n\nI'm 25 and live in Atlanta. I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Communication Studies in 2016 with 3.89 GPA. Since then, I did some retail and am currently a project manager at a professional development consulting firm. I always knew grad school was in the cards but didn't know exactly what that would look like. I've since discovered [this MS-HCI program at Georgia Tech](http://mshci.gatech.edu/program/about) (which I live very close to). I'm interested in the psychology specialization in particular and projects surrounding computer-mediated learning and training.\n\n(Long story short, in high school, I was really interested in careers in tech and took tons of coding and digital design classes but talked myself out of it for university. I have a lot of regrets over that decision. Well, what better time than now to try and get back into it?)\n\nThe program only admits for fall, but I don't think I'll be prepared with a good application by 2020 so I'm planning on trying for fall 2021. That gives me until February 2021 to put a game plan in action.\n\nSo now, I'm trying to figure out what else I can do to make myself a competitive applicant. I don't have any lab experience so I was planning to inquire about volunteering with a GT lab that's working on relevant research. I'd hopefully make some connections at the same time. I was also looking at a couple of graduate certificates at Georgia State University that might be relevant to my interests such as [this one in Instructional Design & Technology](https://education.gsu.edu/program/gcert-instructional-design-technology/) and this one in [Online Learning](https://education.gsu.edu/program/gcert-online-learning-design-development/). [GT has psych certificates too](https://www.psychology.gatech.edu/undergraduate/certificates). My thought was that I could get some relevant schoolwork on my resume/CV while hopefully making a connection or two. I'm genuinely interested in the programs, but just don't know how helpful they would be for my end goal of getting into the GT program.\n\nIn my personal time, in addition to the obvious preparation for a great GRE score, I'd consider some self-guided learning on Coursera, Udemy, Codeacademy, etc. but I'm not sure exactly what that'd look like.\n\nProfessionally, my job is sufficient money with benefits and a great location, but it only somewhat relates to my academic interests. I'd be open to looking at other work if it would get me more on my way. (Going part-time here and finding a second part-time gig is also an option.)\n\nI would love to hear other ideas on what to incorporate into my game plan. I may very well be overestimating how difficult it will be to jump from liberal arts to STEM. Your honest thoughts and comments are super appreciated!

            "content": "Hello! and thank you in advance for any sight you can provide for the situation I'm in. Sorry for the length.\n\nBasically, I graduated college in 2011 with a BA from a U.S. state university (as an international student), took a break from school for 5 years for military service, attended a master's program but dropped out eventually. Since then I've been working, but I'm hoping to restart grad school in a different field than what I've been involved in.\n\nA longer story:\n\nI graduated with a BA in history and psychology. After graduation I took a break from my academic career and spent 5 years in the military.\n\nRight after retirement I started a history master's program in Europe, but the important thing about this is that I dropped out before my last semester. The program was just not what I thought I was getting into, and it took me too long to realize that.\n\nSince then I've joined a small startup company I had co-founded a couple years back. We work with universities to make tools (toys, etc) and educational programs for children and the cognitive impaired elderly to help with cognitive rehabilitation. The company is doing okay and the work is fine for me for the moment, but I'm not passionate about it, I don't see myself as a business kind of person, and I have no intention of continuing for long.\n\nSo again I'm hoping to restart my academic career but in a different field than what I was involved with so far.  Even with master's program I dropped out of, I enjoyed the learning process that came from coursework, got good grades, got scholarships, and was very interested  in the research aspect of graduate work; I just wasn't happy with the more practical aspects of the program or the university. So I really do want to give grad school another try and I definitely feel more prepared than before.\n\nMy problem is, in addition to my past as a grad school dropout, that I have practically no research background in the new field I want to go into (psychology) other than what my bachelor's degree in psychology entails.\n\nMy main interest is cognitive psychology and human factors (human-technology interaction in a complex, high-risk, high-stress environment.) I was involved in airfield and air traffic management as an officer while I was in the military, so I at least have some work experience managing human factors in terms of occupational safety. This experience is also partly why I became interested in pursuing this area of psychology, but I don't even think this particular experience will count as a relevant work experience for grad school admissions.\n\nSo basically all of my undergraduate research work is in history and is also pretty limited (it's without any field work, within the scope of the degree curriculum (thesis research, capstone, etc)). And of course, research experience in history is very different from that in experimental psychology. The only lab experience I have is from taking those major requirement courses (research methods, experimental psych lab, etc.) which all undergrad psych majors must take anyway.\n\nMy master's program was an interdisciplinary degree that was somewhat flexible yet heavily focused on anthropology and history, so what little \"research\" experience I gained from the 3 semesters I attended is also anthro and history related. One that is remotely close to psychology was writing a supervised independent research in medical anthropology\n\nAlso, naturally, all of my academic references will be my undergraduate/graduate history or anthropology professors.\n\nHere are some stats:\n\n\\- I'll 30 if I get to start grad school in fall 2020.\n\n\\- GPA : 3.61 (undergrad, psychology major 3.80), 29.3 out of 30 (average of graduate level courses taken)I've taken some CS/IT related courses (programming, data science, etc) but they were not graded\n\n\\- GRE : Got 164 V, 156 Q (sigh), 5.5 AW in 2016. Will take a new exam soon, hoping for 165+V, 162+Q.\n\n\\- University scholarship worth about 25,000 USD (from when I was enrolled in a master's program), a few government grants but all of them are non-academic\n\n\\- No publication (haha nervous sweating)\n\nI am a little (just a little) terrified because I understand previous related research experience and good LoR's from professors that supervised your research work are crucial to being accepted into a PhD program, and I am definitely worried that I might not get accepted anywhere. (I'm not self-funded and I do need as much funding as I can get.)\n\nWhat do you think my chances will be if I apply to cognitive psychology or human factors PhD programs with me having basically no related academic research experience?\n\nIs there anything I can do at all to boost my chance of being accepted to a PhD program? (Getting work as a research assistant will be out of question unless I quit my current job.)\n\nShould I even bother trying to go for a PhD program, or should I first consider a MA/MS in psychology to gain psych related research experience, and then move on to PhD program after getting my master's?(This a real option I've considered, but it's a plan B only. I am hesitant because I know that master's programs are seldom funded, and even when I do get into a PhD program later, my MA/MS will not likely shorten the duration of the PhD program. I'd be in my late 30's by the time I finish everything!)\n\nI apologize for another \"what are my chances\" long post, but if anyone is willing to give any advice, it would be really appreciated. I'm pretty desperate!",

I will be able to finish in 3 years and I am 19 years old currently (I'll be 20 if I start grad school next year.) Not sure If schools might think I'm too young and inexperienced. I dont want to apply for an M.S. since I want to be a senior researcher, my advisor thinks I should just aim for a Ph.D. and an M.S. is a lot of money.

I don't want to waste time applying to programs I have no shot at but am really unsure where I stand or if I should even pursue grad school at all post-undergrad.\n\nBasically I am enrolled in a dual degree program at a top-10 school in engineering (BME) and music performance. I have the classic story of small town high school valedictorian crashes and burns in first year at ivy but I kind of never really recovered. With the dual degree being very intense, I became an extremely average student and I'm not really sure if it's because it's harder or because I just got a little lazy tbh. In the summer after my 3rd year out of 5 (dual degree) my GPA is a 3.4 (not bad I know) but it is HEAVILY inflated by music classes. I have not calculated my \"science\" GPA because that honestly terrifies me but I've already made 5 C's and a D in intro-science/engineering courses. I've really been trying to show upward trajectory but I really haven't been able to because of a rather unlucky series of circumstances... after finally adjusting to my school in terms of academics, this year I got diagnosed with ADHD and depression all at once and then later diagnosed with a serious chronic illness which really affected my schoolwork because not only was I sick but also had to figure out how to get access to the treatment due to an unsupportive family.... blah blah blah i'm sure so many people have shared similar stories and I know I'm not special but it still severely impacted my college experience and I'm just not sure where to move at this point or if that would maybe be taken into account with admissions. I also don't really have consistent lab experience because I'm so busy during the year w/ dual degree that a lot of labs wont take me; I won a research grant my freshman summer but my professor ended up not getting tenure and leaving which really fucked me over. I'm now working on another research grant this summer but in the private industry, so I'm not sure if it would be too late for me to get enough research in on one project before I graduate to impress PhD programs (BME or MechE) and make up for my academic losses. \n\nI'm considering applying to master's programs too but I honestly think I will try to go into industry before doing a masters if I'm not initially accepted to PhD programs to save up money. In my head, I feel like i've already fucked up too much to ever be able to get a good job or get into a good graduate program, so any words of advice or ways I could move forward would be so so helpful for me.

Medication failed to control it and it affects my ability, on occasion, to attend classes or look at screens. For many years I did not know this was considered a disability and so I talked to professors one-on-one about my condition. Most were clear in stating that they believed I had made this up and was faking it to get out of having to attend class. Many would require doctors notes for every bout, which isn't practical or fair to my doctor (I did have a strongly worded letter from her that I would show them but I couldn't get a letter every single time it it). I often failed classes based on attendance alone. \n\nWhile I had looked into the Students with Disabilities office, I had originally been told I didn't qualify. But by late 2015 I was in danger of losing my Pell grants and an advisor finally suggested I revisit that option. This time, I was told it had qualified as a disability all along. My grades shot up. I won a competitive scholarship. I studied abroad to great success. I got an internship with the Department of State, then a job with the Ministry of Education of Chile. Finally, I got into and served in the Peace Corps where I went for a leadership position on their Diversity & Inclusion Board. My job performance has been good, and now that I'm armed with the knowledge of my disability and my rights I have had no further major issues.\n\nBut my GPA is still a disaster. I have 3 semesters of straight failing grades and a bunch of Ws in the semester before that. My overall GPA is a 2.4. \n\nApplying for graduate school I feel my work experience is decent and proves I have a good work ethic. My program manager and country director are both writing me letters of recommendation, as well as a professor from my school who headed the program in which I minored. But the GPA haunts me.\n\nI've thought about writing a letter addressing this issue head-on and attaching it as an addendum. What would I call it? Letter Explaining Poor GPA? I did address this issue head-on in my application for Peace Corps but I framed it a lot differently to suit that role. \n\nI've also considered addressing it in my statement of interest-- I want to work specifically in diversity and inclusion partly because of my own struggles and experiences. Is that a better place to put it? Or perhaps opening with my sad failure really isn't a great idea for my introductory letter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do y'all think? Any ideas is greatly appreciated.",

For background, I am applying to CS PhD programs and I am now a double major in math and computer science. I have attended three institutions:\n\n1. College A (15-16). I was during my senior year of high school. In my state, we can get college and high school credit at College A. I got about a 3.0 there, however I dropped classes Winter Quarter after a major injury. \n2. University B (16-17). I got a 1.55 my first quarter, withdrew my second quarter, and got a 3.0 my third quarter. University B is a top 10 state school in my field. My biggest concern is that I took calculus 3 at University B twice, where I received a 1.5 then a 2.6. Additionally, I took my first CS course where I got a 3.4. *The summer following this, I enrolled back at College A to take a second programming course, but did not pay my tuition and surprisingly failed the course instead of getting kicked out. I am currently working on fixing this issue.* \n3. University C (17-20).  University C is a smaller state school. My grades improved very suddenly after starting here, and I have gotten around a  \\~3.95 each quarter. I am able to graduate from this University in three years with a double major, as I have taken a full load of classes every quarter (and have occasionally taken more). Two gen eds, Calculus II and III, and my first CS courses are the only courses I took at the prior Universities which are used towards my graduation at University C.\n\nOver the past two years, I have accumulated research experience and some awards that I believe to give me a fairly good application. I believe that I will have fairly good recommendations as well, including one from the chair of a high ranking math program from an REU I did. The biggest flaw in my application is likely my very poor grades in the past. However, I do have an explanation for this.\n\nIn Winter of 2016, while at College A, I had a major ski accident which lead to multiple injuries. I couldn't walk, so I dropped most of my classes. The financial burden of the surgery and physical therapy impacted my parents marriage, and I felt extremely guilty. When I went off to University B, I began to work full time for a company that would pay for my tuition. However, the work was physical and I wasn't completely healed, so I was often in pain and subsequently didn't do well in school. I moved three times that year, each time to a cheaper location. There were times when I was between housing where I slept in the library at University B. Finally, I took the CS course spring quarter, and decided to transfer to the smaller (and cheaper) University C to pursue CS. \n\nIn addition to the information above, I will also mention that I have been diagnosed with complex post traumatic stress disorder due to some unfortunate occurrences from my childhood. All of the poor effects that the ski accident had on my life were likely avoidable, however during this time in my life I was terrified of failure so I just tried to do the bare minimum to function. I have since received a lot of treatment for the PTSD and I no longer believe it effects my life. This leads me to the following questions:\n\n1. In how much depth should I explain my injuries and poor grades? Should I mention it in my SOP, should I have a letter writer mention it, or both? \n2. Should I mention the c-PTSD? I am leaning towards no on this one, mostly because I don't want other people to know.  I also think it might be too much information.\n3. How much does this negatively impact my application? Do I even have a shot at applying to University B?\n\nThank you to anyone who reads this entire post, I really appreciate it.\n\n**Tl;dr. I got REALLY bad grades due to personal reasons, then I got REALLY good grades. How should I explain this in my SOP or through my letter writers?**",

            "content": "I'm asking here because I honestly have no idea what I should be considering a reach school, what's \"in my range\", and what I should be considering a safety school, and with the GREs only a couple months away, I really need to figure out where I should be sending my scores. For reference, I'm an Asian male physics major at a very large Midwest institution. It's a state school in the top fifty for physics in the country. My credentials are okay, but a lot of my friends have much stronger applications (one has six research publications, six! And she thinks she won't get in anywhere!!) and I'm worried because they're freaking out that they won't get in anywhere, and if they don't get in anywhere there's NO chance I'm getting in anywhere. I'm interested in pursuing high energy theory, but I feel like it's too competitive for me to have a chance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 3.5 GPA (huge stress for me, most of my friends have 3.9s and 4.0s)\n* 2 years of research experience in experimental high energy and molecular physics.\n* 2 research publications in preparation, 1 as lead author, but neither will be published by app time.\n* 2 strong letters of recommendation, 1 or 2 mediocre letters of recommendation.\n* Judging from practice GRE exams I've taken, I can expect around a 165 Verbal / 170 Quantitative.\n* And I'm guessing I'll get around a 850-900 on the Physics GRE.\n* 2 graduate courses taken, one is a first-year graduate condensed matter course, the other is a QFT course.\n* 2 paid research positions: 1 research scholarship from my university, 1 internship at NASA/JPL.\n* 3 abstract / poster presentations at conferences; I wasn't the presenter for any of them, but my name is on the abstract.\n* I've been an undergraduate TA for upper-division physics courses at my university for two years.\n* Random other stuff: I'm a mountaineer and a rock climber. I've walked up and down a bunch of mountains and I have touched many rocks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I have fairly strong research experience; it's about on par with most of my friends, and I have more publications than most of them at least (although they haven't actually been published yet), but my GPA seems low (my advisor recommends a 3.5 or higher if you plan on applying to grad school, so I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel there). As far as the GRE scores go, I think they're the only thing left that I can really do to try to improve my application other than having excellent personal / research statements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the moment, I'm looking at applying to PhD programs at U.Wash, Caltech, Ohio State, UC Boulder, UC Irvine, Oregon State, Harvard, and Cornell. I know for sure Harvard, Caltech, and Cornell are at the best reach schools, and probably completely out of reach. But I'm not sure if I'm qualified for the other schools to be reasonable to apply to, or if I should be looking at less competitive / prestigious institutions for the majority of my applications. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I'm ~~so stressed I want to die~~ coping like a normal, healthy person who would like some input on where it seems that I'm actually qualified to apply to, and maybe what scores I should be shooting for on my GREs or anything that's slipped my mind to strengthen my application.

I have applied for several Masters in Economics at German public universities, but because my Bachelor is in Maritime Studies (Business Administration specialised in Shipping) I have been rejected because my Bachelor has not been considered as relevant for the masters I was going for - they were consecutive master programmes, and since my bachelor did not have some advanced economics modules they were looking for, I was rejected. I have chosen Maritime Studies because Greece has a strong shipping industry, but after graduation I did not manage to get a job there.\n\nUnfortunately, I have limited options. I have been admitted to a Masters in Applied Economics and Finance at the Athens University of Economics and Business. I have no idea, however, if a Master from a GREEK university will cut it in Germany. So I pose the following questions:\n\n1. Will a Greek Economics Master cut it in Germany? Do I stand a chance of getting accepted for an internship at German companies while I am studying in Greece?\n2. Considering my profile below, I believe a Master is necessary for me. The question is, will I need a second Master in Germany to achieve my goal?\n3. Is it worth going for a pHD instead of a second MSc?\n4. I have found a call centre job for German customer support roles - 30 hours per week, with a salary of \u20ac835 per month before taxes. It will be very difficult to combine it with my Master, however, since it's an intensive 1-year programme. I want to go for a high GPA, so should I sacrifice that job or is it doable to get a high GPA while working 20-30 hours per week? Will that job count as relevant experience?\n5. Alternative to #4: I can see if I can volunteer to work as an accountant at an NGO, with more flexible hours but no moolah. Is it worth it?\n6. Extracurriculars: I want to improve my French, and if possible my Turkish. I have also been thinking of taking up Crossfit. Any other ideas before I make final decisions?\n7. A lot of people talk about a coming recession in 2020. If a recession does strike, and my efforts go up in smoke, what would be the best course of action? Second Masters? pHD? Or the military?\n8. Extra bonus. I have been thinking of applying to European institutions (Commission, ECB, EIB etc.) for a traineeship. With my profile, is it worth it?\n\nWhat do I want to achieve? I want to break into the German financial industry, specifically into risk management.\n\nBy when? As a maximum, before the age of 28. I have no time to lose.\n\nWhy Germany? The UK is about to leave the EU and I speak German fluently. It would hence be a waste NOT to go to Germany.\n\nWhy not Greece? Unemployment in Greece is rampant and it is insanely difficult to get an internship, let alone a job that honours previous achievements (low-paying jobs are easy to find, thankfully, so I can make money on the side while I am doing my masters). One needs serious networking to get a good job. By the time I graduate I might get it, I might not, however, and I thus need options.\n\nI am open to all opinions. What should I do?",

My low GPA\n2. An F in a class of my major\n3. Letters of recommendation\n\nI am positive I can do better than I did nearly 10 years ago. I have a better handle on things and I've since moved out of a bad household into my own apartment. Going to school without having to deal with my bad family situation was a game changer for me. As for the letters of recommendation, I was a pretty quiet student and all but two of my professors haven't seen me since 2013. I highly doubt anyone remembers me. \n\nI'm feeling like a lost cause and that I'm doomed to be a receptionist forever.",

            "content": "Hello, fellow friends and hopeful applicants:\n\nThere are a few things I'd like to ask and then will elaborate on:\n\n1. Is there any way to assess the competitiveness of a program? I'm applying to what I'd think would be mostly mid-tier schools and a handful of probably-not-but-I-should-still-try level schools, but am straight up clueless what even mid-tier means for an applicant. I can't find admission statistics on a good majority of the programs I'd like to try for.\n2. General advice on the graduate school admissions process. Timeline, etc. I've taken the GRE and asked for my rec letters, but don't know when to contact potential advisers or if I should submit my application extremely early, i.e. if most programs are first-come, first-serve or not.\n3. I'm so anxious about every part of grad school applications and feel like I'm going in completely blind. I have no academics in my family and do not feel confident about anything I'm doing, even though I am confident in myself. I know I will do well once I get into a program -- I understand my capabilities, how hard I'm willing to work, and the fact that I am adaptable. But I cannot help but think at every step of the way, I am not good enough. Have you felt this way and how did you get over it? What do you wish you'd known as an applicant?\n4. Have any of you taken time off to save money and learn how the world works by taking a job in the private sector for a year (I'm in the scientific field but not doing research) and been able to re-enter academia successfully?\n5. The age-old question...do you guys honestly think I have a chance at pursuing an advanced degree in biology at this point in time? I don't want to waste my time applying even if I think I've made up my mind to do so. Info below.\n\nI'm applying to master's programs in paleobiology and evolutionary biology across the country and a couple out of the country and I'm feeling crushingly daunted by the process. I graduated from undergrad in May 2018 from a top 10 public university and my GPA was a cumulative 3.70. Haven't gotten writing score on GRE back but unofficial 167V 160Q. Writing will likely be above average but not extraordinary. I had two majors and participated in a genetics research lab and did a weeklong fossil dig with a professor in undergrad, but have not written a thesis or been published. I am always so nervous to ask my old professors for favors, i.e. rec letters and advice even though I know they would go to bat for me. One even emails me to tell me about new classes he's teaching or trips his family took and I still get so terrified of sending emails to ask if I'm doing everything correctly. There are no academics in my family and I'm going in so blind that the anxiety even in the early stages of the application process is honestly crushing me.\n\nI am, by all accounts, a really good, enthusiastic student and I care immensely about my subject. My brain has an unusual capacity to take large data sets and see patterns as well as retain large amounts of specific information, which is why I've done so well with paleobiology and evolutionary timescales that occur over eons. I will have two excellent rec letters and one pretty good one, most likely. Research and, hopefully, teaching or curating is what I feel like I am meant to do and I'm always willing to do whatever work will get me there, but I don't know if that will be immediately apparent in my application barring my recommenders' decisions to include a statement of the sort.\n\nThank you and good luck everyone. I'm so overwhelmed hahahaha",

Apologies in advance for this being a bit long-winded.\u00a0  \nA  quick background - I'm a 28 yo male from India with a Bachelors in  Finance & Accounting along with a Chartered Accountancy (CA) degree  (Indian equivalent of the CPA) and CFA (L2 candidate). I have a total of 5+ years of work ex  with the initial 2 in core finance (1 for a public sector undertaking  & the 2nd in Risk/Assurance for a Big 4.\u00a0After those 2  years I somehow stumbled into a PPP like organisation. I have spent 3  years in the organisation in a \"Program Development\" role which simply  put translates to impact investing in the education and training domain.  \nI  now feel the need for a Masters to the next step and feel like the  public policy/administration discipline most closely aligns with my aspirations, which  i'd hope would span (in terms of opportunity) from multilaterals to  developmental impact consulting firms (Dalberg, FSG, etc.) to working in  the public sector.  \nTo that end, I wanted to seek advice on a few specifics. Putting those below:  \n\n\n* Would  an MPP/MPA be the best fit for career growth? I think \"Global  Development\" is the catchphrase that most impact consulting firms use.  If not the MPP/MPA, are there any other programs i should be looking at  and if it is MPP/MPA, which of the 2 might be broader in terms of  employment opportunities and acceptability?  \n\n* I would be  VERY interested in programs that are subsidised (as would anyone else).  Recommendations for a concentration of good & (at least relatively)  economical offerings. I do know that the a few Nordic countries and  Germany have this but is there anything specific (or beyond i could look  into).  \n\n* Competitiveness & Requirements - I would  consider my undergrad to be one of the stumbling blocks in my  application. It is around 50%, with the contributing factor being  \"articleship\" requirements as a part of the Chartered Accountancy  course. Undergrad is pursued primarily in distance mode since CA  \u00a0requires On-the-Job for practically 3 years minimum. I basically got  only the day of exams as leave so resulted in a less than acceptable  overall score (though core finance subjects are still strong). How great  of an impediment would this be to my application?  \n\n* Would you advise that i take the GMAT/GRE? Far as i've researched, it's been optional",

I'm applying this year to a handful of Canadian universities for an English MA because I really miss studying literature (plus the creative industry in India pays peanuts). I was wondering if you guys could give me a second opinion on my chances of getting in? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm angling my applications towards the film/ performance aspects of literature, because I do want to rope in my training and experience drawing for screenwriters. Ideally I'd have wanted to go to the UK again but I've maxed out my student years there, and I don't want to give GRE's for standalone MA's in the US (and they're all pretty expensive). It helps that I have top A grades in all the performance/ theatre/ film courses in Edinburgh, and I'm using a mix of referees- one lecturer who taught me film adaptations of Shakespeare, one who taught me Victorian lit (I'm interested in Victorian illustrated fiction) and one who is a lecturer for the Illustration MA course, who can talk about my critical abilities when discussing illustration in an academic context. Naturally I'm tailoring each application after scanning the department's faculty and seeing their strengths, but I'm feeling pretty underconfident/ anxious about this, as I have no clue how grad school applications in Canada work. I keep seeing GPA's mentioned but I'm not sure how the UK grade system translates. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSchools I'm applying to are: UofT, UBC, McGIll, and Alberta for sure, and then maybe one or two more as reserve choices. What do you guys reckon my chances are? I'm asking because I'm already subconsciously tying up loose ends here in Delhi and sort of preparing to study again, and it would be a terrible jolt to be rejected by all of them. What do you suggest I do to strengthen my applications? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also know nothing about Canada, having only been on holiday once as a kid. Which are the best cities to live in as an international? I know first priority is studies but I'm the type that gets miserable if it's a tiny little fishing town/ unwelcoming/ no diversity etc, like Falmouth was. It'd be great to hear thoughts on this, and also which graduate departments in Canada are good for English lit. and interdisciplinary studies. I've looked through rankings and read up on their department pages, yes, but don't know anyone who can give me an insider's take on it. Thanks!",

            "content": "Hi all! I\u2019m planning on applying to masters of education programs for school counseling this winter and hoping for some advice on whether I should retake the GRE or stick with my scores. \n\nI took the GRE last Saturday after signing up for it the Thursday before. I\u2019d been so anxious about the test that I continuously procrastinated studying so I literally studied for one day - the day right before the exam. I took two practice tests and read about the format of the test. On the day of the test, I was incredible sick from anxiety.\n\nMy scores were 161 verbal (88th percentile) (who knows how lol), 156 quantitative (60th percentile), and 4.0 writing (57th percentile). I\u2019m thinking the verbal and quantitive scores are okay but very worried about the writing score. If I had actually prepared for writing, I think I might have been able to do better but I\u2019ve researched how they assess the responses and I\u2019m not sure. My writing style is very succinct because I\u2019ve spent all of undergrad analyzing research/ programs and practicing shortening my writing. I think I\u2019m pretty good writer but it seems like my natural writing style won\u2019t help me on the GRE. My fear is that maybe I\u2019m just not a good writer and practicing/ retaking the exam won\u2019t help.\n\nIf I were to retake the test, I don\u2019t think I would be able to get the same verbal/ quantitative scores again without actually studying and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have time for that. My first application is due Dec. 1 and I\u2019m a full time student with a part time job and leadership positions with multiple organizations. I might be able to improve the writing a little bit (maybe a 4.5 or 5.0) but I\u2019m not sure. \n\nThe schools I\u2019m applying to:\n\n* My first choice (UVA) published average GRE scores for accepted students to all M.Ed programs: 156 verbal, 153 quantitative, and 4.5 writing but they say they take a holistic approach.\n* My second choice (William & Mary) just says their guidelines are 40th percentile or higher.\n* My third choice (UNC Chapel Hill) doesn\u2019t require the GRE if your GPA is above a 3.5 and I can\u2019t find any guidelines for the scores they look for.\n* My fourth choice (James Madison) also doesn\u2019t have any guidelines listed.\n\nFor background:\n\n* I\u2019m currently a senior at a top 5 public university double majoring in psychology and youth development in the school of education. My overall GPA is a 3.82 and my major GPA is a 4.0. \n* I have 5 years of experience working with kids as a swim team coach, I\u2019ve volunteered with about 5 tutoring/ mentorship programs for youth (but each only for a semester or year), I had a one year internship with a community non-profit, I\u2019ve worked a part time job throughout college and now have a supervisory role, I\u2019ve volunteered for a crisis hotline for 3 years, I\u2019m in a sorority, and am the president of two student organizations. I also have a couple education/ research related certifications but I have no actual research experience.\n* My rec letter from my internship supervisor should be really good and I\u2019ll have two recs for professors that should be pretty good but maybe not excellent.\n* My personal statement will be pretty good - I have clear reasons for why I want to go into school counseling and clear reasons why I think I will be a good school counselor.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this is so long but I would really appreciate any advice about the GRE or any advice regarding applying to grad schools for school counseling in general. Specifically, if anyone has any other grad programs they would suggest (ideally around the southeast) or advice for making my application look more competitive. Thank you so, so much!",

There are a few concerns with my application, and I'd like to get some recommendations on some schools I have a chance of getting into. \n\nUndergrad Information:\nDegree: BSc in pure mathematics, minor in physics\nGPA: 3.1 major: 3.05\nMath: UG: number theory, matrix algebra, calc 1-3, algebra 1 & 2, real analysis 1. Grad: complex analysis, graduate real analysis, graduate graph theory/combinatorics course\nBackground: Caucasian male\n\nResearch experience: I've done research most of the time ive been in college. I started the physics research program when I was a physics major freshman year. Second semester freshman year I started physics research, and continued it through that summer, receiving funding from the school. The school year after that i didn't do any research but the summer after my sophomore year I started a geometry research project that got NSF funding. I've been working with my schools geometry lab to do research ever since. Doing a graph theory project, and now that I've determined I like graph theory, I'm doing a project with another, pretty respected professor, in graph theory. I'm really enjoying it.\n\nWork Experience: 2+ years office experience. 1 summer working as a TA for a beginner physics lab. Also worked at Kroger for over a year while in college. Working 20+ hours a week at some points. \n\nGRE(General): taking october\nGRE (Math): taking October's\n\nSo I'm taking the GRE this October. I'd like to prepare a range of schools based on if I do well in the GRE or if I don't. My biggest concern is my GPA. I tend to do alright in my classes, but don't do too well on testing, I think recommendation letters might reflect that. Also with my SOP. Im having someone help me write it a bit. I think it should turn out good.\n\nAnother big concern is rec letters. I should have 2 pretty decent ones, but I'm struggling to find a third. One thing I don't like about my university is that I've had completely different teachers for all the math courses I've taken. So none of the teachers know me that well. I was going to have my analysis professor write a rec letter, because I've had undergrad analysis with him and am currently taking graduate analysis, but I'm currently not doing too well in his class. Is this enough reason to not ask him for a recommendation letter?\n\nI am planning on doing a PhD program to become a teacher. My main interests are teaching and, to me, math is what I want to teach. I'm wondering if there are schools that are specifically good at that.\n\nI am going to be applying to several schools in Boston/NE. My family will be up in the area and it would be preferable to go there for grad school.\n\nLet me know what you guys think about my application and how/what I can improve by application time.",

I am transgender and estranged from some family.

My GRE scores are high. I got a lot of scholarships and funding from various sources that allowed me to travel for academic opportunities. I mention this because my academic profile alone wouldn\u2019t peg me as being low income or needing to explain any extenuating circumstances.

Was straight A Psychology student, but graduated almost a year ago. Indecisive about grad school and cant shake off the thought of med school. Is it too late? Am I too old? Idk if I need pep talk or slap in the face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI turned 25 this year and feel like I'm having a quarter-life crisis. I graduated summa cum laude last year with a BS & BA in psychology, but I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to do as far as grad school was concerned. I knew I wanted to go, but not so sure what I wanted to be doing on the other end of it. Going into my sophomore year I really thought I wanted to be a therapist, but after some life experiences (& a life-perspective-altering relationship) I realized therapy is not for me. Either way, I'm feeling old now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI read somewhere (& also had a prof tell me) that essentially if there's anything you want to have accomplished before you turn 30, you should do it before you start grad school, because once you start, you don't have time for much else. Especially if you happen to get yourself a family during/shortly after. This scared me a bit since I already was unsure of what I wanted to do and thus gave me some cold feet. Especially given how expensive grad school can be, I didn't want to get into a program that I was lukewarm about. After thinking it over and talking to advisors, I realized I wanted to take a \"gap year\" of sorts because I was worried once I started grad school I wouldn't have any time for anything else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is where I am now. I've taken this time to think about the direction of my life and do things I told myself I didn't have time for in college. I really committed to learning a foreign language, I've been traveling when I can, painting, writing, reading books I felt too busy for, focusing on hobbies - some old ones I fell out of touch with and some new ones I've always wanted to try but never had the time (or confidence) for -, I've tried to be more social and spend more time with friends and family, as I didn't do a lot of that because I was so devoted to studying, etc. I don't know quite how to feel about this; part of me feels like this has been a really vital time in regrouping my thoughts and sort've \"centering\" myself and my mental health, but another part of me feels like I'm glorifying wasting my time and thus my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing, I've always loved medicine and anything to do with medicine. One of my parents is in the medical field (although not a doctor) & they thought from the time I was 2 I'd go into med. I tried to get them to let me observe a surgery at the hospital and even begged my parents for one of those suture practice models for Christmas for years (I wasn't successful). I'd even convince my parents to let me eat lunch with them at the hospital cafeteria so I could feel like a doctor haha. Point is, this medical interest is not some random flight of fancy. It has been a deeply rooted, life-long interest & fascination of mine in one way or another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're probably wondering \"Then why didn't you focus on medicine in college?\" well, honestly,  I had a rough time coming out of HS, my grades weren't great and neither was my self-esteem (it's a long story for another time), but I seriously worried that I wasn't smart enough or that I wasn't someone who'd make a \"good doctor\".  Starting college, I hadn't written off med school, but really wasn't sure I could handle it, as I felt dumb. I took my love of people and science and combined them to study psych.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* As a note, I turned out to be a fairly good student. I'm only listing this to give context as to whether or not I could make it through (& be a viable candidate for) med school, not trying to sound snooty or anything.\n\nI got all A's, National Honors Society, Alpha Lambda Delta my first semester, received a scholarship & studied abroad the summer before my sophomore year; the head of dept. recommended me to Phi Beta Kappa & I joined my senior year; received a couple of scholarships (& was eligible & received recommendations for scholarships like the Rhodes Scholarship but I didn't apply because I didn't think it was possible for me to win); was an RA in the neuroscience lab, received a STEM grant & scholarship for my senior thesis research...  I also became a student teacher & taught freshman students, which was a pretty competitive program for me to get into. I  had very good relationships with nearly all my professors and received great letters of recommendation whenever I needed them. I also had a good relationship with a professor of the small college I transferred from that went on to become dean there, so that's kinda cool.  They said they'd always be happy to give me a letter of rec.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took anatomy & physiology as a few of my science credits (I somehow convinced my advisor to let me take the \"med prep\" one and not the  basic GE one), took medical history, medical anthropology, etc. However, you weren't able to get into bio, chem, physics etc unless it was required for your major or you had the pre med path added to your major. Pre med classes had almost 0 overlap with my major, thus I hesitated adding it. When I started really considering it end of my 2nd year, I realized it would add about 2 years to my current degree path, unless I changed majors. Even then, it would still inevitably add time and i wasn't certain what was the right choice...at the time, this time felt monumental.  I also felt guilty because I knew more time = more money and my parents were paying. I hem n hawed well into my 3rd year & by that point I had gotten into a better groove and decided just to finish with my psych path for \"flexibility\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm glad I have my psych degree, but I cant seem to let a career in medicine out of the back of my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's my dilemma: I'm worried that I am too old to start med school, especially since I have no extensive (or any) work experience in the medical field or anything similar to counteract what my starting age would be. I only have two part time jobs now, due to the flexibility they allow, neither having anything to do with medicine or psychology...  I didn't want to commit to a psych-related job because... idk. I guess I worried I would get stuck with that as my career? It also somewhat defeated the purpose of a gap year... I don't have experience in any medical lab, hospital, or shadowing a doctor or anything (I've seen what my mom does as a nurse throughout my life, but doubt that applies), so I don't have that going for me. I haven't taken any biology or chemistry since HS, I took statistics in college but no calculus, no physics ever, (although I have taken A&P, psych, sociology, & medical history related classes). That means I'm not prepared for the mcat or even 1st year med school.... I don't even know how I would go about ameliorating that situation at this point, given that I am no longer enrolled in a college program. Also, I continue to lose eligibility for scholarships and programs the longer I stay out of college/the older I get, despite my good academic record, so I'm really feeling the ticking clock at this point.\n\nWhile I have a good work ethic (looking at my academic history) & a seemingly life-long interest in medicine going for me, I feel like the odds are still stacked against me. Is this true? Is it essentially \"too late\" for me & med school? Ahhhh I just really need some advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* I also had a rather abnormal upbringing, but I don't think that is relevant to this post.

I'm not improving and the exam will probably jeopardize ALL chances I have getting into the programs I'm applying to.

I graduated this past year (BA) with a mediocre GPA 3.3 (bad first few years at uni and I didn't major in psychology until late into my degree). My psych GPA = 3.7 and my GPA in my senior courses = 4.0. I have a few manuscripts in prep/under review (first and second author, respectively), a ton of lab experience (currently managing a lab), posters, some awards in psych, and a ton of mentoring experience. But none of it matters if I can't don't do well on the GRE - especially with my mediocre GPA. It feels like all of the hard work I've put into building my CV and skillset has been a waste. It doesn't help that grad programs in psych are crazy competitive - especially clinical. The programs I'm applying to don't have minimum GRE scores, but I know a low score will definitely lower my chances.\n\nIt's fucking embarrassing and I'm seriously panicking. Applications are due on Dec. 1st, and I don't have the time or money to re-take the test. I don't even know what my referees and potential advisors would say when they see my scores. Fuck. I spent so much time this summer emailing potential PIs and they're all expecting my application. I don't want to apply anymore if I'm just going to get crap scores. So much pressure to succeed and this is the first time I've felt seriously worried and stressed out. \n\nAnyways, sorry for the rant and grammatical errors. I'm tired.

            "content": "I've been a software engineer in industry for 3 years, and am currently doing embedded engineering at a 20 person start up for a hardware device. I'm hoping to redirect my career towards research in neuroengineering. I received my BS in Computer Science with an average GPA (3.2). I haven't done any research experience in neuroengineering/neuroscience/neurobiology, but after gathering and absorbing information plus a lot of self-reflection, I am certain that this is what I want to do (or at least try to do) next. I'm hopeful that my technical and engineering skills would be of a decent value in this field, but am very aware of the amount of learning and effort that this leap requires. I just need a little help in figuring out where to aim such a leap.\n\nHere are a few options I've come up with for myself:\n\n1.) Applying to neuroengineering PhD programs this fall\n\nThis is 20% hope 80% delusion. I'm very unconfident in my shot as an applicant. I know that neuroengineering values a computer science background, but I genuinely do not know how far that extends. And, unfortunately, I don't know enough people to ask.\n\nPros: trying to start what I want to do more immediatelyCons: I have no idea what my actual chances are\n\nThe main thing preventing me from just applying to school this year is extra cost (\\~100/app) and unnecessary pressure/stress if I would just apply at another time with more information/knowledge. I would apply this year if my chances are somehow higher than I think.\n\n2.) Applying to neurotechnology startups as a software engineer\n\nIn the case that applying to PhD programs is more like 100% delusion...\n\n*The ideal*: I'll do software engineering while learning from the company and maybe gaining connections to academia. When I've learned enough to make for a better PhD application, I'll apply in hopes of transitioning to neuroengineering researchCons: job opportunities depend on market need and company fit; not guaranteed that I can learn what I want/need to do\n\n3.) Applying to a neuroengineering masters program this fall\n\nThe biggest, most important con is cost. If there is a way to maneuver around this step using a different route (*e.g.,* via #2) I will skip out on losing 50-80k. But, if you think that #2 won't actually work, and I can't gain the right experience outside of academia to do #1, I'll go into some debt.\n\nSo, my closing question is: given my current situation, what would it truly take to make for a confident PhD application / what are some steps that I can take?\n\nI'm at a bit of a loss on what to do, and am hesitant to reveal to my only source of professional help (my boss) that I'm potentially jumping to a completely different field. Any information, advice, or candid feedback would be greatly appreciated.",

Also, beware, this is a long post.\n\nI graduated from a University of California school with a Bachelors in Statistics with a 3.16 GPA (like, 2.8-2.9 major GPA) in 2014. I was going through a depressive episode during this time, which is at least part of the reason these grades kind of suck. Since I assumed graduate school was out of the question and didn't want to become an actuary either (and still don't), I ended up becoming a math tutor right out of school while taking other odd jobs. I assumed my experience would nicely lead to becoming a school teacher. However, I got fired from my first teaching job less than 2 months in because my students decided to set my paper towels on fire with my microwave. The second was a long-term substitute position where I did stick it out until the regular teacher came back from maternity leave. In both positions, I had the sense I was utterly incompetent, was completely stressed out, gained 30 lbs, and was otherwise quite miserable. I'm working as a substitute now, and my health (physical and mental) has thankfully improved, and I don't want to go back.\n\nI'm seriously considering applying to a Data Science MSc program soon. I have dabbled in using Python for Data Science (more like basic data analysis), and I do find I like learning how to work with data on at least this level.

I just have a few concerns:  \n\n\n1) In order to become a teacher, I had to join a Teacher Credentialing program for a whole school year. Moreover, it's been over 5 years since I graduated with my Bachelors. How do I handle getting LoR's/Recs, especially when I barely remember any of my profs?\n\n2) Is there anyway I can spin my experience as an educator to look relatively positive? I know people from my second teaching stint that would say nice things about me, but this isn't exactly the same as being a regular teacher.\n\n3) Considering my GRE scores, should I be looking more closely at stateside programs, especially since I don't have much contact with my profs outside of the teacher training program?",

As for the fall semester of sophomore year, I was dealing with anxiety and undiagnosed ADHD and ended up with a D in linear algebra due to a combination of factors that I don't feel comfortable mentioning in Reddit. \n\nI ended up taking a year off of university, which is why I have many W's on my transcript for the Spring 2018 semester but I came back to get a B+ in web programming and a B- in linear algebra as well as a C+ in discrete mathematics. Gosh, I wish my GPA was better when I came back from my year long leave of absence but it is what it is. \n\nCurrently, I'm taking Networks, Introduction to Learning Analytics (a graduate level course), Independent Reading and Research, Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures, and Engineering Probability and Statistics II. So far, I'm doing okay on these courses except for Networks and OOP and DS. I will try my best to bring up my grades for the last two years of my undergraduate career, especially that I did poorly in the first two years (except for freshman fall) in my subjects.\n\nMy ultimate goal with doing a PhD in Information Science or a related field is to do industry research in technology (I will be more detailed once I have the time to concentrate on my life goals and not grind on my problem sets.) Knowing that I love my research at the Future of Learning Lab, which I did for three months, as well as my research at the Social Dynamics Lab in which I am conducting research about mental health and self-help subreddits, I want to conduct my original research in these following areas (but are not limited to): a more inclusive book recommendation system that isn't Goodreads and features authors of different backgrounds rather than just the most popular reads, the perceptions of Western media vs. local media in the drug war in the Philippines using natural language processing and neural networks, and a website or a mobile app that helps people with executive function (e.g. ADHD, autism, executive function disorder) using machine learning and natural language processing. \n\nAnyway, I'm confused how to get into graduate school.

Is that a wise thing to do or should I do something else?\n\nAny current students here pursuing PhD in Economics? Would love to get some insights from you as well. \n\nI appreciate you for taking your time to read the post and thank you for any suggestions you might have. Have a good Friday peeps! \n\nTL;DR- Need suggestions on how to make my application stronger for PhD in Economics, cause I have no Economics background, less work experience and still need to take a few pre-requisite classes.",

            "content": "Hey all\n\nI\u2019m a 4th year biochemistry major and I am having a lot of difficulties with completing my bachelors degree. \n\nTo begin with, I have been researching in a neuroscience laboratory for a little over 2 years and as a result am the head of the lab next to the PI. I facilitate research by managing 17 undergraduate assistants and I assist the 2 graduate students with their research. I also assist in the teaching of the laboratory portion of a Histotechniques class taught during spring semester. My PI is an absolute master in neuro and I have been learning a lot from him and due to that, I would say the level of expertise I have in the neuroscience field is probably comparable to someone almost completing their masters in neuroscience.  I don\u2019t have any publications yet, but I having been working on a thesis for quite some time now, and am easily a coauthor on the work of the graduate students in the lab. \n\nThe dilemma I am facing is that I love biology but absolutely hate chemistry. It bores me to death, and I do not have the time to spend reviewing and practicing the material (I work 20hrs in addition to 20-25hrs a week in the lab and I have a side hustle that I work on with my father). As a result I do not perform well on the exams. I have tried to switch to being a biology major, but my GPA (2.8) does not meet the minimum 3.25 requirement. \n\nEveryday I sit in class and I cannot focus. Whenever I have a little bit of time to study I am so exhausted from performing work 7 days a week that I can barely focus. The class consists of many mechanisms and my brain just doesn\u2019t work well with specific mechanisms as I am more of a bigger picture person. Furthermore a lot of the material is unrelated to my research which makes me feel like I\u2019m wasting my time when I could be reading literature instead. \n\nAll of this combined has taken a toll on my mental health and has led me to having an identity crisis lately as to what I want to do with my life. I am excelling at every aspect of my life (finances, physical health, work, relationships with people, etc) except school and it makes me feel a failure. I have such a strong desire to become a neuroscientist but I simply cannot survive taking the 9 upper division chemistry classes I have left. I am currently doing very poorly in my physical chemistry class and doing okay in my biochemistry class.  Which means I may need to retake these if I don\u2019t get my shit together. \n\nIf I were to drop out I am sure I will do well financially as the side hustle with my father is going very well. I just don\u2019t know what I would do with my life. The lab has been such a critical factor for making me the man I am today and I feel like I would be lost without it. All I know is that I will always be good at what I\u2019m passionate about, and currently that is neuroscience. \n\nSorry for the long post and thank you all for reading.",

I started my AA at my community college a few years ago, quit, and now I\u2019m back for my bachelors. My community college offers direct transfer degrees that translate into GED requirements at local universities, and I will be completing that simultaneously so I can knock those out. (I did the math\u2014it saves time and money rather than filling out the gaps with transferred classes alone) By the time I do this, I will be a junior. \n\nI like studying culture, arts, and criticism. I have my sights on grad school. I would like to go on to get a masters in either Pop Culture studies or musicology, depending on which fits my strengths best. Originally I was going for creative writing, but after comparing degrees, the Liberal Studies degree at my university seems like it would offer the best preparation for this field of study. It\u2019s an interdisciplinary offering allowing you to cater a degree that doesn\u2019t fall under the traditional umbrella, including things like cultural anthropology, music history, and I\u2019ll be asking my advisor if I can include professional/creative writing as well, since I want to become a stronger writer. \n\nThe problems I face is that I\u2019m in my mid-20s and work a full time job. Online school is the only viable option. My college isn\u2019t one of those for-profit degree mills, it\u2019s a real public university that happens to offer some degrees online, but I know the stigma against online programs is very real. The other problem is my AA. I practically dropped out of community college with a 2.5 GPA due to mental health, addiction, and plain stupidity. Now I\u2019m riding at a 3.75, clearly doing much better, but when I translate my AA and GPA in, I\u2019m gonna have to fight like hell to get it back up to where I want it to be. \n\nHow will an admissions office look at this? Will they take an online degree, and an online degree in Liberal Studies nonetheless, seriously, or am I sunk in the water before I even start? Is there anything I can do to help?",

It involved camping at a bunch of different national parks and doing trail maintenance. I loved it. I decided that working in conservation, specifically NPS or the Forest Service, was what I wanted to do.\n\nTwo months into the program, I got a call that my father was dying, so I went home a month early. The program was completely understanding, and I left on good terms. My father ended up staying on hospice until May of this year, when he passed away. Since July of last year, when I returned from the AmeriCorps program, I have been taking care of him and my elderly mother, and have not been working. \n\nI have been looking up requirements for jobs in the park system on USA Jobs, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that grad school is the best path to my goal. Part of this is because most of the well-paying jobs require two years of graduate level experience, and part because I am so disconnected from the rest of the conservation \u201cscene\u201d and from academia. I need something that will allow me to make connections and give me guidance. I spoke to a career counselor at my alma mater earlier this year, and she encouraged my decision and suggested that I aim for a degree in Natural Resource Management or Ecology. \n\nI\u2019ve done some preliminary research, but I am feeling very overwhelmed because it has been so long since I have done any academic work, and my resume since leaving school is very underwhelming (aside from the AmeriCorps program, and even it is only two months).\n\nI understand that I need to get a list of schools, study for and take the GRE, and get recommendation letters from my old professors, but even those steps seem overwhelming.\n\nSome specific questions:\n\n- What should I be looking for in a program? There are tens of schools across the country that have resource management/ecology degrees, and all of them look fine at first glance. I don\u2019t know how to separate \u201cgood schools\u201d from \u201cbad ones\u201d.\n\n- Is it worth it to apply for Spring 2021? I\u2019m too late to apply this year, and I\u2019d rather not wait an entire year for fall intake applications. I\u2019ve heard mixed things about spring intakes on this sub, but I spoke to a post-grad friend about it and he encouraged me to go for it. Since I don\u2019t have a particular school in mind, I think I could easily find one with a spring intake.\n\n\n- If a Spring application is indeed a good idea, is there a timeline template anywhere? There are a bunch of them for Fall applications.\n\n- How/when to begin studying for the GRE? I am a very good test taker, and I\u2019m hoping to have high scores to even out my application. I do not want to spend a ton of money on a class or anything, are there some recommended cheaper textbooks?\n\n- Most importantly, is a degree in natural resource management a good idea? I think this is sort of a \u201conly you know the answer\u201d kind of question, but I have fears of going through a two-year program and then being unable to find employment, especially with the instability of the government. However, conservation is crucially important to me, and with the climate crisis I believe it is virtually the only job in which I would feel fulfilled and secure in the knowledge that I am living in accordance with my values.\n\n\n- Any general tips for someone who has graduated a long time ago and who has a lot of resume gaps. I\u2019m confident that it is possible for me to do this, but the idea of actually starting overwhelms me.\n\nThank you so much for reading.",

            "content": "Hi guys, I am your average engineer (mechanical) working a construction job for the past two years since I completed my undergrad. My problem is this, I honestly do not like the industry I am in, as on average it takes up more than 14-16 hrs of my day working/commuting etc. \nIts a harsh job, taxing my mind and body at the same time, and this being a civil field in its entirety (as the project I am in is a Metro Project, if it were a manufacturing plant/HVAC/MEP scope it would have been different for a mechanical engineer I guess I wouldn\u2019t know for sure) has very little growth prospect for a mechanical undergrad. And it\u2019s mostly a blue collar job I\u2019d say.\nSo after speaking to my peers, profs, I\u2019ve decided to try my hand at universities in Canada, Europe and US for a masters program. The reason (my viewpoint could definitely be biased based on the feedback I got from my peers or such) is a better lifestyle, better pay and a work life balance outside and also the chance to move away from here.\n\nSo, my question is this \n1. How do I decide the universities ? I have a few courses in mind like MEM, Industrial Design(the mainstream courses people opt for)\nMy priority when looking for universities is very simple the ROI, and the job opportunities available there after(Now when I say after I mean right after completing my masters)\n\n2. Should I bias my views on single website like QS World Ranking or should I double check by talking to alumni and get their feedback?\n\n3. I\u2019m honestly not looking to go into research at all, knowing this how should I prioritise my university selection?\n\n4. Should I try and avoid vying for a college in US due to the currents trends there?\n\nPS : I know I\u2019ve gotta see an education counsellor and I will, but before doing that I\u2019d like to do this,\n\nAny help at all would be much appreciated!!! \nThanks a lot!",

            "content": "I\u2019m needing some advice...I studied for two months prior to taking GRE, was super confident about it and then the night before I had a bought of insomnia (probably due to being anxious about the test), took the test on 0 hours sleep and as you can imagine, totally bombed it. Ended up getting 158 verbal 146 quant and 4 on analytic writing (this was surprising given that I didn\u2019t even finish the first writing topic). \n\nWell, in my sleep deprived and post-test depression state, I had my scores sent to all 3 schools I\u2019m applying to. Only one of them, my safety school requires GRE, and I\u2019m not too worried about it bc the lab I work in currently is part of the program I\u2019m applying to and they already offered me a spot. GRE is just a formality in that case. \n\nAs far as the other two schools, one specifically states that if you send GRE scores, they don\u2019t look at them, so no issue there, however the other school which is my top choice says GRE scores are OPTIONAL...\n\nI\u2019m debating on whether I should reach out to the admissions office and ask them to exclude the scores from my application (if that\u2019s even a possibility) or just do nothing, leave the spot on the application where it asks for GRE scores empty and hope for the best. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts?\n\nP.S. I already know that I did something stupid, and I'm already beating myself up for this mistake so please have mercy.",

            "content": "Hey all. I'm set to graduate in May and I study psychology and neuroscience, but I want to go into public health instead. I've found that having these majors won't necessarily hurt my chances of getting into these programs, especially since I have a strong bio and chem background and have taken relevant coursework my school offers that's adjacent to what I want to do. I also have some research experience in psychology that could benefit me as well. I am also very involved in cocurricular and extracurricular activities, including service organizations, student orgs, music, and I work 2 jobs on campus (gotta get that scholarship money). These are the good things.\n\nThe real problem is my GPA, which fell just under a 3.0 last year after some medical/mental health issues and has been extraordinarily difficult to recover. The main program I'm looking at has a GPA waiver for the GRE and it's still high enough for me to be eligible for that. This is not to mention the votes of confidence my professors have in me despite my GPA. One of them actually said it would be a tragedy and a wasted opportunity if I didn't go because I am overall a strong writer and devoted student. I was able to go from almost failing a majority of my courses to almost making honor roll for the entire next year following that, but have caught myself in a similar (arguably less intense) rut to last year.\n\nI guess the question I'm trying to ask you is: What do you guys think my chances would be? Should I apply? Do you think it's possible for me to be accepted? What should I do to help my chances?\n\n*I'm very new to the whole process and don't really have much guidance. I'm sorry guys.",
