            "content": "For anyone needing a little motivation or people thinking they're in the same boat as I am, this is my experience.\nI've been a full-time student, since May 2018, taking anywhere from 4-6 classes per semester trying to finish my BS in IT Management. I work full time in my career field as a System Administrator and have 2 kids, both under 3 years old. It might sound like a lot (and it is), but the best way to get through it is Time Management.\n\nThis is exactly how my week goes:\nMonday - Friday I wake up at 5:15 am to get ready for work, I leave by 6:00am and commute 1 1/2 hours to work to get there at 7:30am, I work until 4:30pm, commute back home 1 1/2ish hours to get home at 6-6:30pm. I cook/feed my kids dinner (while my wife works) and then feed myself. Between 7-7:30pm, I start studying and doing my homework (depending how much homework I have, I try to complete 2-3 assignments a day). I try to finish my homework by 11:00pm the latest then take a shower and go to sleep by 12:00am. Then I do it again at 5:15am.\nOn Saturday I wake up early and use half the day to finish any homework I have left then the second half of the day and all of Sunday, I spend with my family. Now it doesn't always work that way, but 80% of the time it does. I've maintained a 3.80GPA so far and should graduate by the end of this year.\n\nI don't think it's hard, but when I tell people my situation, they are surprised that I haven't gone crazy yet haha.\n\nBenefits I have:\n- Most of the assignments I have is something I've seen before since I have prior experience, so it's not too hard for me other than the programming classes.\n- My wife supports me when I need no distractions with my kids.\n- Online classes gives a lot of flexibility with my schedule.\n- I think being prior military by dealing with worse situations, helps me get through it relatively easy.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- I don't like school pretty much at all and I can't wait to finish, but I know it will make me more marketable, make me more money, and it will be a good accomplishment.\n- I only have a day and a half to myself out of the week at most.\n- I don't watch TV at all, but I really want to catch up on all my TV shows eventually :/",
