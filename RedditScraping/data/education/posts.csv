1j4k27y,Feeling like a burden at my clinical site- Help!,"Howdy everyone! First Time posting here.  Encountering a bit of difficulty in my school/healthcare education and i'm interested in some opinions on this.

I did well in my program, and was selected to complete a rotation in a fast-paced healthcare field at my very first hospital of choice- a location i've totally dreamt of as a little kid.  Both of my parents have worked here in different capacities.

I was expecting this to be my fairytale, but i've been met with difficulties.

my two preceptors are both 10-15 year veterans in this field. while this can be a very serious career, with life-threatening work on the heart being done----  They seem to have a very little amount of patience, willingness to teach outside of required materials, and generally seem bothered by my \*obvious\* amount of incompetence- constant eyerolling, sighing, etc. I do not expect much congeniality from physicians either, but they have been brutal as well.  I don't consider myself a bad student, but I have no comparison from other classmates or employees..

I'm feeling generally uncomfortable, unwelcome, and stunted in my learning (to a degree). Although I am consistently told this is one of the best locations, I'm unsure of what to do.  I've completed \~275/1200 hours..

After 8 weeks, I've been shrugged off multiple times with regards to obtaining a proper badge, or identification that allows me to access parking, or other areas of the hospital that i'm required to attend meetings/procedures inside of.   The Human resources department has not responded to any of my emails after discussion of a small contingent job to make some money on the side of this student work. Texts/Emails/In-person attempts have all been avoided..

I feel like I'm unwanted- or I'm being pushed out?  I'm unsure of how to proceed, entirely.  Am I being too sensitive? Do I need to request a new rotation site? Do I get my university involved?  Do I need to suck it up?

1j4itiy,Roommate Advice,"I am in need of advice. My boyfriend and I go to different colleges that are 2.5 hours apart. He lives in a dorm room, and his college is not in the safest part of town, so when we hangout, he usually comes down to my college and spends the night with me in my room. I live in an apartment with one other girl. We have separate bedrooms, our own bathrooms, and our own floors. I always text her and let her know before hand when he is coming over. The other day I texted her to let her know, and she sent me a text saying how it makes her extremely uncomfortable when he spends the night. Once she got home, I went to talk to her so I could try to help the situation. Just to preface, when he comes over, she literally barely see him or doesn’t see him at all, we don’t do anything “weird” also so he’s no loud, we literally just go out and hangout and then go to bed in my room.

1j4gql1,Toxic Environment in Master’s Program,"Hello,

I’m looking for thoughts and advice on dealing with an unexpectedly toxic environment in my master’s program.

I’m studying in a European capital, and before this, I completed an honors bachelor’s degree in the same city (though in a different field). Wanting to build more technical skills, I enrolled in a science-focused university for my master’s.

The student cohort in my program is small—only 15 of us, and all my classmates are non-EU citizens, many from former Soviet countries. From the beginning, I noticed that the atmosphere in the classroom was unusually cold and distant. Given our small size and shared courses, I had assumed that, while we might not all become best friends, we’d at least develop a cordial and supportive environment—something I experienced in my previous university, where students were generally positive, collaborative, and open to teamwork.

Initial Efforts to Foster a Friendly Environment

In the first few weeks, I put in genuine effort to be friendly, helpful, and approachable—not trying to force friendships but just encouraging a more comfortable dynamic. However, the response was lukewarm at best. People kept to themselves, and the classroom remained cold as ice.

Eventually, I formed a connection with a Soviet classmate who was close to two other girls. I spent a lot of time chatting with her and even shared some personal things. Yet, in class, she was always with them, and I mostly sat alone, minding my own business.

Over time, though, the four of us started spending more time together—clubbing, having lunch, and hanging out. It felt like we were finally creating a more welcoming atmosphere. But then, things took a sudden, toxic turn.

The First Signs of Conflict

One day, out of nowhere, the girl I had befriended turned on the two others. She completely cut them off and antagonized them for reasons that, at first, seemed trivial—delays in responding to a group assignment. Instead of handling the situation maturely, she lashed out, calling them stupid and unleashing an absurd level of hostility over half a point on a project.

I wasn’t directly involved in the conflict but got dragged in due to my association with them. At that point, my moral compass kicked in—I saw how viciously toxic she had become, and I refused to condone her behavior. She harassed them relentlessly for the rest of the semester, even dragging professors into her half-point obsession. The professors literally laughed at her and told her (politely) that she was being delusional.

When She Turned on Me

Despite all of this, she tried to stay in contact with me, sending messages about how she valued our friendship and wanted to stay close. But after seeing how she could switch from friendly to full-blown hostility, I knew I couldn’t trust her. I distanced myself.

Soon after, she latched onto another Soviet classmate, someone arrogant, dismissive, and convinced of his own superiority. Together, they started gossiping about me. She even sent me ridiculously immature messages through the official class system—which, for a 37-year-old woman, felt surreal. I refused to engage, replying only “no comment”, because it was like watching a bad Mean Girls remake.

The Aftermath: A Divided and Toxic Classroom

Fast forward to today, and she has somehow reinvented herself, embedding herself among other classmates. I strongly suspect she bad-mouthed us and framed herself as a victim while making us look bad. Now, I can feel the invisible walls—a solid divide between us and the rest of the class.

What’s bizarre is that the entire class is cold—not just toward us, but toward each other. There’s no acknowledgment, no greetings, no smiles—just a sea of expressionless faces. This goes beyond simple shyness; it feels like active, dismissive hostility.

We, on the other hand, chose not to spread gossip. We figured that her behavior spoke for itself and that we didn’t need to stoop to her level. But in hindsight, maybe our silence worked against us.

What’s Really Going On?

At this point, I’m wondering:

	1. Is this cultural? Coming from a Western background, I wonder if there’s a deep cultural disconnect at play. Most of my classmates come from former Soviet or impoverished countries, and maybe there’s a fundamental difference in social expectations.

	2. Am I just the black sheep? Sometimes, a class unconsciously singles out an outsider, and since they all come from relatively similar backgrounds, maybe I stick out too much in ways I don’t fully realize.

	3. Is this just bad luck? I’ve had a long student life, interacted with more than 150 different students in my past studies, and never encountered a classroom environment this toxic. At my previous university, the atmosphere was warm, supportive, and collaborative—even during high-pressure moments. Here, the dynamic is the complete opposite.

I would genuinely appreciate any insights, similar experiences, or even a professor’s perspective. Am I misreading the situation, or is something truly off here? Please, tell me if I’m the problem, or if this classroom environment is just beyond dysfunctional.","Am I misreading the situation, or is something truly off here with the toxic environment in my master's program?","The individual in the Reddit post has the following background information and context:

1j48fpx,"My teacher has not graded most of the work turned in, isn't giving feedback, and isn't responding to emails. Not sure what to do other than just deal with it.","This is the tail end of my second year of college and the first time I am experiencing this problem, and I honestly do not know what to do? When I started this class, I read through the syllabus to make sure I knew how things were graded and in the syllabus it's stated that she will grade things within the week after it's due. Great for me, I thought, because I want to keep my grades up to graduate with honors whilst taking difficult classes I am currently struggling on. Well, it's now been 6 weeks, and my teacher has not even graded the FIRST ""main"" discussion (I am just calling it this to keep it simple). They have, however, graded the other discussions, provided no feedback, and slapped on a grade. The only thing other than this that was graded was an essay, where they said I had no title, and the automatically graded quizzes. I haven't gotten full points on any of these assignments, and most of these assignments have no feedback on what I am doing wrong. This situation has made me really anxious because, and I know this is irrational, I need to know how I am doing at all times as soon as possible in a course. Of course, I don't go emailing teachers left and right for grades, but if I have questions on how to do better or questions at the beginning of the course I ask them all. I just want to do well. Waiting a week or two longer for an entire multi-page essay to be graded is vastly different than waiting six weeks for the first ""main"" discussion to be graded, I feel like. It's still not graded! None of them are! Just the smaller discussions, where I don't get feedback on how to improve, and I get multiple worse scores because she also takes weeks to grade those.

  
So, I figured I should just email her, then I could get an answer and put my worries to bed. In that email I just asked her an example of what kind of title she wanted if the one I did put was not sufficient on my essay (or just to say what was wrong with the title so I know for next time) and what I could do better on the discussions, if I am not doing something she is particularly looking for, stuff like that. I thought that was a reasonable ask. No reply. I emailed a follow up recently but I haven't tried again since I don't want to be bothersome, though it's been weeks since my first email and a reply. However, the announcements are still going strong. I can't attend office hours because they start when my other classes and obligations start. 

  
My mom said I am every teacher's nightmare so I haven't tried to ""do more"" about this situation. I am trying to be careful as to not bother anyone too much since I am apparently this nightmare student. It's really making me anxious though, and I feel like it isn't unreasonable to want grades in a timely manner, which is really all that I want. I understand feedback can be difficult, but is it also unreasonable to want feedback? Even a little ""you didn't talk about this enough"" goes a long way, since none of the discussions have a rubric. I understand I will just need to deal with it, but should I do anything if this continues? It's easy to say ""don't worry about it,"" but not knowing what my grade actually is six weeks in doesn't feel right, we're nearing the halfway point of the semester in a couple to a few weeks..

1j3twns,"I battled cancer and am burnt out, so I’m thinking of changing my major to something more my passion","I’m 21 and I battled cancer. I originally was gonna be a vet, however, I started developing second thoughts and switched to premed. After battling cancer during college and faced a lot of challenges with my gpa and graduation time, I’m burnt out. I switched to PA since PA school is shorter than med, however, I don’t want to take anatomy and physiology my senior year. I’m taking biochem and a few other rigorous courses and I don’t want to do it anymore. So I’m thinking of changing the concentration of my major to my passion, which is more environmental biology and genetics (rather than medical biology if that makes sense. Not changing the major, just changing the focus on my major). And maybe minor in photography. I know job opportunities in these fields aren’t that good, but part of me wants to just prioritise my mental health so that I can improve my gpa and actually enjoy college.

1j3tuwu,I'm having a serious family emergency. Do I look like an idiot for asking to makeup an assignment?,"So overnight on Sunday (2 days ago), I ended up rushing my mom to the ER with severe chest pain, coughing blood and breathing issues. It turns out she has fluid filling up her lungs as a possible result of a pneumonia infection. There was so much fluid they couldn't see whether there was pneumonia on the xray or CT scan. They gave her medications and said we must come back in 48 hours to see a specialist and to have the fluid drained from the lungs. They weren't able to do it in the ER that night.  The fluid then has to be tested to see if its pneumonia or lung cancer, which is really taking a toll on us mentally.

I have 0 control over the date and time the procedure was scheduled. Given the fact that my mom is sitting in bed right now, trying to be as comfortable as possible while there's fluid building up in her lungs, the procedure can't be postponed. We also didn't get a choice in the appointment time of day, to begin with, but we were obviously just taking what we could get because she absolutely need this fluid out of her lungs so she could breathe properly again. Not to mention, I have 0 control over the situation itself. This is the worst shape I've ever seen my mom in, and it's honestly terrifying.

So, of course, this is the day that I have an in-person assignment based on student presentations (tomorrow). The appointment time is 30 minutes into the class, so i wouldnt be able to go to class and get her into the procedure on time. I emailed my instructor and explained the situation, that this is urgent, and I have no control over it. My mom can't drive in this shape, and she cannot leave without being accompanied. Hospital policy. We don't have any other family members or anyone we can ask to do this except me. Not to mention, I really want to be there for my mom when she has the procedure because she's really scared, and so am I.

I offered to ask for proof of the appointment time and date, a doctor's note, or anything that is requested if I'm allowed to somehow make up this assignment or do an alternative assignment so that I dont have to take a 0 on it since its worth 20%.

I've never had to ask for this type of excuse in school before, and I really hesitated to do it, but I explained to the instructor that I really had no other options at this point, that i was sorry for the last minute email but that the situation was out of my control, and I was willing to do whatever I could to make up for it.

Most of our instructors don't allow assignment or test makeups because of people who make up excuses or lie regularly, and then it really ruins things for those people who do unfortunately run into actual emergencies. I still havent heard back from them, and im not sure what to do at this point. I cant let my mom go another day in the shape she is, but its also going to be devastating for me to take a 0 on this assignment, as ill probably have to drop the course or fail. But honestly it would be more devastating to have my mom die in her sleep if she stops breathing or i'm not home to get her to the ER in time. She really needs the procedure done.","What can I do if I need to miss a class to take my mom to a critical medical procedure, and my instructor hasn't responded to my request for an alternative assignment?","The individual in the Reddit post is currently attending school, where they have an in-person assignment involving student presentations.

1j3tsn7,Adjustment of Financial aid for Fall Semester during Spring semester,"Few days ago CT State CC cancelled my financial for Fall semester for some reason. I have completed all the courses, and technically graduated in December.

After talking with financial aid and head of financial aid they told me that primary reason was me attending spring semester.

During fall semester I qualified for the aid. However, because qualified courses were half of the courses - only $1500 out of $3000 (CCG Scholarship) was awarded. Furthermore, I had to take Stafford loan to pay for the remaining part. On October 1^(st) I submitted my Graduation Application for December, which was satisfactory as well. 

So, up to that point CT State DID NOT know whether I wish to continue my education in spring semester or not. When Spring semester registration opened, I talked with my advisor if I can take some transfer classes in Spring, so I can have more credits for transfer at fall. She said that I can, if I choose a secondary major. However, she said that it won't be covered by any financial aid. I said it is fine - I would pay out of pocket if necessary. Also, at the end of Fall I paid of that Loan in full.

So, with the above information, you are telling me that the reason of cancelling my fall financial aid CCG scholarship and cancelling my loan AS WELL, was my enrollment in Spring?

Any advice on that?",Why was my fall financial aid CCG scholarship and loan cancelled due to my enrollment in the spring semester?,"The individual in the Reddit post has graduated from a community college with their graduation application submitted for December. They attended school during the fall semester and were eligible for financial aid, receiving a partial scholarship of $1500 out of $3000 from the CCG Scholarship, along with taking out a Stafford loan to cover the remaining costs. 

They consulted with their advisor about taking transfer classes in the spring semester to accumulate more credits for future transfer, and were informed that this secondary major would not be covered by financial aid. The individual expressed willingness to pay out of pocket for these classes if necessary. Additionally, they have fully paid off the Stafford loan by the end of the fall semester.

1j3m2nm,Is it better to complete my degree late to focus on directed study my final semester?,"I (junior standing, 20, major in the bio sciences, USA) lost a close family member the second semester of my freshman year. Because of it, I dropped my courseload down to 12 units (minimum for a full time student at my university, the standard is 16), and have been slowly raising the number of units I take every semester as I regain my footing. I'm up to 15 units this semester and am finally getting good grades, working part time, and balancing everything OK.

Because I spent time focusing on myself, my graduation time had to be extended another semester (I started fall 2022, current planned graduation is fall of 2026). However, looking at my schedule now - I have to complete 18 units a semester for the next 3 semesters without failing anything to graduate. I am considering graduate school, and while the graduate program I'm interested in is not too competitive compared to many other universities, there's no way I could get into any grad school with my current GPA (2.5). I'm worried I'll be unable to improve my GPA as much as I'd like to if I'm taking that many units at once.

I also have a directed study requirement for my last semester, which I want to put my full effort into, and I think it'll be difficult to prioritize research if I'm taking 17 other unit hours.

Is it worth it to extend my graduation another semester, meaning a full year late, in order to prioritize GPA, directed study, and potentially part time work? It would also mean I'd be able to add a few more special interest upper division courses that I think would be useful to my career. On the other hand, the current administration means that financials may be more of an issue, and of course taking another semester extends the time before I'll be in the workforce full time and able to start paying off my student loans. I'm curious to see if anyone has any perspective - my academic advisor is kind of only focused on making sure I have the courses scheduled I need to graduate.

About three months ago, I was in that same cycle — barely attending classes, never doing homework, and spending all day playing games or scrolling through social media. My situation got so bad that I was afraid of taking exams and had no idea what I was going to do with my future.

But with my family’s constant support, I was able to get back on track. Now, I’m on my self-improvement journey alongside many others. To be honest, I’ve never made it this far before, but this time, I did. So let me share some tips that helped me get here.

1. Don’t Wait for Tomorrow
Even you yourself know that you’ll just procrastinate again if you push that task to tomorrow, so why not do it today? And if the task feels overwhelming because of how big it is, here’s the second tip:

2. Break Your Task and Start Small
Breaking a task into smaller sections tricks your brain into thinking it’s easier, increasing the chances of actually completing it. Start small and build it like a habit.

3. Consistency is Better Than Perfection
Trust me on this one — don’t try to be a perfectionist on day one. You’ll only end up disappointed and fall back into procrastination.

I was expecting to do quite well in this class, but my grades are coming back as Bs and Cs and I want to fix that. 

One problem though, my professor teaches like he has no confidence in himself. He talks super quietly, so quietly that the mic he started wearing recently barely picks him up at all. Half the time when he’s speaking, he’s looking at the floor, and his sentences just seem to trail off a lot of the time, ending in “so….. yeah.” or quite literally muttering to the point of it being unintelligible.

1j3dz84,How can you tell if your academic writing has gotten worse?,"For a while now, I've felt like my writing in essays have gotten worse. Yes, I know this is a common concern for anyone and that it often isn't true but what if it is true? Maybe I'm just out-of-practice but writing feels harder now than it did back when I started college. It feels harder to write my thoughts into analysis and I keep getting worried my points are too surface-level or too unorganized. Like, I'll often write and it just feels like I'm expanding a point that doesn't need explanation. I used to feel like I could mess around with paragraph structure and do well but now I stick to standard structure. Perhaps it's the way I read that messes with my comprehension and subsequently how I write, idk. I still get good grades but I think a lot of the professors I had didn't grade that harshly, some did though, and I'm often just not satisfied with my work. I could really use some advice on all this. If I am just worrying too much than how do I stop doing that? If there is a drop in skill then what could I do to check and would could I do to improve?

Side-note: One explanation for difference between start of college vs now might be the classes I had since I transferred schools. I was on semester system first and the classes I had assigned writing assignments every week whereas when I transferred to a quarter system, almost none of my classes had mandatory minor writing assignments that weren't essays or exams.

1j3d7za,General Roommate Conflict Advice from an RA,"

Hello r/college, 

I’ve been on this sub for a while and have noticed a lot of posts asking about what to do in situations of roommate conflict, so I wanted to make a general post as an RA on what you should be doing in the event of one. 

1. Communication - This is the biggest one. If you haven’t communicated with your roommate that something is bothering you how can you expect them to change? Before doing anything else, you need to be direct about why you’re upset with them/what you’d like them to change. Be willing to compromise. Bonus points if you’ve filled around a roommate agreement and boundaries have been established. 
2. Talk to the RA - They have been trained to deal with situations like this. When communication fails, have your RA come in to mediate. 
3. Escalate - Sometimes, the RA/ your roommate doesn’t take you seriously after you’ve tried all the appropriate first steps. If your RA doesn’t do anything, ask another RA, or the Hall Director for assistance. It’s important to keep bothering them if they haven’t done anything, because eventually - they will. 
4. Take photos/videos/evidence if needed. If there’s something specific that’s becoming an issue, like gross things being left out, ensure that you have evidence. Or if they are being loud, remind them to be quiet and mark down every time you have to tell them that. Make sure everything is documented. Of course, be aware of recording/consent laws in your state/univeristy/country. 
5. Only if you have exhausted all other options - then request a room move. This is typically a last resort option, especially if your university is at capacity. Of course if you are unsafe in your room (threats from your roommate, etc), then you should immediately jump to this option. 

TL;DR: Try communication first, and only after direct communication go to the RA and escalate. :)

",How can I effectively handle a conflict with my roommate?,"The individual contributing to the Reddit post appears to be an RA (Resident Assistant) in a college setting. This role indicates that they are likely a college student, possibly in their second or third year, as RAs are typically upperclassmen. Their experience as an RA suggests they have some level of training and responsibility in managing student conflicts and peer situations.

The context implies that they are involved in a residential community, suggesting that they live on campus and are familiar with typical college life and challenges, such as roommate conflicts. There is no specific mention of their educational background, family situation, or work history beyond their current position as an RA.

hey guys, i’m writing this on a genuine whim because i’ve been struggling so much lately. i’m currently a freshman in my second semester of community college & i’ve been thinking about changing my major from computer science. i gained a love for coding after learning html, CSS, and js— i just learned the curriculum isn’t for me, i’d rather do it if it wasn’t built to set me as a software engineer :p

i’m set on changing my major, but i have a dilemma now.

my two dreams have been to either be an elementary school teacher or work in graphic design/digital arts. i’ve been working with kids in my town for two years and i love it; on the other hand, i’ve been video editing and making graphics since my childhood for outside entertainment purposes or my extracurriculars.

i decided recently i’ll be changing my major to studio arts and transferring to a school that has a design program. i’m not limited to just graphic design because i love all forms of digital art (video editing, photography, et). and then i stumbled upon my home elementary school district announcing they’ll have a teacher residency program (paired with a nearby college). that just blew my mind!

ever since my job working with kids, i’ve always had in mind maybe i should work towards elementary school teaching, the thing that holds me back is the salary lol. 

i’ve also always had in mind working within a creative department. i’ve had countless instagram accounts that blown up because i made creative video edits of things i’ve hyperfixated on. on the way, i found a love for graphic design and will just jump on any opportunity that lets me make a flyer or design of any kind.

i genuinely don’t know what to do. i don’t need firm solutions because that’s impossible, but i’d like some advice on how to think through this with a clear mind. i’m so scared of choosing one or the other and regretting it, wishing i did the opposite.

if you need more details i’m happy to provide it, again i just want advice on how to think through this with a clear mind. i’m meeting with my counselor this week, but i’m not sure 60 minutes will help me come to a conclusion.

The other day I just found out I have some serious health issues (my doctor is thinking I might have cancer, still have to run more tests.)

I am currently at University, but I decided to drop out, and I am looking into getting an online degree. It has nothing to do with me not trying hard enough, I just simply realized how much I hate school here. I have no friends, I have nothing here that is worth saving.

There are other things going into this as well. As I live a few hours away from home, it is not easy seeing a doctor. I do not have a car (sold it for textbooks lol,) so the constant back and forth has been so expensive. With my insomnia, I keep staying awake for 2-3 days at a time and falling asleep in dangerous places (school bathrooms, one time on a bench, on my bathroom floor.) I am concerned for my safety at this point.

My roommate studies out loud, like LOUD loud. Generally she's loud in everything she does, and I'm the opposite. I usually let it slide because our room is our only private space that we both have.

It's midterm season and we both have exams. She studies all day which is none of my business, but it means that she's talking to herself loudly all day in our shared space. I've tried telling her to keep it down, which she does for a bit (and it is still loud) but she goes back to it after a short while and I don't tell her again because I don't want to be annoying.

Truthfully, I can't focus on my studies anymore and I am overstimulated because it goes on all day. I'm not exaggerating, this happens for like 7-8 hours of the day at least. I realise how overwhelming it is when she leaves for a few hours and I get some quiet again.

I've thought about it, we have public spaces in our dorm where she can study out loud, there are no restrictions on noise. I haven't told her to go, but she says it's cold outside. I've also thought of going to the dorm library (only quiet place at the dorm) even though it's very busy during midterms, but sometimes it's not just about studying. It gets very overwhelming to do anything in my room when someone is talking out loud literally all day. Even when I'm asleep in the morning (I stay up later to have some quiet).

1j2qogw,"How to Make Friends in College, A Guide","I made this because I see so many posts on this sub and others about young people struggling to meet people and make friends in todays day and age of the internet. I saw a post earlier today about this and wrote up this comment to help out this dude who seemed to be struggling. I obviously got carried away but I wanted to be thorough. Unfortunately when I was done writing this he had deleted the post. I am leaving this here, hoping that others may be able find guidance from my experience.


There was a time in my college life that I didn't have many friends. From what I have experienced and seen, here is what got me out of my funk and where I am today with a friend group of over a dozen super close friends.

1. Learning to get outside my comfort zone and be around people. I know it sounds cliché but getting around people helps you work out your social muscles so when your ready to meet people your social stanima and conversation ability come more naturally and you dont come off a nervous wreck. Things just as simple as going to the gym so your around people in a tad of a vulnerable way is a good way to start this. Then move up to other things where you have a higher liklihood of talking to people spontaneously (think going to study sessions set up by a professor, career fair, volunteer opportunities, etc.).

My ace in the hole for this step if you want to fast track getting good baseline social skills and learn how to carry a conversation with strangers naturally though? Become a cashier at a grocery store part time. It forces you to talk to dozens of strangers a day from all walks of life. The key is being intentional with talking to people while your on the job. Of course it's easy to be the quiet cashier that only says hello, rings up all the items, and says your total is xyz. Instead, work on making conversation with whoever it is on the other side of the register. My go to starter was ""Hi how are you sir/ma'am do you have your loyalty card"", they give it, then something along the lines of ""and how are you doing today?"" Now not everyone will give a good answer, with some just saying a one word answer, but generally that will open up a conversation and they will tell you how they are doing. The key to making short term conversation like this is let the person talk and when they're finished talking, pick something from what they said and ask more about it. This is a good strategy as people generally like talking about themselves, so the weight of carrying the conversation is on them (this advise applies outside of being a cashier as well). 

For example, lets say its a weekday night and a women in her 30s comes to your checkout lane: 

""Hi ma'am how are you, do you have your loyalty card today"" 

""Yes I do it's 12345""

""Great thank you! And how are you doing today, anything exciting going on for you?""

""No nothing too exciting today, I don't normally get groceries today because tomorrow the day I normally get groceries I'm going to a play that my son is in. I'm very excited to watch him perform in it!""

From here this is easy, just pick something from what she said and ask her about it. For example you could say:

1. ""Oh that sounds awesome. How old is your son and is this the first play he's been in?""
2. ""Oh that sounds awesome. What is the name of the play I used to do a lot of theater in high school?""
3. ""Oh I could never be in a play I get stage fright! Is he nervous at all?
4. ""Oh I'm sure your excited! What role is your son in for the play? 


The key to this example, as well as any other conversation, is to actively listen to what is being told to you. Of course the first several times you try this it will be sloppy or you might downright fail, but that's ok, your only practicing. That's why I recommend being a cashier, it allows you to practice quickly in a setting where failure will have no negative consequences (think trying to talk to someone in your class where if you mess that up you blew it no second chances vs some random senior citizen in the checkout at foodlion that you'll never see again). Bonus points, you get paid to do this as well.

All of this is to prepare you for step #2.



2. Take a good intrinsic look at what your interests are for a career or otherwise (I strongly encourage to pick several items across various areas). Write them down. Have a list? Good. What your now going to do is go on your university's club dashboard, and find clubs that align to these interests. Your average college has dozens if not hundreds of clubs to choose from, so you have many options. Two things that I've found to be universal throughout life is the following.
   1. No matter what your interest is or how niche it is, someone somewhere (and more than likely a lot more than just one single person) shares that interest with you.
   2. Everyone, in some degree, yearns and seeks out a sense of community. This places you on more of a level playing field for meeting and making new friends than you may realize.

Using these two points, find some clubs that you have an intrinsic interest in and make it a point to go. You will undoubtedly find new members that it's their first time there if going at the start of a new year, or people who are still pretty new if going in the middle of the year. Use the skills you've been practicing to introduce yourself to people. Get to know the senior club members, especially the officers who run the club. Ask them about activities or volunteer events  the club is doing. They can get you acquainted with other club members this way. Rinse and repeat for all other clubs.





3. Take your time, have patience, but DO NOT procrastinate! College is a great, no, fantastic place to make personal and professional friends that will enrich your life and lift you up in the best ways possible. Something I did not realize when I was in college however was that college is not just a great place to make friends, but that after college in the real world, the real world is a hard place to make friends. 

With this in mind, my recommendation is to simultaneously not rush the process of making friends now artificially, but also do not put off joining clubs and getting yourself out there. In further depth, this means that you should not rush to become bff's with the first bro who gives you attention in the first club meeting you attend. People can feel if others are rushing and/or being desperate. That puts people off and can push them away. Instead, have patience and take things at a slower pace. Don't ask to hang out outside of the club after meeting someone for the first, or even second time. Let a raport grow first within the setting of the environment that you originally met. 

Meet multiple people at the same time. Do not put too much stock and energy into one single person. If you feel there is no connection (the vibe check fails) stay respectful but don't be afraid to cut your losses and move on. Your not going to vibe with everyone you meet. For those that you do, 7 out of 10 of them your only going to be acquaintes with. For the remainder, you may become decent friends with. For about 20-33% of that group you may become close friends with. That is how quality close deep friendships are found. 

From there let things progress naturally. If you have any luck, the people you become friends and close friends with will have a friendgroup that they may introduce you to (if possible try to do this with the acquaintces you have). Poof! Now you have more potential friends that are already probably around a similar vibe that you have. Also the fact that their friend introduced you means you have social validation, which makes it a good bit easier to introduce yourself to those new people in that group.

Again before I wrap up, I want to stress again how hard it is to make friends after college in the real world. If you want more proof of this concept, simply look it up on reddit.



To conclude, I have a few pieces of advise.

-One thing I've noticed from a overarching point of view of looking at the whole process of social mobility and having friends, is it is a lot like the wealth inequality of today's age. The less friends you have, the harder it is to get any. But the more friends you have, the easier it can be to get them. It's somewhat like the financial concept of compound returns. If you don't know what that is, I highly suggest looking it up. With this in mind, note that it may take you some time to get an initial group of friends, but also note that the beginning is the hardest part. It's like getting a snowball started down the mountain.

-I caution making friends with people where the only thing that you both have a shared interest in is doing a drug or vice of some sort. If you decide later in life that you want or need to stop this, you will have a hard time keeping that friend.

-Its a process. Learn to embrace the journey. It's normal to feel challenges like this at this age in your life. There are others who are in the same boat as you. If you find those people, you will find it easy to make friends.

-Have no shame in going to talk therapy if you think it will help. I highly recommend it just to keep your personal life and life objectives in order. Talking things out can really be the ""ah ha"" moment for you to figure out what you need to do. They can also help you with fine tuning your ability to meet new people via telling you what your doing right and what you need to work.

-Very simply, if you are having a down day or are struggling with being alone, or you tried to practice talking to someone and it just didn't work, go for a walk. Seriously. It will take your mind off things and you will feel so much better afterwards.

1j2k73a,Wondering if my college is challenging me enough…,"I’m a freshman at college this year and I am experiencing some worries when it comes to the level of education I am receiving. I want other people’s opinions on this because I’m so confused on whether I should transfer to another school or stick it out here. 

The first thing is I find all my classes pretty easy. Right now I am averaging no lower than an A on all my classes, for this semester and last semester. I’m going to clarify that I am an undeclared student, which is why I thought that my classes in the fall semester were easy because they were mostly gen-eds. But I started taking some more major aligned courses (like micro-economics) and I’m still finding it easy. This is causing some concern to be risen internally that I am not getting a strong enough education…

I think for my major I think I want to do something in a business, maybe accounting? I am still trying to figure everything out, but there are other majors/subjects that interest me too, I just want to get a good job and make a good salary for myself in the future. 

But on the flip side while I am finding my classes easy, the professors I have seem to be passionate about what they are teaching. Most of my classes are heavy lecture based, so a lot of just sitting around and listening. 

I am in a state right now of complete uncertainty lol. I am debating transferring, have actually brought it up with my mom (she thinks it is just freshmen worries and I am super homesick), but on the flip side I don’t want to start all over (I would probably be transferring the spring semester of sophomore year) and I have heard that it is a difficult process because of transferring credits and such.

1j2ifts,Are there any 'Traditional' Pen-and-Paper Colleges? Universities that do not heavily use Blackboard/Online components for every Course?,"In 2015 I entered my first year of Uni and I struggled severely with my Maths Courses - I did awesome on my In-Class Assignments and my Pen-and-Paper Exams. Problem was, the online Homeworks. If you don't type your answer in the exact format the answer is listed on their 'Server' as, you're marked incorrect, regardless of if your answer is of equal value. My Professor at the time didn't care when I asked for assistance trying to understand what format the Site was looking for *(I think it was ""UT"" from the University of Texas?)*.

At my wit's end, I went to the Tutoring Centre, had my Homework all completed on paper and I'd try plugging the answers in, sitting side-by-side with someone who took the Course the year before me. He'd say *""That looks right""* and I'd lose .25 Points over and over and over on each question, as we couldn't figure out the preferred format for the Answer. I got an F on the Homework, with someone right there who passed the year before. It was so demoralising I took a Withdrawal mid-Semester. Knowing I'm capable of getting an A *(and even getting one on the Midterm!)*, but scoring low-B's to C's on every Homework was so discouraging and from my POV felt like artificial difficulty because my Uni entered into a contract with some Tech entity to ""optimise"" education.

It's been almost a decade, I'm successful in my career but I still want a Degree - I love learning! But all I'm hearing about is BlackBoard and other Sites being used now even for Essays and Fill-in-the-Blank Questions. Or about Respondus bugging out every time you try to take a Test, clicking 'Submit' on an Assignment only to have the page tell you you've been Signed-Out and all your progress is lost, Professors accusing you of using AI *(or using it themselves???)* etc. I just don't know if I can deal with **everything** being Virtual, especially Maths. Do I just have to tough it out and maybe it's better in higher-level Courses, or Grad School, when Professors have less to individually grade so they do it themselves?

**Or** \- maybe BlackBoard and all of these Sites/Programs are better nowadays? It's not that I'm tech-illiterate, my job is in IT and I code in some of the basic languages, but the whole song-and-dance is too taxing if College is less about evaluating what I've learned about the material and more about jumping through a hoops to placate faceless Apps that never gave any formatting instructions.

Sorry if this feels complain-y. I really do **want** to go to College, but it's an expensive pool to jump back into if the water's going to be the exact same. I appreciate any insight you may have on the state of these tools or how your specific Uni handles things.","Is the current virtual learning environment and technology in universities more accommodating than it was a decade ago, especially for courses like Maths?","The individual began their university education in 2015 and experienced significant challenges, particularly with their Maths Courses.

I realize I’m only a sophomore, but I’ve been wondering this for the last little bit. In my APUSH (AP US History) class, I’ve been having trouble with the pacing of the class and how the assignments work. I love my teacher to death, and I also know we have to go over things quickly, but he gets caught up on certain things too often for me to be able to fully understand what’s being taught.


On top of this, I also just don’t find the material to be very interesting, so that could be a contributor to that. I have an essay coming up soon that’s supposed to be written in the POV of a person of note from the Jacksonian Era (in my case, writing from the POV of John Calhoun), but none of the questions I have to answer in this essay are making sense to me with the material in the book we were given.

On the other hand, I’m taking another, more chill college level class (Dual-Psych), and I find that class much more engaging and fun than my APUSH class. We do hands-on activities and the material is more interesting to me.

On top of this, I’ve never been very good with attention. I’m fairly sure I’ve got some kind of ADHD, as I get side tracked very easily (hell, I’m getting side tracked now instead of writing my essay).

1j28p8f,I graduate in two months. Is post grad going to be as scary as it feels?,"

Hi!! Apologies for the random post but I really need some input from those who have been there done that. Because I’m really stressing.

Basically, I am a senior in college majoring in computer science. I graduate and leave campus for good in… well, pretty much two months, give or take a couple weeks. I’m trying to just keep my head down and stay focused on submitting my thesis and passing classes but the unknown of- well, everything- after college is REALLY getting to me. As in I can’t even sleep without having nightmares.

My biggest thing is being scared of being all on my own. I never had such an open ended ‘what now?’ Feeling. High school I knew I was going to college. But now I have no idea. I’ve tried applying for internships and research cohorts for the summer but haven’t heard back (yet? Hopefully). That’s my first hurdle- surviving in a job market that I’m graduating at a horrible time for. I’ve heard so many stories about it being SO hard to get even a basic job, let alone one in my field. I worry if it comes down to it and I can’t secure a job (summer or otherwise) I’ll have to give up on forming my own independence and have to live with my parents who I love, but are incredibly toxic to live with. I really want to avoid that at all costs.

The other big issue is my roommate right now. We are SUPER close, as in a weird more than best friends but not dating (we are both lgbtq so it’s more of a lavender couple if anything lol). I’m a very stability focused person and he is big on keeping options open. I’m terrified that our plan to get an apartment with each other in November will fall through if he decides he doesn’t want to be around me for whatever reason. Obviously the answer would be ‘okay??? Find another roommate or live alone and get over it’ but while I’ve gotten over most of my anxious attachment issues I think it would be REALLY terrifying for me to go from having my friends as my support system and then all of a sudden being just… me. So I really hope he will at least be the one consistent thing but I know I can’t guarantee that. He could get zapped by lightning tomorrow! And I definitely (with or without him) want to not just follow him around and make friends with his friends, but actually work on being confident and finding my own people.

Anyways, sorry for the ramble but does anyone have advice on how to keep going even when everything is SO uncertain? Because going through my day with constant stress headaches and nightmares is NOT it fr",How can I keep going when everything feels so uncertain and I'm experiencing constant stress and nightmares?,"The individual is a senior in college majoring in computer science, set to graduate in about two months.

1j1s3q0,I'm losing my mind! Am I overreacting?,"
Let me start by saying my sister is a teacher, my mother is a teacher, my aunt is a teacher, and I currently work at a high school with other teachers. 

I am currently in an English writing class online. It is a short semester class (starting in January and ending in March). Everything was fine until I submitted my first essay. I received a zero on my first essay, which brought my grade down to 45. I set up a meeting with my professor to understand why I received a zero. She told me it was because my essay came back 77% AI. I was confused because I never used AI. So we went back and recounted all that I did on the essay. Well, come to find out, it is because I used Grammarly to fix a couple of grammar mistakes. I did not know that Grammarly was considered AI, as I had been using it for my other classes, and MY college gave it to us for free. She explained she understood, and that is why she sent an email detailing the use of Grammarly. Well, I apologized for my mistake and took full accountability. I accepted my zero, stopped using Grammarly, enlisted help from my sister and my coworkers, and even uninstalled it from my computer.  Note: that she also said that if I needed the grade at the end of the course, she would let me re-write the essay. 

Fast forward to yesterday, I submitted my LAST paper for this class and I received another zero! She said I used AI again, 40%. Which drops my grade from 90 to 67. This time, I was extra confused because I knew for sure I had never used AI. Upset, I emailed her to let her know that since the first incident, I have never used AI. I told her that I had the rough draft and outline to prove that I did not use it. I spent hours writing this essay and my psychology essay at the same time. I even had my sister, who is an English teacher, and some of the teachers at my job re-read it. And it doesn't make sense that I would use AI on the very last paper of this class that is worth the most points. I mentioned that I had turned in multiple essays before this that were not flagged and didn't do anything differently. So why would I use AI now! 

.** Side note: in one of my other classes, we had a discussion on AI, and I asked my teacher privately how Turnitin detects AI because I received a zero in another class. She explained that she put her own written words into the AI checker, and it came back 74%. She said that it was not accurate and no professor should use it as a means to grade a student but use their judgment. That's what that professor, who is also a superintendent, said. **

Well, I guess she did not like the tone of my email or whatever and replied that I never mentioned my sister was an English teacher. She questioned the validity of my essays because the email style that I sent to her didn't match my writing style. She mentioned she saw I did well on all the other essays. She says AI detects AI, so, of course, humans wouldn't detect it. She also mentions that I admitted to using Grammarly before, so that knocks down some of the validity. She ended the email by asking if there was anything else she needed to know. As if I was keeping secrets from her.  

Still clearly upset, I emailed her back to let her know that I didn't appreciate her accusing me of letting my sister write my papers. I explain comparing how I write emails and how I write essays makes no sense. I love writing, so I put forth a lot of effort into writing. I try to make sure my writing is perfect. Emails are emails. I also mentioned that she glossed over that I let MULTIPLE people re-read my essay, not just this one but every single one in her class. I let her know I work in a high school with English teachers, so I have also let them re-read my essays. We get free tutoring through the school where we can submit papers and people re-read them. I saw no difference between letting the people around me re-read the essays and letting the English department at my school re-read them. I let her know that I have never needed anyone or AI to write my essays. She hasn't emailed me back yet. 

I worked really hard on this essay and even lost some sleep trying to finish this essay and my psychology essay which were due at the same time. It just seems crazy to me that the FIRST and LAST essays were flagged for AI but none of the ones between. I am not saying that my professor is out to get it because she's never given that, but it doesn't make sense!

Im pretty set on it at the moment because I can't imagine a life where I don't do it, atleast semi professionally. But with the current job market and political climate, I don't feel comfortable just jumping headfirst into a BFA. 
I'm looking at colleges that offer a BA in musical theatre for more flexibility, but i wanted to know: what are some good double majors that could go along well with this? I kind of want to just have a stable, repetitive 9-5 or 6-3, monday-friday, and then do theatre on the side. Are there any certificates or degrees that would be good for something like this? I'm just getting nervous with the way things are looking.","What are some good double majors that could pair well with a BA in musical theatre, and are there any certificates or degrees that would provide stability for a 9-5 job while doing theatre on the side?","The individual is a sophomore in high school with aspirations of pursuing a musical theatre program in college.

Do you ever see College professors engaging with their undergrad and graduate students in such a way where they can build good close relationships?

There are student organizations at my school for various different programs like ASME, IEEE and also some cultural organizations like CSA, SASA, ISA etc. They usually organize events throughout the year like formals, galas, game nights, lunch or dinner parties, dance performances, concerts, award nights, banquets etc. It is a great way for professors and students to hang out in spaces outside of classrooms so they can bond and get to know each other more.

In high school, it was pretty common to see teachers go to events organized by their students like homecoming and concerts and stuff. It was always fun to see our teachers there coming to these events but I haven’t seen that happen in college very much at all!

**Tips:**

1.  If you want to find the truly secluded bathrooms, look for them while you're looking for your classes. Especially before the semester starts. This leads me into my next point.
2.  Go up a floor (or down in some cases), most people are lazy and don't want to put in more effort. Most buildings at my D2 state university don't even go above 3 floors, yet without fail the 2nd and 3rd floor bathrooms are usually much cleaner and empty
3.  Building off the 2nd point - go to buildings further away from the dorms if possible. Some people might have the same idea as you.
4.  Also just explore the buildings while you're at it in general, I've literally explored almost every single floor of the buildings at my college. I know where almost every single staircase is on my campus (at least in the buildings that aren't under construction).

I have a BFA in theatre, and though they didn't have official minors, I crafted my schedule to have a secondary focus on performance history. I also graduated with honors, so not particularly worried about the GPA side of things, but I'm worried that the ""F"" in ""BFA"" might be a red flag to anyone reviewing my application, since there's a perception of those degrees being easy/too specialized to apply to anything else (at least in my family/circle, where most people have advanced degrees in STEM).
 

I'm going to be applying for Folklore, Heritage Studies, and History programs at several different schools.

1j4gq6o,team project advice,"So I’m currently in a 4 person team project and one of my teammates is a much more experienced software engineer and 10 years senior.
I thought it would be awesome to reach out for their insight since they’re almost done with the program and any advice for an early professional. I’ve openly shared my respect for their experience.
Their communication style is cut and dry which is fine but on the topic of favorite classes in the program, they mentioned how they would have enjoyed the current class more if ‘no offense, it wasn’t a team project’. 
I was a bit miffed so asked to clarify if it was something I could improve upon as a teammate or if they meant the structure - to which they said it was the structure.
The entire time they were a bit nonchalant which again is fine but this is was riled me up.
I’ve committed the most amount of time rewriting the writing component, doing the data analysis, and decision tree modeling. How do I know? They would echo findings I’d already have mentioned and I’ve always been the one to present my analysis. 
I don’t mind shouldering the work since I’m learning but what gets me going is the authoritative tone they use when the real work is done by me. The last straw was feedback that was obviously indicative of them not really looking at the actual dataset and it’s been really hard not to sound defensive and annoyed.

1j4giro,I really feel like my master's thesis is riddled with flaws and I'm worried that it's going to suck,"I'm doing a master's thesis in psychology. We designed 2 experiments that were ran over the summer. I passed everything by my advisors who said that they thought they seemed like logical studies that were designed well. We got the data in like January (we had to get the data from the university which took ages) and there's a number of problems that I see:

\- No significant results. I know this doesn't affect your grade in theory but it certainly makes the paper less interesting.

\- Very underpowered. We split up the sample by two characteristics of participants because we wanted to compare them. We thought that the groups would be about even but they weren't even close, one is much smaller than the other. After making some necessary data exclusions our sample size was very very small, with our sample sizes for conditions going into the like 20's. It's because we have too many conditions. If we simplified it the sample sizes would have been larger. I didn't realize how small they would be or that this would be so drastic. If I could go back and change it I would.

\- One of the manipulations we wanted to make in the first experiment didn't make sense and I didn't realize that until looking at the data. We would have to look at the data in some very restricted ways to even see if there was an effect. We can cut it out but it kind of makes the first experiment redundant. 

\- The only results we have that support any of our hypotheses only really make sense in the context of previous hypotheses being true. We can still use it but it makes it much less insightful.

I can't run any more experiments because this is data that we can only collect in the summer and the thesis is due in May. I'm really annoyed because I'm a much better researcher than this, I see all of these issues very clearly and I know how to change the study design to improve it. I made these designs almost a year ago now and it was all cleared by my professor. I talked to her about my concerns and she said that these are all points that I could acknowledge in my paper and try to defend, but I don't know. I can't imagine that the committee is going to see such an underpowered study with manipulations that don't really make sense and thinks it's all okay because I acknowledged them as limitations.

1j4e8q9,Should I go to LSE or King’s College?,"Hello!

American here. I was recently accepted to King’s College London’s MA Conflict, Security and Development-as well as London School of Economics’s MSc Human Rights & Politics. For context-I studies political science and history for undergrad-and have come out of uni with no undergraduate debt (thankfully).

It’s been a dream of mine to study a masters in London. I studied abroad here during undergrad and fell in love with the city. Additionally-I have a girlfriend here and we’ve been doing long distance since December ‘23. 

The problem is-I will be going into debt for these schools. There is a chance that I can apply for a fellowship that could fund a good chunk of it-but without scholarships it’s going to be around 40k for the programs.

Is this worth it? I know a lot of American students have come out of undergrad with far worse debt-and these are great, globally know schools. Especially with LSE-the connections I could make going there would translate well both in the US and the UK.

I also haven’t completely ruled out going to law school-though that would be down the line in say 3-4 years.

1j48g4y,Dealing with difficult students as a grad student,"I tutor students at my university's library. I love it, it is very rewarding, and 99% of the students come in with great questions and really want to improve their skills. 

There is one particular student who comes to our centre multiple times a week, and I am quite convinced her end goal is to get us to do her work for her. If she receives any critical feedback, she completely shuts down, gets defensive, and questions my feedback. Today, I was explaining to her that although she provided explanations for parts of a thought, she didn't provide an explanation for the entire thought in her essay. I emphasized to her that it's important to give a big picture. I got met with ""well, what I've written already says that so I'm confused what you're saying"". And I've dealt with this student many times, so I explained it in other words once more, and then moved on. She kept circling back to it because I wasn't giving her a satisfactory answer. I just said it's no longer important, and of course, she never fails to be bratty, and said ""then why would you tell me to fix something if it wasn't important in the first place"". I told her that it is not essential to her paper, but that my suggestion would improve her paper, however, I can't force her to be receptive to my feedback, and I can't tell her what to do if she doesn't like it. 

The session ended shortly after, and she left. I feel defeated. I feel like other tutors have been able to get through to her. I have asked their advice, but they have not really given me consistent answers. I really don't put up with bullshit from students - and I know some of the tutors try to appease this student. I don't think she is getting good feedback anymore, because the tutors can't be critical of her. I would rather leave her with my feedback and let her give me attitude back, than not give her any useful feedback at all (or edit/write her work for her). 

This has me thinking about my (potential) future career in academia and in graduate school. I feel as if dealing with difficult students is not something we are taught to deal with. Frankly, we aren't taught how to teach... really at all. I want to be an effective instructor. And I want to be able to get through to otherwise good, but highly emotional and volatile students. I don't want to write these students off and give them a lesser quality of instruction because of their poor attitude; I know I definitely wasn't a peach in my late teen years, and I can imagine my instruction suffered as a result.

It is way more than I can afford and I told her that prior to the lease takeover. I fully expected her at this point to pay half of the rent when I paid at the beginning of the month, so I just paid and texted her asking how she'd like to pay me her half. She acted like we never had that conversation and said ""you took over the lease so now it's your responsibility"".

She told me I should be graduating in December and that I should return my cap and gown and bring my GPA up. My GPA is a 3.45. I understand it could be better. But it could be worse. I worked full time 40+ hours a week during college, I live in Florida and we had a major hurricane come through my town that i live in/went to school in that basically destroyed my whole town, I lost my car, etc. but I’ve always wanted to pursue a masters degree and then eventually get a PhD.

1j3zpww,What I Learned From Reading Hundreds of Student CVs: How to Best Make Up for a Low GPA and Get In Great Schools,"Nowadays, in every Reddit scroll session I go on, I see people needing advice on how to make up for a low GPA. In the last two years, because of my job and my side projects, I have read more student CVs than I can count, and I've been thinking about writing a post on this for so long; and here it is, finally!

As I said I've seen too many CVs, some from applicants with the highest grades possible, others from students who struggled academically but still found ways to stand out. After seeing so many applications, I’ve realized something important: **a low GPA is not a dead end**. It feels that way when you’re staring at your transcript, wondering if it’ll hold you back. But I’ve seen firsthand how students compensate for it; and sometimes even turn it into a strength. If you’re worried about your GPA, here’s what I’ve learned from the students who made it work: (But don't forget that the first and most important thing in all of this, is ACTUALLY WANTING TO GET IN and genuinely putting the effort to get a seat at the table.)  


*A low GPA doesn’t define your potential, your story does.* Let me tell you sth, in most cases, the students who overcame their GPA didn’t ignore it; they framed it. Some wrote about personal hardships that impacted their grades, but they didn’t stop there. They explained how they rebounded: taking on research, improving in later semesters, or excelling in related projects. They made it clear that their GPA was a chapter, not the whole story. 

*Research experience can outweigh grades (DUH!)*. One of the strongest patterns I’ve noticed is that students with hands-on research experience often get further than those with perfect GPAs but no practical work. If you’ve got a low GPA, get involved in research. Volunteer in a lab, assist with a professor’s project, and work on an independent study. A solid research background proves you have the skills to succeed beyond the classroom and in my opinion, every supervisor that is experienced enough, cares more about this than just a GPA.

*Networking and strong recommendations make a difference (More than you think)*. I’ve seen students with average GPAs get into great programs because professors knew them personally and could vouch for their abilities. If your grades aren’t perfect, make sure your relationships with professors, mentors, and researchers are. A strong letter from someone who has worked closely with you can shift the focus from numbers to your actual potential. It's like a testimony for your abilities, and yes, committees do count on those words.

*A standout CV tells a stronger story than a transcript*. The best CVs I’ve read don’t just list coursework; they showcase skills, impact, and growth. They highlight research, projects, and leadership roles. They emphasize practical experience over classroom performance. If your GPA isn’t high, your CV should be airtight! Every line should reinforce why you’re a strong candidate, and writing that kind of a CV isn't that difficult, you just have to be passionate, FOR REAL. 

*Skills matter more than you think*. Some of the most compelling applications I’ve seen come from students who built technical skills: programming, data analysis, lab techniques, languages, and writing. Even if their GPA was lower, their ability to do things made them stand out. If your grades aren’t strong, double down on learning tangible, marketable skills. I personally have even seen a student who had a 2.5/4 GPA but the 4 year serious experience in coding made them win a great position!

*A compelling statement of purpose can change everything*. MAN! Reading a SOP that has everything in its own place is actually fun and refreshing! I’ve read SOPs where students owned their GPA struggles and then proved why they were still a strong candidate. They didn’t make excuses. They showed resilience, growth, and evidence of their strengths. A powerful SOP can shift the focus from your weaknesses to your unique strengths, especially if you can articulate well on how you’ve overcome challenges.

*Improvement matters*. A low GPA is one thing; a clear upward trajectory is another. If your early semesters were rough but your later ones show improvement, make sure that’s highlighted. It tells reviewers that your struggles weren’t the full picture. That you adapted, grew, and figured things out. (Tbh, a little confusion in your bachelor's years is acceptable for committees, So just don't stay there for too long!)

If you’re reading this and feeling stuck because of your GPA, I want you to know that you’re not alone, and more importantly, that you’re not out of options, a loser, or talentless. I’ve seen students with low GPAs get into great programs, land research opportunities, and build careers they’re proud of. It’s about how you tell your story, where you invest your efforts, and how you prove your potential beyond a number. IT IS REALLY POSSIBLE TO GET BEYOND THAT NUMBER!

So don’t let your GPA hold you back. Take control of the rest of your application. Show them who you are beyond the numbers. You’ve got this and if there's anything I can help you with, just tell!",How can I improve my chances of getting into a program despite having a low GPA?,"The individual in the Reddit post has experience in reviewing student CVs and applications, which suggests a background in a role related to recruitment, admissions, or education.

1j3rc2g,"Advisor don't let me graduate, what are optinos?","I was accepted into a fully funded research-based MSc program two years ago. Before starting, my advisor asked about my plans after my MSc, and I told him I wanted to pursue a PhD. I verbally committed to continuing with him for my PhD, as he often emphasized that he invests in MSc students, brings them up to speed, and expects them to stay for a PhD.

At the start of my MSc, he gave me a raw idea—an extension of one of his previous papers. The idea was quite underdeveloped, and I struggled for a long time to refine it and make it feasible, but it didn’t work out well. Despite this, he pushed me to publish a conference paper based on that idea, and I did. The results were not particularly strong, but the paper was accepted anyway.

He was fully aware of my performance and qualifications from my letters of recommendation before offering me the MSc position. To be honest, I am not an exceptional student—nor particularly clever or creative. I tend to struggle with tasks more than others. For example, if a typical student completes a task in one month, it might take me two. That being said, he still accepted me, and given that the university isn’t particularly prestigious, it was a fair match for my qualifications.

After a year, my personal priorities changed, and I decided to apply for PhD programs somewhere else. I repeatedly made it clear that my decision wasn’t an act of betrayal but was based on personal reasons. However, my advisor saw this as dishonesty, believing that I had broken my earlier verbal commitment.

Since then, his attitude toward me completely changed. I remained the same student with the same level of performance, but he became more aggressive and frequently blamed me for my lack of progress.

Two months ago, he explicitly stated that I could defend with my current research paper, making it clear that he wanted me to finish as soon as possible. He even said, ""I’m happy that you’re leaving here.""

Now, with only two months left in the semester, he has shifted his stance. He wants me to finalize my thesis by improving the results from my conference paper and submitting them to a journal. He has stated that he will not arrange my defense unless I demonstrate progress beyond the conference paper. He is fully aware that I have been struggling to improve the results for the past 10 months and likely knows that achieving significant improvements in just two months is unrealistic. However, he insists on it, and he has even said that if I fail to improve the results, I must either leave without an MSc degree or continue paying tuition and living expenses out of my pocket until I achieve reasonable results.

This brings me to my question: Can he legally prevent me from graduating?

I have several PhD friends who faced similar situations, but they were usually able to graduate with an MSc instead of a PhD. The difference in my case is that I am already in an MSc program, and I have sufficient materials for a defense—a conference paper that he himself agreed was enough two months ago. However, now he has changed his mind.

At this stage, I suspect he is simply making a final push to extract more work from me. But my concern is—what if I fail to produce better results? What are my options?",Can my advisor legally prevent me from graduating with my MSc degree?,"The individual in the Reddit post is currently enrolled in a fully funded research-based MSc program, which they started two years ago. They initially expressed a desire to pursue a PhD after completing their MSc and verbally committed to continuing with their current advisor for that PhD. Their academic history indicates they were accepted into this program with the understanding that they would stay on for further studies, despite not considering themselves an exceptional student and often struggling with tasks more than their peers.

The individual completed a conference paper based on a poorly developed idea from their advisor, which was accepted despite the results not being strong. They have acknowledged their struggles in keeping up with typical academic demands, noting that tasks that may take other students one month can take them twice as long.

In addition to their academic challenges, their personal priorities shifted after a year in the program, prompting them to apply for PhD programs at other institutions. They communicated their decision to their advisor, but he viewed this as a breach of their verbal commitment. This change in plans has resulted in a significant shift in their advisor's attitude, leading to increased pressure and blame regarding their performance and progress.

With only two months left in their semester, the advisor has shifted expectations about what is required for graduation, demanding improvements to the results of the conference paper, a target the individual feels is unrealistic given the timeline and their current struggles.

While I was in his class, I was also writing a thesis on a similar topic and asked if he could be my advisor. He was happy to do so.

I met with him a few times to talk about it and also asked to have a few chats about PhD programs. Throughout this time his responses were usually delayed and he would get on the chat a bit late or cancel last minute. During my thesis presentation for his class, I froze up a bit when I was talking about one of the slides (stage fright). During our last conversation, he seemed annoyed with the questions I was asking regarding PhD applications/researchers I was interested in and when I casually asked if he could write me a LoR if I decide to apply in the future, he goes, ""Do you want to be in academia or industry"" I told him was open to both, and he said, ""Let me know if decide you want to go into academia, then we can talk"".

I get that I was a low priority and he was doing me a favor by being my advisor despite how busy he is so maybe that was just culture, but got the sense that he didn't like me - maybe i seemed like I was trying too hard to be a goody-too-shoes?

1j3fjgy,How is UCLA MS ECE like in the field of communications and signal systems,"
I am a prospective student and recently got admitted to UCLA’s MS ECE program. I’ve been excited about the opportunity to study at UCLA for years, but after looking into some course plans online, I now have a few questions.

I plan to focus on communications and signal processing, and I’d like to understand more about the courses and resources available in these fields. I checked the Signals & Systems program planner (this data was made during 2019-20) on the ECE grad school website, but some of the courses listed there don’t seem to be available in the current UCLA General Catalog.

A couple of questions I have:
	1.    Does UCLA’s MS ECE program offer abundant courses and resources in this field?
	2.	As an international student, what are the job and research opportunities like in this field for MS students?
      3.   Do I have the flexibility to take courses outside of ECE, such as CS courses; and even if it exceeds the required graduation credits can i still take more?

1j3e4wi,Is spending 6 years in undergrad a red flag?,"Hello everyone!

I'll be graduating from undergrad in six years, after needing to do several semesters of part-time after I sustained a brain injury and developed a serious illness as a result. My illness, along with my caretaking responsibilities, have also had an adverse impact on my GPA, and I'll be graduating with a 3.7x. By the time I graduate, I will have spent six years in undergrad. I'll be taking a few years off to work in scientific research before applying.

Do grad school admission committees care about how long it took someone to graduate? Do they read addendums that address extenuating circumstances? I've been encouraged by my research mentor to apply to the top programs in my field, but I don't know whether spending six years in undergrad is a red flag or will be viewed negatively. I also don't know if addressing my illness on my application will compensate for a GPA that's almost universally lower than the medians for the top 20-30 programs in my field.

I'll be applying to mid-tier programs as well, but I'd rather not go into the process without any idea of how my application will be received at top schools. I'd really appreciate any insight.

Edit: I really appreciate everyone who's responded so far, and hearing your stories makes me so proud of and inspired by all of you :) I want to make one clarification: this question is specific to top programs.

1j3du0s,"Need advice, feeling discouraged","
I’m dealing with a grading issue that could have serious consequences and would love some advice.

My professor heavily deducted points for APA formatting and content, initially docking a large percentage in both areas (40% each). After discussing it, she partially adjusted the APA score, but refused to reconsider the content grade. The only submission annotation  I got was that my introduction lacked a clear thesis or purpose statement. 

It also seems like they graded based on criteria that weren’t explicitly outlined in the rubric. The APA deductions feel harsh for minor formatting issues, and I’m concerned about how this will impact my future work in the course.

The real issue is that if I end up with a B, I could be dismissed from my program. Given that, is it worth escalating this further, or should I just move on and focus on doing well on future assignments?

Has anyone faced a similar situation? How did you handle it?

1j3dhtt,Changing Research Focus from MSc to PhD?,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to gather some thoughts on a question I’ve been thinking about:

**Is it possible to shift research focus between your MSc and PhD?**  
I’m not talking about a complete change of field, but rather moving within the same broad area.

For example (specific to Mathematics, my major): If my master’s thesis is on secant varieties and geometric representation theory, but I apply for PhDs in, say, symplectic topology, would I still have a chance of being considered? Both topics fall under geometry, but they aren’t explicitly related.

So my main question is: 

**How much does your master’s thesis influence your PhD research topic? Have any of you successfully transitioned between related but distinct areas?**

1j36wt3,"I’m graduating from my PhD program but my mom told me she doesn’t want to come, but idc… do I need therapy?","So it’s a little more complicated than that. My mom and I have had a bad relationship since I started college. For background my mom is old school Hispanic, straight from Mexico, and is severely catholic. She was very strict as I grew up but I was very introverted so I didn’t care about what she made me do. I just did it quietly so that she wouldn’t smack me across the face. She also has never been outright affectionate. When I was graduating high school I wanted to go to a “better college” than my sister went to. My older sister was going to a CSU an hour away and commuting by train bc they wouldn’t let her drive or live by campus (we couldn’t afford it and they didn’t know how to fill out the fafsa correctly). When it was my turn to go to college they didn’t “let me” go far away and decided I would go to the same CSU and me and my sister would go together. In my second year of college the relationship with my mother and maternal grandmother (lived with us) started getting bad. Screaming matches and arguing all the time. I was really starting to think about a lot of the fucked up stuff my grandma was saying to my face. The one that stood out the most was “how are you going to get married if you don’t know how to cook? You only know how to do math?” I was infuriated. I was studying for calculus 2 and was a biotechnology major. I was outscoring premeds even though I had no desire to go to medical school. I was first gen American and the 2nd in my family to go to college so we could never afford it. But my mom was really strict about me continuing in higher education. From a young age I was always at the top of my class so none of this was surprising. Yet my grandma and my mom always scolded me for questioning them, and correcting them and told me I was disrespectful for going against them. That they knew best… even tried giving me advice for college when my grandma stopped going to school at 12 got married at 13 and had two children by 15 (in Mexico). I never listened but as college went, my relationships with them got worse. The more independent I got, the more they showed signs of jealousy I think. I moved away to grad school a couple of hours away… things were ok for a while.

I would visit from time to time but only to see my very old dogs. When I moved away for grad school I left my childhood dog bc she had separation anxiety and my sister worked from home so I decided it would be best if she stayed with my sister. Well eventually as I got more educated, I resented the way my mom and her mom treated me more and more. They put me down all the time and said I “acted like I was better than them.” And when my brother said “well…. Isn’t she technically?” They went silent. They said whatever they could it seemed like to be mean to me. My mom said she never even wanted to have kids and that’s why she treated us bad growing up. I called her psycho and told her she needed a therapist to which she laughed. Well… eventually my dog started dying of cancer. I was visiting more frequently to visit my dog of 16 years. After she passed this past October I didn’t care about anything. I didn’t care who I offended, I didn’t care what happened to my life personally or professionally. I spiraled… only finding comfort in a select few. My brother, my sister and my boyfriend. I shut everyone out, I called my parents only to fight because my mom’s 8 siblings were verbally attacking my siblings over the sale of a family house to my siblings and I. Every time I saw my mom call I would think “fuck I don’t want to talk to this bitch.” I knew she was trying to manipulate my siblings and I (26-30 in age) for the capital gain of her siblings (all 48+ in age). I started setting boundaries and telling her to treat me with respect or that she wouldn’t be seeing me, and that I would make sure my siblings wanted nothing to do with her. She said she didn’t care, and in my mind I knew she truly meant it. I told her you might not care or love us like a good mother would, but I know dad does and I know dad does. After that she behaved for a while. In December my grandma called me a controlling manipulative bitch that was just trying to control my siblings into doing what I wanted bc they didn’t want to sponsor one of our uncles for American citizenship. My siblings told her that they would only ever listen to my advice because I was the only person in the whole family that had shown reliability and responsibility. They said they trusted me not just bc of my future doctor title but because I had only ever shown I wanted the best for my siblings. This was a few days before my grandmas birthday. She ended up in the hospital… some sort of kidney infection and I never called to say happy birthday. I honestly felt no sense on anxiety or anything at the fact that she was in the hospital. I felt more when my childhood dog of 16 years would get sick. She never called to say sorry for calling me a controlling manipulative bitch. In that moment I realized she had never learned to apologize… ever in her life. Neither had my mom… or her siblings.

My grandma and I haven’t talked…. My brother and I both have birthdays separated by one day. So it’s pretty hard to forget them. My brothers birthday is in January, and it happens and my grandma doesn’t say happy birthday. Mine is the day after and she doesn’t say  happy birthday and we know she has them memorized. My sister asks her a week later why she didn’t say anything… my grandma said it’s because I didn’t call her on her birthday. My sister said maybe you should apologize and my grandma says she’s never done anything wrong. From that day forward I make the decision that she doesn’t have to speak to a “controlling manipulative bitch” and that I don’t have to speak to a grandmother that doesn’t actually care for me. It’s better that way. She doesn’t ask about me to my sister like she usually does, and I don’t ask about her (I hadn’t in years).

Graduation registration opens, I’m pretty hesitant to walk since the end of this PhD seems extremely bitter for other work reasons (my mentor has ALS, my major professor asked me not to take a job offer and then asked me to TA my last quarter, and I’m just burnt out as I also have RA a chronic illness I developed in my third year of grad school). This entire PhD has been bitter. I decide to walk for the people that are supportive of me or at least should have been. I call my mom and say I have two tickets for you.

Should I be concerned about not caring, or is it okay to prioritize my boundaries?","The individual describing their situation in the Reddit post provides a background rich in personal history and context that leads to their current crisis:

- **Family Background**: The person comes from a traditional Hispanic family, with their mother being originally from Mexico and adhering to strict Catholic values. The relationship with their mother has been particularly strained since the individual started college, characterized by a lack of affection and involvement in contentious arguments. They also mention a maternal grandmother who lived with them and contributed to the contentious family dynamics.

- **Education**: The individual is a first-generation American and was the second in their family to attend college. They have always excelled academically and are currently completing a PhD, specializing in biotechnology. Their academic success contrasts sharply with their family's views, particularly those of their mother and grandmother, who both scolded them for prioritizing education over traditional roles typically expected of women, such as cooking and marrying.

- **Work History**: This person has dedicated a significant portion of their life to education, particularly in a demanding field like biotechnology. They have outperformed peers in their program despite not planning to pursue medical school. Currently, they are navigating the challenges of completing their PhD, which is further complicated by their mentor's illness and their own chronic health issues, rheumatoid arthritis, which they developed during their graduate studies.

- **Sibling Relationships**: The individual has two siblings who appear to be supportive and share similar feelings about familial expectations and dynamics. They note that their siblings regard them as a trustworthy and reliable figure, contrasting with the behaviors exhibited by their mother and grandmother.

- **Personal Struggles**: The passing of their long-time dog had a profound emotional impact, contributing to a sense of apathy and a downward spiral in their emotional state, prompting them to reevaluate their family relationships. Their desire for independence has led to increased resentment towards their mother and grandmother's treatment of them.

Overall, their background reveals a complex interplay of cultural expectations, familial relationships, and personal achievements, all contributing to their current crisis of identity and emotional well-being.","The person is dealing with a complicated and strained relationship with their mother and grandmother, facing issues of familial control, disrespect, and lack of affection, particularly in the context of their achievements and graduation from a PhD program.

1j32jzx,Philosophy PhD Pivot,"Hey, I'm a 31 year old Chicagoan who happens to be a rather prolific artist, in my time in undergrad I learned painting and other forms of art but during that period of time I continously found myself drawn to Philosophy over the years and despite my success from art (which I will not go into per the rules here) I kept a consistent practice of studying artistic theory that often engaged deeply with Philosophy.  At some point I even did my own independent studies of perception, philosophy of mind and ancient philosophers that have deeply impacted my artistic practice.

As such, I was thinking of applying to a PhD program in philosophy as I already have bachelor's and masters in Fine Art. The task seems daunting but as I live in the Hyde Park area I am constantly immersed in Chicago University's deep admiration for philosophy and wanted to make a pivot to either that school or a local college that addresses philosophy. 

I'm in my early stages of looking at programs but I was wondering what I should do to scale my writing for applying to these programs and  improve it for the academic rigor of philosophy for their written samples. 

Also, as someone that has been working/writing in another discipline entirely I was wondering what I should do to prepare for applying to graduate Philosophy programs as a whole and about what programs that have pretty decent funding.

I'm very new to applying to PhD programs and really non-art programs where the bulk of the application is weighted on my artistic portfolio but have done a couple of fellowships with museums but all art related so any and all advice is welcome. I was thinking maybe Post-bacc into a program to sharpen my writing skills for the programs I'm interested in. But I've never looked at Phd programs and their rigor in terms of writing and don't know what to expect.

Last-- I do plan to pivot into academic for philosophy and teach college courses while merging my artistic theory with philosophy. I have a ton of experience in education though not at the collegiate level (as a substitute teacher for 6 years while also working in education at museum depts so I am no stranger to teaching either).

1j2wpqd,"Anyone else seeing biomedical subreddits and forums full of random, unbacked transphobia dressed as “science?”","First off—
No, not everything is transphobia. Many members are genuinely seeking healthy debate in relation to the field of medicine. 

However, on almost *every* post about transgender folks, there’s at least 2-3 comments with blatantly misleading/false information with the self-labeling as “science.” 

(Transphobia is not the only issue that falls into this trap—it is just the one I’m pointing out). 

Here’s a comment on the recent post about the SRS mental health outcomes—I’ve changed some details of the comment to protect the member’s privacy. 

“Gender affirming care influences all kinds of stances that we will look back on and wonder why we took the positions that we did. It is OK to not validate someone suffering in what is clearly a mental health crisis (not necessarily all cases). In addition, just because you follow the idea that medicine shouldn't be a proxy for validating concepts that don't align with reality, doesn't mean you don't care for these individuals. They are often the result of a subconsciously broken coping mechanism with a side of neurodivergence.”

No sources. No evidence. Not even an anecdote. Just straight up “here’s why transgender people are actually just mentally ill but I dressed it up as an ethics topic to make it sound less bad.”  

Honestly I know this post may get downvoted, but I’m genuinely confused. Why is there so many members who honestly believe that transgender healthcare is a sham?

1j1vyyz,Choosing the Best MS/MEng in AI/ML (or CS with AI/ML Specialization) – Need Advice!,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning to pursue a Master’s in AI/ML (or a CS program with an AI/ML specialization) while working full-time. I need help deciding between the top-ranked programs in the field. Here are some of the schools I’m considering:

* **Georgia Tech (OMSCS – ML or Interactive Intelligence specialization)**
* **Stanford (MS in CS – AI track)**
* **MIT (MEng in AI/ML or MS in CS with AI focus)**
* **Carnegie Mellon (MS in AI/ML or MS in CS with AI focus)**
* **UC Berkeley (MEng in AI/ML or MS in CS with AI focus)**
* **University of Washington (MS in CS – AI/ML focus )**
* **Harvard (MS in CS – AI/ML track)**
* **Columbia (MS in CS – Machine Learning track)**
* **UPenn (MCIT or MS in CS – AI/ML track)**
* **Duke (MS in CS with AI focus or MEng in AI/ML)**
* **Cornell Tech (MS in CS – AI track)**

I have been considering Georgia Tech’s OMSCS for its affordability and flexibility, but I also want to explore Ivy League and other prestigious programs like Duke, UPenn, and Columbia.

My main questions are:

1. Which of these programs can be completed in one year while working full-time?
2. Which programs have the strongest reputation in AI/ML?
3. Are there any good scholarship or financial aid opportunities for working professionals? Should I take GRE? 
4. Any other suggestions for strong AI/ML master’s programs that are well-respected and flexible?
5. In general , is it really worth pursuing a masters degree in AI/ML online or it HAS to be in-person if I want to get something out of it.

I’d appreciate any insights from current students, alumni, or those who have researched these programs.

1j1tv3k,Prospective PhD Program being passive aggressive - suggestions?,"As title says. I was admitted to a top PhD program in my field (philosophy) in the US. People in the department seemed nice during the application stage but started to act indifferent and passive aggressive after my admission.

I have been awarded the “top admit student award” which no one in the department informed me. I later found it out myself through the graduate school. When I politely inquired about the award the DGS responded in a very rude, one-sentence email basically saying it’s nothing to be proud of. Furthermore, visiting day information is very unclear (I got several different versions from different people) and my emails regarding travel planning went ignored for a few times. No one personally reached out to me after my admission. My request to connect with a current student got declined. etc. etc.

This program wasn’t my top one choice and now I’m even wondering if I should attend campus visit. The research specialties fit with mine but I already feel like I won’t thrive in their culture at this point. How should I react to situations like this? Should I decline and pass the opportunity on to someone on the waitlist? Should I give it some benefit of doubt and attend campus visit regardless?

I originally applied to a PhD program in the engineering field but got accepted to a Master's program fully funded. My advisor is expecting me to start the PhD with her which is something I would love to do. However, after the new president, I started getting emails from the university saying that they don't know yet how funding is going to affect grad students that there are things in court, and that you should continue working on the projects until a stop order is received which making me a little bit worried about the funding for my Masters which I still have two semesters to complete.

Now, I feel it is not ethical to leave my advisor and work in the industry after she funded my Master's but at the same time, the funding situation is unclear and makes me feel anxious all the time. Also, I read that teaching positions at some universities are being held off until universities which is the goal after a PhD. When is the right time to discuss these matters with my advisor?
