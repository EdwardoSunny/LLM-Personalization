2025-02-27 20:01:33,1izoz1v,Caught a kid cheating. Should I report him?,"OK I am 33 and back to school for a 2nd dlBachelor's degree. I am in my first year in this new program so my classes are literally with kids. 18-19 years old. Generally they're alright, though I get annoyed with how little homework they do and having to constantly correct their work when we are doing group work in class so that I don't look like an idiot.

Anyways. This one student,  who I'll call Anthony, has annoyed the shit out of me. I want to be a teacher so I try to always be really willing to help the other students learn/understand a concept, I understand life experience has made this run through college a bit easier and I love to teach so it's all good. Then there is Anthony. Never does his homework, rarely paying attention, socially awkward as all hell (the he may be special needs, and I say that with love as someone who worked 2 years with low functioning autistic kids), and just cooonstantly ripping off other students' work.

Anytime we have group class work he runs over to join me because I am the only one who I think is kind to him or even tolerates him. It's annoying to me because I want experience with other classmates to get different perspectives as we work on problems (studying music btw). Anthony contributes NOTHING during class work. I try to model how I want to teach, so I will do some of the work as an example, and then ask him to work through some other ones. He literally can't do anything though. He just waits. I try to guide him to the answers, explain the theory, make him think. But it all goes over his head (of course it does he's never done his own honework). So I end up doing all the work and then he gets all excited when we get a good grade.

So, I noticed lately that before class he will always pull out his homework and try to rush through it. How does he do that? He peeps at the kid next to him. This happens every class. Kid next to Anthony is a real quiet type so he just doesn't even acknowledge it.

Today. I pulled out my phone, and recorded a full minute of Anthony leaning over, peaking at the other kid's homework, and then filling in his.

I am very tempted to report him for academic dishonesty. #1 because I want to be an educator and it pisses me off to imagine this kid passing this class not on his own merits. #2 he annoys me so much I could only hope he gets a failure and drops out of the class.

Should I go for it and report him?",Should I report a classmate for academic dishonesty after witnessing him cheating?,"The individual is 33 years old and currently pursuing a second bachelor's degree, indicating a commitment to education and personal advancement. They are in their first year of this new program, which places them in classes with much younger peers, specifically 18- to 19-year-olds.

In terms of family and work history, the individual has experience working for two years with low-functioning autistic children, suggesting a background in education or a related field that likely informed their desire to become a teacher.

2025-02-27 18:22:24,1izmkv0,"There will be more wealthy  and affluence students in the Community College, which makes it more prestigious due to the high rejections rate","It is no secret that rejections are getting more common despite having great STAT, EC, LOR, SAT/ACT scores, AP/IB/Duel enrollment, and personal statements. As a current undergraduate student at T100 public university in the US, I still remember that I got rejected from all the universities except one university I got accepted to, which was my safety at that time. During my senior of high school, I took dual enrollment in community college, so after several considerations, I decided to commit to community college. I only ended up staying in community college for about 1 year, before transferring to T100 University in the US.



**Not all community colleges create equal; Some community colleges attract affluence and wealthy students**

If you go to any subreddit, Reddit loves community colleges, without doing further research, you know that not all community colleges are created equally. Here is the thing: I applied for an internship at Blue Origin, and I was surprised that the ""target school"" or ""target university"" included a full list of the community colleges that Blue Origin are targeting. Let's say Candidate A went to De Anza College and transferred to UC Berkeley to continue Candidate A's education in Engineering, and Candidate A is surprised that De Anza College is part of the ""target school"" list alongside UC Berkley, candidate A is mostly likely to get accepted to Blue Origin engineering internship, as long candidate A has the right qualification and the right connections.

Certain community colleges attracted wealthy and affluent students due to the nature of the ""school feeder"" or ""community college-university pipeline"", meaning those community colleges have the largest transfer for certain universities. For example, if you go to De Anza College and have a good GPA, EC, and personal, you are more likely to get accepted to UC Berkeley than from a well-known prep school in the Bay Area. Compared to 20% general expected rates if you go directly from a well-known prep school in the Bay Area and the US. The transfer rate from a community college is a whopping 75%-85%, sometimes 90% accepted, depending on the semester/quarter and which major the student applied to.

",How can I improve my chances of getting accepted for internships when I come from a community college?,"The individual is a current undergraduate student at a T100 public university in the United States.

2025-02-26 18:50:55,1iyv0nl,"~28yo, returning to college, feeling left behind and out of place","Hey everyone,

I started college at the ripe young age of 19 years old. School was never too demanding before, so I assumed I was just smart, or ""gifted, although easily distracted"" as my teachers would sometimes say.

During my first two years. I got messed up in serious stuff that screwed my early 20s badly (I'm not sure if I can mention it, but it involved substance use). The anhedonia and general unhappiness -from being handheld in high school to *the first year subjects suck and I'm barely passing*, etc...- led me to **drop out** of university for around 2 years.

**When I came back, two years ago,** I got beaten down to the realisation that I cannot do it all on my own. That I am easily distracted, irritable, prone to procrastination. That I get good grades if I devote my attention to the subject at hand, but I easily lose focus. I went to a psychologist for a few months, then to different psychiatrists, and got diagnosed with ADHD(-C). >!*I am medicated, and it helps, and so does therapy, but this is not the sub to discuss this.*!<

I am majoring in economics, which to me is an interesting topic but I've been burnt out after near 7 years spent in school. I like some topics, but most, I've already done. And I'm missing 2 subjects to graduate altogether: X (2nd term, now), and Y, module 2 (3rd term); so the sunk cost fallacy. at this point, is sort of a reasonable *doubt.*

* The latter of which, subject Y, is daunting, scary, and difficult beyond belief for a series of reasons I won't delve into.

School is hard. On top of MH issues, my parents are getting older, I have no place of my own even though I have a S.O. and we meet regularly. I feel trapped, like my feet are not big enough to fill the shoes so to speak.

**Also, it's hard to pick up the books.** I have a final on the 12th of March, for a less difficult module and a retake exam on the 26th of April. but I'm so tired of everything. Deep down, I realise now that all I wanted to do in life was to make people's lives better, but I was pushed to do stuff that would make me money instead.

I **don't** **enjoy** macro, I enjoy reading fiction, listening to music, math (even though I'm really bad at it), movies, and exercising. I'm too far deep now, though, and the only way I'm quitting this degree is either graduating, or after the 3-strikes-then-out rule hits (i.e., fail the subject 3 times -> get kicked from the whole university).

If this is rambling, I apologise. I'm slowly realising what it means to be an adult. My back hurts like hell from looking at screens and books. *Hyperfocus* isn't something I can just summon out of thin air. My S.O. and family support me, but it seems like it's not enough for me to cope with the rest and bring some nuance to the matter.

**P.S. As some good news, my faculty granted me 50% extra time on grounds of my official diagnosis, and they gave me more benefits, but I don't know how to take this from here. I wanted to speak to my lecturer/postdoc researcher during office hours but I don't want to take time away from her.**","How can I better manage my studies and stay motivated to graduate, especially when I find school overwhelming?","The individual began college at the age of 19, having previously found school not demanding.

I finally had some time to do something other than work yesterday so I prepared this browned butter cookie dough with semi sweet and white chocolate chips.

I also used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar and the whole thing just smells incredible I can't describe it.

I am now also doing my senior thesis on hearing aid programs and I’m looking towards AuD/PhD programs. 

This has been a pretty stable interest for me since my senior year of high school, with the only change being from music cognition specifically to more of a focus on the auditory system as a whole and hearing aids. I’m interested in this area as a musician and I’m also involved in music production, where I find lots of overlap in areas.

However, I came across a topic I may have more internal drive to study. I have been avoiding bio literally forever, and decided to take it this semester since it was the last class I needed to get a BS instead of a BA. I’m actually doing really well in the class surprisingly. The issue came up when we learned about sex chromosomes, Barr bodies, and how women are more susceptible to autoimmune disorders than men. As someone with an autoimmune disease (and many other women in my family having different ones), I feel an attraction towards the topic. I only have one semester left though as I graduate next winter, and all of my work has been around hearing aids and music with only one bio class. Am I overthinking this based on only liking one bio class/topic so far, or should I really reconsider my plans?

I do like my research, but it has nothing to do with me personally and it’s just an area I find interesting.

To make a long-ish story short, I was a computer science major and this semester I decided to switch to a more creative path in front end web development, with a double major in psychology to potentially even get into UX research (we'll see how that pans out). The reason for this being that I realized I really, really hate backend programming. I know I'll have to do a bit in web dev, but the major is a lot more frontend and design focused. I'm just not cut out for computer science's backend-heavy curriculum.

Unfortunately, I'm stuck in a second semester C++ class. We just finished up C (which I'm not really great at in the first place, but did okay with), and now we're moving into C++. I attend lectures, study and everything, I just really heavily dislike studying this and I find it extremely difficult. I'm completely burned out and we're barely halfway done with spring semester.

I can't withdraw because I can't afford to pay back the financial aid, so I just have to push through it. But god it's extremely difficult. I'm not built for this kind of material.

I am a nontraditional student (32 years old) who has had a moderately unorthodox approach to higher education. Long story short, I didn't first go to college until age 25 when I completed 2 years, and then Covid hit so I withdrew from school because I do not learn well online.

I did moderately well in school (I had a 3.19 mostly because I had one D and one C in v tough classes that really pulled it down but otherwise everything was A's and B's.) This year I decided to go back to school to finish my degree and really wanted to move out of my home state and live somewhere new. Now I am at a theoretically ""top-rated"" state university, but honestly, to be blunt it feels veryyyyyy below what I need. The rigor is not there and my peers don't care about school at all. Currently, I am working on a group project with 5 people and no one else is putting in any effort so I'm hauling basically the entire project on my own. I feel like since I'm now a Junior it's a bit silly to transfer somewhere new and the state I'm living in doesn't have a ton of universities that are highly rated/or are not in the middle of nowhere. I feel really frustrated that I'm paying out-of-state tuition and I'm sitting next to people who are paying in-state tuition who leech off of my work and don't put in any effort. I feel like I should be at a much better university but don't really know what I should do to achieve that since I'm already a Junior at an allegedly good school...I also live with my partner who changed his life and plans to move with me and I feel this crushing weight of paying for school AND caring about how this move has affected my partner, and I just want a good education but I don't think I'll have the opportunity to get it where I am...idk what answers I’m really looking for but I just cannot believe people care this little and that a “good” school is this bad. 

I’ve thought about applying to the Yale Eli Whitney and Brown RUE programs for non trad students but I’m already a junior so it seems like I’m too far along in my education for those programs. But I feel like I need a much much better school","How can I find a better university to finish my degree as a junior, considering my frustration with my current school's lack of rigor and my concerns about my partner's situation?","The individual is a 32-year-old nontraditional student who first entered college at the age of 25.

2025-02-25 15:48:06,1ixy2vr,My program is losing accreditation what do I do?,"I am a junior studying music history with an emphasis on early music (baroque era). In the second week of this term NASM, the governing board for accreditation for schools of music, visited my university to discern whether we qualify to be re-accredited. After their reviews and student interviews we were told we no longer qualify for accreditation. 

At this point I am concerned that none of my credits will transfer to accredited universities and I would have to restart entirely the process of getting my degree. I understand that my general education credits would transfer and I have gained the knowledge to “test out” of the vast majority of my lecture based music courses, however, over half of my degree at any school would be experiential and therefor if they did not transfer I would have to redo them, which cannot be done consecutively which would in effect lock me into at least being a part time student for the next four years.

2025-02-24 20:29:17,1ixc33j,should I drop out? 6 weeks left in a 1 year course but I'm kinda miserable,"basically, I'm just over 6 weeks away from finishing a pre-college one year course. I like the content but because one of the main instructors was absent for the first 6 weeks of the course we are moving through projects and assignments really quickly. I was stressed about it but doing ok-ish until I got sick for 3 weeks in January and even with extensions it seems likely I'll just fail a couple of my modules because my work is handed in so late it wont be graded. 

Not going to get into my mental health much here because of the post rules - but it's been pretty bad since this course started. I think I may have depression or something at the moment but I'm slow to throw labels at things. I'm seeing a therapist but the sheer amount of work that I know I just dont have the time to catch up on, and the sense of like shame that I can't do this course as well as I thought is messing with me. I've always been good academically and at the start of the year I was one of the better students in many of the modules, but that is no longer the case and they all seem vaguelly like disappointed? when I tell them I'm planning on doing Arts next year instead of this course they all look at me like I've failed or something. I've been fairly stable mental health wise for the past 4 or 5 years so this is quite unusual for me

The way this course is structured (3 2/3 hour long classes with one half hour gap in the day, only about 13 people in the course and a small campus so no social stuff at all really) doesn't suit me at all. I have pretty significant Adhd and even on meds I've really struggled with the structure of this course. We get loads of work to do at home also and it's so hard for me to get anything done at my desk after coming home at the end of the day. The college library also has really limited hours so I can't even work there really.

 Its also all assignment based rather than exam based and its taken me longer than others to get used to that because of my Adhd. I also have to do 40 hours work experience between now and the course finishing, so I'm looking at a very heavy 6 weeks ahead with that also (8 hours a week work experience on top of 26 hours in college and then more hours working from home as well as that). It also seems like because of how burnt out I am that I won't be able to do the work experience projects as well as I'd like, and I'm worried that will damage my relationship/reputation with the person I'm doing work experience with, I really don't want her to see me as unreliable.

I did quite well in my exams in secondary school and will for sure get a spot in the Arts course in my local university for September based on those grades, so I dont need to do well in or even pass this course to get in. I'm fairly confident that the arts course will suit me more, it's more interesting to me content wise, there are more essays (which I really enjoy writing, my current course has almost none) and less contact hours with more gaps in the day, and a bigger campus so I can have more of a social life (a few of my friends study there also).

The pure amount of hours this course takes for me to do means I have way less/no time to do things I care about (make art, write, see my friends, have a part-time job, my youth theatre group). The course was also not that expensive fees-wise, so it's not been a massive financial investment 

So yeah idk if that made any sense. Basically do I pull though 6 weeks of unnecessary slog that is stressing me out to the point of loosing my will to live, but get to put a solidly useful qualification on my CV and have my parents not be disapointed in me. Or do I drop out, fuck around with a part time job and focus on my creative hobbies before going into college in September as a fresh start (and if I'm still not right then I'll go up on my adhd meds I'd say)","Should I push through the last 6 weeks of my current course, despite the stress it's causing me, or should I drop out and focus on my creative hobbies and mental health before starting college in September?","The individual is nearing the completion of a pre-college one-year course, which has been challenging due to various factors. They have been experiencing significant stress and mental health struggles, potentially linked to depression, particularly since the course began. They have a history of good academic performance, having done well in their secondary school exams.

Family dynamics seem to play a role in their current crisis, as they express concern about disappointing their parents. The individual has been stable mentally for the past 4 or 5 years, but the demands of the course and their ADHD have made it difficult to cope with the structure and workload, which they find overwhelming. Their ADHD affects their ability to manage assignments, particularly because the course is assignment-based rather than exam-based.

Previously enjoying a range of activities such as making art, writing, and participating in a youth theatre group, they now feel constrained by the heavy demands of the course, which limits their free time and ability to engage in these hobbies. The small class size and campus environment have not provided adequate social interaction, contributing to their feelings of isolation.

Despite the challenges, they are confident they will be able to secure a spot in an Arts course at their local university for the upcoming September, based on their previous grades. They believe this future course will better suit their interests and learning style, as it involves more essays and fewer hours in class, with the added benefit of a larger campus for social opportunities.

2025-02-27 20:57:39,1izqaag,Should I do an MFA in poetry in the US or stay in Spain and get a masters in publishing?,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit to ask this so I'll upload this on a few.

This is my situation. I am a Spanish published poet. Two of my books have been published in Spain and Brazil and I have been published in pretty big magazines here too. So I do think I have some talent. 

It may sound too soon, but I am finishing my first year of my degree in literature and I have to start thinking of what I will do after. I have two options in mind:

—Do an mfa in poetry in the US that lasts 2 or 3 years. I have always been fascinated by the US and have had friendships/relationships with people from there. The mfa is exactly about the the topics I am passionate about which is poetry and creative writing. But I have been told the main career prospect for it is being a teacher, which I don't like. 

—Do a masters in publishing here in Spain. The one in Barcelona (where I live currently) is one year long and with good job offers after in good editorials. Pretty stable jobs. No need to get a toefl or change my life much. Even though the topic is not interesting to me, it would get me a stable job I would be happy with.

I don't know. On one hand, I still want to explore more of my writing and see what the US has to offer. On the other I don't know whether to stay here. I have never been to the US yet but I am planning on making a trip and maybe that might help me decide...

If any of you has done an mfa in the US or knows Spain, you might be able to tell me what's best between the two options. Any feedback will be appreciated nevertheless.

I have had some turbulent years before this degree I am doing right now and I think my mistake was choosing what I thought was more ""practical"". I dropped out of many things before because I just didn't like it even if they offered good career prospects. So now that I finally feel like I am on the right path, I don't know whether to play my cards and choose something I might enjoy studying more but have no idea where it might bring me, or choose the easy way out that will help me make a living decently happy instead of doing something I dislike like bartending or teaching (nothing wrong with those jobs, I just personally don't wanna end up doing those).","Should I pursue an MFA in poetry in the US, which focuses on my passions but may limit my career options, or should I do a master's in publishing in Spain for more stable job prospects, despite it not being as interesting to me?","The individual in the Reddit post is a Spanish published poet with two books published in Spain and Brazil, as well as contributions to significant magazines in their home country.

2025-02-27 19:31:00,1izo98m,Seeking Tips for Getting a GSI Position as a Master's Student with a poor GPA.,"I am a Master's student at a large university trying to get a GSI position. The problem is that my GPA in my program so far has not been what it was during my undergrad and I feel that I may not be seen as a good candidate for a GSI. 

The straightforward reason why I have been performing poorly in classes is due to financial stress. I am working part time at another on campus position but barely make enough to make the leftover tuition after loans and am covering rent + groceries with money I saved up from internships during my undergrad.

Between meal prepping, working, and having to spend 2 hours walking/bus-ing between classes, work, and my apartment I only have so much time to spend on studying and homework and it has led to poor performance in most of my courses I have or am taking thus far. I am not failing but I have a lot of Bs and B+s where a the class average seems to be higher. 

If I were able to get a GSI position, at my university, tuition would be covered and the pay is enough to pay for my rent and allow me to have more wiggle room in my grocery budget and would be a huge alleviation of stress in general and probably enable me to do better in my courses. The problem with this being my GPA is already not doing well due to financial stress so I am not sure I could get a GSI position.

Does anyone have any tips or tricks on finding and getting a GSI position? My department is small so not many courses have GSI positions and those that do are often taken by PHD students. I tried applying to departments outside of mine last fall for the current semester but had no luck. ",What tips can you provide for finding and obtaining a GSI position in a competitive academic environment?,"The individual is a Master's student at a large university and is attempting to secure a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) position.

They also have limited time for studying due to their obligations, which contributes to their poorer academic performance, reflected in a series of Bs and B+s in their classes. The student believes that securing a GSI position would alleviate financial stress by covering tuition and providing a salary sufficient for rent and basic expenses, potentially improving their academic performance as well. However, they are concerned that their current GPA may hinder their chances of obtaining a GSI position, especially since such positions are often filled by PhD students in their small department.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1izo98m/seeking_tips_for_getting_a_gsi_position_as_a/,gradschool

I have a bachelors in CS and I want to get a master's in data science. I can get it for free at NU as an employee and it would take about 15 months.

The advisor for NU reached out today and said she made a mistake and the program is available for residents in my state. If both cost the same, there's no way I would take NU over Pitt, but would it be absolutely stupid for me to go the Pitt route now? Pitt seems like a much higher quality program. Is a MSDS from National University taken seriously in the real world? I feel like most people have never heard of them. I hadn't before I got the job here...

I just don't know if I'm romanticizing getting a master's from a school people have actually heard of or if the cost difference would really be worth it.

Ive been offered admission for MS in each of the above universities. The programs are:

Tufts University - MS in Sustainability 
UMass Amherst - MS in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science 
Penn State University - MS in Business Analytics


I know that they are all very different programs and might not be comparable. I did a non-STEM bachelors. However, they are STEM-designated and did not require GRE. 

Surprisingly, I find the prospect of studying all three very exciting. 

For Tufts, it’s liberal arts education in Boston. I get to study urban planning and choose any extensive quantitative related courses as electives. 

For UMass, the prospect of studying data analytics and computational social science is very exciting. 

For Penn state, again - the prospect of studying analytics is exciting even from a business perspective.

They got me interviews, just nobody agreed to work with me.

I got hours elsewhere, but I was late to an appointment, and they said ""You failed clinicals and need to retake them in the fall.""

It has been a struggle since I was accepted to get information from these people.

I ask questions and receive long e-mails that don't say anything--if I receive a reply at all.

Presumably, I need to pay a portion of the quarterly tuition in order to work for free, but I have never seen my small private school break down the cost per credit, just $42,216 per year for SLP.

Please feel welcome to say some equivalent of ""Forget that!""

Everybody knows one quarter would be $10,554.

I wouldn't be surprised if they say ""You need to retake one quarter, that will be $10,554,"" but I sure hope it will be a fraction of that--or they will give me another opportunity, like ""Here is a 60-hour project. Complete it over the summer and you can graduate,"" but they aren't flexible.

Classes end the end of May, I believe that summer is 6 weeks, and officially we need 60 clinical hours per quarter, but they have been obsessing over having us on-site 25+ hours a week, regardless of how many clinical hours we get.

I have had classmates on-site for 25+ hours, but not obtain 60 hours.

I just hear that it is the SLP's prerogative to make grad students sit idly for 8 hours in a row.

So, I probably won't be able to accomplish anything towards graduation over the summer, will pay thousands to work for free for an additional 250 hours despite already having my clinical hours, and then I will finally be able to start my CF?

2025-02-27 03:25:23,1iz6dnf,Forgoing PhD teaching experience to do admin work with a well-known professor?,"Hi there. I'm an international student studying for a humanities PhD in the US. I taught for 2 years during my MA, and have also done the occasional guest lecture to schools and at various universities, which I'm quite proud of for where I am in my career.

For our third and fourth years, we have to teach in order to receive our stipends. Here's where things get confusing. As international students, we can 1) teach 2 or 3 times per week, or 2) do a combination of admin and teaching. 

I'm not yet teaching, and recently, I started working for a very well-known (and kind) Economics professor (h-index almost 100), doing admin for one of his popular courses. I should state that I am in a history-related field, and not Economics. This work has nothing to do with my teaching requirement, as I don't have to teach until the Fall. However, the professor likes me so much that he wants to make an exception and hire me as a full-time administrator (well, 20 hours per week) in lieu of my teaching next year, which is permitted. Because of Visa restrictions, I couldn't also teach on top of this, and his department are saying they will hire me for 20 hours per week or nothing, as that's what they require. The professor teaches a number of courses and there's about 600 students total over 2 semesters, hence the need for more administration. His department and my department are both fine with this, and I'd have the title of 'Head' or 'Lead' Teaching Assistant. I'd co-ordinate the staff, guest speakers, lectures, syllabi etc for his courses, and, as my PhD exams are coming up next year, I'd be fine with this, and am quite excited.

At present, I am not interested in a career in academia, but I think there's maybe a 10 or 20% chance I will pursue it. As such, will forgoing actual teaching to be a 'Head TA' for 2 or 3 semesters be a bad thing? I can teach in later years of my PhD, but I'm worried that not getting the experience now will come back to bite me. On the other hand, this will leave me more time to finish my thesis on schedule (as many people in my program struggle to do this due to heavy teaching loads), plus, I'm regularly being introduced to fantastic people in business and finance and the professor is keen to support me to explore a career in business if I so choose (which is one of my potential options).

Any thoughts would be welcome! Thank you for your time!",Will forgoing actual teaching to be a 'Head TA' for 2 or 3 semesters be a bad thing for my career?,"The individual is an international student pursuing a humanities PhD in the United States.

2025-02-26 21:57:50,1iyzigf,Strict grader and begging for mercy from prof,"Hello.

I've had a rough semester, long story short due to a technical issue i failed a class last semester, so in addition to the three classes i had to take, i have to retake the class plus a stupid busywork class. Ive been dealing with burnout due to the added stress and alll that. One class i struggled in was a spiritual class, that's required for my Christian university. I've been putting that on the bottom of my pyramid so to speak, and ive had an 85 in the class until a few days ago when an assignment that i had to put off did badly and it bumped me down to an 82, which is a C+ in my program. SO im desperately trying to do well on the last three assignments, but one of them, a discussion, did a bit too lowly, an 80 due to two factors. A. it was supposed to be 300 words, and when i submitted it it said 350, but she kncoked me down. Upon further review, i realized i had mistakenly read the word coutn with sources included, which bumped it down to 286, 13 words short. the second i think was a lack of words on a discussion reply, but i had accidentally submitted it half done (butterfingers) so i jsut added the other half in the comments with an explanation. overall i got bumped down to 56/70

So here is the email i sent begging my case

Hello Dr. \[redacted\]

So, I looked over the grade on the recent discussion and saw i was knocked down a few points due to not meeting the wordcount. I was a bit confused at first but i plugged the first one into my word doc, and what i think happened when i checked the word count was command all, and it counted the sources as well.

Without it it was 286 words but with it said 350 words. So that was certainly a mistake on my part.

Also, for the second comments, I'm not sure if it was seen but i had accidentally submitted it half complete, so i put it in the comments the finished section, and it came out to 200 words.

 I am really close to a B-, I wanted to do better this semester but due to an issue with a course last semester I had to take five classes, with one 8 week and one sixteen weeks in addition to my original 3 ( this and two 16 weeks).  This caused a bit of burnout, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and am putting all my energy into these last two weeks.

I say this to basically ask, would you mind giving me grace on this assignment and bump it up a few points? I plan to do well on the paper, as i started on Saturday, am almost done at the moment, and am planning on consulting the writing center when i finish, as I hope to get a better grade in this class.

Thank you regardless \[my name\]

IDK what I'm posting about, i think i just needed to burn off some anxiety by writing about it. any advice is appreciated. thanks

2025-02-26 19:52:41,1iywiu1,Considering history PhD from a non history background,"Hello all, I come from an IT background: I have a bachelor's in information management, in one more semester will have a master's in information technology, and have 6 years of work experience in the field. The problem is I have been feeling disillusioned with the tech industry for a while now. I chose this field mostly for financial security, not out of pure enthusiasm for tech.

History has always been a passion of mine and I have spent many countless hours diving in to books and researching various historical topics. I was discussing it with my wife recently and we came up with the idea that I should study something that I have a strong passion for, not just something that might move me up a another bump on the career ladder but ultimately leave me unfulfilled

I would like to pursue a History PhD mostly for intellectual reasons. I understand that a history PhD won't do too much for me financially or career wise. I love the idea of becoming a history professor but it seems from what I've read its basically impossible unless you graduate from an ivy league school and have the right connections. So I'd be ok just pursuing the PhD to become an expert in a field that I've always loved. But of course it would be best if I could put the degree to work, since it would be a massive time and effort investment. 

My main question is, is it entirely unrealistic of an idea to switch disciplines this late in the game? Is there any chance I can even get accepted into a History PhD program? Or will they just look at my background and throw out my application immediately since my academic career and resume are entirely IT focused. Also if anyone could chime in with other job opportunities that open up with a history PhD that'd be appreciated too.

Thanks in advance.","Is it entirely unrealistic to switch disciplines to pursue a History PhD at this stage in my career, and will my IT-focused background negatively impact my chances of acceptance into a program?","The individual has a bachelor's degree in information management and is one semester away from completing a master's degree in information technology.

However, I am still waiting on the other three. I checked around on the FAQs of the schools (including the one I was accepted early at), and they all say they will get back to applicants in mid-late March. Does this mean that all the other schools have probably already sent out their first-round of acceptance letters, and may have put my application in a backup file in case some of their first-round picks do not accept the invitations?

So, I am pursuing a master's in Electrical Engineering. Before I speak out my thoughts, I should mention that I LOVE what I study. It is SUPER fun.

Now for what I think. Studying is fun. But having absolutely zero personal time? Not so much. It's my second semester, and I am exhausted. The first semester was insanely packed, to the point where I went to the library every single day. Not a day of rest. I ended up with a 4 GPA, but for what? I didn't get a TA/Grader position. I have a good rep with the professor, but I didn't have time to connect regarding these positions. Additionally, as stupid as it may sound, I completely neglected the urgency of applying for such academic positions because I was buried in coursework.

Now, I have a very bad habit of going beyond the coursework to the point where it's pointless to do so. I have absolutely no idea what to do about that. It doesn't seem to serve any purpose, seeing as I do not have a job either :). I didn't apply for anything other than academic positions because I thought getting a TA/RA/Grader would be way better. And that, too, was done late, which is so dumb on my part that it's almost laughable.

Now, I just got off a meeting with a professor who potentially will be my advisor for my thesis. This was the second task given to me. Contrary to Task 1, as usual, I didn't get much time to work on Task 2 due to extra heavy coursework. The professor who initially proposed setting up bi-weekly meetings mentioned that he probably won't do so and asked me to contact him when I am done. He also mentioned that I could contact him after two weeks. (not sure what he meant by this)

I am exhausted and frustrated. The problem is that I am aware that I can do stuff, including these tasks, but I do not have TIME. I have so much coursework, and I try to solve assignments, which themselves are a nightmare, by myself. Meanwhile, so many people have academic positions. In essence, I think they are pretty smart in prioritizing important work over coursework, which I cannot do. That is obvious since I missed out on a very good chance of becoming a TA or grader in a course where the professor has a very high opinion of me due to me delaying it. Procrastination is a \*\*\*. Applying for internships is a completely different nightmare in itself.

  
How do you guys deal with stuff like this?

2025-02-25 20:21:56,1iy4rq5,A Revolutionary Educational Model in Venezuela: Seeking Feedback and Insights on AI in Assessment,"Hello Reddit community,

We're developing a unique educational model in Venezuela, and I'm reaching out for your insights. I'm the president of a foundation providing accessible education to those who may have missed traditional university or want to formalize existing expertise.

Our approach centers on open studies and accrediting experiential knowledge. Our curriculum includes:

* Induction
* Portfolio Creation
* Master Classes with professionals

We empower students to connect classroom concepts with real-world experiences, developing personalized research paths based on their lives and extracurricular learning. Our target audience: professionals with 5+ years in public administration seeking to validate their expertise.

We offer degrees in:

* Bachelor's in Alternative Pedagogy
* Master's in Critical Pedagogy
* Doctorate in Intellectual Creation Management

We believe in valuing *all* knowledge, regardless of origin, and are redefining education/pedagogy.

**Crucially, our entire curriculum and syllabus are built using AI, specifically Google's Gemini and NotebookLM.** This is where we're looking for your expertise.

Our classes use questionnaires linking course concepts, cognitive skills, and student knowledge, culminating in a final question: ""How do these concepts connect to your research?""

We're using AI extensively, but we're facing some key challenges and want to learn from others' experiences. Specifically, we're hoping to get input on:

* **Curriculum Development with AI:** How can we best leverage Gemini/NotebookLM for content creation, ensuring quality and alignment with pedagogical goals? What are your best practices for prompting and refining AI-generated educational materials?
* **AI-Powered Assessment:** We're exploring AI for personalized evaluations. How can we ensure fairness, transparency, and mitigate bias in AI-driven assessments? What tools or techniques have you found effective?
* **Preventing AI-Facilitated Plagiarism:** Since our curriculum relies heavily on AI assistance, how can we ensure students are genuinely learning and not simply relying on AI to generate their work? What strategies can be implemented to detect AI generated content and what are the best practices to deal with it?
* **Workflow Optimization:** What are some best practices for integrating AI into our educational workflow, from curriculum design to student feedback? How can we streamline processes and maximize efficiency while retaining a human touch?
* **Similar Projects:** Have you encountered any projects with similar principles, especially those using AI for curriculum development and assessment? We'd love to connect and learn from your experiences.

We're particularly interested in hearing from those with experience using AI in education, especially for curriculum design, assessment, and plagiarism prevention. Any insights, resources, or connections you can offer would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you for your time and expertise.

2025-02-25 20:03:07,1iy4bem,Italian moving to the U.S. for a master’s – help me choose which school,"I'm an Italian student coming to the U.S. for my master’s in Fall 2025 and need advice on choosing between two universities:

* **Stevens Institute of Technology** – MS in Information Systems (36 credits) with a $14,000 scholarship
* **Fordham University (Gabelli Business School)** – MS in Information Technology (30 credits) with a $25,000 scholarship
* **Columbia MSBA:** Still waiting on a response, but likely not considering it due to lack of aid and debt concerns.

# A few key details:

* Debt: I won’t take on major debt due to family support, but realistically expecting around $35K in expenses, which I don’t mind.
* Commute: Not an issue, I’ll be living near Hoboken with my girlfriend (splitting rent)
* Work: At Fordham, I’d like to work as a TA or get a part-time job during the school year.
* Cost difference: Fordham would save me about $18K, plus I like the idea of studying in NYC.

I want to live and work in the U.S., ideally on the East Coast, so I want to pick the best option for career growth. Would like to work in technology consulting, data analyst, or possibly even something in finance.

# Questions:

1. **Recognition & Reputation** – How do Stevens and Fordham compare in the tech job market?
2. **Networking & Opportunities** – Is studying in NYC (Fordham) a better environment for networking and job prospects?
3. **Job Placement & Outcomes** – Which school has stronger employer connections for tech-related fields?

I know job hunting depends on me, but I want to make the most strategic choice. Any insights from current students, alumni, or professionals would be really helpful!

2025-02-25 15:00:58,1ixwzc7,On The *Duty* of Civil Disobedience.,"Hi all. This post is for everyone to weigh in on, but aimed toward those in the US. 

Obviously, there are a lot of times and places in the present moment that call for civil disobedience-- inside and outside of academia.

Obviously, everyone in this sub is busy with their research, studies, and day-to-day tasks, and the prospect of putting effort into organizing, unionizing, and coordinating civil disobedience is likely appealing, but ultimately exhausting to consider undertaking on one's own. I admit with some shame that this is the case for myself.

To those that have already been directly impacted, lost their jobs, lost their funding: I am incredibly sorry for the injustice you are facing, and my anger on your behalf grows daily. To those, including myself, who are able to proceed with our work, I think it is time to admit to ourselves and one another: our livelihoods, the lives of those we care about and work with, and in some cases the existence of departments and institutions are at stake. If you're not feeling vulnerable to poverty, joblessness, homelessness, and other forms of precarity now, you will be soon.

So, as a very isolated grad student at a tiny college, perhaps I am not seeing the ""behind the scenes"" organizing occurring at present. Please let me know where/how I and others can join if so. But so far, to a large extent, I am seeing paralysis and begrudging compliance: programs quietly closing, indefinite hiatuses. At what point do we \*not\* comply? And how must we organize to protect one another in this?

This transcends departmental, institutional, and state lines. I would like to join an accordingly broad union if possible, but also to open a discussion to further concrete actions. Unfortunately, many of us conduct research with a significance that cannot be immediately appreciated, so I am unsure how traditional strikes would play out. What are some avenues of action? How can we act to protect science and academia for ourselves and future generations NOW?

Here are some broad links to spark discussion. Feel free to add your own.

I’ve been in my masters for what will be 2 years in May (2 years or under is the norm for our plant science dept). My advisor is also the head of the dept and she’s known for being disorganized and having a lab that’s way too big. I come from a BA with not a lot of research experience and her and my post doc say they talked me into this when I was an undergrad in the lab because they needed to use grant money. 

Anyway I figured I would be ADVISED by my advisor or at least my post doc but the whole first year I never met with them because they said they were busy and when I would ask questions they said ‘grad schools about figuring it out for yourself’. They had me design my own experiment too and when things kept going wrong my advisor was still completely hands off. 

Now it’s the last actual semester, I have a 2 part experiment, one that is going good and one that’s not going so good. When ever I ask her (my advisor) for a real plan that will get me to graduate she brushes it off and is like ‘it’s fine you’ll get there but you need a paper’ how am I supposed to have a paper with no data !? 

Anyway I met with her yesterday and she wants to scrap both of the experiments and have me redesign a whole NEW one. I scheduled an emergency meeting this afternoon to plan but every meeting is just me asking for help and ideas and her saying ‘yea go for it’ without any real input. I asked my post doc to come to the meeting to help but he basically said this is all my fault for not forcing them to help me more my first year, and he’s not coming. 

I’m at a loss, I wanna quit. I honestly don’t know how I’m gonna graduate on time or anywhere close and at this point I’m so angry my advisor and post doc will brag about saying ‘we got you here all your successes are our doing’ then turn around and tag team me.

I’ve been applying for management consulting and economic consulting roles and went through a few interviews with major firms, but unfortunately, I didn’t land an offer. Right now, I’m feeling pretty stressed and uncertain about my next steps.

About two weeks ago, I decided to start applying to graduate schools, but I know I’m late in the cycle. I’m wondering if I might have a better chance if I apply this fall instead. I'm also too late to be considered for scholarship - the tuition is definitely a burden. Has anyone else been in a similar situation, or do any of you work on the admissions side? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

I’m also curious about how much my gap year activities might matter for admissions. I likely won’t find an amazing job in the meantime—since if I did, I might not need to go to grad school. As an international student, if I can’t find a job in the US, I’ll probably head back to my home country, where the job market is super competitive as well.

Although I have some passion for the field (less than I initially though but still), I don't really like the university/campus and I do not feel like my program is engaging. It very much feels like a money grab for the university, the classes are really surface level, the professors are much lower caliber than my undergrad (partially due to department romances...), and there are very limited opportunities to explore hands on preservation. There was a lot of misinformation in the recruitment process-- I was promised lots of programs and workshops that simply do not exist and I was misled about funding (I think this may just be a shady part of every program's recruitment though). For these reasons, I'm miserable. I have no motivation for class, I go home to my parents as much as possible, and I'm just overall upset all the time. I have tried really hard to cope with it and do everything I possibly can to make the best of it, but I'm at my breaking point. It is a two year program, so I only have 1 year left but I am thinking of leaving. I hate the idea of giving up and not receiving the masters degree; I am also really scared for how I can pivot and find a career. I was able to work for the university to have my program paid for, so no financial loss, just time and emotional labor if I leave. Has anyone else gone through this?

2025-02-24 19:34:48,1ixaq6u,English PhD vs. MLIS,"I’m currently in an English MA program, and I’m considering either going into an English PhD or an MLIS program. I’m not sure which I want to go into, so any advice or thoughts is helpful!

The pros/cons of my particular situation or from my perspective:

PhD Pros
- opportunity to teach
- get to learn really cool, interesting stuff and engage with topics at a very high level of thought
- flexible and ever changing schedule (I hate monotony)
- higher salary ceiling? (Maybe?)
- most programs pay you to go to school (even if it’s not a lot)

PhD Cons
- sometimes I get bored with topics and the depth required by a PhD intimidates me
- I would have to move to get my PhD since there aren’t any in my area
- A job where I want to live isn’t guaranteed (and is somewhat slim)

PhD Info
- I’m open to jobs outside of just tenure track, but I obviously can’t survive on an adjunct salary. Full-time lecturer job tho would be cool.

MLIS Pros
- I can go to school online, so no need to move
- I’ve always heard that librarians have really dynamic jobs (never boring)
- there seem to be a decent number of librarian openings in my area at any given time

MLIS Cons
- Some librarian jobs pay pretty low, especially public librarian jobs.
- I still feel like I don’t know a lot about it.
- the online program would cost $20k-ish

MLIS Info
- I don’t have any prior experience working in a library, and I don’t really have the capacity to get any until I’m done with my MAE program.
- I’m open to different types of librarianship. I think academic is the top of my list but I also think school or archival could be cool.

I know neither of these options pays the big bucks, but I really just want:
1. To make like $50k-ish with moderate benefits and potential for growth over time
2. To live somewhere cool that I like and isn’t too far from family
3. To not hate my life and my job
4. To feel like my job has meaning
5. To not be bored all the time

2025-02-24 07:59:56,1iwwxm7,Make Sure You Are Going to School for the Right Reasons,"I just want to start off by saying, I am very grateful that I have had the opportunity to work at a master’s degree and am proud to be graduating in the spring with it. I also recognize that I am very lucky in the fact that I was able to get it majorly funded through becoming a TA and recognize that I am very lucky to have gotten the ability to not only go to grad school but go for what will be a little under $3000 for the entirety of my master’s program, especially when looking at how things are going with the current administration and so much being up in the air when it comes to funding and such here in the United States.

With all that being said, I just want to caution you if you are thinking about attending and why you want to attend. I will fully admit, I do not think I did start my MA for the correct reasons. I will fully admit, I started because I felt it could allow for me to get paid more adequately in the job market, and I was at a job that I was not particularly passionate about. And now I feel like I am the same place as I was two years ago. I often regret my choice to go to school, but I am in no way not going to complete it, I am here for essentially three more months, it would be stupid not to. I joke about how I will never actually use my master’s (which I know rationally isn’t true). I am working on not being upset with my past self and moving forward, and ultimately, while I may not think I have gone for the correct reasons, I am proud of the fact that I currently have a 4.0 GPA in a program and field that I personally hate, again, not the program or field’s fault, just not something I particularly care about in the slightest. Maybe it’s burnout, maybe it’s just self frustration because I am going in a different direction in my life. I am unsure.

What I will say, really do yourself a favor and look into why you want to go to grad school. Do you feel like you are unsure where you are going in life? Maybe avoid going until you are confident in what you are thinking about in that regard. It is a commitment, and I really only recommend going if this is something you absolutely love and are passionate about. Grad school can be an extremely rewarding experience and one that can really advance you in life- but only if it is something you really want to pursue. And also look into if you really want to engage in academia. It is definitely different than undergrad, there is tons of research involved, much more reading, and can be extremely time consuming. 

This isn’t meant to ward anyone away from joining a grad program! I have met some wonderful friends in my program who absolutely love everything we do within the program. Even though I have some regrets, I have ultimately leaned more on the side that I am glad I went. I just wanted to give my experience and thoughts, and sort of maybe lay everything out there. Good luck to everyone!

I was thinking of emailing one of the program I got into for extra funding, leveraging the fact that I also got into another good program (but slightly weaker in my field) - how does my email look? Is there anything I should add/substract?

Thank you all!

Dear \[blank\] Admissions Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is \[blank\], and I am honored to have received an offer of admission to \[blank\] program. I am excited about the upcoming school visit in a few weeks! However, I am writing to express some financial concerns regarding the funding package offered, and I would like to explore the possibility of adjusting it to make this opportunity financially feasible.

\[blank\] has long been one of my top choices for PhD studies, with exceptional facilities and resources for \[blank field\] . The program’s diverse faculty also exposes me to a wide range of research focuses and techniques and put me at the forefront of this rapidly expanding field!

While I am deeply excited about the prospect of joining \[blank\], I am concerned about the feasibility of the current financial offer, particularly given the high cost of living in the surrounding area. Over the past few months, I have been researching the housing market and other living expenses in \[blank\] area. The costs in and around \[blank\] are quite high, especially when compared to \[blank\]. Additionally, \[blank\]’s suburban location presents transportation challenges for students without a car. I would need to obtain a driver’s license and purchase a car, which is both financially and logistically burdensome. Given these additional costs, including car insurance, living expenses, and relocation, I am unsure whether I can sustain myself on the current stipend.

In comparison, despite being located in a smaller city with cheaper living costs, \[blank 2\] has offered me a stipend of $37,000 (\[blank\] for the academic year plus \[blank\] for the summer) and full coverage of health insurance, which is significantly higher than \[blank\]'s offer of $32,000 or the full twelve-month period. This difference, combined with the higher living and transportation costs in \[blank\], has made the financial decision even more challenging.

I am reaching out to inquire if there is any possibility of increasing my stipend or offering additional fellowship support to help alleviate the financial challenges of attending \[blank\]. Even a modest adjustment would greatly ease my ability to attend and fully dedicate myself to my research.

I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration of my request. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this further at your convenience. I remain incredibly excited about the possibility of joining \[blank\] and contributing to the program.

Best regards,",How can I write a request for additional funding for my graduate program while comparing it to another offer?,"The individual is preparing to enter a PhD program and is facing financial concerns regarding the funding package provided by the program they have been accepted into.
