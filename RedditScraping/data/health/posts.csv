I have been better and worse, on and off medications (mostly on), with doctors' guides of course. I have recently been feeling down again, talked to my doctor and we increased my medicine. 

I love my medication, they help me without a doubt. But when I'm through a depressive state it takes a couple weeks for the adjustment to take effect. I generally just try to hang in, but waiting is hard. 

I'm looking for advices that will help me cope better until they kick in. What do you guys do when you can basically do nothing? What do you watch, listen, eat and so on?

Also, I'm scared to rely heavily on medicine, so I want to go lower on the dose some day. Find a way to treat this thing as good as I can. I am okay with being on medicine for the rest of my life but I at least want lower doses. Any advice from you guys that helped to get a hang of this?

2025-02-27 22:14:00,1izs2ed,TW: Childhood abuse and neglect by caregivers (advice),"I really want to make this clear and preface that this could be very triggering for people so read with caution.  **TW - emotional, physical, potential sexual abuse, trauma.** 

I guess the anonymity of Reddit is looking like the only way in which I can actually talk about what happened and seek advice because I've had bad experiences opening up to people such as friends and therapists and do not have anyone in my life to learn on at the moment. I know I am not in a good place right now but I am really trying to work through these feelings and am looking for a way to cope. 

The abuse started out fairly innocuously but as my parents mental health declined they increasingly took it out on me. I was a mistaken one night stand and only had my mom present in my life for the first few years of childhood. She got into a relationship with my now step dad and although they were in a bad place at the time it only got worse. They would bring me to these huge parties where there were only adults and I often had to sleep in a dark room in an unfamiliar place by myself while my caregivers were so drunk they could not even talk coherently let alone console me or pay attention to me. My step dad is not from my home country so we would often go to where he is from on holidays and even lived there briefly when i was a little bit older. I could not speak his language and was never taught or attempted to be taught so I had nobody to talk to besides myself. Any semblance of sadness or anger was met with physical punishment on numerous occasions and rants about how ungrateful I was and that I should appreciate that I have parents at all. This was a common theme until I became a teenager when I began self destructing majorly.. At the time I felt so angry and stricken with sadness and had no way to express it healthily. I felt so isolated from everyone and struggled (and still do) with being intimate with people. I was fraught with loneliness and felt so guilty for not discussing these things openly but I guess I am trying now. 

The worst time in my life was living in that country as a child. There are two events that I will probably never forget. The first is when I was showering one morning and my mother knocked on the door asking to use the bathroom. I told her that I was showering and that I was nearly done and to just wait but she got increasingly angrier and angrier about not being able to come in so she got my step dad. He then came along and proceeded to kick the door down, drag me naked into the hallway in front of the entire family and forcefully throw me into their bedroom all while hitting me. The second has never sat right with me and I cannot remember all the details but one night after drinking my step dad was in a foul mood. He said ""you can't even wipe your ass properly"" and then ran his hand between my legs. This is the worst one I can remember but my recollection of everything is so fuzzy that I can't say for certain if anything sexual happened. I remember waking up one morning with discomfort but other than that I have no evidence of anything happening. I am so confused about my past and have so much self doubt that its hard to move past it. Some days are easier than others but I recognized that today was a particularly hard day. 

if you have gone through something similar I would really appreciate advice on what you did to help yourself cope. 

","If you have gone through something similar, what did you do to help yourself cope?","The individual describes a challenging background marked by trauma and abuse. They were born as a result of a one-night stand and were primarily raised by their mother during the early years of childhood. Their home life became increasingly dysfunctional as their mother's mental health declined, and they got into a relationship with the individual's stepfather.

During their childhood, the individual was exposed to a chaotic environment, often being taken to adult parties where they felt neglected and unsafe. The stepfather, who was not from their home country, created additional challenges, as the individual struggled with language barriers and cultural differences. Physical punishment and emotional neglect were common in their upbringing, leading to feelings of ungratefulness for their situation. 

As the individual grew into adolescence, they began to exhibit self-destructive behaviors, stemming from their feelings of anger, sadness, and isolation. They recount significant traumatic events that occurred while living in the stepfather's country, including instances of physical violence and potential sexual abuse.

I also started going to therapy, and my therapist told me I’m most likely depressed. By my second session, he was already suggesting medication. I don’t necessarily agree with meds, but at this point, I’ll try anything to get out of this funk.

I’m a realtor, and business has been really slow. Honestly, I don’t even love my job and have been looking for ways out. Lately, I’ve been having this overwhelming urge to quit my job, sell everything I own, and just leave—start fresh somewhere new. I don’t know if that’s me running from my problems or if it’s what I actually need.

Most days, I just lay in bed, doing absolutely nothing. I have zero motivation, no energy, and when I try to push myself to get up and move, I just feel like crying. My bills are covered for the next couple of months, but my debt is stacking up, and that stress is weighing on me.

I’ve even thought about going to rehab, even though I don’t know if that would help. I had a physical last week, and medically, I’m totally healthy. But mentally, I feel completely drained. I know working out would probably help, but I can’t bring myself to do it. I’ve been isolating myself more, canceling plans, and becoming a recluse. I can’t even focus on watching a movie or playing video games—nothing holds my attention except self-help videos about people who have pulled themselves out of this hole.

2025-02-27 21:59:48,1izrqen,Moving Back Into My Parents House is Destroying Me. Venting Session.,"I had to move back in with my parents because my physical health has taken a toll, causing me to work less, which made me unable to afford my place on my own. I haven't lived with them for the past 6 years. My dad does the snowbird thing, while my mom just stays at home all day. Since my dad has been back, I am on constant alert. Always stressed, walking on eggshells, and staying in my room. My parents hate each other. Some days they are fine, but most of the time, they are ignoring each other or making snide comments to one another. I was already slightly stressed just with my mom, but around both, it's like I'm numb.

2 days ago, the stress came to a head and my dad started yelling at my mom. Apparently, he accidentally ate my breakfast my mom made for me, and she definitely made a rude comment about it. I was upstairs and my dad starts screaming ""YOU ALWAYS FUCKING DO THIS. WHY CANT YOU JUST TELL ME AHEAD OF TIME? THIS IS WHY I HATE TALKING TO YOU."" And I could hear some of my mom's words saying ""Oh you think you're such a nice guy..."" She was talking at a lower level so I couldn't hear her much.

I froze in my room, and felt like I was transported back to when I was 10 years old. I got all choked up, trying not to cry but rushed downstairs to try to make them stop yelling at each other, but honestly, I was also so angry so I just started saying ""Shut up! Shut up!"" And when my mom started saying ""It's your father's fault he ate your food."" I yelled again in a shakey voice trying not to bawl ""I don't care!"" I made myself a new breakfast. Mom left the kitchen, dad sat at the table. As soon as I finished my eggs, he asked ""How are you feeling?"" (I called off work that day cause I was already feeling sick from my health stuff) and I just muttered ""My heads hurts."" And ran back upstairs.

Throughout my childhood, it was my cousin. Then, it was my friend. Then it was my crush. Then it was my mom's friend with whom I stayed for a while. All of the cases, women, though I myself am a male.

I display some facets or dimensions of my personality more prominently than others depending on my company. Among family, I tend to become more intellectual or political. Among friends, I can be more fun-loving or spontaneous. Just having fun. None of these, I really enjoy being. Though I can say, I love my father, it's a little tiring to talk politics all day long. I identify as conservative but I don't really like being conservative. It's just... a thing.

I realized I liked myself best around these women, because for one reason or another, I felt the favorite version of myself with them. We don't talk politics. We don't talk news. We don't talk money. More often than not, we just talk feelings and fun wholesome memories and experiences. We talk about family and religion, also aspirations and bucket lists. Crushes too. Psychological stuff. Dream interpretations and number of cats means how many kids you want sorta things.

I'm a boy but I just can't handle talking to boys for too long. I can't stand my own kind. We're so brain dead and dirty. I myself can be a pretty dirty person, that's dirty in more than one sense and though it's fun for a bit, it gets stale and I often myself staring up at the ceiling drained of my social battery in some corner with a cigarette in my mouth while the rest of the party rages on drinking. I hate drinking. I'm not into cars. I'm not into sports. I'm not into bragging about numbers, whatever that number may represent.

So even though I'm a certified welder now with two months experience grinding metal with sparks flying in my face and an ambition to save up for an education to become a chemist or a rad tech to work to then save up some more so I can afford pursuing an artistic side mission along with starting a nice Christian family, there you'll find me often shedding these things when someone lets the real me show. I'm not so grand. I'm not so zealous. I'm not really a man at all.

At my core, the self I most enjoy being is my innocent 8 year old self. Gentle women tend to amplify that the most in me, so I am drawn to them. I don't like fighting. I don't like competition. I just wanna be babied in a sorta platonic familial way, like riding at the back of your aunt's car or running errands with your big sister in the market, being asked if you want ice cream.

That's another thing. I never had a big sis. I was an only child, so I've always looked for one in other people.

Am I weird? Isn't this like a syndrome or something?",Am I weird for feeling more comfortable and myself around women and wanting a platonic connection similar to having a big sister?,"The individual is 20 years old and has a background as an only child, which has influenced their interpersonal relationships, particularly a longing for a big sister figure. They have a complicated relationship with their parents: they express love for their father but find conversations with him about politics tiring. They identify as a male but feel disconnected from typical masculine interests and social behaviors, finding better connections with women and feeling drained when around other males.

Professionally, they are a certified welder with only two months of experience. They have aspirations to further their education to become either a chemist or a radiologic technologist. Additionally, they have a desire to pursue artistic interests and start a Christian family in the future. 

Their social interactions reveal a strong preference for emotional and light-hearted conversations over political or competitive discussions, indicating that their relationships are a significant aspect of their identity and self-perception. The individual reflects a yearning for a sense of nurturing and innocence that they associate with their younger self, suggesting that their upbringing and family dynamics have heavily influenced their current emotional state.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1izr2md/people_like_people_who_help_them_be_the_person/,mentalhealth
2025-02-27 21:30:03,1izr1py,How to quieten the voices,"So apparently it’s not ‘normal’ to constantly be thinking all the time and narrating your own life as you live it. I struggle to live presently and be natural in social situations because of this as my inner monologue is very loud and constantly analysing every single action I make. I’m too introspective and hyper aware of the fact I am a human. I used to think everyone had thoughts like these and some were just better at ignoring them / managing them but apparently not? 

My way of thinking isn’t productive either I wish I at least hyper fixated on real word issues instead of just negative thoughts and ruminating about the past. I hardly think about the future or the present, they’re all very self centred and introspective thoughts, I’m obsessed with trying to understand how I operate. I constantly think about the past and my actions and how I behave and I usually end up limerent over people I become comfortable around because I imagine they hold answers about me that I’m trying to understand. Limerence is one of those worst examples of how my hyperactive thoughts manifest. I’m aware that my brain is self sabotaging me with these thoughts patterns and I do my best to shut them down but it’s constant and very difficult. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to quieten the voices. I do everything ‘right’ I sleep well, I have a daily routine that I stick to, I exercise, get out in nature everyday - I live on acres of woodland I’m very connected to nature, I do yoga and practice mindfulness, I eat incredibly clean and drink enough water, the only thing ‘wrong’ with my lifestyle is that I have no social life which comes from living in an isolated part of town and working unsociable hours but I’m an introvert and I’ve spent most my life like this so I’ve learnt to accept that. 

I used to smoke weed daily for 3 years and I do remember that numbing my thoughts massively which is why I think I became so reliant on it. I quit cold turkey just under a year ago now and haven’t gone back since, I realised it made me very complacent, I had no desire to better my life or myself, I didn’t talk to anyone or care to try and make friends, I ate like shit and hardly exercised. So my lifestyle has massively improved since quitting weed, even though I haven’t been able to make new friends I actually care enough to try and want to build a community which i feel is the only think I have left to ‘fix’ in my life. But the voices have become so loud and apparent again since quitting weed I just don’t know what to do. There has to be another way right? 

I’m not sure what causes my hyperactive thoughts, it seems to be a little bit of ocd with the whole rumination thing and probably mixed with anxiety - I don’t know but I just want them gone. ","How can I quieten my constant, hyperactive thoughts and inner monologue?","The individual describes a challenging inner mental landscape characterized by constant self-narration and introspection, leading to difficulties in social situations. They have an isolated lifestyle, living on acres of woodland, which has contributed to a lack of social interaction due to working unsociable hours.

Previously, the individual used to smoke weed daily for three years, which they indicate helped to numb their thoughts; however, they quit cold turkey nearly a year ago, recognizing that their reliance on it made them complacent and disconnected from others. Since quitting, although they have improved their lifestyle through better sleep, routine, exercise, and nutrition, they are struggling with the resurgence of intrusive thoughts, possibly linked to OCD and anxiety.

2025-02-27 21:16:11,1izqq3c,How do I get through this constant numbness?,"
Hi all, I've been feeling really shitty lately so I guess I'm just wanting some advice or at least someone to relate to so here I am.

The past few weeks I've felt completely numb, there have been so many moments where I'v felt like I should feel excited or happy, but nothing. The shitty part is that I still have all the negative feelings sadness, anger, burnt out, etc, just not the good emotions to balance it out.

I'm a student with bills to pay so I work 2 jobs (Afternoons are more freelance) I struggle some months, but it's more about working hard to create a good future. The hours are a lot (6:30am-5/6pm) so I have stepped back and taken on less in the afternoons since I could be burnt out, but that hasn't helped.

I have been through a lot recently, namely caring for my dad and then watching him lose the battle to cancer just over a year ago at 20 and not having any other family present. He was my entire world so of course I haven't been the same since but I had time to prepare myself. I've always been  independant and from young I knew that my parents wouldn't be dependable. So I've been doing this adulting thing alone for over a year and it's very tough but I've pulled through so far. 

Why do I now feel like I've drowned and there's no way back to the surface? I do have my found family, so please don't take it as I'm completely alone. I have an amazing support system. Yet, I feel that I've lost myself, my spark and my will in life..I'm not the expressive, loving and fun person that I was. Instead I either walk around like a zombie, a second away from a break down or with this deep anger bubbling inside my chest at everything, at the world. I've lost the person that I was and have become this almost hardened and numb realist  What do I do?

2025-02-27 20:59:24,1izqbq4,have a crush on someone who seems depressed,"basically what it says. i (26F) like a recent friend (34M) i have made and in the last 2 months he has been going through something which is affecting his mental state badly, he finds it difficult to get things done or focus, he doesn't feel like stepping out or meeting people, has trouble sleeping etc. once this started, he stopped responding to me and i took it to be a social hint, especially since he said he is just staying off social media for some time. later he reached out on his own and explained his absence. he has also talked to me about his state a few times, but for the most part even when he talks about it he struggles to articulate it clearly. he believes it is not depression per se, claiming that he is familiar enough with that to know the difference. regardless of the classification, i think, he is clearly going through something serious. we mostly talk on text now only to discuss things around this, and he doesn't seem to carry other conversations much. we met a few times recently. he was also looking forward to getting out of the house. i think we enjoy each other's company but there is also a real possibility that social interactions in general might be too much for him sometimes.

my issue now is that i really like him, but he has been a bit hot and cold, and i find it hard to tell if it's because he is only interested in being around to me a certain extent or if he is genuinely not in a position to talk. for instance having me come over with the agreement that i will stay the night but then when i was there he said he might not be able to be social the next day, so it seemed best if i go. i understood his position and left. we met again after that, this time he was okay with me staying the night, and we ended up cuddling (new! i suggested it the last time we met and then he initiated it when we met this time), but then seeming a bit aloof the next morning, which left me feeling very confused and a bit upset. of course platonic cuddling is a thing but i feel like in a situation where one person puts it out there like that as a possibility, it should be read differently? is it not the best idea perhaps to have any expectations since the other person is suffering and would not be able to prioritise thinking about this? 

i was wondering if there's anything i can do to be there for him meaningfully, keeping in mind that we have only known each other for 5-6 months now, and he doesn't seem to be the one who initiates making plans much.. all this, of course keeping in mind his ongoing struggles. because i have a crush on him sometimes i think i end up projecting some of my insecurities on his lack of enthusiasm sometimes so that makes it more complicated than it should be, for instance for the most part i make plans for us to meet, and i don't know if that gets read as desperate or needy or perhaps impinging on a possible desire for solitude on his end. 

sorry, this is closer to a confused rant than a specific question. my general request is, are there things i should keep in mind when i proceed further with our friendship, as well as stuff which is important to consider if i put my feelings out there for him to consider (eg. how someone in his position might react to something like that in general). i don't want to overwhelm him or possibly contribute to further deterioration of his well being in any way at all. if anyone has been on the other side of things, how have you felt or would feel about similar situations?",How can I support a friend who is going through a tough time while navigating my feelings for him?,"The individual in the Reddit post is a 26-year-old female (26F) who has developed feelings for a recent male friend (34M).

2025-02-27 20:58:45,1izqb6y,I am tired of isolating my self from the world and rotting in my room whenever I get the chance (21F),"I'm so embarrassed to admit that I am scared of the outside world. I feel uncomfortable walking in public and the only reason I go out is either for uni (which is the same exact route every single time) or when I RARELY agree to go out with my friends (it legit happens like 2-3 times a year) I have two friends, one of which is my uni friend and I barely spend time with them because I simply can't make myself go out and enjoy the moment. I feel the safest when I'm in my room working on my laptop but at the same time it makes me feel pathetic and I know how bad it is for me, both mentally and physically. I know how good I feel when I'm active but stepping out of my ""shell"" feels impossible and scary. 

I've had an eating disorder for almost 3 years now and it doesn't make things easier. I simply feel ""not worthy"" of enjoying my life until I finally lose the weight but it's been 3 fucking years and I've had my life on hold this whole time. And I've achieved nothing. If anything, this damn disorder took everything away from me. My day consists of me thinking about my weight, how fat I've gotten, how I should try to eat less, how I should eat ""cleaner"" how I should move more, sitting at my desk all day, occasionally going to uni, either eating too little or too much, overstimulating my brain with endless YouTube videos, thinking about food again, falling asleep at 4-5 am and waking up at 1 pm (when I don't go to uni) This is not how life should be for a 21 year old girl bro. I feel like I'm destroying myself more and more but getting out seems so scary. I'm so sedentary, even the smallest amount of food I can eat makes me either maintain or gain. I know this isn't my natural weight, I know for a fact that if I changed my lifestyle and started actually LIVING I would look and feel so much better. I just don't wanna be at war with my brain and body all the fucking time. And it's an endless loop too, the sedentary, isolated lifestyle makes me feel like shit which makes me eat emotionally , which makes me feel fat, which keeps me from going out and being perceived by people, which keeps me sedentary and isolated...

Another reason is my controlling dad. It's a long story, but basically he's a control freak and doesn't let me go out whenever I want and doesn't trust any fucking one, which has been this way my whole entire life and it literally made me NOT want to leave the house to protect myself from being controlled. I'd rather stay in my room, safe and sound not worrying about my dad controlling when and where I'm going. 
All of this is starting to make me lose my shit and I can't keep living like this anymore. I want to start going out every single day, either after uni classes or even if I have a day off (which is always an excuse to stay indoors and rot in bed all day long), I just wanna walk around the city, explore new places, try to meet new people and stop being scared of the real world. And I want to do it alone for now, without telling my friends. And I'm definitely not telling my dad.
 
But I don't know where to start. What am I even supposed to do in the city alone? All I can think of is window shopping. Hey, I'm 21 and I literally don't know how to spend my free time outside like a normal person 💪🏻 The most ridiculous thing is I'm not even interested in clubbing or anything of that sort, I just wanna...

I absolutely loved talking to strangers and making new friends so I had a lot of associations. Everything was going great.

Until one day I met two new people. They were great people and we hit it off so fast. Months went by and they became my new best friends. They would come home with me on weekends to see my family and friends and would stay in my dorm all day and all night. I loved them.

About 6 months into the friendship they started showing signs of obsession and control towards me. If I wanted to skip a day of hanging out they would call me a bad friend etc. If I didn’t want them to sleep over a night, they would call me names and even ghost me for days at a time. If I didn’t want to go on a bike ride with them they would pull up pictures they took of me and call me fat until I went. Sadly these manipulative tactics worked on me because I loved them so much and thought they loved me and I could trust them. When I type out what they did, it was obvious that I was in a bad situation and I feel so stupid. They played this all off so calmly like they weren’t actually mad and they would laugh when they did this stuff so it didn’t seem as bad. I ended up going home because these actions became worse and they were threatening me and I was scared.

About a month after I ghosted them I went back to my college dorms and I was jumped by three women at the gym. I did not know who they were but I assume my old friends had a connection with them. I did press charges. After being jumped the three girls continued to show up to my campus and ask around for me and harass me through my door threatening me. The police were called multiple times and I was told I could not get a restraining order against my old friends and these girls until something else happened. I was utterly terrified and so was my family so I moved home for good.

Moral of the story. I can’t form friendships after this. I can’t trust people and I refuse to go into public places alone because I feel like i’m still unsafe. Please give me advice on how I can become the social butterfly I once was again and how I can trust others. I think about these events that have happened and to this day they make me break down in tears thinking about it.

Another few examples I have of similar situations are:

-they always make fun of me ‘playfully’ but it’s always only me being targeted. recently they’ve been making fun of the way i speak, which has been an insecurity of mine for a while.

-whenever i text them im sick and not able to come to school, they ignore the text or say ‘bruh.’ when anyone else texts the same thing they say “NOOOOO” and complain about missing them all day.

it’s not like i want my friends to fawn over me or worship me i just wish they wouldn’t treat me like im not one of them. am i being dramatic?
 ",Am I overreacting to my friends making me feel excluded and insecure?,"The individual is a student who regularly attends school with a main friend group. Their social interactions involve routines, such as meeting friends at school doors and sitting together at a table. The person has experienced feelings of insecurity and exclusion within this friend group, particularly when they were ignored and made to feel unwelcome. 

They have a history of feeling targeted by playful teasing from their friends, which often centers around their speech, a noted insecurity for them. Additionally, they have noticed a disparity in the way their friends react to their personal health issues compared to how they respond to others in similar situations, suggesting a perceived lack of care or concern for their well-being. 

Overall, these experiences contribute to the individual's current feelings of upset and insecurity regarding their friendships.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1izolea/i_think_my_friends_hate_me/,mentalhealth

It feels impossible to actually stay in a conversation or make plans to socialize that actually end up working out. As a result I’ve effectively been isolated for the past 2~3 years. Not because I don’t know people or that I don’t see folk on a regular basis but the fact that there’s so much going against the ability to socialize and find a friend group while at under the influence of a heavy depression and social anxiety.

2025-02-27 19:35:33,1izoczg,Professional help for my mom who I suspect is severely depressed,"Hello, I'm coming with issue that keeps growing in my family and it's high time both my parents went to therapy but especially my mom. 


Starting from the beginning: My mom is an only child, her dad was an alcoholic who worked as sailor until he got malaria when my mom was 23 years old, spent 3 months in a coma and upon waking up has mentality of a teenager. He needs supervision, can't be trusted with money and as he ages keeps tripping and breaking new bones. 


My mom's mom was always ""crazy"" until finally diagnosed with schizophrenia and she haven't left her apartment in the last 15 years. My mom cares for both of her parents daily, bathes her mom every second day, cooks for them daily and delivers those meals, it's been like this for the last 15 years. My parents stopped leaving our town for longer than one night when my grandparents health deteriorated physically 5 years ago. If they do manage to arrange help (me, my sister, my brother who all have busy work life in another city and can't always come and wash and feed grandma) then my mom worries through their vacation anyway. 


She is under immense stress and pressure, can't sleep because thoughts about her parents' deaths hunt her, she cries in her car every day after coming back from visiting her parents, she's unstable emotionally and her mood can change very quickly. She lashes out on us daily, followed by sunny mood acting like nothing happened. Last month her anger outburst resulted in breaking glass doors in a fit of violence, she needed stitches. She lost all her friends in recent years due to her behaviour and now her only support is us (my dad who has the same opinion about psychological help and 3 children who ""are to young to understand not every problem in life can be solved by some shrink""). Physically she's tense in every muscle of her body it seems, experiences multiple pains and other stress related somatic symptoms. 



I've been trying to talk with my parents about therapy to strengthen my mom's mentality but they are adamantly against it using mainly arguments ""find me a single child with sick parents who was helped by some shrink"" and ""shrink will just tell her to not worry and stick her parents in old people house"" and ""it's just how shitty life is, shrinks won't help and it will just get worse"" and finally ""when grandparents die we will be free"".


I find this stupid as hell and I'm incredibly frustrated that they refuse to try. I understand why they do that but still it pains me to see them trapped in a cage of their of making. I want to help them realise life can be better and they are not the only ones in such situations, that there is help available and psychological support specialised in problems like those. 


Where should I start? Have any of you experienced or know someone who experienced similar situations and what helped? Thank you


Some relevant data: my mom is 54 years old, takes no medications.","What should I do to help my parents realize that therapy could improve their situation, especially for my mom who is under immense stress?","The individual posting on Reddit has a mother who is 54 years old and an only child. The mother’s background includes a father who was an alcoholic and worked as a sailor until he contracted malaria at the age of 23, leading to a three-month coma and a subsequent mental decline to the level of a teenager. He requires supervision and is unable to manage money safely as he ages, also experiencing physical deterioration such as recurring broken bones from falls.

The mother’s own mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and has been reclusive, not leaving her apartment for the past 15 years. For the last 15 years, the mother has been the primary caregiver for both of her parents, handling daily tasks such as bathing her mother every other day, cooking, and delivering meals. The family dynamics shifted significantly when the grandparents' health further declined physically five years ago, limiting the parent’s ability to travel and forcing them into a caretaker role that exacerbates stress and worry.

2025-02-27 19:26:06,1izo4rd,Is it normal to be fine your whole life and then one day you’re not?,"
I wanted to reach out because I am 30M and reside in the US. I don’t really have any health problems other than severe treatment resistant anxiety that started suddenly following a series of traumatic family events about 5 years ago. I have been in therapy for 2 years now and have tried everything under the sun to get this under control but I can’t. 

Up until 2020 I was fine and had no mental health issues and was doing well in life. 

Since 2020;

-I had a major health scare (told a mole in my eye was most likely melanoma ~ came back benign)
-My father secretly developed an online gambling addiction and lost his job, house, most of our family possessions, and is now about to become a criminal over theft. He went from joyful and very successful to really depressed and won’t get help. 
-Shortly after he lost his house my grandmother (his mom) became depressed and killed herself via pain medication and Wellbutrin overdoses in an attempt to leave everything she had to him to help him (He gambled the estate away and no one got anything)
-My brother was diagnosed with BPD and has not been the same after finding my grandmother dead in bed with her eyes open. He is now violent and destructive and abuses drugs in an attempt to get over finding my grandmother. This creates stress for me as he was never like this and I legit worry most days he’s gonna die or kill himself. 

These are just the big issues. I also lost my mother to lung cancer as well when I was a child so I don’t have anyone left to talk about this with beyond a therapist. 

Believe it or not I was holding it together really well until late 2022 when my brother was arrested for a crime. I was so upset over it that I dreamt about it for 5 nights in a row and on the 6th day woke up feeling like I have since then. I feel like I’m almost in a dream and like I’m just drunk without the alcohol part. I think that is what did me in and even though I can talk about it with no issues I haven’t felt right since. 

All my symptoms are physical in nature. I just feel dizzy and drunk, extremely tired, and almost like I’m on edge for no reason. My vision feels off and slightly blurry even though I am corrected to 20/20. Another issue I’m having is panic over anything that could be bad. For example if I get a phone call I freak out that someone is calling to tell me someone else finally killed themselves in my family or is hurt. It really is stressing me out. Multiple therapists have worked with me and despite this nothing has worked. We have Tried EMDR, CBT, Mindfulness, and another therapy type I can’t remember.  

I am completely lost on what to do. I am completely out of money, I lost my high paying job because my performance got so bad after 2022, I lost my house, and I am trying to file bankruptcy. I also don’t have health insurance anymore so beyond the ER no one will see me without money upfront. I’m not suicidal I just want to feel normal again because if I can I believe I’ll rebound really quickly. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to recover from all of this? Is medication going to be my only hope?

Is medication my only hope?,"The individual is a 30-year-old male residing in the US. He was previously in good health and had no mental health issues until a series of traumatic family events began around 2020.

He has lost his high-paying job, his house, and is facing financial difficulties, including filing for bankruptcy, along with a lack of health insurance.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1izo4rd/is_it_normal_to_be_fine_your_whole_life_and_then/,mentalhealth

Right now I’m trying to heal my relationship with my body. I’ve been weightlifting and eating better. ( I most likely have an unhealthy relationship to food though). I hope honestly to be a bit of a muscle mommy lol. But anyways, even though I have these ambitions, it’s still hard to accept that I won’t ever be a naturally small “dainty” girl.

I'm 22, I have all the privilege I could want and people would consider me successful for getting a big girl job right after college, but I hate every single thing about myself. This isn't new, I can't remember a time I've ever felt any different. I'm autistic so I've always struggled socially in a major way, so I think all of this self hatred is rooted in how people have always reacted to me. I'm not blaming other people, I just have an acute awareness of how unlikable I am. 

I've always ruminated on everything that's ever happened in my life so I've spent basically every conscious moment since middle school hyperfixating on myself and how I'm being perceived at all times. I also struggle with black and white thinking, so every time I think anything negative about myself I genuinely feel like I deserve the worst death imaginable. I was extremely suicidal as a teenager and spent time in the psych ward over the years. I think the only reason this got better in college was because I was smoking weed constantly to cope. 

I had friends in college, but those relationships came to a tumultuous end as they always have for me. Now I'm living in a big city by myself, 9 hours from my home state, and I have zero friends here. I work a cubicle job which is very independent so it's hard to get to know people. 

I've been treading water for the last 10 months, being alone all the time isn't a new practice for me so I've probably been coping better than a normal person would, but for the last month the suicidal stuff has been unignorable. I can't stop thinking about it and it scares me because it reminds me of when I was a teenager and attempted. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is knowing how much it would fuck up my family. 

This mentality has been around for years for me, but it's been seeming more and more unbearable that I have to stay here just so I don't traumatize anyone else. It's so conflicting because I genuinely feel like I'm a burden and drain on every person who knows me and know in my gut everyone's life would be better off. But I'm stuck here, and wondering if any person that truly hates everything about themselves could ever possibly feel any different.",Can someone who has struggled with major depression and self-hatred since childhood ever change and feel differently about themselves?,"The individual is 22 years old and has experienced major depression since childhood, with suicidal thoughts dating back to their teenage years.

Since I started I've been put on antidepressants, started almost 2 months ago now. It helped for a bit but the last week I've gotten worse again. I feel more anxious and depressed, they decided to up my dose to 75 mg. Hopefully that will help but it feels like my anxiety and depression doesn't really go away. My psychologist has only focused on talking in general about my well being, it felt like the only reason I went there was to check up on how I was doing. Funny thing was that I was only supposed to meet him for a pre-evaluation regarding ADHD, but now  3 months later there hasn't been any progress in that department. I told him from the beginning that my focus problems isn't due to my depression because I have experienced periods where I don't feel as depressed and my focus problems are still just as bad and has been like that for as long as I can remember. 

I had an appointment today where I for a second time broke down and was really angry with him over how he handled it, he didn't care about my focus problems. He read into things saying ""you're getting better"", but as the person living with it, it ain't getting better. I'm still stuck in this weird Limbo where I can't do anything. He gave me some papers regarding ADHD that I should fill in and he finally seems to have started the pre-evaluation. But it feels like I've spent the past 3 months thinking he has but seems like has only focused on my depression. But the thing making me depressed the most is the focus thing, I've been clear about it from the start. Anyways I'm really frustrated and now I don't have an appointment with him until like a month. This is all taking so long and it feels like I'm ruining my life, he asks me if I experience suicidal thoughts and honestly, yes I do. I feel really shitty about my situation and I feel like no one or nothing is helping me. I just wanna know what's wrong, I wanna fix it. But I can't because it feels like no one is taking me seriously, they're not doing anything. I hate my psychologist and I just wish I could switch but I don't wanna have to redo it all again. I fucking hate it here, I'm so tired. ","How can I find a psychologist who will take my focus and motivation issues seriously, rather than just my depression and anxiety?","The individual is 19 years old, and they began seeing a psychologist in December after talking to a curator for two months.

2025-02-27 14:50:58,1izhi0p,It feels like the universe hates me.,"I feel like the year 2025 is the year in which the universe has set itself to absolutely kick me in the gut over and over and over again. I must be the unluckiest person out there, or maybe I've been cursed by someone... Everything I do goes wrong- everything. 

I lost a long-term relationship. I fought for it tooth and nail, the fight was slowly destroying me, but I held on. Did that fight result in anything? Nop. I was the only one fighting so in the end I had to leave. 

Leaving made me lose everything, because I had moved to the country of my ex, leaving everything behind. I left behind my job, my friends, my healthcare, my housing- everything , just to be with her. My friends already knew how toxic that relationship had become they told me to not move to another country with her, but that was the plan I had worked towards for 6 years... Work my ass off, fall in love with her country, move, have my happily ever after. 

Instead of my dream I got a nightmare, now when my living situation was dependent on her and I had no friends or social support, things became worse. Constant power trips, threats, constant demeaning, social isolation... When I left her, I became homeless, jobless and had no healthcare which I needed... Thankfully I could contact a friend in my own country and avoid sleeping on the street while I sort everything out. 

I was heavily depressed... But I was pushing through, working on my studies, sending job applications, looking for housing, planning to move back to the country where I study... A brief moment of luck was thrown my way, I got help with housing from my university, I got a part time job and I keep searching for jobs in my field. 

So I sucked it all up. I decided- I will not complain. I will keep pushing, keep staying optimistic. But... things are not really changing... I work my ass off, I keep getting rejected from the places I apply to, finances are very tight. I still have no healthcare. 

There are various small things that keep going wrong too... Like I can't get necesary appointments to register in my place on time, I have to reschedule appointments, I waste my time going to places to handle all kinds of bureaucratic matters, but there's always something wrong, I got a fine which I possibly couldn't have gotten and now while they check all my documentation proving I haven't even been in this country for 6 months, I still have to pay the fine, with a promise of a refund if a decision is made that my dispute is valid... I wanted to order a bike, I need one for work, but I got scammed twice in the same week (Thankfully I can receive my refunds because I was careful, but just waiting for the money to be sent back to me, and waiting for days on end for internal investigations is frustruating). For my thesis one of the online spaces I am researching all of a sudden got blocked in the EU, so I had to spend a whole night trying to set stuff up so I can continue my research... It's like I'm cursed or smth. Maybe a car will run me over soon enough, I wouldn't be surprised at this point, because every single thing I put my hands on just goes terribly wrong... ",How can I cope with feeling like everything in my life is going wrong and improve my situation?,"The individual in crisis has a background marked by significant life changes and challenges:

1. **Relationship History**: They had a long-term romantic relationship which ultimately ended. The individual described the relationship as toxic, characterized by a lack of support from their partner. This led to a deep emotional struggle, as they fought hard to maintain the relationship despite it negatively affecting their mental health.

2. **Relocation for Love**: The person moved to another country to be with their partner after working towards this goal for six years. This decision involved leaving behind their job, friends, healthcare, and housing, demonstrating a significant commitment and investment in the relationship.

3. **Social and Professional Isolation**: After the breakup, the individual faced homelessness and joblessness, as their living situation was dependent on their ex-partner, leaving them without social support when they needed it most.

4. **Educational Pursuits**: They are currently engaged in studies at a university, which indicates a commitment to education and professional development. Despite their struggles, they have been working on their studies while seeking employment.

5. **Mental Health**: The person has experienced significant depression but is attempting to push through these difficulties with a positive mindset and determination to improve their circumstances.

6. **Current Employment and Housing Situation**: They recently secured a part-time job and received assistance with housing from their university, showing their efforts to stabilize their situation while still facing financial challenges.

7. **Bureaucratic Challenges**: The individual has encountered numerous bureaucratic issues, including difficulties with healthcare registration and fines related to administrative errors, which have added to their stress and frustration.

These factors contribute to their sense of ongoing crisis and feelings of being overwhelmed by misfortune.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1izhi0p/it_feels_like_the_universe_hates_me/,mentalhealth

- I am single. No children. I feel like I've failed in terms of the projectory I had for my life. My relationship with my mom is unstable. My father is and has always been an alcoholic.

I've pursued and conquered all of my goals and challenges by my self, on my own. Currently, I'm enrolled in graduate school to obtain my Master's in relation to Education.

Everything has become too much. I am medicated for anxiety/depression w/ lexapro. I am diagnosed ADHD and & medicated.

Yet. I struggle to find my own purpose in life. 

I attempted, reluctantly after MUCH research, to pair with a therapist. It was  bust. She was awful. She completely killed my 'I want therapy vibe', and I haven't tried again since.

I know my family (although distant) loves me.

I know my students need me. But sometimes the overwhelming feeling to end my life is intense. I fear the aftermath for my students & how this would affect them.

I got raped multiple times before even hitting 15yo. I started drinking and using and engaging in dangerous activities to run away from reality and I did for a while but I kept harming myself in all the possible ways even cutting myself I even tried to suicide 4times but I always failed.

I tried to find jobs since I was kid and I did work and made some money started therapy at 18 but kept relapsing and couldn’t even talk about these experiences (neither with my therapist nor my friends) i get really uncomfortable specially that im a guy and supposed to be strong enough to fight but i was a kid.

When I grew up i kept harming myself by getting into meaningless sex mostly with girls but I even had some experiences with guys even though I didn’t  like it but im addicted to the pain, i see myself as nothing so i put myself in such scenarios because i worth nothing.
I broke up with my gf last year after a long relationship (3y) because she cheated on me.

Lately i feel the urge again to end everything i don’t feel like anything is worth it, i don’t feel like anyone is there for me not even my family.

How she hates her life, she hates herself, she hates this person and that person, she has no social skills, nothing going for her, she wants to die etc etc. She dumps all of this on me constantly and if I try to help her she just rejects my suggestions. For example I told her she could meet some of my friends if she wants since they're nice people and much better than the people she currently surrounds herself with and in fact they're actually closer to her age than mine (my sister is 7 years older than me). She refuses saying no because she has no social skills, she has met one of them before and felt no connection. I've tried to link her to resources that can help or helplines because ultimately I'm not a therapist or a professional and I can't deal with this. I've told our mom about her being suicidal and she didn't care (they've had an incredibly poor relationship for years anyway). My sister will also guilt trip me if she thinks any advice I give her isn't good enough by saying things like ""is that all you have to say?"" or ""you're my sister you should be able to think of something meaningful to say"" or just straight up telling me to make her feel better.

My cousin killed himself when I was in high school and I am starting to isolate myself akin to the signs he showed when he began planning it. I just want to do what's best for me but feel like I'm a coward for it if I drop out.

I earned my bachelor's in computer science from a tier 3 college in India. I learned shit about coding, Just mugging up the theoretical syllabus one night before the exam and scoring considerable marks to maintain the GPA. Well, TBH I just filled supplementary just to increase the content, though I didn't know the hell I was writing. Never mind, that's how I completed my 4 years of college, going to college to chill with friends, spending lots of my parent's money, and done. Technical knowledge --0, practical/theoretical tech knowledge ---0. After completing my undergrad, I felt like let's go to the USA, the job market is not good, I might not get the exposure in India that I would get in the USA or any foreign country, blah, blah, blah...... Cut to Sept 2023 I started my MS in CS at a university at the San Fransisco Bay area(Won't specify the university name). I decided to live with people from India especially with people from my state (Which most Indian students do) and DAMN!!!!!!!. This is where it all starts.

The flatmates

A guy from a renowned University in Gujarat (PDPU), did his [b.tech](http://b.tech/) in CS with a 9-pointer GPA, published multiple research papers, and whatnot. The second Guy is from another reputed university in Ahmedabad (Nirma) multiple years of practicing coding and is kind of an IDIOT(From my perspective) though what matters is how good he is at DSA(Data structures and algorithms) those who don't know, it's a concept to learn to get a job in big tech giants. The third guy from the same univ as the second has expertise in AI/ML, and tons of research papers published in his bachelor's not smarter than the second but fuck yes, hell lot smarter than me. NOW, the 4th guy(THE OG) that's what people in here call him. FROM IIIT SURAT Obviously who doesn't know this college, right? doing DSA for the past 4 years, a candidate master on CodeForces(for those who don't know, it is a platform to compete in coding competitions), and a hell lot of egoists. The Last guy, yes me, has No knowledge of coding, cant pass a TWO SUM, Fucked up in his life, not knowing what to do, and is surrounded by such people. I have heard people say, ""If you are surrounded by smarter people, it makes you smart"", Well I agree (FUCK NO) but who talks about ""What the smart people make you feel like"" --- A FUCKING IDOT ???

Its FEB 2025 already and those who know its time to get an internship for SUMMER 2025, well guess what ""I AM FUCKED"" about 500 application -- 0 acceptance 0 interviews I don't know what the hell will happen. On the Other hand. from my roommates, 1 guys cracked google, 1 interviewing RUbrik, 1 interviewing AMAZON, 1 in the process and me ------ FUCK ME.....

I’ve had struggles on and off with mental health since i was a kid. For the most part ive been fine but the past couple of years it just seems to be getting worse and worse.

It kinda comes and goes though. I will be fine and doing pretty good for a while and then it hits out of nowhere for a few weeks and it kinda screws up my life. I am on an ssri but i dont find it really does anything other than make me have weird dreams. 

Recently at night ive just been feeling really disconnected from everything, and i feel, well, nothing. I have no emotions all of the sudden its like im watching my life through my eyes and dont care about anything. 

This has led to me taking more risks and not caring about what happens to me or my body as a result of those risks. Im also starting to have more suicidal thoughts which has not been uncommon during my life, but theyre getting worse and ive been noticing an increasing interest in drugs, which are currently very accessible to me, which is weird because in the past i would never even think about drugs.

I feel like im starting to go down a bad path but i dont even know where to start with getting help. Ive been researching coping strategies to try out but it all feels so pointless. I’d like to see a psychiatrist but how do i even do that? Could i even do it?

2025-02-27 01:28:35,1iz43jw,How to make yourself want to live?,"I (F17) don't really care to live?

I don't WANT to be dead, I think? I just don't want to live. Like, is this all there is? I have friends, about 4, though I only talk frequently to one outside of school. If is all life has to offer then I think I've seen enough? Like I want out, get me off the train. 

I'm from a conservative religious family, and I'm neither of those things. It's hard to talk about much when we fundamentally disagree on most things. I want to go to someone but I'm worried I'd just be put in a ward. My dad isnt empathetic, he doesn't feel sympathy for people. My mom's a sweetheart, but she's also depressed and suicidal. I don't wanna put her through that. My death would crush her.

My friends would care as well, my best friend would be crushed. I've mentioned my suicidal thoughts(I hate calling it that it makes it sound so serious, when I feel like it isn't.) and he said something along the lines of he couldn't make it without me. I don't want to be the reason HE kills himself or goes down the wrong path in life.

I wish I could just die, everyone care for a week or two, grieve, then let go and move on. I have no active plan to, and I feel like I'll never actually grow the balls to, anyway. Sometimes I wish I could just get in a crash, only fatal for me, or die in my sleep. 

I have no motivation for anything ever, I don't want to do anything. I wish I could pause time and just live one day forever. 

I haven't self harmed asside from scratching myself a few years ago when what I really wanted was to cut myself. I think I WOULD cut myself if I thought I could hide it. I want to find joy in life, a purpose. But I have none. All I have is art but realistically if I pursue a life in art I'm screwed. I want to do something creative in life but good luck with that. If I do then it'd be dead end job after dead end job. It's unfair. I wish I was a nepobaby.

I don't want to be like this forever. I want to find reasons to live but I'm just bored. The only things I find joy in are my fandoms and hanging out with people. (Friends, little siblings.) And even that those are when I'm in the mood. I get lifes ups and downs but I don't care for the downs. I'm sick of it being down.

It's a constant thing too. Even when I'm happy I think ""I should kill myself at at this high point, so I don't have to go through the next down."" I asked my best friend if he ever feels like that and he said no, I think that's when I realized it wasn't really normal? Like I knew suicidal thoughts and stuff are bad, but ... Not everyone thinks that? Really?

I feel like I'm meant to die young. Living past 20 just doesn't seem in the cards for me. Being an actual adult and growing old doesn't seem right. I truly believe I'd be gone by now if I wasn't so worried about making people sad.

The thought of dying is such a comfort to me. I had a panic attack about my future and what my job will be and I calmed myself down by thinking ""if things get too rough you can just kill yourself."" And that made me feel so much better. Again, I feel I'm meant to die young. 

What do I do? I don't want to be miserable forever, always thinking about a release that I know I shouldn't use. And I can't kill myself, that'd affect too many people.

I’m not really sure where to start. I’ve been through so much recently, and it feels like my entire world has fallen apart.

I think I might’ve just gone through a manic episode. I made choices that felt right in the moment but have left me devastated. I lost my home and have been without a fixed address since early January. I tried to find stability by staying with my girlfriend in Ireland, but I had to return to Switzerland, where I now feel completely alone.

Financially, I’m drowning. I haven’t had an income in months, and I don’t know how to pay for even the basics. My unemployment fund has been a nightmare, and my debt is piling up. It’s like I’m constantly battling just to survive, and I’m exhausted.

My mental health is at an all-time low. I’ve been in therapy since early last year and had a psychiatric stay in September, but things haven’t improved. I’ve been searching for a spot in a psychiatric clinic for weeks, but there’s no place for me. I finally got an appointment for next Tuesday, but I’m struggling to make it through each day until then.

To make things worse, my relationship with my family is almost non-existent. I reached out to my mom, hoping for some support, but she basically told me I need to figure it out on my own. It hurts so much to feel rejected by the one person who should care. I feel completely abandoned.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m scared of my own thoughts and feel like I’m standing on the edge of a cliff. I’m trying to hold on, but I feel so alone.

2025-02-26 22:31:42,1iz0b1r,Advice needed… severely depressed mom & bipolar brother,"My brother has self referred himself to the mental hospital for probably the 8th or 9th time regarding suicidal thoughts and ideations. He's a great kid, but he really struggles from time to time and requires medication adjustments regularly. I am proud of him for noticing signs and getting help. However, my mom is completely emotionally codependent on my brother and since him being in the hospital she been on FMLA for severe depression. She has had no income for about 3 weeks and already doesn't manage well with the income she gets when she's not out of work. She is completely self destructive with her habits and I've tried to help her non-monetarily many times. In the last 3 months I've given her almost $400 to help. She messaged me again today begging for money. I finally said something along the lines of ""I'm sorry I can't help you. I have a partner and 2 kids to support, plus other life circumstances that prevent us from spending extra money. I also feel at this point in time I am enabling you to keep asking. Here are the resources in your area."" How do you I deal with the guilt knowing she's in a hard place and struggling, but I absolutely cannot keep lending her money. She never pays it back and like I've said we can't be spending extra right now. Like she's my mom and I love her because of that, but I am also extremely resentful towards her at this point because I'll never have a healthy relationship with her as an adult as long as she stays the way she is. I understand she's having a very hard time, but how do I tell her she has to function at at least the bare minimum? She's becoming a burden to me and I am feeling so much guilt and responsibility for it. I absolutely will not abandon my family for her though. There's other aggravating factors from my childhood affecting the way I feel, but that's rather here not there. Just looking for encouragement I guess ","How do I deal with the guilt of not being able to financially support my mom while she is struggling, without enabling her behavior?","The individual posting is dealing with a family crisis primarily involving their brother and mother. The brother has a history of mental health issues, having self-referred to a mental hospital multiple times due to suicidal thoughts and ideations, and requires regular medication adjustments. The mother is described as emotionally codependent on the brother and is currently on Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) due to severe depression, which has resulted in her being without income for about three weeks. Financially, the individual has provided almost $400 to the mother in the last three months but feels it's unsustainable and enabling.

I feel like I’ve never formed a meaningful connection with a woman, and every time I feel like I have a shot at being friends with one they lose interest and/or were likely just using the fact that I clearly liked them as an ego boost.

2025-02-27 19:14:34,1iznuzq,My addiction nearly ruined my life,"

I’ve been struggling with a really bad porn addiction for years all throughout high school. I self isolated due to a traumatic experience early in my high school years and my addiction got worse and worse. I was in such a bad place mentally, the isolation really got to me, my mind was overwhelmed with negative thoughts and I saw no way out of my situation. My mind was infected with nihilistic and existential thoughts that left me severely dissociated and it was a living hell. I hate that this happened in my life, it’s not something that I ever wanted to be part of it. I hate to admit that I briefly exposed myself to CSAM on instagram. I didn’t look for it initially, I never intended to see that stuff. I looked in the comments of one of the videos I was watching and saw a link. I knew exactly what was in that link, something in me told me not to click it, but my curiosity got the better of me, and I made the single most worst mistake of my life. I never knew that stuff existed on instagram, and while I was aware I was in dangerous territory, I didn’t know the magnitude of damage I was doing to myself. There were literally hundreds of accounts posting and advertising selling that stuff. But I felt a strange desire to keep looking, I knew it was fucked up, and I knew I should’ve gotten out. I didn’t last long, I left that evil place and left it for good I never thought of going back. I then got a new job where I started to ground myself back in reality and the memory resurfaced of what I did and it completely devastated me, I couldn’t believe it, I was so overwhelmed with shame,guilt, and disappointment that it traumatized me. It’s all I think about now. All I’ve wanted was to get myself out of that rut I was in, I hated watching porn, I WANTED to move on with my life. And now I feel like I’ve ruined everything. Please, I need help, I’m not a pedophile, I would never think of doing anything of that sort to a child. Ever since I stopped watching porn altogether, I don’t even feel the urge to do it anymore.  How can I ever recover from this?

2025-02-27 22:31:29,1izsgn7,A sob story rant,"I hate being alive, even though I don't have enough of a valid reason to. I'm 18, still in highschool and not seeing much of a future for myself regarding what job I want and how I'm going to get it. I'm not terrible academically, but not good enough for opportunities that might spark some passion in me. Other than that, I'm closeted bi and pre-transition, plus the scapegoat in my friend groups, which are things that weigh down on me everyday. 

Suicide is something I think about a lot, nearly daily, but I know I can't realistically pursue it because it would affect my family really badly, especially my recently divorced Mother. Self harm isn't an option too, my Mom found out when I did it when I was younger and I couldn't put her through the emotional turmoil of that again. Therapy isn't completely out of the question, but I'm hesitant to try due to my past experiences with a therapist that wasn't the best.

Does anyone relate to the feeling of wanting to be noticed, yet praying to god that you're not at the same time? I fantasise about someone I care about finding out that I'm not doing as well as I pretend to be and then worries about it, but I know I'd feel terrible if that actually happened. Just something I like to daydream about.

In the past, the individual was pursuing education but had to drop out because they needed to provide 24/7 supervision for their grandmother, who suffered an injury and reportedly does not appreciate their sacrifices.

Another thing that stopped me was the fact that I hate seeing blood, so cutting my wrists wouldn't have been an option. I was thinking about jumping out the window (I live pretty high up so jumping would've lead to a hospital visit or even death), but I couldn't bring myself to.

2025-02-27 21:11:23,1izqm3w,I've written my suicide letter to my best friend! How is it?,"Dear \*\*\*\*\*,

I’ve had a lot of best friends over the years, a lot of fizzled out friendships. I talk to lots of people. I hold on to a lot of people. But nobody is my best friend except for you. (I’m lowkey jealous my friendship with you is at the top but SHARED with \*\*\*\*… I’m joking \[no I’m not {yes I am}\]).

I wish I could’ve seen you one last time. I really wish that. I feel so stupid for not making any attempt to see you before now. I was genuinely so excited to potentially see you in April. I think we would’ve had an amazing time had the plans come to fruition.

That being said, I feel like our friendship might have changed in some capacity. I don’t know how. But I imagine our dynamic of being long distance friends would change once we hung out in person, you know? I don’t really know.

In some ways you’re too good to be true. You’re a *phenomenal* person. You care deeply about the things that matter to you. That “care” isn’t surface level, nor is it propelled with selfish intention. It’s pure love. It’s authentic. It’s fully and entirely real. You truly care about me, about your family, about your girlfriend, about your friends, in a way that I could bet my life on. That’s so rare. And the fact that I get to experience it *personally*  is so special.

I can imagine my life without most people, but I could never imagine my life without you. I lean on you when I’m struggling. I talk to you when my mind is adrift. You’re always there. Always.

I so badly wish I could be that person for you. I know you come to me with your struggles, problems, when you need advice. But was I ever that person for you truly? Have I been that person for you *lately?*

I question a lot when it comes to our friendship. Not on the authenticity front, but whether I was adequate enough. I have an abundant level of self-doubt, and it often gets in the way of whether I’m worthy of our friendship, or worthy of being in your life at all.

I look back on our memories fondly. I really do. Every single conversation with you has meant something to me. It’s real, all of it is so truly real. I can’t even express how badly I wish I could see you again.

Thank you for being my everything for anything. Thank you for being my best friend. Thank you for choosing to know me.

I know that this is a selfish request, but, please don’t move on from me SUPER fast. My ego CANNOT handle that. Yes, you’re mysterion, but that’s not even the point…  if you move on within 0.5 seconds I’ll get even more jealous. I wish I wouldn’t, but unfortunately, there’s a lot of things that are out of my control these days.

I’ll say it one more time. Thank you for being my best friend.

Ok so whats wrong?
1. I'm doing a shitty degree at university that has poor job prospects. This is probably the least of my worries right now, but it definitely contributes to me lacky any hope for the future.
2. All of 2024 i spent hiding from people, and so I missed out on the most important time to get to know people at uni. I'll be going into 3rd year soon, and I feel like I will never make any friends here before I leave.
3. I hate who I am. I hate how i view the world. I hate how i view others. It's like im some sort of cynical, spiteful, self-hating people pleaser. That describes me best. I hate how I still automatically cling onto right-wing views I've held in the past. I hate how I cannot relate to any other people. As soon as I am shown kindness, I reject it as I fear I'm not worthy of it, and I immediately anticipate my disappointing them. I hate that I'm so very uninteresting, and I hate that I take everything so seriously. 
4. Life is so lonely. I have loving parents and a supportive sister, but still, no one outside of my family. My past is full of failures, disappointments, mistakes, nothing lasting to look back on in happiness. The good memories I made are with people I had falling outs with. Nothing in the past, nothing in the future. - and the present moment I spend completely alone. All by myself. With no hope of ever making a friend. Maybe my standards are so high, or maybe they're too low, either way I avoid people out of fear of what they will think of me, and all my ugly flaws. 

I can't go on living like this. It's a horrible way to live. I feel like a loser. A weirdo. An outcast. Rejected by society, and I've perpetuated this rejection through my own actions.

2025-02-27 19:33:44,1izobg2,Am I selfish for wanting to end it?,"Ever since I (16F) was 12 I've been having suicidal thoughts. I was thinking about ending it recently for real.

One of the main reasons why I want to end it is because I feel like there's no true meaning to life. Wake up go to work, eat, sleep until you die. I've always thought like this and I don't see a reason to live.

Recently I've been getting horrible grades. And I mean HORRIBLE.I feel like such a dissapointment to my family. I  told my mom I was SH last year but she gave me a hug and told me not to but that was it. Which kind of dissapointed me, it didn't seem like she cared about how I felt, but more about the image of who I am. Why I think this is because she told me not to tell anyone so I don't get dragged to a psych wars or something.

If I did end it, I feel like it's selfish of me because I know my brothers care about me. And even if I told anyone in my family about how I feel, I doubt I'd be taken seriously.

I know ""grades don't define you"" or whatever but I feel useless. I feel ungrateful too. My dad recently said ""how can people be depressed when they have food, water and shelter"" and I felt like somebody shot me with a guilt arrow. 

If I ended it, I'd feel more guilty about what my brothers would go through by my death. But I don't want to suffer anymore as a burden because everything and anything I do is never enough. It's not just grades, it's my whole existence. I wish I was born different and be someone who isn't me or not be born at all, I wish I was never born.

This is a very shortened version of how I feel. I don't really have anyone to tell, I don't really have friends and my family is not even an option. I tend to smile alot, especially when I'm nervous, so of I said I'm having mental health issues they would think it's BS. Plus my family is black. 

If I end it, I'm putting myself first so I don't have to suffer but if I stay alive I'm keeping my brothers happy while I suffer in silence. I was going to end it this week but I freaked out, thinking about how this would affect my brothers life's.

I scored **54** in this year’s GATE with very little preparation, so I know I have potential. I have a plan, and it will take me **3–5 years** to achieve real success.

Indian audiences may relate. For others, UPSC is a prestigious exam to get into Indian civil services. IIT is top technical institute of the country and GATE is the exam to get into an IIT.

**But I am too old for this!** I need to get settled **ASAP**! My parents are pressuring me to join our family business—it’s a daily drama. Sure, it may be great, but I don’t want to live that typical, well-settled life.

What the fuck is wrong if I **don’t** want to get married by 30, have a kid by 32, and spend the next **30–40 years** living a life I don’t even want?

I’m so done with this that I just want to blow my brains out! Hopefully, then I won’t have to make any more decisions. If only I had some **certain, painless** way to leave. But neither is there **freedom to live** nor the **freedom to die**.",What do I do if I don't want to follow the expectations of marriage and settling down by a certain age?,"The individual is a 29-year-old male computer engineer who has faced significant challenges in recent years. He devoted a considerable amount of time preparing for the UPSC exam, which is a prestigious examination for entry into Indian civil services, but was unsuccessful in passing it.

Despite scoring 54 in the recent GATE exam with minimal preparation, he is aware of his potential and has developed a plan that he estimates will take 3 to 5 years to achieve success.

I've been contemplating suicide for years and even attempted when i was 12 in 2023 (yes i'm 14- or i'm turning 14 soon enough.) but that didn't work i guess. It got worse this year because my friends have started distancing from me because i've been expressing my weird interests and expressions like that i love danganronpa and question my gender, i have extreme self hatred that just got worse due to the dysphoria i feel and my past is coming back to haunt me.

in october 2024 i stabbed my ex in the face with a pencil and it left scars, but the pain he felt from that couldn't even come close to the emotional pain he gave me.

2025-02-27 18:26:30,1izmohn,I can’t fucking take this pain anymore.,"My best friend who I’ve been friends with for years stabbed me in the back. It’s a longer story, please take your time to read. I’m M14 if that helps. So in 5th grade, I met my best friend, let’s call him K. K was introverted and didn’t really have friends. But I thought he was a chill and nice guy, so I befriended him. We got best friends and met up really often and just talked about everything. Our friendship was really strong and we talked with eachother if we had a problem. Then, we came into 7th grade. At the beginning of 7th grade, mental problems came into my life. At that time, I had some friends, but never really close friends besides K. So, when the mental problems got worse, I got into the mental hospital and stayed there for 5 months. My other friends turned their back and didn’t talk to me while I was there, but K held the contact. I’m still thankful for that. After I got out, I thanked him very often and invited him to a theme park. We had a good time there, but anyways. Let’s fast forward to 8th grade, around December ‘24. We talked a bit and suddenly, he asked me if I had a crush on someone from the class. I told him the truth and told him that I had a HUGE crush on a girl, let’s call her E. He told me „aight“ and said that he had a crush on another girl, but she’s not important for the story, so she doesn’t have a nickname. I knew that he had a crush on this girl for like 2 years, so it wasn’t a big suprise. 4 weeks later, we meet up. What does he tell me? That he has a crush on E. I was perplexed, so I just answered casual, like „ alright, cool“. I don’t even know why. I should’ve confronted him. He knew exactly that I had a crush on her and still said that he had a crush on her and -even better- that he’ll meet up with her two days later. I couldn’t believe it, but acted cool. So they met up (I was on vacation at that time) and he called me and told me how it was. Oh, btw, I forgot that, when we met up two days before, he asked MY MOM how to act around E. That mf. Anyways, he called me and it sounded „aight“. Not really bad, but not very promising either. We met up as soon as I got back and he told me that he asked her if they could meet up again, but she’s said that she doesn’t have ANY TIME, which is obv a bad sign. I still had a huge crush on her. And idk if you know what I mean by huge crush. I mean, I wrote multiple short stories including her and 16 poems about her. Just so you know what I mean by huge crush. I got closer to her, we texted a bit, I invited her to my bday, she didn’t have time. So a few weeks later, I thought „It’ll kill mr if I don’t know what she thinks about me, so I’ll ask“ yeah, bad decision. I invited her to a coffee ALONE, but she rejected and said that she isn’t interested in me (she wrote it way nicer and wrote half a novel, but that was the main message). Alright, I thought, I’ll get over it. Nope. Still thinking about her. My friend is distancing himself from me very fast. My current friends are stupid and childish. They are good to have fun with, but not to talk about my feelings or serious things. K doesn’t talk to anymore, and if he does, it’s just a hi (only if I say hi first btw) he’s such a simp. He only talks to her or friends he knows since half a year. Who befriended him when nobody was there for him, huh? You’re right. Me. He doesn’t talk to me. He sent me pictures of a „Karneval“ (German tradition) party. He was there with E, her friends and some other friends I only know from sight. And no, that wasn’t a private house party, it was an open festival. And he never invited me. He never asked me if I had time. He never even mentioned it. And that’s where I am now. I’m thinking if he would even care if I just killed myself. Probably not. He only has eyes for the girl. Plus, he only sees her outside. He even told me. Plus plus, she’s not interested in him. When E rejected me, I asked what she thinks about K and she answered that she’s not interested in him. So his simping doesn’t help anybody. Atp, I’ll just commit suicide. Nobody I care about cares about me. Not E, not K. Nobody. I have no one to talk to.",I'm feeling like nobody cares about me and I'm thinking about suicide.

I got a concussion yesterday because I got broken up with by the only person who ever tried for me and genuinely loved me and I slammed my head on the hardwood floor. My body is disfigured with SH scars. I hate myself so much. I’m such a screw up. I thought I was doing better and my mood has been up the past month, but my BPD still found a way to covertly trash my relationship under my nose. Every minute of my life is so fucking painful. I hate the fucking monster I share this body with. I would be a good, likable person if I didn’t split. That’s why people love me at first and then abandon me once they see the monster for the first time. What is there to live for if I’m supposed to live a life where everyone constantly abandons me for the disorder that causes me to fear abandonment? How come only the people whose worst fear is abandonment, get abandoned regularly? This disorder is a cruel joke. 

Not only that, but I think killing myself knowing my case will never get better is an ethical decision. I am a rare case that cannot be rehabilitated ever. All I do is cause trauma and suffering and fear. It would be the first genuinely good thing I’ve ever done for this world.

I envy the people in Canada who will have access to MAID for BPD soon. I’m stuck in the US where they want workers—oops I mean living citizens. So the idea of us being allowed to die is making the billionaires who run everything quake in their boots. I don’t want to die painfully and violently. I just want to be put to sleep in a safe, peaceful environment with the 2 people who somehow still like me after 3 years present to help support me through death.",What is there to live for when I feel like my disorder causes everyone to abandon me?,"The individual in this Reddit post is experiencing significant mental health challenges, specifically related to Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). They express feelings of self-hatred and instability in their relationships, indicating that they struggle to maintain connections with others due to their disorder. The person has a history of self-harm, as evidenced by disfigurement from self-inflicted scars.

They mention an inability to work full-time, implying potential challenges in their employment history. Additionally, the individual feels that the impact of generational trauma has affected their life, leading them to believe they are undesirable and unable to have children.

They recently suffered a concussion after a breakup with a partner who showed love and support, highlighting a significant event in their personal life that has contributed to their current emotional crisis. Despite experiencing a somewhat improved mood in the past month, they still feel that their BPD leads to repeated patterns of abandonment. 

The individual's perspective reflects a deep sense of despair, as they feel trapped in a cycle of trauma and believe that they cannot be rehabilitated, which contributes to their ongoing psychological distress. They articulate feelings of envy towards those who may have more supportive end-of-life options available to them, showcasing their desire for a compassionate resolution to their suffering.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1izmnjd/i_wish_i_could_be_euthanized_for_bpd/,SuicideWatch

I have been fighting my depressions for a few years now and things finally seemed to go my way: I finally started HRT, I started opening up about my problems and would regularly talk to a psychologist, I even found a person that would date me (which would have been my first relationship). 

However it all was too much and I broke down, starting yesterday: I severed most connections to my friends, I told the person I was dating that I need time and don't want to hurt him with my problems, basically breaking up (now he himself is thinking about suicide, which I knew would happen) and I even started, or at least tried, cutting myself for the first time and also held a knife to my throat. 

What I did today wasn't any better: I quit my Job by deleting everything I have ever worked on and deciding to just not come anymore, I pushed away the last friends I had, after hurting them with my problems (I even sent someone a picture of me trying to hurt myself) and although I talked with my psychologist today and he offered me a solution (going to something like a psych ward, which would definitely help me), I'm too afraid to go there and I'm currently just waiting for my parents to die so I can off myself.

TL;DR: My depression got the better of me, I have no friends anymore and even though I know the solution, I'm too scared to take it and don't know what to do anymore.",What should I do if I'm too scared to seek help even though I know it might be the solution for my depression?,"The individual in the Reddit post has been struggling with depression for several years. They recently made some positive strides in their life, including starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and regularly consulting with a psychologist. They also experienced a significant moment by entering into what would be their first romantic relationship. However, they felt overwhelmed by these developments, leading to a breakdown in their social connections.

The person has a history of pushing friends away and has recently broken up with their partner to avoid causing harm due to their own problems. This decision appears to be linked to concerns about their partner's wellbeing, as that individual began to contemplate suicide in response to the situation.

In terms of their work history, the individual quit their job abruptly, deleting past work and deciding not to return. Their actions culminated in self-destructive behaviors, including self-harm and expressing a desire to end their life.

The person's background suggests they are dealing with significant emotional distress, compounded by feelings of isolation and fear about seeking further help, despite having access to professional support.

I’ve felt suicidal on some occasions in my life and have half assed attempted a few times before but this is my first time seriously posting here, im a college student with a horrible gambling and alcohol addiction and last night was the biggest loss I’ve ever seen
I had just over a thousand dollars in my student checking account, which was all I had to my name, and I managed to blow it all away last night on online blackjack on stake. I went from turning that 1k into 5k in blackjack after drinking a liter of whiskey, and then into -500$ in my bank account. I don’t really know where else to turn to, this is the lowest point of my life. If my Dad finds out about my gambling and alcohol addiction, he would most likely not help me pay for my tuition. I’m supposed to be transferring to one of the university of California schools this fall and I’m in the spring semester of this school year so going to rehab would put a massive halt in my plans for the future. The gambling addiction rears its head around every 2 or 3 months, and I end up losing a lot of money in a large binge, and my drinking addiction is more of an everyday thing, I drink anywhere from 8-12 drinks a day and usually 70 drinks a week. I went to the doctor for the first time in 5 years and my blood test results indicate some kind of liver disease like fatty liver.

 I don't have a strong rope so i just used to tie a couple of belts to a beam across my bedroom's ceiling. I tested that they could hold weight and they always did.
I used to put my neck in and balance some of my weight on it, by dangling a leg from the chair i was on, and every time i did it for a bit longer, to try and find the courage to finally jump off.
Every time i held back, it hurt so much, it felt like my head was going to blow up, even from just shifting half of my weight on my neck for about 10 seconds.

Last month, i don't know why or what changed, but i actually did it. The only problem was that  in the heat of the moment (though i felt pretty calm) i grabbed a different belt from the ones i usually used, one that was a bit thinner and  filmsy.
So this time i jumped, kicked the stool, and i felt nothing, no regret, no life flashing before my eyes, i just felt calm, and a bit sad.
I closed my eyes and after just a couple of seconds i founds myself on the floor, i don't even remember falling, it was like i had already given up and my brain was turning off.
Once on the floor i laughed like a maniac while coughing and then went on with my evening like nothing happened.

Thinking back to it now, it feels so weird that i was that close to actually making it, that if i just had been a bit more careful i would've been gone now, it's that easy, yet i'm still here wishing it could've gone different, like everything else in my life.

Since then i've only gotten worse,yet i don't feel changed by that experience. I started self harming again and eating way less, but i don't know if i have the strenght to try hanging myself again, i just wish i'd die in my sleep.

Every day I would wake up and think that something bad was going to happen and that would finally be my final push. 

Finally, last night before going to bed, I took 12 pills (wasn't going to kill myself, I was just tired of that shit). 
In conclusion, I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't go back to sleep, most likely I have restless legs. 

Can't share this with anyone, I've even stopped going to my psychologist. Please advise me how to calm down, I want to sleep.


Anyway, I feel okay, except for the anxiety after that moment and not going to do anything like that in the near time.",How can I calm down and help myself sleep better?,"The individual in the Reddit post is experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts, which have led to significant discomfort in their life.

2025-02-27 17:27:24,1izl8wv,I wanna reach out… but im scared,"I(14m) have already attempted twice amd failed both times. Ive been thinking of attempting again recently but the thing is i dont really wanna do this. I wanna get better, i really do. But its so fucking hard and scary to talk to someone. I cant tell my ‘friends’ because ill get laughed at and they’ll even use that against me to make fun of me. I cant tell my siblings because theyre too young to deal with stuff like that. That only leave my mom which im scared to tell because many outcomes can be bad. She could blame herself, say im lying and doing it for attention or just send me to a hospital or smthng. Im acc scared to be like this. I always randomly get mad at my life and try to attempt. And its so fucking scary how it can happen on impulse.

2025-02-27 17:25:21,1izl72j,"If I don't get a 2:1 by the end of this year, I will hurt myself really bad.","TW: Self-harm 

I'm sick of choosing compassion all the fucking time. I chose to be nice to myself for the last 2 years and it has not been doing me any good. I am too lenient. I am too nice. I need to be harsher, so that I understand and acknowledge how hard my parents are working to give me these luxuries and opportunities that many would die for. 

If I don't get a job by the end of uni, what point is there to even be alive. I have wasted so much of my parent's resources that it might just be better off if I wasn't concieved at all. I am a sum of my achievements and my achievements sum to nothing. I am in university. I am not even REMOTELY CAPABLE OF being close to anyone in the cohort. If I had my work ethic back in my GCSEs, I would have at least achieved a 2:1.

All my friends are so much better than me, I can never aspire to be as good as my friends. NEVER. I am so arrogant that I VIEWED THEM AS MY EQUALS, when they are 2 miles ahead of me. I'm closer to middle school than I am to them. I don't deserve to be their friend, I don't give them anything. I don't deserve to leech off of them anymore than I should. My friends are too nice to me, I don't deserve it, they're better off finding friends that can actually help them. 

  
My family are better off not raising me in the first place, because I'm just burning their money, and not bringing results back to them. They invested so much in me, but that is all going down the drain. I don't appreciate them enough for their sacrifices. They gave everything to provide me an opportunity that many others desire but cannot achieve. I love them so much, but I don't deserve their un-conditional love. I don't want to be the under-achiever in a family of over-achievers. 

My trauma is correct, I am worthless.

 So on the bright side, I have one last chance. I need to prove to myself that I should fight on. I want to look 5 months later and realise that I am worthy, because I am not right now, and there's only a couple months to change it.
