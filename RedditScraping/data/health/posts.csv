1j4qhhe,I met this girl and now i’m “different”,"About a year ago, I met a girl. She was wild, exciting—something different. I thought she was the best thing that had ever happened to me. But now, looking back, I see she was the worst.

She pulled me into her world, one I had no business being in. It started small, just trying things here and there. But before I knew it, I was in deep. Drugs became a regular thing, and I lost track of who I was. I stopped caring about myself, about my future. I let everything fall apart around me because, in the moment, nothing else mattered.

Now, I hate myself for what I’ve become. I look in the mirror and don’t recognize the person staring back. I’ve burned bridges, lost opportunities, and let myself slip into a place I never thought I’d be. My outlook on life is shattered, and I don’t know how to fix it.

I want to believe it’s not too late. That there’s still a way out. But I don’t know where to start. I feel trapped, stuck in a cycle I can’t break.

1j4qcri,No freinds,"Ever since I’ve been a kid, I’ve been the weird one. Elementary school, middle school, high school. I’ve only had one real friend in elementary school up to the 3rd grade, then had to change schools. After that no one else. Throughout elementary school I was by myself, I had a small group but they were really just jerks to me, middle school was no different, labeled as the weird kid for doing nothing… All of middle school I didn’t hang out with anyone outside of school hours. I truly had no friends. Then covid hit and I was homeschooled for 1 year. Thats when I decided to “change.” Stopped being “weird” and just kinda boxed it away. Went into high school with different expectations and was wishing for friends, freshmen year, I met a lot of people, but never got to hang out with anyone outside of school. Started to get called an “NPC.” I tried so hard to be normal and actually do stuff. Guess it wasn’t enough. Sophomore year was a better year, started to be “Normal” and people told me how I used to be “weird” a couple years back. I was thinking of getting an actual friend and being part of a friend group, but nope, just started to call me boring then left me out of basic things, I was already hanging out with other people but they always left me out of stuff and pull up an excuse not to hang out with me. Currently a junior and I still haven’t even been in an actual friendship, I’ve in total hung out once with someone in my whole life. Crying to sleep has happened before and most likely will happen again, it just gut wrenching. I’m a dude, shouldn’t be doing that but here I am, haven’t even experienced a real friendship for 9 years☹️. I’ve been in so many clubs, jobs, social gatherings, nothing.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, they were homeschooled for a year, which inspired a desire to change and fit in better when they returned to high school.

1j4pkb6,I can’t feel happy,"I know I should be grateful for the good things in my life, but I can’t seem to feel happy anymore. I go through the motions—enjoying things, laughing, and getting through the day—but I’ve never felt truly satisfied. I was overweight for most of my childhood and teenage years, and I still don’t like my body. I’ve lost a lot of weight and got into better shape, but the stretch marks and loose skin make me feel insecure.

I grew up feeling like no one really cared about me. My mom lost my older brother when he was young, and it had a huge impact on me. She would always tell me how much he loved me, but I never felt like I received that kind of love from her. My dad was always distant, focused on providing for our family, and my mom was preoccupied with my younger siblings. I grew up feeling alone and unattractive. My mom gave me a lot of freedom, and I ended up eating my emotions.

The one thing that kept me grounded was school. I loved learning, and it eventually led me to become a scientist, which is something I’m passionate about. Six years ago, I met my husband. He wasn’t very affectionate, but we had a connection. His family is broken. His mother feels so unattractive that she refuses to take pictures, and her husband is always criticizing her appearance. It’s painful to hear, and I hate it. My husband doesn’t say much to me, but I feel judged by my in-laws and insecure about myself.

We recently had a baby, and I gained a lot of weight. My insecurities have only gotten worse, but I don’t have the energy to exercise or follow a diet because I’m constantly juggling work and caring for my baby. I eat whatever I can when I get the chance. I’m exhausted. My husband is also struggling, and he often says hurtful things or responds to everything with a frustrated tone. My in-laws are staying with us, and we haven’t had intimacy in over a month. I feel like no one truly cares about me.

I cry all the time and feel guilty for doing so, especially when I look into my baby’s eyes. I feel like I’m failing him, like I should be more grateful for having such a healthy, wonderful baby. But I just feel so sad. The only place I can find peace is at work. I can focus on my tasks, and everything seems okay there. But I feel guilty for preferring work over being at home with my baby.

Sometimes, I feel so overwhelmed and trapped that I even imagine what it would be like if I just disappeared. I was seeing a therapist, but I don’t feel like talking anymore. I don’t want to feel like this. My husband is depressed and says cruel things like that I cry to play the victim or that I should just “suck it up” and put on a happy face for our baby, like he does. I don’t feel loved or supported. I feel like I’m just stuck.",How can I cope with feeling overwhelmed and unsupported while navigating my emotions and responsibilities as a new parent?,"The individual who wrote the Reddit post has a complex background marked by familial challenges, personal struggles with body image, and professional achievements. They were overweight during their childhood and teenage years, leading to insecurities about their body that persist despite significant weight loss. 

Their family life has been heavily influenced by tragedy; their mother lost an older brother at a young age, which affected their relationship. The individual felt a lack of emotional support from their mother, who was preoccupied with younger siblings, leading to feelings of loneliness and unattractiveness. Their father was distant and focused on providing for the family, further contributing to their sense of isolation. 

Education played a crucial role in their life, as school provided a sense of stability and joy. This love for learning eventually propelled them into a career as a scientist. 

In terms of their personal life, they met their husband six years ago, but describe him as not very affectionate. His family dynamics have their own issues, particularly around body image, which resonate painfully with the individual's own insecurities. They have a baby together, and postpartum weight gain has further intensified their feelings of inadequacy.

I’m almost 21 and I feel like I haven’t done much since graduation because of my social anxiety and depression. Getting a job is hard because I suck at interviews like, I physically can’t speak sometimes and my face twitches. I can tell the interviewer thinks I’m weird by their expressions and tone, and then I never hear back from any of them 😭.

I want to get a job to save up and move out, but it feels impossible because of how I am. I still don’t know what I want to do with my life and I’ve thought about school but if I start now, I wouldn’t finish until I’m like 24, and it feels like I’d be so behind. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to keep applying for entry level jobs and feel stuck, but I also don’t want to stay with my parents for 3+ more years, especially since they’re really toxic and abusive and make my mental health worse. I feel like I’ve wasted so much of my youth doing nothing, and I just want to start living, but I don’t know how.

Would it be better to stay and go to school? I’m just embarrassed to start at 21, and I’m worried about how to even get a job afterward because I don’t know how I’d handle the interviews.

1j4p4xi,Fluvoxamine and OCD,"Fluvoxamine SSRi

Hi yall…gonna make it short ive had chronic OCD my whole life. Repetitive racing intrusive thoughts 24/7 and compulsions. 

Benzos just made it worse so i stopped. They only helped the panic that ocd itself brings because its so stressful and awful but its temporary relief and not worth what benzos come with so I told my Dr i was leaving them.

I also have a chronic GI disease and it is linked to lack of serotonin. So i decided to finally give an SSRi a try. 

I started Fluvoxamine 25mg once a day, almost a month ago. 

On week two of that, i went up to 50mg. 

Ive been there since. 
I felt better the first few days on 50mg (thoughts were still there but not as brutal which is a relief and a blessing in itself) and all of a sudden i feel incredibly down and stagnant and the thoughts are almost worsening. 

Not sure if i should stay on 50mg for a few more weeks, in the hope that itll be enough of a a dose and i just simply have to give it time?

Or is it not enough of a dose for OCD and i should just go up to 75mg for a few days, and then to 100mg?
(Id like to not go over 100mg for as long as i can for now) 

Please help. Ive heard and read and been told that im on way too low of a dose for OCD, especially OCD as severe as mine. Would really appreciate feedback from others that have actually gone through it.

Hey everyone,  

I’ve been trying to understand my mental health better and wanted to share something that’s been on my mind.  

Most of the time, I feel happy and content, and sometimes I do get angry. But I never really experience sadness, loneliness, or the urge to cry. It’s like those emotions just don’t exist for me.  

However, I do struggle a lot with forgetting things, paying attention, and maintaining focus. It feels like my mind keeps drifting away, making it hard to concentrate on tasks.  

I’m not sure if this is normal or if it’s something I should be concerned about. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any advice on how to improve focus and attention?

I have no social life basically. I have 3 friends that I talk to atleast on a weekly basis, and that's it. Most of my friends i lost after high school, as it goes apparently. Especially people i've known since elementary school, they never wanted to be my friend after high school.

The majority of my day consists of playing video games, watching youtube videos or tv shows. I've been excercising because everyone says it's the fucking cure all for depression apparently. But that's it, besides some other niche interests. I have no outgoing interests really, which I feel like makes me undesirable and boring.

I've never had a relationship in my life, not for a lack of trying though. I tried a couple times with a couple crushes in high school, which ended terribly because I was alot more socially awkward than I am now. Recently I tried talking with one of my friends, friend, and we hung out with her friend, her, and I. Found out they both were toxic as fuck, and left me feeling like shit after they were insulting me constantly.

I'm so god damn lonely, it literally hurts every day. Like I feel it in my chest. I see people happy in real life, in tv shows, in movies, and it just makes me depressed and resent them for having what I don't.

I went to bartending school to train to be a bartender and I applied to over 25 restaurants and bars in a 25 minute radius. 1 restaurant gave me an interview. One fucking restaurant.

1j4ojqz,Advice on how to not feel like an embarrassment,"Hello everyone !!

For the longest time, I have always felt bad about myself. That no matter what I do, I end up making the wrong decision and failing as a person. I question my intelligence, my character and my confidence continues to deteriorate. 

Every time I speak or casually talking to a coworker or stranger, I immediately notice their reaction to my commentary (facial expressions, responses, body language) and I wonder things like:

“Did I say something weird?”
“Did whatever I just say make me look stupid?”
“Omg why did I say that, this is why you don’t talk to people”
“Did I say something offensive without knowing?”

Sometimes I get awkward when I don’t know how to respond to someone. If I am in a group setting, I often don’t talk because I am afraid of judgement or saying the wrong thing and having everyone look at me in awkward silence. 

And it makes me feel…embarrassed. I am not sure if that is the correct word I am looking for, but its somewhere along the lines of: stupid, weird, cringe and probably more that I can’t think of at the top of my head.

A bit more on my background: I am not school smart. Math, science, any subject where it is deemed more intellectual and useful to society, I am not. I am an artist, I like history (when its interesting) and I find enjoyment in my own bubble. I often compared myself to a lot of the “smarter” people at my school and even my own siblings. My younger brother is incredibly smart and athletic. He works hard in everything he does, spending his days off in the library studying, waking up at 4am to workout and anything that I cannot do. My younger sister is following in his footsteps and going to the same private school as he is. Shes involved in anything and everything(clubs, sports)shes also very pretty.

I am stuck in community college still unsure of what I wanna do. I skipped last quarter and haven’t applied for this coming quarter. My social anxiety gets in the way of a lot of stuff which makes it hard for me to make friends.

In short, I wanna overcome this. But how? I am not in a position to afford a therapist, so here I am talking to a screen hoping I find the answer I am looking for. I appreciate anything that could help, my mental health is not doing so well with this.

1j4ohb0,My childhood best friend told me my health problems are my fault.,"Hi i'm a 20f and ive been friends with this girl since we were in the fourth grade. She was basically family growing up, we have had a lot of problems with how she and her family have treated me. we have tried to work through things.

I'm currently in the lowest mental state I have ever been in my life i'm really struggling, I hadn't really opened up to any of my friends and I decided I was going to share a little bit with her. A couple days later I get a long text message she said pretty much said my poor mental space is my fault i allowed it to take over me and I'm not doing enough to get better. I sobbed while reading the entire thing I have been trying so hard, i'm currently seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. She said she doesn't want to hear me talk about it unless I have a plan of action, it's not about if you tried but I need to try harder.
She only wants to surround herself with people who have a life and want to grow. I was really bothered by this text message I felt like it was extremely rude.

The next day she calls me up and begs me to leave the house and go on a walk with her (l've been dealing with panic attacks so I haven't wanted to do much) we went back and forth for 40 mins almost like she could care less what I was saying and she was kind of laughing about it.

1j4obfw,What should I be looking out for if I suspect my child might be self-harming?,"My daughter is 12 and last year she caught a couple of her friends self-harming at school. She told the teacher in what was supposed to be an anonymous note. 

The principal called the whole class to the gym and basically outed my daughter for informing the teacher. 

Because of this her best friend got pulled out of school and they no longer get to talk or see each other.

She has had a suspicious number of “accidental”cuts or scratches on her in a suspiciously short amount of time. 

Granted she is adhd and with that comes a lack of spatial awareness about her body. I understand because I suffer from that too and am constantly cutting corners too short and hitting them with my shoulder, stuff like that.

Considering she immediately sought grownup help for her friends despite the consequences to her, I figured she wasn’t the “type” to self harm. But what do I know?

I don’t think she’s been under any extra stress lately. No friend drama, all A’s, excelling in extracurriculars. I asked her if her plate was too full and she said she likes the activities and doesn’t feel overburden.

Sorry, if I’ve included too many details. I just don’t know what to be watching for. Should I just take her at her word that a cut on her leg is from what she says it was from? What should I be doing to make sure she isn’t self-harming? Should I ask her? Should I avoid the subject?

Last year when her friends were doing it, I told her if she ever felt the compulsion to do something like that she could come to me with a code word and we’d do something together instead, like go for a bike ride, a movie. Hell I told her if she needs a mental health day I have no problem keeping her home from school, that I’d make up a reason so that she wouldn’t have to answer any questions from her dad (he’s less understanding) and I’d take the blame or fallout and make sure she had a note for school.

I don’t want her to self harm and I feel like she might be dipping her toe in that water. 

ANY ADVICE is appreciated!!!!

Edit for clarification: when I said “she has had a suspicious number of accidental… I am referring to my daughter, not her friend. The way I phrased it wasn’t clear. Apologies.",What should I be doing to make sure my daughter isn’t self-harming?

The parent expresses concern about the daughter's recent injuries and worries about the possibility of self-harm, seeking advice on how to address the situation appropriately.

1j4o0hw,I don't know what's going on with me and it's so frustrating,"My mood has been never constant in these few months, and mostly it's always full of guilt and shame about myself. 
I might have to give a background first so here it is-- 
I'm currently 18, a student, I was always a sincere and a disciplined student and got good grades throughout, but it's been changing now. 
I've always been an anxious person, but the anxiety I feel now is too much for me, theres panic attacks more frequently and quite a lot of crying comes with it. 
So I passed out my highschool and I decided to give an year for preparation of an entrance exam, it was going very smoothly during the start, but it started to crumble down later on. I chose to prepare online, that made me cut off all my connections with most of my friends, basically made me a bit isolated, I had my family of course. 
Everything had gotten overwhelming for me slowly, but I tried to push through. But now I don't feel like working at all, I'm trying to avoid it like anything, I feel like I'm being lazy and it's so pathetic but I'm not that kind of a person who is lazy at all. I've watched countless videos on how to be more productive, disciplined, etc thinking that I'm not disciplined enough, but something tells me that's not it.  I sleep too much sometimes and get random headaches. I know I have the potential to do it but I just can't and it's so frustrating. Whats more frustrating is that I don't understand what's wrong. Even as I write this I feel like I'm exaggerating and trying to pretend like something is wrong so it can become a good excuse for me being lazy, although my family has noticed it too, it's so confusing, forgive me for writing it all in a messy order. I feel like a failure in my own eyes, knowing that I could do it and yet I still couldn't hurts so so much.
P.S.- it's embarassing to say it but I don't wanna hide this, my consumption of pornographic content had increase quite a lot than before during a timespan of 2 months in between, although it's much less now, could that be playing a role in this? 

Why is this happening? Am I just overthinking and making it a big deal than it actually is? Or is it a problem? It would be great if I can get some guidance over this, or any of you guys have gone through it and would like to share please do so..

1j4no1y,I’ve been treating my boyfriend poorly as my depression worsens.,"I have been with my boyfriend for over a year, almost two years now. Me and him have had a fairly good relationship but for the past couple months; i’ve been really rude towards him, saying things such as “i hate you”, “you don’t even really love me”, “you should just break up with me” etc. i’ve said a lot worse and i dont know why. My health has been deteriorating for over a year now and its slowly getting worse, I’m only nineteen and I’ve already had three surgeries due to stomach issues, and now I have an appointment coming up for possibly heart issues. The reason why my health is mostly deteriorating is since i’ve had an eating disorder since i was twelve but didn’t get so bad until I met him when I was fifteen. I don’t want to blame him for it, but he definitely played a role as he’s compared me many times to other women who obviously look a lot better than me. 

I’ve always struggled with my image and he knew that… He ended up changing and doing a lot better but I can’t help but only notice that, which also plays a role in my behavior. I genuinely used to be so sweet towards him and would do anything for him. — My depression is getting worse, my anxiety is through the roof, especially with schooling and he won’t get off my back and he continuously upsets me.

I’ve always been someone who’s avoidant with my issues and let them bottle up until it all comes crashing down and I hurt someone I love. I’ve talked to my therapist about it, she never helps. Just say’s “A higher dose of meds will help you out!” (which obviously doesn’t). I don’t want to break up with my boyfriend, I dont want to lose him because we practically grew up together and he’s my best friend.. But I don’t know what to do and whenever I try to talk to him he just points fingers instead of wanting to talk it out? I don’t understand it at all. Which is why I quit communicating, I just instantly get defensive and start saying cruel things to upset him.. It doesn’t feel good to me, and I sure know it doesn’t feel good for him. Which is why I don’t know why it happens… I just lash out and this has never happened with anyone. 

I really don’t want to lose him, because he’s said if we break up he’s not staying my friend and letting me work stuff out before we get back together.. I don’t know, one minute I’m all over him and the next,,, I hate him and just want him to get away from me.

1j4mncm,"Anxiety, Depression & DPDR after antibiotics","I'm a young male adult and about 2 months ago took a 7 day round (3 pills a day) of the antibiotic Clindamycin. I have taken this one several times in the last year or two. Day 6 of 7 I started to feel ""off"", I became more forgetful, started to feel sad for no reason, no real obvious symptoms of anxiety yet.
Fast forward to roughly 1 month after taking it, I started to feel increasingly depressed and began feeling disassociated.

The feeling of everything being a dream got much worse and just last week, I felt extremely depressed and anxious. I felt impeding doom, felt like I was losing my mind, horrible intrusive thoughts, time felt so distorted and slowed down, the dream feeling was so intense and I was questioning reality. It ultimately led to a severe panic attack one night.

Mind you, no real issue with anxiety or depression prior to this. I refuse to take SSRIs or anti-anxiety pills so I started researching ways to help what I was experiencing and came across a mix of Magnesium glycinate, taurate and malate. I am on day 3-4 of taking this twice a day and l'd say my symptoms are 70% gone with continuous improvement. 

My question is, could it be that the antibiotic wiped out my gut microbiome? I've seen some others say they experienced a similar thing with antibiotics. This is very out of the ordinary for me and I feel like I was at the lowest point in my life just days ago. I'm almost weirded out by how calm and clear everything is all of a sudden again. Should I start taking probiotics as well now? This whole thing really threw me off.

1j4lvr8,I have no friends,"Since 3 years ago my 2 medical issues made it almost impossible for me to go to school so I have been doing homeschooling. Every day is the same and I just stay inside all the time. When I was in 6th grade I feel like the pandemic kinda affected me so I had like no friends and would sit alone for lunch everyday. For 7th grade it was ok there was some people I could casually talk to but still had no friends and I felt so left out. After 3 months of 7th grade my second health issue forced me to go on homeschooling. I haven't even socialized in such a long time. This year I was sure that I was gonna be able to go to in-person school so I ended up going and for the first day it was good but then after no one wanted to talk to me and I felt really alone. Everyone went on their phone and stuck with their old friends. I would try my best to make small talk with people but no one wanted to talk to me. I thought it was going to be different but nothing changed. I try to contact people from my school online but everyone would be dry and some people would even leave me on read. Is it that hard to talk to someone? I don't even get the online thing either, it's not like people can't call each other and text like normally (even if it's not better than hanging out irl). Idk what to do anymore I feel rlly depressed and I started hating other people instead. I notice whenever I go in public I get really negative and judgmental thoughts of people. I always think that others are stuck up or fake now. There's over 1,000 people in my school how is there not even one person who is friends with me? One time when I was in class there was a group of friends near me taking loudly and I got so mad that I almost ended up walking up to them and yelling at them to be quiet. Another time I was on a mini class field trip and everyone went to their friends and I of course was along. There was a group of girls I used to talk to in middle school but now they completely ignored me. There was one new girl that joined their group who I actually got into a fight with before and I couldn't believe it. I felt so disappointed, lonely and mad and I was just sitting by myself the whole time looking at them.

They experienced social isolation during their schooling, starting in 6th grade, where they felt the pandemic significantly affected their ability to make friends, resulting in loneliness during lunch. While their 7th grade was somewhat better with casual interactions, they still lacked close friendships. After three months of 7th grade, their second health issue forced them to continue with homeschooling, leading to further social isolation.

This year, they attempted to return to in-person schooling but felt alone when others chose to engage with their established friend groups rather than include them. Despite their efforts to initiate conversations, they were met with indifference, often feeling ignored or dismissed.

Over the course of 6 weeks I took Wellbutrin and lexapro and every two weeks dropped 5mg down on the lexapro . 


(So down to 15, down to 10, down to 5, and then off.)

Once I was off lexapro for about a week and only on Wellbutrin things started to fall apart. I started being anxious and having panic attacks and being angry and irrational all the time and even though I know I’m being irrational I can’t control it and I feel crazy and out of control all the time. Then she had me go up to 300 mg of Wellbutrin but still nothing has improved. Now we’re trying vyvanse to see if it’s add related? I feel depressed and disconnected I hardly feel joy or drive. Did the SSRI screw up my brain? I don’t want to go on it again but I’m so miserable and don’t want to feel this way anymore. I’m either sad, angry, anxious, or depressed all the time. It was never THIS bad before I went on something. What is going on has anyone else experienced this and had any luck turning things around. I’m going crazy and I honestly don’t even want to go on the vyvanse cause now I’m just terrified that I’m fucked up forever and I don’t want to fuck myself up more. ","Did the SSRI screw up my brain, and what can I do to improve my current mental state?","The individual in the Reddit post has experienced a significant history of depression, which led them to seek medical treatment. Initially, they were prescribed Wellbutrin, which they found to be beneficial. However, upon becoming pregnant, their doctor advised them to discontinue Wellbutrin and switch to lexapro. Although lexapro was somewhat effective, the individual noted a complete loss of sex drive as a negative side effect and felt they performed better on Wellbutrin.

After giving birth and breastfeeding, they requested to return to Wellbutrin. The individual describes a gradual reduction in lexapro dosage over six weeks until they were completely off it. Following this, they encountered a resurgence of anxiety, panic attacks, and feelings of anger and irrationality. Despite increasing the Wellbutrin dosage to 300 mg, there was no improvement, and the doctor is now exploring the possibility of ADD with a trial of vyvanse.

Everyone is growing sick and tired of me because of my “outburst” and my “whininess” (depression, Audhd). I can’t share my feelings to these people as they always weaponize and make fun of me, especially my parents. Can count on my fingers how many times I have left the house in the last 6 months. I just feel like a massive failure and my self esteem is so low and I’m so insecure I have been lashing out in every comment section just to vent. Can’t pass my classes, can’t find a job willing to hire me, can’t improve on a skill.
I am growing more and more angry by the day, where sometimes I randomly grow into an anger spiral so violent I hurt myself in the process. I would slam my hand into the door, bang on my mattress violently, throw rocks, throw my books aggressively on the floor etc. I had bent a few fingernails, burnt my hand, bruised my hands and sprained a toe because of it. I am a grown woman and these make me feel like a tantruming toddler. I can’t seem to control it and nothing can do to calm me down because of how angry I am at the moment. Worst, I refuse to let anyone help me because my parents are not great at being emotionally available (actively mocked my sobbing outbursts in the past). They even joke about how I secretly want to kill them.
This is just an ever growing spiral and nothing I can do to help myself right now because I am stuck with miserable people.

I was adopted by a family that didn’t understand the trauma I had experienced. When I was seven, I went through an earthquake, and it was really hard for me to process everything. I would lash out because I didn’t know how to handle my emotions, and instead of recognizing that I needed help—or even just a hug—my parents labeled me as the “problem child.”

All my life, I was raised to be the scapegoat. My mom, who was my biggest bully, turned everyone against me, including my siblings. I felt like I had nowhere to turn. I was kicked out at 17, and it’s been really hard ever since.

Last year, my mom passed away from cancer. What hurt the most was that she didn’t even want to see me at the end—I never got to say goodbye. I went to her funeral hoping that maybe, now that she was gone, I could reconnect with my siblings. But the opposite happened.

Now, I’m dealing with a lot of pain. I lost my job, the job market is awful, and I don’t know what else to do.

I've scratched myself, dug a toothpick into my skin and dragged it through, and bit myself. I decided to finally post something because I had an argument while cooking today and thought about using the knife in my hand to cut myself. I'm extremely distraught.

I have no friends, no motivation, I feel like I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love and when I do meet people or “have friends” there’s no real human connection I have with them it, and it makes me feel inhuman.

On top of that, I’ve experienced years of emotional abuse from my mom, starting when I was a child. She’s blamed me for things that were out of my control, even saying I ruined her life and was responsible for her miscarriage. She wouldn’t let me cry around her and would slap me if I did. This has left me with deep emotional scars.

There’s something I did when I was very young that I feel is unforgivable. I realized what it was when I was about 7 or 8, and ever since then, I’ve believed I was evil and that I deserve the worst. That thought has haunted me for years, and it’s made me feel like I’ll never be okay. There’s so much more horrible shit going on too that i don’t really feel getting into, I feel so overwhelmed.

I haven’t been happy in a long time, and I don’t even enjoy the things I used to love, like video games and anime. Sometimes, I wish I were dead—not because I want to die, but because I feel like everything is too fucked up to fix. I just want the pain to stop. I feel sick thinking about how much I’m carrying.

1j4oxus,"Been feeling suicidal, but won't do it. Need to vent.","So, here's the thing. I (28/9 FTM) struggle with GAD and major depression for a very long time. GAD was diagnosed when I was 5 and major depression officially 14, but more than 3 therapists said I struggled with it a lot earlier, like 7/8 yo. Because of some trauma and how my behaviour would be described by my parents. Later (around 15) I developed PTSD, which came to actually be C-PTSD, and I also have Borderline Personality Disorder. And couldn't leave ADHD out, of course. My first attempt at taking my own life was at my 13, then it became almost a yearly ritual. 

Past 2 years I progressed a lot in therapy and my meds are keeping me at a stable level. 

However... I am so tired. I'm so tired of feeling alone, of not being able to call people from my support network because I feel like a dead weight.... I'm tired of being used as example of ""surviving and overcoming depression"". I'm just tired. My favorite person betrayed me. My network isn't always there. I'm tired of calling paramedics during a breakdown. I'm tired of not being able to enjoy life. 

I wish I could die without causing pain to my family - the only thing I have to keep me breathing. But I am barely managing to do it. ",How can I cope with feeling tired and alone despite making progress in therapy?,"The individual is a 28/29-year-old assigned female at birth who has struggled with several mental health issues for an extended period. They have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) since the age of 5 and major depression at 14, although therapists suggested they showed signs of depression as early as 7 or 8 years old. They developed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) around the age of 15, which was later identified as Complex PTSD (C-PTSD), and they also have Borderline Personality Disorder and ADHD. Their first suicide attempt occurred at the age of 13, and they reported that such attempts became a near-annual occurrence.

In the past two years, they have made significant progress in therapy, and their medication has helped maintain a stable level of functioning. However, they express feeling exhausted from a sense of isolation, the burden of feeling like a dead weight to their support network, and the pressure of being viewed as a success story in overcoming depression.

1j4owbl,Suicide,"So im 21 I’m a dropout, I decided to drop out my last year of school because I was at a private school originally then my senior year I skipped class once and got expelled the next day. Keep in mind I never got in trouble once before this besides a detention for being late to class my freshman year. The real reason I was expelled is because the dean of discipline raised a troubled white kid years before this troubled white kid ended up owning a business that I ended up actually getting my hands on my senior year (He went to prison for fraud I was gonna turn the place into a detail shop) while getting the place ready before I opened couple people passed by and told me it’s so funny me a Arab ended up with the place because he used to post about how much he hated Arabs on social media. Sometime my senior year I was talking to the Dean of discipline and told him what I’m doing and when he found out that I now owned this other guys building I guess he set out to expell me first chance he could. He’s probably the reason the other guy hated Arabs as that shits usually taught though not always. Anyways I got expelled transferred to a new school they made it super hard to graduate for me so I gave up atp as this whole situation really really discouraged me. Flash forward that business fell through. I worked as a employee at some other places now I have been able to open up another business. The current business I run is a nightmare I don’t see it going absolutely anywhere it truly seems like I’ll be stuck with this until I’m dead. I don’t wanna say what I own as it is very niche and I might give myself away but I constantly get threatened at this place every employee I’ve had takes complete advantage of my kindness and if I ever try to put my foot down they just quit or threaten to quit and I literally can’t run the place on my own it’s impossible. I feel so stuck right now I genuinely don’t know what to do all my “friends” have turned into actual pieces of shit. They are horrible to women and just a genuine problem for the general public as they have no respect for anyone or anything. I no longer want to be around them so I’m now constantly alone. I play video games to try and help with the boredom on my free time but even when I play video games shit sucks. I suck. The people are always rude I try to be nice to everyone but constantly get shit on. So I really don’t have anything to look forward too. The only real thing I enjoy doing is riding my motorcycle but everyone says I’m gonna die on it so I’m starting to think that should be the way I go. I’m to pussy to pull the trigger on myself I feel like I should just go on a death ride at 3am when the roads clear and just crash myself into a wall at 190. I just want the pain to end tbh ive had suicidal thoughts since i was very little ive always hoped things will get better after I graduate from school but that didn’t even happen and now shit just seems to be falling apart. I wanna just run away and start a new life but I don’t have any real skills to get a job anywhere else in the world I don’t know any languages other then English I’m scared of everything to be honest I wake up everyday feeling delirious and extremely anxious about what’s gonna happen I literally am late to open my own business everyday because I can’t get off the toilet because I have crazy nervous shits before leaving for work. It’s just a horrible cycle and I don’t know wtf to do. Talking about this on here right now is just making me feel even more helpless I just want to idk man I’m just so hurt by life right now I’m really thinking the motorcycle idea is a good one I’ll at least go out doing the one thing I enjoy doing. And if I really do go through with it and anyone I know somehow find this on my phone just know I’m sorry I don’t mean to cause anyone hurt or pain I just been in pain for far too long the only happy time I had was the honey moon faze of my relationship with it’s pretty obvious and that went to shit as well and I feel like I caused it not her so it’s not her fault infact I’m tortured in my dreams at night with the memory of her and I just want that to end as well it’s been 3 years and I still dream about her almost every night it’s just painful and confusing sorry","I'm feeling overwhelmed and lost in life, struggling with my business and dealing with constant anxiety. I have suicidal thoughts and am unsure of how to cope. What should I do to find a way through this pain?","The individual is 21 years old and has a history of educational struggles, having dropped out in their senior year of high school. Originally attending a private school, they faced expulsion after a single incident of skipping class, despite having previously maintained a clean record with only one detention for tardiness in freshman year. The expulsion appears to have been influenced by the actions of the dean of discipline and a prior incident involving a business owner who harbored prejudiced views against Arabs, which affected their experience.

After transferring to a new school, they found it challenging to graduate and eventually gave up due to discouragement stemming from the entire situation. They have since worked various jobs and attempted to start their own businesses, one of which has since failed, and their current business has become a source of significant stress and feelings of helplessness. The individual describes a difficult work environment where they feel taken advantage of by employees and struggle to manage the business alone.

Their personal life is also impacting their mental health, feeling increasingly isolated from friends they now view negatively, and expressing feelings of boredom and discontent with video gaming as an escape. They have a motorcycle, which they enjoy riding but are also contemplating as a means to end their suffering. They report ongoing suicidal thoughts that have been present since childhood, expressing anxiety about their future and a fear of their current life circumstances. They have limited skills for alternative employment and feel overwhelmed by daily life, including physical symptoms of anxiety that interfere with their responsibilities.","The person is feeling stuck and hopeless due to a series of setbacks, including being expelled from school, struggling with their current business, losing friends, experiencing suicidal thoughts, and dealing with anxiety and depression.",21,male,single,business owner,struggling,"The person is experiencing mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts and extreme anxiety.",high school dropout,The person has a history of suicidal thoughts and experiences extreme anxiety and feelings of helplessness.,yes,hurt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1j4owbl/suicide/,SuicideWatch

Lately it’s been really hard for me not to cut myself, and to be honest, the only thing preventing me from doing so is my relationship with my boyfriend. I love him so much and I want to be a stable partner for him. If it wasn’t for him I would never have stopped cutting in the first place. I have dealt with urges to cut myself ever since I stopped, but lately the urges are stronger and more often. I find myself thinking about it every day, multiple times a day. It just feels like the right thing to do. It’s like an itch I need to scratch. The worst part is, recently I found myself thinking “where could I do it that my boyfriend wouldn’t see?”, but there isn’t really anywhere on my body that he doesn’t see regularly. I hate myself for wanting to do something like this and for wanting to hide it from him because we are very honest with each other and this is a topic we have discussed a little bit. I am also worried that my boyfriend wouldn’t want to be with me if I hurt myself in such a blatant way. Over the past 2.5 years that I haven’t been cutting, I felt confident that I was strong enough not to do it, but lately I’ve felt weaker and weaker. I do see a therapist, but I can’t talk about these urges with her because she would have a legal obligation to make a report, as I am a minor.

1j4nu6g,AITA for committing svicide?,"Hello. I'm currently a ghost and posting this from beyond the grave. Satan allowed me one last request before I'm tormented in hell for eternity, and that was to post this here and be able to read the responses for 24 hours before being relegated to Judecca.

I'm AuDHD and grew up in a rather ableist, controlling, and abusive environment wherein superficially my interest in computers was praised but in actuality I had shit constantly taken away from me and got yelled at, punished, and sometimes even beaten for even small transgressions which really traumatised me and put me off from learning or doing anything ever again because of all the thoughts of self-doubt and memories being held back resurface which always serve to sour the mood; this kind of shit happened at both school and home. I feel it and the meds I was put on caused brain damage and chronic anhedonia.

Then somehow I got accepted into a really good university for computer science and engineering and decided to study computer hardware engineering. Problem is, I’ve not had an internship or research experience because of my motivation and self-esteem issues, and often relieved the sheer amount of burnout by playing video games, hoarding books and hardware, or doing other unproductive shit, because programming became associated with deadlines, problems that I couldn’t solve or understand without additional explanation, senses of dread, stupidity, and resentment, and just stress in general.

It killed my career and job prospects, especially with how no one is hiring anymore, whilst I watched all my peers who weren't as mistreated go on to have successful and prosperous careers and become master programmers, meanwhile I was left financially emotionally, and occupationally destitute from how much of my life I wasted and how mentally ill I was.

It culminated in a quarter-life crisis and endlessly ruminating about all the shit that could have been, and the end result was that yesterday, I hvng myself outside of my apartment. There really was no other choice. It was a long three minutes, then darkness... then I was a ghost.

I was 23 and about to graduate.

Soon after my phone in my pocket rang, mom was calling. I couldn't pick up the phone and my hand just noclipped through my jacket. I really wanted to answer and say sorry... several more phone calls from family and friends, and eventually cops were sent to my last known location where my body was discovered. Ambulances came and loaded my body into a bag where I was taken to the mortuary; I followed along.

Not too long ago, my parents came and wanted to see me... I watched my mother, father, and siblings scream and cry their eyes out, mom holding my dead body in her arms and desperately trying to get me to talk to her, running her hands through my long curly hair as Dad and siblings babbled almost incoherently, something about how I was ""gone too soon"" and ""had so much potential"" and ""the world is a much darker place without me now""... my body gave no response. It was then and there I realised the enormity of what I had done, despite how griefstricken and upset about the way my life played out I was.

Soon after, everything faded to black and I was left in the void with nothing but my all-consuming regret and God himself admonishing me for what I had done. I just had to sit there and take it.

I don't know, was I really the AH for taking my own life? I really did see no other way out...",Was I really the AH for taking my own life?,"The individual in the Reddit post is 23 years old and was on the verge of graduating from a reputable university with a focus on computer science and engineering, specifically studying computer hardware engineering. They describe growing up in an abusive environment that was both controlling and ableist, where their interest in computers was superficially supported but ultimately led to punitive experiences. This environment included being yelled at, punished, and physically disciplined, which resulted in trauma, self-doubt, and a long-term impact on their motivation and self-esteem.

This history of abuse carried over into their academic life, where they struggled to gain internship or research experience due to their mental health challenges, which included feelings of chronic anhedonia and burnout. They often turned to video games and hoarding books and hardware as coping mechanisms, while programming became associated with negative feelings like dread and resentment. As a result, they felt their education and career prospects were severely hampered, particularly as they observed their peers achieving success in the field.

The combination of these personal factors, including a troubled upbringing, mental health struggles, and a lack of support during their educational journey, contributed to their sense of hopelessness, ultimately culminating in a crisis that led them to attempt to take their own life.","The person is experiencing a quarter-life crisis and has taken their own life due to feelings of despair, regret, and the impact of past trauma on their mental health and career prospects.",23,male,single,computer hardware engineering student,destitute,"The person has a history of mental health issues, including chronic anhedonia and experiences related to trauma.",Bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering,"severe mental illness, chronic anhedonia, suicidal thoughts",yes,regret,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1j4nu6g/aita_for_committing_svicide/,SuicideWatch

1j4ndtj,falling back into suicidal thoughts,"just for context, I am an 18 year old high school freshman drop out with a couple years of homeschool experience that I inevitably dropped out of as well. and my parents are recently divorced after many years of being in a toxic marriage. 

my depression and anxiety started in middle school and was at its peak when I was 14/15. those years were the closest that I’ve been to attempting suicide. these past couple years though, I’ve worked on my mental health greatly and I can proudly say that I’ve made immense progress within myself since then. 

I wrote this as an entry for the journal app on my phone, but after reading it I just realized how truly honest I was here and I’d like to just share with people that align with how I’ve been feeling. Although saying the things that I did there about getting advice at the end, im really not opposed to receiving it. I’m just feeling a certain type of way as of late and I want words that can help me in any way

-

admittedly, these past couple of months I’ve been falling back into thoughts of suicide. in january, because I was unemployed and fighting for my life trying to get a job. in february, because I finally got a job and it didn’t bring me the happiness and joy that I thought it would. this month, because I still feel the same way and I thought I would already get over it. 
but also so many other little things on top of that like our financial situation, my future, finding a career, you know- things of that nature. 

Ultimately, thinking this way- it almost never fails to lead me into going into a spiral about everything that’s gone wrong in my life. my family always comes to mind first. and I wanna talk about it.
I often think about how much I want a miracle to happen. I want my dad to just snap out of it one day and be like, “man, life is so boring and so hard without my family. I should try talking things out with them and see if they’ll take me back into the house.” then he comes home, finds work over here and boom- big happy family again. but I know that it’s more than unlikely. It’s just something I like to think about to cope with the fact that my family turned into hot shit. 
Oddly enough though, I do think my dad is hitting his fork in the road. His job is so slow that he’s been finding other jobs to apply to- first sign. and he’s been asking us for money- second sign. It amazes me how that’s happening because we were always the ones in the dirt asking him to help us pay the bills constantly. now it’s roles reversed. fucking insane to me. especially after going off with his other chick thinking shit would be sweet between them with all his money that he would just love to flex that he had. I love my dad, but over the years he made me and the rest of my family feel like shit because of how little we make financially.

but besides that

yeah I am working now. and it’s not entirely going how I thought it would or I would’ve liked it to have gone. before I got this job I thought that being employed would have solved all of my problems and would have been the cure to all of my problems. I was completely fucking wrong and now I think I’ve felt the worst I’ve ever felt in a while. yes having a job is a huge blessing especially in my case, but I’m not happy. I was supposed to be happy. 
I just needed a job to fill the void that was in my head for years and it’s benefited me by 0 mentally. I just feel stuck. like what do I do now? I wanna save up and pay for my high school diploma, but bills are always so high that I start to spiral and think about if it’ll even be possible to save up for it. I wanna get into medical school, but how can I even do that if I don’t have my high school diploma?? Say I do get into medical school, how am I gonna drive over there?? I don’t know how to drive. Maybe I should learn how to drive first, but gas is so expensive and we only have 2 cars and never enough time for me to be taught. 

It’s constant war with myself and my mind can never shut the fuck up. I hate my mind, I hate thinking. music is the one thing in life that I truly value so much and depend on to silence out the noise but even that hasn’t been helping. my thoughts are so loud that is spills out my headphones.
I feel so ashamed even thinking about letting myself go, but as of late I really can’t help it. my thoughts are draining, thinking is draining and that’s all I ever seem to do. I don’t know how to just stop thinking. because really, I don’t wanna die. I see a beautiful life for myself. I just can’t seem to stay looking at the light for long periods of time without falling off track somehow. and I don’t wanna talk about it to anybody either. I always feel like a burden. my brain tells me that no one actually really gives af, they just wanna know what im going through so they can give me a pat on the back so I feel better. and I hate to say it because I know how conceited it sounds, but I feel like I never hear what I wanna hear from people either. which makes no sense because I don’t even know wtf I wanna hear from them.

- **Mental Health**: They suffer from frequent panic attacks and a profound sense of hopelessness, feeling disengaged from family and expressing a lack of belief in their support system.

1j4lvi1,My suicidal ideations are getting worse,"When I drive to work all I can think about is either running my car off the road and into a ditch or driving straight forward into a bunch of trees.

Last year before graduating college and all the stressors just kept piling up, I was pressing my step dad’s gun against my head, just sobbing but unable to pull the trigger. I ended up confessing to my mom during that moment out of so much fear and anxiety, and they got rid of it. Though now, I wish I did pull the trigger. I feel so pathetic all the time, can’t even end my own life. 

Right now I just have a bunch of antihistamine pills, like 35 in the bottle cap.

I think I’ll just drink whatever alcohol I have and see if a drunk me will finally say fuck it and end it. I’m so scared whenever I try to attempt, and it’s a bit silly because of fearing more of the “what if’s”, but honestly I really don’t think there’s any reason for me to be here anymore.

1j4kacz,The most important game you'll ever play,"Life is the most important game you will ever play. But there are some differences between life and Super Mario Brothers. You didn't ask to play. You aren't given the controller till you're 18. You have to hope the ones with the controller during those years is good to you and doesn't leave you messed up by the time you exit the nest.

You have the controller now. Do you feel ready? There's no tutorial or manual. Time to roll with the punches. Young and dumb phase but how dumb you are during this time may affect you for life. Had a kid with someone you barely know? Did you rob a bank? Did you kill someone because of a stupid gang rivalry? Did you try a really addictive drug and get hooked? That's your twenties. 

Here's your 30s. Raising kids, maybe more established career wise, getting the hang of things. Divorce may have found you. A parent or close loved one may have passed away by now. Your back or knees may have minor kinks and cracks. Naps are your best friend. Do you still look how you did in high school or gain a million pounds? This thing called life. You look at your parents and wonder how they made it to 50 because you are only 30 and tired!! I really have to work another 30 years?! How is this possible? 

You have probably accomplished some goals by now. More confident in who you are. Not as naive. Realize that blood isn't always family and friends could be fakers. Living life. This phase had the potential to be the best time in life because your body is still young but your mind is older. You realize that you can really do whatever you want and this is your world. A constant learning experience. So you keep Going through the motions, yet always expecting the unexpected, because it's coming. 

And unfortunately mine did. The irreversible. I apologize I can't tell you about any other decades. I haven't gotten there. I'm only 32 and it seems this is where my story will end. The game isn't fun anymore. No more levels unlocked. My brain has been warped and can't find a way to beat this level. The level prior traumatized me and took away any confidence I had in crossing the finish line. Just forever level 32. I didn't ask to play this game, but I'm voluntarily going into the next one. Not knowing if that will be the worst decision yet.

1j4jx21,Student suicide from my brother's school makes me think about my own ideation.,"Around a month ago, a kid from my older brother's school jumped onto subway tracks and got run over. The school sent emails to every parent, including my mom, informing them of a student death. The email talked about how tragic the death was, how he was a valued student and person, and that he will be missed, things like that. They said that there'll be a book up at the front of the school where people can sign their condolences to the family.

This made me contemplate my own suicidal ideations. These days, the thoughts are passive and I don't have an active plan. Most of my suicide ""fantasies"" involve me as an adult in the future, but when I do imagine it happening in the present, I often think of using the same method that kid from my brother's school did. Railway suicide is extremely traumatizing to passengers, the driver, and any passerby. I'd tell a particular friend of mine about my ideations. I remember him joking a couple of times about how I should use this method, as (according to him) suicide would be a one last ""screw you"" to the world and I shouldn't worry about scarring anyone.

This also made me wonder how people in my school, specifically, would feel. I don't want to mention or even think about how my family would react, not because I don't give a damn about them. It's more of, ""It's too horrifying and exhausting to think about"". The friend of mine I've mentioned, we aren't friends anymore. He was an old boyfriend too before that. My first one ever, and probably my last. He ended things due to my mental health. If I killed myself and the whole school knew, I wonder how he'd feel? We aren't speaking anymore. We aren't even in any classes together. He seems happy, especially now that I'm not really a part of his life anymore. And I know it's not ideal assuming how someone feels based on how they present themselves to the public, but I know I held him back at some point, and now he's free. I'm relieved for his freedom, but I'm also grieving what I lost. Admittedly, he was everything to me. If I killed myself and the whole school knew, would he start grieving? Would he finally feel like he's lost something too? Or, would he just meet my death with indifference once again? Would it be just a small blip in his life, like how cutting me out was to him?

I dunno. Everything around me reminds me of this friend. Any thought I have eventually finds a connection and links back to him. I don't even know what I'm writing this for. I feel kind of dull and useless. I feel fat, dull, useless, dumb, and really unmotivated. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest because I haven't been able to tell anyone, especially the suicide part. Thank you for reading.","If I killed myself and the whole school knew, would my ex-boyfriend start grieving, or would he just meet my death with indifference?","The individual who wrote the Reddit post appears to be a student who is experiencing a mental health crisis, influenced by a traumatic event involving a peer from their brother's school who died by suicide.

1j4iql0,I want to cut my nipples,"I need to clarify that it's not about being in the LGBTQ or something like that.   
I have been struggling with an endless itch in all parts of my body. This started when I was around 12 years old, I'm 18 right now. So, these last years I have been trying to deal with that itch. Maybe you'll understand. It starts with a small itch, yu scratch a little, but when you realize you have already scratched for several minutes because it satisfies you too much. That is my problem. 

At first, it happened in my legs, I have some spots on them because I got to scratch to the point of creating horrible wounds. I even bleed. I remember I went to a specialist but that didn't help. What he prescribed only increased my itch. Luckily, some familiar people recommended a body cream that helped me a lot in only one week. I stopped scratching my legs and I was happy! But I don't know when either why I started scratching again but this time in my thighs.

  
Over the years, I continued scratching and it's always a new part of my body. Currently are my shoulders, forearms, my boobs and my left leg's calf. My boobs are THE problem. I have been thinking that I'd like to bury a knife in my nipples, because the itch goes too deep.
