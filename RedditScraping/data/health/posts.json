I'm 19 and in my first year of uni I should be out there having fun and enjoying life and working for my course. (I havent been able to work for almost a year now and my first assignments were done at the last minute with a a long extension and even then I almost just didn't do them). The problem is recently I have been extremely bad mentally because I tried to come off my meds and with in 5 days of intermittent dosage I was struggling with my head. It's been a week now since I started taking them again daily and it still not working so this whole gf situation has made me even worse. Another friend doesnt think she will break up with me but I have extreme paranoia and every little detail is important and I just have a feeling. When I get to my extreme worst my head is just a place of constant pain, but it isnt a pain you can feel you just know it's there. My whole body just feels like crap and the constant thoughts make me feel like there is no way out but one. I dont like thinking about it but I have a history of instant rash decisions and in a split second I wouldnt stop myself from actually doing it. I have done close a few times. \n\nThis whole post is weird because I dont really care about myself because I dont really matter but I read a few posts on here just now and I wanted to be there for every one of you that feels like this or shit in any other way.

        "original": "This is my first time ever posting and I just started using Reddit last week. But I always search these communities and there have been helpful stories so I thought I would add to that:\n\n12/31/2019\nI have been struggling for months to a year in silence after a relapse in major depression and anxiety. I started journaling my suicidal thoughts so that if I wasn\u2019t able to tell anyone that if the worst happened they might know what was going on. I wrote down my wishes for my body after death, researched the most environmentally conscious one so my last act would be a good one. \n\nI made the poor choice in 2018 to stop going to treatment just when things started to get better during . (Bi-Weekly copays add up quick even with the good insurance I am blessed to have due to a parent with a good job and my age) \n\nI have tried finding help but each therapist or psychiatrist I have been turned away because they weren\u2019t accepting patients. They didn\u2019t ask what treatment I was looking for and what I needed they just denied me immediately. I have trying hard to avoid the emergency room just because i feel observation would make the problems in my mind worse. \n\nI live in a more rural part of my state so a good doc can be 1.5-2 hour trip=not good. I\u2019ve been experiencing every side effect of it. Naturally things can get very bad very quickly. I\u2019ve had persistent thoughts of suicide everyday as soon as I wake up and until I fall asleep which have gotten more prominent as time passes. \n\nI stopped leaving my house 6 weeks ago because every time I did my commute to school or work I was scared a bad day would tempt me into trying to hurt myself and indirectly possibly others physically on the roads. I dropped out of school for the second time since 2018 and Had to leave my job of 3 years because the illness was taking over and I didn\u2019t have the courage to ask for help. This has been a struggle I have battled in mostly silence until the last few years. I am vocal with some friends about this but have only talked with my mom a handful of times about it and the last conversation where I was open about what was happen 1.5 years ago. I have been lying and trying to pretend that I\u2019m okay because she hasn\u2019t dealt well with learning that I am suffering so badly. She didn\u2019t understand what was going because I tried so hard to hide the signs when I could. \n\nChristmas was REALLY hard this year and my anxiety plus trying to detox from weed has kept me awake for last 4 days straight. This morning after another night distracting myself with tv in hopes I would just exhaust myself, my mom came down the stairs to start her day. I don\u2019t know what she even said I think she asked about when school was starting again but the exhaustion mixed with the thoughts in my head exploded. Just created word vomit I started to just tell her everything because I couldn\u2019t stop the honestly. I sobbed and she sobbed she showed anger and she showed compassion. We had the best conversation I have ever had and it was something I never thought she was capable of. \n\nI haven\u2019t started any treatment as this all happened today. But the hardest part is admitting to others what is going on and I was able to do that. Somewhat against my will and subconsciously maybe some part in my brain knew what it was deciding, I don\u2019t know and there\u2019s no way to really find out.\n\nLife is hard and the holidays can be hard when you\u2019re alone and even when you\u2019re with people. Things become out of our control and that is okay and that is normal. Human beings have a collective knowledge that is so vast and immeasurable that with all that knowledge we can still not fully understand when someone is sick and that it\u2019s okay and we can be helped and be better. \n\nThis happened at 7 am the morning of the last day of the year. The last day of the decade. 6 weeks ago I thought I wouldn\u2019t make it to Christmas and my family would have to bury me. I thought I would be starting 2020 in a dark place figuratively and possibly literally. But I\u2019m still here. Please don\u2019t give up if you find this story to connect with you on some level. The world needs our voices and our compassion and even our weaknesses. \n\nI don\u2019t know what my future holds but for the first time in a long time the darkness isn\u2019t as dark.\n\nEdit for informational context: I have struggled with problems since very young the first conscious thought I had of killing myself was 9 years old in a diary meant for crushes and random entries. \nMy parents made one attempt and seeking mental health help when I was 11 at the beginning of an official divorce. I expressed not liking the therapist to my parent(s),  which happens and I expressed that to my parents and they took it as I didn\u2019t want to do therapy. \n\nI really try to avoid parenting advise because I don\u2019t plan to have children so I most likely will experience life different from you. But I\u2019m not telling you how to raise them. With that said, If you have kids I would HIGHLY recommend therapy, even if they seem perfectly fine. Developing an understanding that there are safe spaces for feelings I think is something that will have a huge impact for generations to come.",

It did for my academic, however, my mental health has worsened to the point of suicidal thoughts.\n\nI just turned 18 two weeks ago, and I\u2019ve been in constant fear of fucking up. I don\u2019t drink alcohol due to alcoholics, I don\u2019t smoke weed, I don\u2019t even smoke cigarettes. I\u2019m terrified my family will kick me out if I mess up in the slightest. They preach that they won\u2019t since my whole family has lived here for most of their lives, and only two of us moved out. The fear is instilled in me, though. I keep waking up everyday fearing for the day they stop caring, and I struggle more. I love my family, and they haven\u2019t given me reasons for wanting to kick me out but, I just can\u2019t seem to keep the idea out of my head.\n\nHomeschooling helped me academically but, I already missed the deadline for the rest of the year as a homeschooled student. My family bought me everything to go back this January, Im terrified. I have never been bullied but, my self esteem has worsened to the point where I gained more weight in the year, I can\u2019t stop acknowledging it. I ask for ways to lose weight but, I am terrified of a job and can\u2019t bring myself to go to an interview, and my family won\u2019t buy me just a few things to help me jump start a diet. They didn\u2019t before I was 18, and they won\u2019t now. I understand they aren\u2019t obligated, even though they said they would if I considered a diet. I can\u2019t go back to school because my mind thinks \u201cyou\u2019re disgusting, fat, ugly, your old friends won\u2019t talk to you because you gained weight.\u201d \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been having issues, and I don\u2019t want to break it off because I know it\u2019s due to my lack of communication. I dealt with verbally abusive, and toxic relationships that any form of affection is hard for me to comprehend. I can\u2019t figure out how to go about relearning how to hold a conversation if my mind goes blank, or I think I\u2019m talking too much. The bigger issue about this is we are hitting our 3 year mark in March. 3 years and this first year I haven\u2019t been able to figure myself out, nor talk to anyone properly. I can talk in group forms because everyone else talks first, yet I can\u2019t talk to my own boyfriend.\n\nLastly, I\u2019m suicidal. I don\u2019t yearn for suicide, I just feel like I would be best suited dead, not by murder but by hanging, or something. I\u2019m not scared that I\u2019ll inflict pain because, I know I won\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t do that because I fear the aftermath, I fear what my family will see. However, I do wish I was alone so it\u2019d be easier. I hope things get better for me.\n\nTDLR; Constant fear of being kicked out now that I\u2019m 18, despite not causing issues/problems. Homeschooling didn\u2019t fix my problems, they worsened. My boyfriend and I lack communicated due to my insecurities. I\u2019m suicidal but, wouldn\u2019t want to hurt myself, and don\u2019t yearn for it; although if I was homeless, alone, and forgotten about, I\u2019d do it.\n\nALSO: I\u2019ve dealt with depression and anxiety issues for a long ass time, anxiety prevents me from even asking for help in most cases.",

A couple of examples:\n\nOne topic that regularly consumes the entirety of my attention is retirement and other investing or personal finance. I get caught in a loop where I am concerned I am saving enough for retirement, and will build spreadsheets to calculate how much I will save by my retirement age, based on current saving rates and a prediction of investment returns. I will play out different scenarios, adjusting my saving rates or rates of return and other variables. I will read every blog or website about retirement investing and play with retirement planning tools. Alternatively, I will obsess about my mortgage payments, seeing how many extra principle payments will help me pay off the mortgage early, and how much I would save overall. Those are only two examples of finance related obsessions consume me regularly.\n\nAlternatively, I will obsess about something that I am interested in buying, spending hours reading reviews or finding the best of a type of thing. The latest in terms of this is straight razors and straight razor shaving. I have spent hours and days looking for different kinds of straight razors, comparing options, reading about shaving techniques, stropping techniques and honing techniques. A couple of months ago it was similar with shoes, looking for the perfect pair of boots and weighing whether or not or when to buy them, which ones to get, and reading up on men's style.\n\nWhile all of this is going on I struggle to focus on anything else, like work or social relationships.

        "original": "Hi all,\n\nI hope you\u2019ll entertain a post in which I vent about stuff I don\u2019t know how to say to any one in person and that I\u2019ve never said to anyone before. :)\n\nI\u2019m a 24-year old male college student in graduate school and I feel like I have become *extremely* socially withdrawn in the past two years or so. \n\nI used to pretty actively post (*at least* a few times a week) to social media and engage with friends on sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, but I find that I\u2019ve become less and less interested in posting any sort of material whatsoever. I still actively use these sites to see *other* people\u2019s posts and to keep up with news and what not, but I seem to have no interest in sharing anything of myself. As an example, I have stopped posting to my Facebook and Instagram altogether and have reached a tweet rate of about < 10 tweets/year over the last two years.\n\nThis may sound silly and like a non-issue, but it also seems to be affecting me in a similar manner when having conversations in person or having an open-style discussion in groups. I often find that I listen and allow the other person(s) to speak *much* more than I do. This results in a lot of, what feel like, one-sides conversations. I dislike this about myself.\n\nThe weird thing is that I *am* interested in contributing to the conversation most of the time. I just can\u2019t bring myself to it. I definitely think that I\u2019m opinionated, so it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m just lacking thoughts on things. \n\nI do tend to do a lot of self-criticism. I would say that it is not uncommon for me to remember things I said years ago and think about how stupid I was to say it or to remember the ridicule I might\u2019ve felt at the time. \n\nI will often consider what the value added is to a conversation when I am thinking about contributing a particular piece of information. Most of the time I decide that what I have to say is not relevant or important and so I say nothing instead. I\u2019ll acknowledge what was said, maybe nod my head, give a generic response, and kind of just move on.\n\nI am seriously concerned that this is affecting my professional life as well. I\u2019m working in a science-related field with some of the brightest people I have ever met in my life. Part of communicating and, in general, *doing* science effectively involves understanding that *words matter.* When describing or trying to apply our understanding of physical phenomena, you have to be precise. Every day, you have to be careful to say one thing and not the other because the other is not correct and is not what you are trying to say. This forces me to think a lot before speaking and writing. \n\nOver the course of this post, I have deleted and rewritten words many, many times. I suppose this is pretty normal in the writing process and maybe I shouldn\u2019t read into it too much, but sometimes I just wish I could say or write what I mean without having to put in all the mental energy to think about how what I said can be misconstrued or how it is not really what I mean. I don\u2019t know. It feels like communicating what I want to say can be extremely difficult. I just wish it was easier I guess.\n\nI didn\u2019t really write this with the intent to elicit any sort of response (not that I wouldn\u2019t read or consider any). I figured it would hopefully, somehow, be helpful to myself if I just wrote it down and posted it somewhere anonymously. So for anyone who did spend their time reading my nonsensical and unnecessarily lengthy post, thank you. Hope you have a great day. :)",

And my older sister got drunk and she passionately talked about how grateful she is for our parents, the opportunities they've given and how supportive they are despite the Filipino stereotype of wanting their kids to be nurses. But letting us pursue what we want, such my older brother in smart home installation and home renovation, my older sister with baking and entrepreneurship, me with robotics engineering, and my little sister who is yet to find a career goal but is still supported in everything she does, art, music, teaching.\n\nWhat got to me was the way she said it. She was speaking out to the world, but to a room of just 4 other people, my mum, dad, little sister and I. She kept screening and crying that she is do grateful, that she does all these things to show her gratitude, and asking the world why people don't take these opportunities their parents give to their kids. But since she was speaking to us the family, it seemed more like her ranting that me and my little sister don't do enough to show gratitude.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that my parents sacrificed alot for their kids. My dad used to make a 6 digit salary, my mum had a career working at a bank and handling stocks. They gave it up to bring us to Canada when we were young (I was 7/8, currently 18) just so we could get an education from the land of opportunity. My mum and dad worked themselves to the bone to feed us, clothe us, and support the family off of minimum wage jobs since nobody wanted to hire them due to their degrees being from the Phillipines. \n\nMy older sister kept going on about how \"If you love your parents why the fuck don't you do anything around the house?!\", \"Can't you see you have awesome amazing parents?!, \"You should understand the hardship they went through\", \"you don't understand because you don't talk to mammy about her problems\".\n\nAs if my sister has the moral high ground for having more appreciable acts of gratitude, she works around the house, she has a job so she can support the family etc etc. While for me, I'm a year behind in highschool and I'm trying to finish courses that I need to get into my program. My gratitude comes from me working on school, it comes from me graduating on stage, it comes from me being able to hold my diploma for my parents on time, despite still not being able to finish my courses to go to uni straight away. My gratitude comes from me being here, it comes from me waking up in the morning and fighting the thoughts that festered in my mind for years until 2018 when I attempted suicide. My gratitude is fighting one of the hardest raid bosses, myself and my thoughts. My gratitude comes from standing up for my family if people speak down about them, my gratitude comes from standing up to my older sisters abusive boyfriend and telling him to leave our lives when she is not strong enough to tell him to leave, my gratitude comes from being beat up from said boyfriend while protecting my sister. My gratitude comes from taking my opportunities and getting my post secondary bachelor's and hopefully masters as well in engineering. My gratitude comes from still being here, when all hope is lost, when I feel I can't get up anymore, gratitude is looking at god and saying \"Go fuck yourself\" for making my life feel like a living hell, staring into myself and fighting the temptation to end it all again, my gratitude is being able to look around the abyss that is my mind and despite all the shit that's here or the lack there of, staring into it and saying I have hope.\n\nTo hear my older sister, my best friend since the day I was born, the person who took care of me for a year when the government tried to seperate my family after my suicide attempt, the person I cried to about having to lock myself in the washroom an entire night to escape thoughts, the person who cried with me on the balcony before I made another attempt by jumping, the person who cried with me waiting for the police to come when my face was bruised and my shirt halfway torn and battered. Of all people to hear them say \"you are not enough\". I understand what she was saying, and I know she didn't mean it the way she said it, especially considering she was drunk off of a bottle of martini and glasses of wine.\n\nI just needed to get this off my chest. It's hard to hear for me, that I need to do more when my 110% is going into bettering myself, rather than 110% going into staying alive cause mum would be sad, putting the effort into wanting to be alive not because other people would be sad, but just so you can have something to say when people ask \"where do you see yourself in 5 years\" and drawing a blank because you honestly can't see a future with you still in it.\n\nI guess the point of this post was to rant, but I wish everyone an amazing 2020, don't let anyone ever say you're not doing enough. Being here is enough, seeking help is enough, waking up even if you get out of bed 5 hours later is enough. Don't let people think you're ingracious, your gratitude to life comes from everything you do. It definetly is a new year, be it happy or not, atleast it's another year. \n\nCheers my friends, and Godspeed",

I've been having stomach/acid reflux issues and I wanted to see if that would clear it up.  (It's helped but clearly isn't main cause) Anyway, I feel great but mostly mentally!  I was drinking with my anti-anxiety pills and I realized I've never tried them without alcohol.  My anxiety has been much better and way more manageable.  I'm able to calm it down faster and more effectively.  Also, I'm not so bloated.  I would've lost some weight but I indulged heavy in Christmas goodies.  I had alot more money to spend at Christmas and more energy to start AND finish projects I started.  The good part is very GOOD and the longer I go the happier I feel. My relationship with my man has gotten closer and better also. \n\nNow the bad? The explaining to friends and family.  I hate explaining myself especially numerous times.  I don't even know how to explain it because it was just something I decided to do pretty randomly and quickly.  Learning to be around drunk people is hard.  I know I was really annoying sometimes drunk but trust me, we all are.  I went to a friend's for cards and hot tubbing and it was difficult at times being sober.  People would pass me a bottle and I'd pass it along.  The constant ' oh I'm sorry! I forgot I feel bad!'.  Don't feel bad, or apologize. Just don't make it a big deal. It's ok.  For me, I don't consider myself an alcoholic.  I will probably drink again someday.  Just trying it sober for now.  I've always been into the party scene.  I still love going out and having fun.  I see this as more of a challenge than a sucky unfun thing I'm doing to myself.  \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend a sober break if you feel your life starting to revolve around alcohol more than it should.  It's hard and rough at times.  Some people just don't understand and aren't supportive but it's not about them.  Do it for YOU!  Life's an adventure with many many paths.

They never cared about the life I was living outside academics which is quite true for every student here, coz its India. I had many friends till 8th grade but after that everybody's lifestyle changed and they started getting into relationships, partied with everyone, all the usual teen stuff. But my parents didn't allow me any of this shit coz they're conservative as hell. They just wanted me to score better in exams, get a job, add to the population and die. So, all of this made me  isolated from everyone and I lost many of my friends and was very lonely most of the times.\n\nBut a  year and half years back, I met this girl, who I thought was an angel coz of her nature and beauty, and within a week we were dating. I  finally got to know what others feel by not being alone. Moreover she was a perfect 10, so yeah I was definitely happy and at peace.\n\nBut  then after 9 or 10 months, I got to know that she was just playing with me. To be concise, she, basically, sent the same nudes to me and four others and sucked  each of us off on the same day without any of us getting to know about  others and then explained herself the next day by saying that it's *\"modern multiple dating.\"* And she had been doing all that long before hooking up with me.\n\nObviously, it broke me like hell, I was a little depressed and even cried at night thinking about my fucking fate. It wouldn't have been that upsetting if I didn't have such isolated and prison like teenage years.\n\nBut hopefully I got over it with much pain, learnt about game, developed my communication skills and completely changed myself. I am no longer a  people pleaser nor am I lonely or get upset about my life. But, as the title says, there's this one thing for which I don't have any  solution, whenever her name pops up in any conversation or situation or just when I thinking about something, I feel like I am going back to the old me.

        "original": "Hey everyone.\n\nSo this text is going to be a huge mess. I just want to write my feelings down for a bit so yeah, let\u2018s go:\n\nI\u2018m currently 17 years old and I\u2018m doing an apprenticeship in a small towns community office. Before I started working I was so excited to finally leave school but after like one week of working I had a kind of breakdown and everything just got up to me. I realized that I won\u2018t have 14 weeks of holidays anymore, I have to work on wednesday afternoons etc. I think everyone who initially started working had that moment. The problem is that these thoughts just never stopped. Every evening I\u2018m afraid of the next day for no reason at all. My colleagues are mostly nice and I enjoy doing the work that I do. I somehow just can\u2018t get myself to actually enjoy it. I\u2018m pretty sad while sitting in the bus, driving to work because I think about the long day that awaits me. Once I\u2018m actually working, these thoughts kinda disappear because I just function somehow and do the shit that I have to do. This has been going for the past 4 months now and it\u2018s slowly starting to affect my mental health. I wouldn\u2018t say I\u2018m depressed, I still enjoy live and for gods sake I shouldn\u2018t complain. I live in a nice skiing town in switzerland and I get to do what I love most every weekend, meeting friends, skiing and just having fun but under the week, it\u2018s just completely different. \n\nNow for the actual problem. I have 2 weeks of holidays since christmas and I felt like the time went by way too quick. I did fun stuff everyday and we had an amazing new years party with my closest friends and today I had a pretty bad hangover and just thought about life the whole day. I want to enjoy the last 4 days of my holidays as much as possible but when I think about it, 4 days are nothing and it\u2018ll go by so quick and then life\u2018s back to \"shit\". I just don\u2018t know if its just me or if time actually goes by this fast when youre not only working all day. \nPlease just talk to me because I want to get shit together and not be a kinda depressed prick when I\u2018m not skiing or doing stuff with friends.\nOh and I don\u2018t really want to quit my apprenticeship because I\u2018d have to wait half a year before being able to do something else.\n\nI know that I complain about unnecessary shit while other people are actually depressed. I just have this small problem that I cant really solve so I\u2018d enjoy talking to other people that were in the same situation as me.",

        "title": "What is Online Therapy?",
        "original": "What is Online Therapy? \n\nOnline therapy is a growing trend. According to one online service, it has grown almost 80% since 2016 with an average of 500,000 registered users. \n\nOnline therapy is a space where you can talk to someone in confidence and work out issues you may have such as Depression, Anxiety, Stress, relationship problems, grief and much more. You can talk to the therapist either by phone, text or video chat. \n\nHere\u2019s how to get started, you register on a site that employs licensed therapists and choose a therapist that you feel will fit your needs. Therapists have a profile, which will state their specialty. For instance, a therapist may state they work with the elderly or are addiction specialists. \n\nThe Benefits of Online Therapy\n\nRural Areas\n\nIf you live in a rural area, for instance, you won\u2019t have to drive 1-2 hours to a bigger city to get service. Even if you live in a more populated area, there may not be enough mental health services available. Sometimes people may have to wait months to see a therapist because of the demand for mental health services. \n\nLimited Access\n\nMany individuals have limited mobility because of age or disability. Online access to a therapist gives people who may not get to an office, access to a therapist.\n\nEase of Use and Affordability\n\nBeing able to talk to someone in the comfort of your own home is both easy and convenient. It is much easier to talk to someone from your home then have to deal with traffic, parking and waiting to see the therapist. If you talk to a therapist from home, you are also likely to be more open with the therapist because you are comfortable in your environment. \n\nOnline therapy rates are much less than at a tradition office. Rates vary depending on whether you talk via phone, text, or video chat. The ability to accept insurance plans depends on the state they are in and the type of insurance you have.\n\nReduces Stigma\n\nOnline therapy services have seen a rise in users. The people who are using online therapy more are women, Muslims, LBGTQ, minorities and Jewish. Having mental health issues is a stigma for many cultures. It may be impossible for someone to seek therapy without being looked down on or ostracized. Online therapy benefits people who are afraid to seek help, due to cultural beliefs or not wanting anyone to know they are struggling internally. \n\nDisadvantages of Using Online Therapy\n\nAlthough online therapy is beneficial for certain people, it may not work for everyone. \n\nOut of State Providers\n\nMany states have laws regarding therapists and psychologists providing services to people in states they are not licensed in. This means that if your state does not have any online therapy providers, you would not be able to use the services. If they do have providers in your state, you may not have very many choices. Laws vary from state to state.\n\nInsurance\n\nSome health insurance companies do not cover online mental health services. Although online rates are more affordable than traditional office visits, they may still be too expensive for some individuals.\n\nSerious Mental Illness\n\nAn online therapist is not appropriate for someone who has a serious mental illness. People who suffer from a serious mental illness should be under the care of a psychiatrist. There are no crisis services available for online therapy, so there is no one to contact if you have experienced a setback or have suicidal thoughts.\n\n\nTo Sum Things Up\u2026\n\nOnline therapy is a great alternative to traditional therapy. It can be both convenient and cost-effective. You can access an online therapist through various websites. Ecounseling has a list of the 5 best services along with an average price point, if you feel online therapy is a good fit for you, you can start looking at your options and make an informed decision.",

        "original": "Hello everyone, \n\nI just want to start off by saying that I do currently see a therapist and she does help me but I still struggle a lot in the in between.\n\nI\u2019m posting because I feel so lost all of the time. A little bit about myself: \n\nI\u2019m a 25 year old male. I am overweight. I work as a High School Teacher, and I coach to sports as well. I have a a girlfriend of 6 years. I own a home, have pets, debts etc. \n\nWhat I really want to know is if anyone else shares the same feelings that I do, because honestly, the struggle has gotten pretty bad these past few years...\n\nI think I may be depressed. I struggle with the fact that I probably am because I don\u2019t want to be and even my therapist has told me that I should explore anti-depressants to help me. I don\u2019t want to take them because I don\u2019t want the side-effects and what if it makes me worse. \n\nI literally don\u2019t have many feelings anymore. I know what they are and what they feel like but I don\u2019t really get them. I seldom feel happy, excited, hopeful or loving. I often just feel sad, tired, and nothing seems to excite me anymore. I often feel as though I hate myself. I struggle to look in the mirror because let\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m about 5\u20197 and I\u2019m overweight. I\u2019m working on losing it but I still eat like crap and I have no motivation to do otherwise. My relationship has gone on for 6 years and we bought a house and all that. Since I\u2019ve been living here I think it\u2019s been bad but I know it\u2019s not living with her because I felt like this even when I was still in college. I didn\u2019t really do anything socially, stopped going to the football games and stuff. Spent a lot of time in my room, other than when I got into coaching, that brightened my day. I feel like most of the time that I don\u2019t know what love feels like anymore and that I can\u2019t put those feelings forward. I constantly worry about money. I constantly think that people are talking badly about me including the kids that I teach and that nobody really likes me at all. \n\nWhen I have to go visit my parents I get upset to leave because we live an hour away from them. I feel like I don\u2019t see them enough and it makes me very sad because on top of all of this, I constantly worry about the fact that they\u2019re getting older and so am I. It freaks me out to no end. I\u2019m even almost in tears thinking about that right now. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m in love because I don\u2019t know how it feels anymore, I hate myself and how I look (I\u2019ve been losing my hair since high school too) and I just can\u2019t. I literally can\u2019t. I\u2019m glad when she has to work late because I get to be alone at home for a little while and that bugs me too. I don\u2019t want to feel like that. She wants to get married and I can\u2019t even decide whether I want to because I can\u2019t feel anything, about anything.\n\nWhen I\u2019m coaching I usually feel better but even then I\u2019m still paranoid that I suck at it and I have a hard time taking criticism there and at work because I automatically take it personally. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m alone in this or not. I apologize for the long post. I just needed to vent. I just feel so trapped in my own mind.",

While these jobs can be lucrative, I\u2019m currently sitting almost $30,000 in debt between credit cards & just found out I\u2019m getting audited by the IRS for $4,500\n\nI started to really explore what was going on in my head because I have constant racing thoughts. One thought would turn into 20 in a matter of seconds.  And sometimes they lead to suicide ideation, I tried talking to my girlfriend at the time, but it didn\u2019t go anywhere. We eventually broke up 2 or so weeks later. I think about her almost every day. \n\nI struggle with finishing things & setting realistic goals in almost every aspect of my life. In business settings it\u2019s never to make \u201cjust enough money\u201d or anything. It\u2019s always to be the absolute greatest at my job. I put together plans that I think are solid constantly... ways to sell 50 houses, or whatever it is. \n\nAnd I think my \u201ccondition\u201d helps with this sometimes because I take ideas to a whole new level. \n\nBut lately I\u2019ve just felt empty. Not sad, not happy, I don\u2019t get excited very often. People who meet me the first time will describe me as \u201cthe most chilled dude they know\u201d but inside my brain is always going 100 miles per hour. \n\nSo far my therapist & medicine doctor have different ideas. Therapist thought it was a mood disorder, then a hint of bipolar (no confirmed people with bipolar in my family, but there are a few that I could see it) while my medicine doctor thinks I\u2019m depressed. \n\nAlso side note because if you actually read this you deserve this lol. \n\nBut when I first started therapy... I actually didn\u2019t know I was going to therapy. I was only there because I wanted an adderall prescription.   Of course like most, I googled my symptoms and came up with ADHD. \n\nSo I went to the doctor, and she referred me to my now therapist. I showed up thinking I was going to a normal appointment. But suddenly someone was asking how I felt.\n\nSo I left therapy and head home. Thinking the whole way home \u201choly crap I need therapy?\u201d And I get home to 4 cops outside my house & my little brother on his way to the hospital for another freak out episode. \n\nMy little brother was born with brain damage, and is essentially a 300 pound 6\u2019 1\u201d 6 year old in a 21 year old body. So naturally when he throws tantrums they get super dangerous. \n\nTo this day, no one in my family knows I\u2019ve gone to therapy. \n\nBUT my little brother started to go to therapy, and he now has the same therapist....\n\nLong post.

Being New Year it seems even more relevant, eg: - People are setting their New Year's Resolutions - People are posting on social media saying what they've achieved over the past decade and what they hope to achieve over this next decade. Anyway,... a little about me: I'm a 25 year old guy. I'm not the sort of person to sit at home playing computer games or anything like that. I'm active (love the gym), enjoy socialising with friends at bars or night outs etc etc. However there's very little else I want out of life right now.\n\nI'm in a job that I don't find fulfilling or challenging and it's pretty montonenous but it's an easy pace of life... I wake up at 8am in the week (a nice lie-in compared to most jobs), then do very little in my office job, find it easy and stress-free despite it being boring. All of this I don't mind though as I don't like stress. I then go to the gym for 2 hours after work and lift weights. I then go home and sleep for day 2. When the weekend comes I usually do the same sort of thing... see friends, go for dinner, get very drunk somewhere and usually spend Sunday hungover and sleeping. I have friends that have goals like becoming a millionaire or having \u00a31m in assets (property) or generally very career driven but I don't want the long days and stress that comes with this.\n\nI'm happy with a simple life without the stress and increases leisure/home time to do things I enjoy. I wake up and it's light outside and get home before it's dark. I do feel guilty sometimes because naturally I can push myself very hard (eg at the gym I work very hard) and sometimes I do feel guilty that I should want or expect more out of life.\n\nI don't know if it's laziness being how I am. I've seen posts like this before on Reddit but the difference is, usually the person who writes it says things like \"I don't know what I want out of life - I don't have a job, play computer games and watch porn through the day, don't leave my messy bedroom and don't socialise with friends apart from gamer friends\". That's not my personality at all however I guess the similar theme is I don't want much other than stress-limitation.\n\nI guess the only goal I have for this year is to find a girlfriend. However even then I'm not going to actively force this. If it happens it happens but I'm not going to chase anything especially if it leads to stress. Also if I feel the relationship is going to lead to stress then I quickly cut it off.\n\nIs it weird to want so little from life and be happy with a minimalistic, simple life?",

        "original": "Hi, I don't quite know how to use this app, but I am desperate and a little scared. Last night was a scary night for me and I suppose to fully explain everything you'll need a backstory. For the sake of keeping it as simple and private as possible, I'll try to keep it short:\n\nwhen I was younger, about 5, there were a series of traumatic events in my life. my step father was abusive to my mother, lots of fighting, my mom was sick with cancer, etc. I was a child at the time, but it did feel like I had to take on the role of an adult. Taking care of a sick mom and a little brother was a lot of work. As years went on, thinks would get better and worse as they do for anyone, but I would always feel the lows intensely. My first feelings of bad anxiety probably started around 8th grade so I was around 13. I would say that I was depressed at the time and I now know that I have anxiety and depression. My mom's relationship with me became toxic and complicated. For instance we would scream and fight and she would say that she wanted me to die, but the next hour she would say it's because she loves me and she was sorry. All was forgiven, but over time my guard was raised. I became fearful of her. It was like walking on eggshells and while I was the one being screamed at, it was me who had to comfort her. This continued for years, but my mom and I are finally in a pretty good place.  \n\n okay here I go...\n\nLast night my mother and her boyfriend got into an argument. There is no abuse anymore. There is no bad man to hurt my mom. But as soon as it started, I remembered exactly how I felt being young and afraid. Panic took over even when there was a part of me saying things were okay. As the argument went on I was able to calm myself down a little, but not enough. My mom eventually went to go downstairs and she fell. Completely accidental. Nobody pushed her. She just slipped. I went to check on her and saw her at the bottom of the stairs crying and saying she hurt her elbow. \n\nWhat happens next is a bit hard for me to put into words, but my whole body went into this frenzy of panic. I screamed over and over for someone to \"help her\", but I couldn't think to move to her or calmly ask for help. I just screamed to the top of my lungs. I have had only one or two other experiences like this, but never as bad. I just screamed. My brother and mom's boyfriend came out immediately to help, but words couldn't form. I couldn't explain what was happening. All I could do was scream. I recall falling on the floor. I recall pulling my hair and hitting myself. I recall laying on the ground and kicking. At one point I pushed myself against the wall so hard that I cracked a hole in the drywall. This is embarrassing to write because even as it was happening I was aware that I was irrational. But I couldn't stop. I was hyperventilating and sobbing and I was unstoppable.\n\n Eventually I was able to get to a point of reason. I took a pill for anxiety. It's called hydroxyzine and it is for when I have anxiety attacks which used to be frequent throughout my first few years of high school. I drank some water and my mom went upstairs. Everyone was okay, but I still felt off. I began to become very confused by my surroundings. I knew it was my home. I knew everything, but it didn't feel right. The same thing happened when I looked at my reflection (something I do when I feel anxious) My face didn't look like me even though I knew it was. I found myself humming without meaning to and I kept saying the word \"okay.\" It's hard to explain, but was like I kept saying it without thinking. Like saying is was a part of breathing. It just kept coming out. That was the first sign in my head that something was wrong. I couldn't stop myself from saying it. It was the only thing making me feel better and any other words that tried to come out felt wrong. \n\nMy mom did come out of her room to apologize for the way everything happened. She wanted to make sure I was okay and I thought I was getting there until she hugged me. I was tense. I knew that. I was still a little panicked, but I thought it would all blow over. My mom held me and all I knew is that I didn't want to be me. I began asking her if I could \"just be five again\"  I just wanted to be five. I could hear my voice changing and I swear I could feel myself shrinking. Like physically, my body became smaller. I couldn't stop talking like a small little child. The voice was unfamiliar and scary to me because I couldn't stop it and I knew that I was not acting normal. The closest thing I could compare it to is the scenes in posession movies where the \"demon\" is talking and the host is trying to fight it. I couldn't stop myself. My ears were whooshing. My body felt small but incredibly heavy and and this point I could tell my mom saw what was happening too. I wasn't just imagining this. She walked me to my room and I was scared because even more so than before, nothing felt right around me. I knew I was home, but it felt unfamiliar. She laid me in bed and it's almost like I slowly started coming back.\n\nFor the next 30 minutes my mom talked to me, telling me my name and my age. It was scary because I knew these things, but they felt wrong. I think the last thing that really helped me was looking in the mirror. Like I said before, looking in the mirror always seems to ground me when I'm anxious. My face felt wrong. My height felt wrong. My body (mostly my curves that come with age) felt wrong. It was almost comical to see that I had breasts. It was like I was seeing myself still as 5 year old me, looking at a picture of myself from the future. Slowly though, I was able to put together all of my pieces. My mom had to keep reminding me we were safe as we looked in the mirror together. She showed me the hair on her head (something that wasn't there as she went through chemo) and I sobbed. She made me repeat some positive phrases to myself as I looked in the mirror as well as making me repeat my name and age. I resurfaced, finally feeling like myself again. I was able to calm myself and get into bed. Though I was okay, I did feel shaken. \n\nToday, the events that took place last night feel blurry and scary. I am sorry that this post is so long and I am not expecting anyone to be a doctor and help me. I am embarrassed for how I acted. I just want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience or can tell me if they know what it is. I do have a psychiatrist and am working on getting into therapy. I keep trying to google what happened (I know I shouldn't self diagnose) but nothing seems to be coming up. If anyone has any answers or recommendations, I am open ears. Thank you for reading this if you finally made it to the end, and please no judgment. I just want answers and maybe a little help.",

        "title": "How I Barely Survived the Last Decade",
        "original": "Trigger warnings: Depression, suicide, self harm, anxiety, bullying, eating disorders\n\nFirst of all, I was only 5 at the beginning of the decade so I will be skipping forward a couple years. I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and gender dysphoria. A big part of my depression and anxiety comes from genetics but that has caused other issues that derived from the original genetic issue.\n\nMy earliest memory of depression was in 3rd grade (8/9 years old) when I was living in (arguably) the most beautiful place in the world for a year, Hawaii. I remember asking my parents if I could go to therapy because I was getting too upset too often, and that's about all that happened. I went to a therapist for a few months but then we moved back to my current home/state and nothing ever came after that for a few years. \n\nMy symptoms of depression and anxiety skyrocketed to become very severe when I got into 8th grade (11/12 years old I think). I also began going through puberty which anyone with gender dysphoria knows is one hell of a time. I was having a lot of social issues and began self harming a lot. A past classmate and friend who I confided in about my depression told my parents who found all my self harm marks and put me into therapy. \n\nI hate therapy and even the idea is therapy. The first therapist I saw did not help me at all. Part of that was my fault because I withheld so much information from her but another part was she just wasn't the right fit for me. I tried to put out my signals of distress many times to my friends but nothing came of those. Looking back I know it was unfair for me to expect a group of 12 year olds to help and deal with my severe depression especially when a lot of them were involved with the social issues I was having. \n\nOver the course of middle school (6th-8th grade) I also developed an eating disorder. This were never diagnosed by a professional because I never told anyone but I'd assume that forcing myself to throw up the lunch I just ate would classify me as bulimic. \n\nMiddle school ages are hard enough as it is but at that time it felt like I was dealing with 1 million added problems from my peers. I was honestly counting down the days until my mental illnesses took my life. I was only 12 years old. To add to all of this I was realizing I was bisexual and had a lot of internalized anxiety and self hatred for that. \n\nFast forward to 8th grade (13/14 years old) my parents had finally decided to transfer me to a different school since i was having so many issues. My 8th grade year was NOT perfect but it was at the time a massive improvement. \n\nIn 8th grade i became best friends with someone extremely manipulative. I hadn't noticed his manipulative nature, though, and was very dedicated and loyal to our friendship. This friendship caused me a lot of issues towards the end of 8th grade and in the beginning of highschool. \n\nOverall in middle school I believe I was hospitalized 3 times. Once in 7th grade and twice in 8th grade. 2 times were by my parents and once was from a \"medical professional\" who wrongfully called the hospital and forced me into hospitalization (I got out as soon as I talked to a doctor because that woman was in the wrong). \n\nIn 9th grade (14/15) I ended up going to the same high school as my now ex-friend, the manipulator. I still had a little hope we could repair our friendship but that hope quickly when he started spreading rumors about me and my mental health. At this point I was still 100% I the closet about my sexuality and gender, had stopped self harming, and I believe had recovered from my eating disorders.\n\nI had gotten into a long distance online relationship and while that relationship was not awful when it ended it took a hard toll on me. At that point I had had so many people I cared for leave me for seemingly no reason which has and still does cause me a lot of clingy issues to this day. \n\nIn late 9th grade I came out as bisexual and a transgender man. Shortly after that the therapist I had been talking to for 2+ years (who I loved and helped me a lot) said that she didn't think she was supporting me in a way I needed and advised i find a different therapist. That, understandably, messed me up. Like I said, I had an issue with people suddenly leaving which she knew and I felt very wronged by her decision. I did find a therapist, though, and still talk to him to this day. He is great. \n\nAt this point I had been on a bunch of medications. I started taking medication after my first hospitalization and have been on so many different kinds, doses, and mixtures that my mom keeps a list of everything I've tried. Medication has never helped me, I either get negative side effect or it had no effect at all. \n\nNow, in 10th grade (15/16). There have been a lot of ups and downs since me coming out and finding a new therapist but this post is already so long. My mental health has never improved as much as it did in late 2019.  Things still hurt me but it's been a long time since I last self harmed. People still leave me and that will always still hurt. The most recent person to leave (late November of 2019) had brought a lot of pain onto me. I had returned to one of the darkest places I had been in a very long time. I was very close to relapsing or killing myself. I cried harder than I had in months. But a few days later I had basically recovered completely. It has been the quickest recovery I have ever experienced. \n\nJust because my biggest improvements happened recently doesn't mean I was happy 24/7, trust me. The thing that changed for me is that I finally feel like I'm gaining control over myself and my emotions. \n\n\"I feel better.\"\n\n\"I feel better\" are words I never thought I'd be able to say honestly just a few years ago but it's true. I feel better. \n\nI will never be 100% perfectly ok and thats ok. I lost track of all the times I hurt myself, of all the times I threw up, the times I cried, and the times i tried to take my life. In middle school I thought I'd never live to be 20 years old. I know what it's like to be literal seconds away from killing myself. I've been there, I've taken the pills, I've tied the belt around my neck, I've held the blades, and I'm telling YOU that it's not the right answer. I am telling you, the person reading this, that it will get better. \n\nI'm 2 weeks away from turning 16 years old. I am no where near done with my mental health journey. Life sucks, it does and there's no denying that. \n\nBut it gets better.",

My mom hit me too many times to count when I was younger (and to this day she says \u201cit wasn\u2019t that hard\u201d) and my dad is the authoritarian old guy (57) that pays for everything and just watches football and gives very basic life advice and loves Jesus. My dad verbally and emotionally abused me, but never physically. My mom did all 3.\n\nI\u2019m at my all time low right now, I have no job and no friends. I fight with my parents all the time and I\u2019m totally isolated and withdrawn from the world. My parents seem to just stick to their routine and are waiting for me to go back to college and somehow make it all better. The rest of this is my life story, thanks for reading whatever you do. I don\u2019t blame you for skimming!\n\nI grew up as the boy genius. I was in the \u201chigh potential\u201d classes in elementary and even was taken out of school for an IQ test to see if a different school would be better. My IQ of 143 wasn\u2019t high enough so I stayed at the same school and took advanced classes. Throughout childhood I never had more than one \u201cclose friend\u201d and I was never their best friend. I loved playing with Yu-Gi-Oh cards and loved challenging myself intellectually. I played sports and talked stocks with my dad because that\u2019s what he likes (I liked the math part of the stock market). Elementary and middle school classes were easy for me and I always finished all my schoolwork before I got home. My insecurity got steadily worse when I started being excluded around 4th grade and realized I didn\u2019t really know how to make friends and interact in groups.\n\nMiddle school was hard socially. I had a couple friends that I met through school and even some popular kids \u201cliked\u201d me because we had a >$1m house and a boat and could afford to do fun things. I usually walked alone in the hallways and when I was with others I felt awkward and didn\u2019t say much. I sat with some of the more popular kids at lunch but didn\u2019t feel like I belonged and had much to say, or knew what to say. I never got invited to parties, and sat in the back of class. I spent my free time playing video games for days on end.\n\nHigh school was hard in most aspects. Grades steadily declined and I finished with a 2.6. I did tons of drugs and eventually quit all my activities, ended up barely graduating. Got into NDSU (86% accept rate). My friends were always just using buddies and \u201cleisure\u201d was getting high in someone\u2019s basement or tying up boats and drinking + cocaine and adderall. I had sex and even had a couple girlfriends like a \u201cnormal\u201d kid. Everything I did was to feel \u201cnormal\u201d and fit in although I was miserable and had low self esteem. My substance abuse problem was extreme and I was always high at home (usually weed). I rarely got invited to parties and kept playing video games to kill time.\n\nNever made friends in college and came home thanksgiving of first semester because I couldn\u2019t handle life alone. Ended up doing 30 grams of cocaine in a month, went psychotic, got an assault charge and went to rehab after 4 days in jail.\n\nThe last year has consisted of part time work and living with my parents while having no friends. \n\nThroughout my life, my parents pretty much just watched it all happen. From the day I was born they thought they could just send me off to school and buy food for the house. My mom works part-time with special ed kids, and my dad owns a wealth management business that earns him high 6 figures. Both grew up in small-towns with limited health support and had unstable relationships throughout their lives. They never gave me the \u201cbirds and the bees\u201d talk, never helped me with relationships, and mostly talked to me about my grades. The only advice I ever got came through platitudes and cliches and church. I hate my mom and idk about my dad but I feel like I\u2019m just nice to him because I\u2019m set to inherit $5m +.\n\nI made so many mistakes and probably just seem like a spoiled rich kid to everyone that reads this. I\u2019m sober right now and hope I am forever. I just want to feel like I belong in this world, but right now I\u2019m having a crisis of identity.",

I have been thinking of a very famous musician (which I will not name), who is two years older than me, almost nonstop. Sometimes, I fantasize about meeting her at a concert or seeing her on the street, which somehow turns into a relationship. I did not discover this musician until around a week ago, and now I listen almost exclusively to her music. On social media, I have talked quite extensively about this musician, often in an NSFW manner. At this point, I have listened to every one of her songs multiple times, and I have memorized the lyrics of most of these songs.\n\nIn addition, I have scrolled through both her Facebook and Instagram, and even tried to Google the venues she performed in. Last night (New Year's Eve at the time of posting), I stayed up until 2 AM refreshing Instagram to see if she posted something that I could reply to quickly and hopefully get her attention.\n\n(edit) These thoughts have permeated even into basic functions. For example, when I eat with my family, I often fantasize about going on a date with this musician and wondering if she would like the food. I am also beginning to dress like her (and she does not dress in clothing that is particularly \"female\")\n\nSome good has come out of this, though. For one, I find it easy to motivate myself to exercise every day, believing that I would eventually attract her. I am also starting to learn how to sing and play instruments as well as pick up new languages from her translated song lyrics. However, I am also studying for a science competition, and this obsession distracts me from the readings and work I have to do. \n\nIs there any solution?  \n\n\nEDIT: It's getting to the point where I am trying to make a song out of this issue",

        "original": "First of all, I would like to introduce myself. I am 22 years old, male and I study computer science. My problem is that I can't get my life in order. I have so many things that I want to get rid of, but I don't know where to start. Therefore, it will all seem pretty messy.I have a high school diploma, I study, I have a well-paid student job, great friends, a nice family, no money problems, I'm pretty healthy. At first glance, an almost perfect life. However, it's all a huge abstract house of cards that can collapse at any moment.I personally have huge problems motivating myself. That may sound like a simple problem, but it is not! While others have problems getting motivated to work in the garden, it starts with getting up, brushing my teeth and washing my clothes. My room is an absolute mess, I've been climbing into my bed for months and have to shovel the place to sleep. I brush my teeth 1-2 times a week, and that's actually occasions like parties or a visit to my parents. I wear socks 4-5 times until they almost stand alone. Everything you can't see is an absolute disaster. However, I get what you see pretty well. Showers, deo, clothes that fit together, at least so much that no one notices my remaining decay. My diet is shit, I only eat fast food and food orders and very irregularly. Sometimes 8,000 calories a day and then 2 days nothing (not even a small snack), I eat when you can no longer ignore it and then always a lot ... a whole family pizza is normal. I would say that I cannot motivate myself with everything that is primarily about me. So when I do something that doesn't benefit anyone else, I usually don't do it. My body has some basic needs that I satisfy and nothing more. The only thing I do for myself is playing on the computer. I can step into the game and forget everything around it. At parties I like to drink with a similar effect (I don't drink alcohol alone), I like to forget .All of this has meant that I did nothing in the past 4 years and nobody knows. My parents think I will finish my bachelor's degree next semester, I just did the exames of the first two semesters and then did not register for an exam afterwards. If my parents find out, they would be angry but understandfull, but I do not deserve it. Why can't I motivate myself? Why is it so difficult!!!!\n\nIt takes me away that I just can't make it. I can pull myself together for a week, but then fall back into old patterns. I have to pull myself together extremely every time. Otherwise I go to sleep for days, do nothing or go to Netflix.In addition, I have the feeling that I am mentally ill. I have not yet shed tears because of a death in the family and I can not imagine ever feeling grief. It doesn't make sense to me, after all, grief doesn't change anything. Generally I have a fairly rational and partly utilitarian worldview. I could kill a person without any tear, without remorse or sadness (I would  never do it for myself, and prop not even for someone else). I am extremely emotionless in many things ...\n\nAm i ill?

My ex has already threatened to take me to court to take away my kids because of past mental health (I have never and would never hurt them, it was more about only being present physically, but not mentally). I worry that if I talk, it'll ultimately end up in me losing my kids. This is a legitimate fear for me because my grandmother lost her MANY children because of extremely poor mental health (she spent most of my parent's childhood in a mental hospital).\n\nRight now, I feel like Lando Calrissian when that sand beast is pulling him in a little at a time. Suicide feels (for the first time in my life) like an inevitability. I feel like I can spend the next x number of years holding it at bay, but I'll eventually lose the fight. The thought of fighting every day, all day, indefinitely is exhausting.\n\nI have some chronic health issues I've been dealing with for a couple of years with no answers from any of my many doctors. I have a therapist and an appointment with a psychiatrist to hopefully get me balanced (I'm bipolar) on some medication. It's been a countdown to that appointment. I keep telling myself to hold it together until then. Ironically, the first appointment they had available was the day I scheduled my suicide (careful timing and circumstances to minimize impact and trauma). I've told myself that I can last a bit longer and see if there's any improvement, but that if there isn't that I don't have to exist just for the sake of existence.\n\nFrankly, I don't know how much longer I can last. Every day is a struggle to the point of barely (if I'm lucky) functioning. I'm a drain on my family's resources and patience, and a leech on my friends' and family's emotions. I'm just putting everyone through a lot of shit for an ending that will probably be the same whether it's tomorrow or 10 years from now.

        "original": "- I'm sick with a cold. Being sick has left me weak, and I've been feeling really depressed as a result.\n\n- I have no more sick leave, so I've missed 3 days pay. Due to Xmas and New Years most doctors offices are closed. I had to go to the after hours clinic for a doctors note. It cost me $100 - about a day's pay.\n\n- I found out from a coworker today that my manager at work has been telling lies about me. She told my coworkers that she gave me $350 for doctors visits and counselling. She never did this. I never asked her to. I never would have taken it. I'm bewildered. it's such a bizarre lie. nothing to gain. Easily disproven. And a good way to get herself fired if i choose to pursue action (which i am). Luckily the people she told smelled bullshit immediately and contacted me.\n\n- I feel particularly hurt by this for 2 reasons. First, I've always admired her kindness and generosity. This gossipy behaviour has removed my rose tinted glasses and now I feel betrayed. Second, according to my coworkers, my manager has displayed strange lying, manipulative behaviour for some time now, which I have largely taken with a grain of salt (innocent until proven guilty). The stupidity of some of her behaviour contrasted with her sweetness at other times makes me think maybe she's not being intentionally vindictive. Maybe she is growing mentally ill due to her age (60s)? The thought makes me very sad.\n\n- I'm scared of taking this to the higher ups, because if she IS unwell, she may feel betrayed by ME and I don't want to upset her. But I know if she is unwell then we need to address her behaviour and force her to seek help asap.\n\n- In ither news, my parents have been divorced for some time. In my teens I moved into my sisters house because I couldnt stand being both my parent's \"bitching post\". Anytime one of them was angry, they would hold me verbally hostage while they complained about the other one. I am now 24. I am temporarily living with my dad. My dad never realised he was doing that stuff to me. He always blamed my mum for making me want to leave, because she was abusive in other ways. Today dad and I got talking and I told him (without malice or anger) that it wasn't JUST mum who scared me off. This new knowledge really upset him. I could see him trying to shake it off and cheer me up with jokes later in the conversation, but I could see the regret and sadness and guilt on his face. I still want to cry thinking about it. I feel horrible for telling him. I no longer hold anger towards him for doing that - it was wrong, but he was under a lot of stress and I understand that - I wish I had shut my damn mouth.\n\n- Later on, he alluded to wanting to die. He has said this stuff before as a joke, but I think this time he genuinely felt it. I sobbed like a child. He realised what he said. Tried to joke and cheer me up. Miserably failed.\n\n- He got drunk and told me some family lore. My mum may have been sexually abused as a child.\n\n- I've recently realised that a large number of people in my family suffer from mental illness. My immediate family is largely clear, but my mum's side is riddled with it. I am scared that my mental health issues are biological - not a product of my environment. I have never been diagnosed and I always held hope that maybe I'm a 'healthy' person going through rough times. I see now that may not be the case. I know it's nit a death sentence, but after hearing about my family from dad, I feel like it is.\n\nI dunno. That's where I'm at. My boyfriend is out of town. I wish I could just hug him and cry. Instead I'm laying on the living room couch in the dark, writing this, trying not to cry because this house has FUCK ALL sound proofing and I don't want my little siblings or my dad to know how messed up I feel right now.",

        "original": "So a few weeks after moving to a new area (we're in South London), the missus tells me of some guy who shouted 'morning' at her aggressively, said he frightened her a bit. Said she said morning back and carried on. Didn't think much of it, but then the next day she said she saw the same guy coming into our building as she was leaving and he shunted the glass door aggressively towards her, nearly hitting her and shouted morning again aggressively. Then he carried out on shouting and pointing at things. Drops a newspaper and leaves and marches off past her, muttering something aggressively under his breath. She snaps a photo of him from behind on her phone.\n\nSo she reports this back to me and I'm trying to work out exactly what the deal is. The man is a newspaper delivery guy. Must do the rounds in the morning. So clearly he's just started working the area recently and now she has to see this guy every day at the same time. No-one else around either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast night the missus doesn't sleep worrying about him. I didn't realise it was bothering her that much, or that it was that big a deal, but she's not the best as communicating situations like this to be honest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, this morning I decide to stake the guy out from up above as I can see three sides of the area from our place. Sure enough, around 7:45 he's marching down the street.\n\nAnd then it hits me. I can see why the missus is stressed out. He's clearly had a hard life this guy. Likely was homeless, or looks like it. He's pointing at windows, shouting random things at them and storming about with his bright yellow newspaper bag. He'll stop abruptly and give a house the fingers V, then march off again, arms swinging wildly.\n\nAnd yes, he comes back round to our place, someone in one flat downstairs must be on his paper round. He delivers the paper, throws arms in air, makes some proclamation and off he goes again down the road, stopping occasionally to give random windows this time the fingers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately missus joins me and sees some of this, and it freaks her out even more.\n\nSo yes, we have a problem now. Missus doesn't feel safe. My instinct is divided. Part of me thinks the guy has mental health issues but is likely harmless. Part of me feels a current of danger, exacerbated by the fact a young man was stabbed to death here recently on his way to the same tube station the missus takes, by another man with mental health issues.\n\nMissus is talking about moving again, even though we only just moved to this area to save money while saving to buy a place. Area is a bit deprived, and maybe moving to somewhere a bit nicer would be better I guess. But that process would take one month minimum (our notice period - luckily it's our friend's flat so not tied into a long contract and no deposit).\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas or insight they can lend. I'm not really sure what to do. I'm thinking to work out his paper run, then plot a time and route the missus can take to the tube. I can escort her earlier than usual to the tube for a bit until that's done. Either way it's an odd situation and not something we need right now.\n\nOther considerations - are we overreacting, or are we not taking it seriously enough? It's just so hard to know what to do. He's obviously the greatest victim here so I'm cautious about reporting this to anyone, especially his employer. The paper round might be the last thing holding him together for all we know.",

        "title": "Looking For Advice For Schizoaffective Disorder And Memory Loss",
        "original": "Hello! First time poster, first time lurker. Excuse any faux pas I may inadvertently create.\n\nTo start, I (F24) see both a psychiatrist and a therapist already. I am on Lithium and Abilify which seem to work with varying degrees of success. I sometimes struggle with taking the Lithium consistently as the pills are rather large and I am a baby when it comes to swallowing pills. I am diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder.\n\nThings started getting bad around 2017. I was home alone in my room when I heard someone come up the stairs and walk around the loft. I thought it was my roommate. I checked my window and saw only my car in the drive way. I was immediately frightened and thought someone had broken into the house, but couldn\u2019t make sense of that because since the footsteps I had heard nothing else. But with some inexplicable certainty I\u00a0knew\u00a0I was not alone.\n\nThroughout this I texted my boyfriend, too scared to call and make noise. I must have stayed in my room for at least an hour before I gained the courage to leave my room. My bf had suggested perhaps a shower would calm me down.\n\nDuring the shower a face haunted me in the background. I\u2019d look over my shoulder and it would just be there, sallow skin and an abyss for eyes.\n\nThat was the first time\u2014definitively\u2014that I hallucinated.\n\nI think from just the bizarreness of the situation, my bf at the time did not quite take the situation seriously. I wouldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t believe me, but more thought my fear was getting the better of me. I spent the rest of the night locked in my room.\nSoon after, with my bf of the time spending the night with me, I went downstairs to get the laundry out of the dryer and to get a bowl of ice cream. While getting the laundry I heard the dog tags chime from my small Chihuahua, Dandy, coming down the stairs to follow me. I turned around to greet him but he wasn\u2019t there. I was confused, but not scared.\nAs I walked toward the kitchen I caught the reflection of Dandy in the sliding glass door. I looked from the reflection to where he would be standing only to find nothing there. Again, I passed it off as nothing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was getting the ice cream that I knew something was wrong. As I grabbed the bowls I saw a woman in my dining room, just standing there staring at me. I froze. I couldn\u2019t speak. I couldn\u2019t move. I knew what I was seeing wasn\u2019t real, I\u00a0knew\u00a0it wasn\u2019t, but all the same I felt like a child left alone in the dark: paralyzed.\n\nEventually I was able to budge and I ran up the stairs crying to my bf. I think that\u2019s when we both decided that it wasn\u2019t just me being scared, something was wrong. I had already been seeing a psychiatrist for mood swings\u2014diagnosed as Cyclothymia\u2014for a month or so. When I went back to my doctor and explained what had happened, he diagnosed me as Bipolar instead. I did not particularly agree with this doctor, got a second opinion, went through some kind of testing, and was finally diagnosed with Schizoaffective.\n\nAround the time of the hallucinations, it started to become apparent that I had other issues as well. Paranoia for one. If I don\u2019t keep up with my medication I get this idea in my head that my pills are not\u00a0my\u00a0pills, and that if I take them I could get hurt. Currently, however, the most pressing issue that has me the most concerned has to do with my memory.\n\nI have gone to a neurologist (I think that\u2019s what he was). I have done verbal tests and gotten a CT scan done. Though with the verbal tests he said I scored below average, for the CT scan he said I was clear.\nMy concern, however, is that I can lose hours at a time. The latest incident involved my bf and I fighting that ended with us breaking up. It started in the morning and lasted into the afternoon. I remember that we started talking calmly about some issues we had been having, and then the next thing I know I am bawling my eyes out, he\u2019s leaving\u2014pissed\u2014and I am begging him to stay. I have no idea what we talked about. I have no idea how things escalated to the point that they did. It\u2019s just a blank space\u2014nothing. I have no clue of what I said at all.\n\nI suppose my main reason for posting here is to know if other people, specifically those that suffer from mood disorders, experience the same lapse in time. My doctor\u2019s say there\u2019s nothing wrong, but I feel like that just can\u2019t be right. I will be seeing my psychiatrist and therapist soon, and plan to bring it up again, but I thought coming to Reddit might shed some light on the situation\u2014or at least get me peace of mind or advice from those in the same situation or similar.",

        "title": "The ten most important things I've learned about healing from childhood trauma",
        "original": " As the year has ended and the inevitable finish line of a decade is upon us, I decided to compile my thoughts on the changes and shifts of the state of my mental health. This is a top ten list about my most significant mental health and trauma recovery lessons. Quick background: ACE score of ten.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n**1:** No one is out to get me. - I swear this is the part about recovering from trauma and abuse that no one mentions. The world, as it turns out, is, in fact, not against me. I had been all but wrong for years. I thought and felt that because of what I came from and the people around me that I must have done something wrong in a former life. Why else would so many awful acts of violence and anger happen to me? Well, as I would discover in my late 20\u2019s, the universe, despite my misgivings, is, in fact, always working in your favor. What I didn\u2019t know is that the favor is all dependent on my actions. My choices and decisions led to an outcome that more often than not, was negative. So, what did I do? I shifted the way that I am in the world, and because of that, I realized that my decisions yielded specific ramifications. No one is out to get me except me. Taking ownership of my choices in life wholly erased the narrative that some unsightly underworldly people were after me.\u00a0\n\n**2:** Fitness is a factor in healing trauma. - I didn\u2019t get to 350 lbs overnight. That took some real herculean effort. And almost ten years after getting serious about my physical health, I still go hard at the gym, Crossfit, Muay Thai, and other various activities. Countless studies have correlated mental health to physical health. Walking for just 20 minutes a couple of times a day can change your life. Don\u2019t believe me? Google it. It\u2019s was difficult to be motivated to take care of my physical health because my mental health was so weak, but it was in doing so that I began to see real changes start to occur in my life. Through a series of tiny baby steps, I went from doing DDPYoga in my townhouse living room to fighting with some of the best martial artists in Thailand. Those steps took years.\u00a0\n\nPutting fitness first as a cornerstone to creating a healthy life is without question, the best choice I have made in my journey of healing my body. The brain and body connection is severed when recovering from childhood trauma and abuse, and thus I had to get them reconnected. Pushing my physical limits not only helped to change my body, but it led me to be able to understand the depths of my mental capacity in a way I had not until lying on the ground gasping for air, knowing that I gave a workout my all.\u00a0\n\n**3**: Asking for help will set you up for success. - It was embarrassing to admit that I was hurt as a child. I stuffed that shit down so deep that even James Cameron couldn\u2019t find it in one of those fun little submarines. I hide my hurt, anger, and pain from myself and the world; until I couldn\u2019t anymore. It rose from the depths, and when I did, I realized that I could no longer carry the burden of my past alone. I had to seek help.\u00a0\n\nHelp came in many forms. I had to open up to my then partner, my siblings, and ultimately the dozens of therapists that I worked my way through. Help to me meant saying that I couldn\u2019t coop on my own anymore and that I needed a support system. Help meant that when I felt my lowest that I reached out to the people around me. Asking for help as a trauma survivor is like asking an astronaut to take off their helmet in outer space, it\u2019s probably not going to happen. However, as I would discover, the only way I was going to heal from trauma was to be willing to do what felt impossible and ask for support.\n\n**4**: Saying sorry is not a weakness. - Sorry was not a word that I heard very often growing up, and when I did, it felt halfhearted. When I would apologize, I never meant it. I thought for a long time that I was a sociopath because of my actions, regardless of how unjust or unkind, never made me feel any particular way. I had to learn how to feel sorrow and sadness for my actions and the impact of the people around me. Learning to let go of the idea that feeling sorry and genuinely meaning it was weak was an uphill battle for me. I had to let go of whatever ego held onto my manic desire to always be in the right, and in doing so, I have been able to form deeper connections with the people around me. I had a lot of apologizing to do for everything that happened from twelve to twenty-nine years old. I discovered that in being able to use the word and feel sorry for my actions that I became closer to me and further from the trauma that was imbued in my childhood.\u00a0\n\n**5:** Not all of my friends are \u201cfriends.\u201d - As I changed and stepped further into my healing journey, I noticed that many of the people that I had invested time stayed the same. I felt a disconnect between the person I was becoming and the people they were. I am not saying this is a good or bad thing; I am just saying that this is my reality. No rule says people will change along with you, and more often than not, they don\u2019t. That\u2019s why most relationships fail when one person seeks growth, and the other is set in their way. A growth mindset is critical in overcoming childhood trauma, but so are friends that want to grow with you. As I moved closer to becoming the person I am today, I simultaneously moved further from the people that wanted me to be the same.\u00a0\n\nFriends should want to support you, raise you up, and help you grow, but the sad truth is that they don\u2019t have to, and it isn\u2019t their job. It\u2019s your job to do that for yourself. It\u2019s your job to build a community of support around you. And it\u2019s your job to step away from those that do not have your best interest in mind.\u00a0\n\n**6:** Self-care means doing the hard shit. - I am so incredibly lazy. I wish I had the words to convey that in a way that would make sense. I hate doing stuff. I dislike going to the gym, reading, writing, journaling, meditating, eating healthy, and staying in routine. I loathe the idea that I have to take care of myself, and I can\u2019t stand the fact that every day I have to show up for myself. Life would be so much easier if I could stay in bed all day and not do anything; it would also be a disaster. The ability to force myself into a constant flow of doing things that I don\u2019t want to do has been the most significant catalyst in understanding myself after childhood trauma. In a word, it is AGENCY that has led me down a path of success. It is in the knowledge that doing hard things and making difficult choices is why I am where I am today.\u00a0\n\nSelf-care is about being uncomfortable in owning who I am. I often wonder what my life would look like if I stayed on the path I was heading. I would surely be dead. I can\u2019t imagine a possible positive outcome of drinking and smoking and fucking myself to death. It would have been Leaving Los Vegas without the Oscars.\u00a0\n\n**7:** When the going gets tough...Cry. - This one is a real doozy. If there were an order for this list, crying would be somewhere near the top. Without a doubt being able to step into fully owning my full range of emotions has set me up for a very bright outlook on the future that is ahead. Being able to tap into my feelings has not come easy and certainly not without spiral after spiral of getting trapped in some. When I first began to \u201cfeel,\u201d I was terrified because most of my emotion capacities had been in the \u201coff\u201d more since I was around nine years old. I used to tell people that I was always even and level-headed, but the truth is that I was a wreck inside.\u00a0\n\nBeing able to step into my emotions fully took years of intensive therapy, writing, sharing, and getting uncomfortable. It is not only crying that falls into this lesson learned, but experiencing everything from dread and sorrow to love and lust has made me feel more human. In American Psycho, Patrick Bateman says, \u201cAnd though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.\u201d The opening monologue of the film seemed more like my life\u2019s mantra until I figured out that accepting emotions is the very thing that makes me human.\u00a0\n\n**8:** Reading is fundamental. - I didn\u2019t go to college. Hell, I didn\u2019t even graduate high school on time. Yet, I have a vigor for learning that is only superseded by my want and desire to teach. I have been an avid reader for the majority of my life, but typically only when it comes to topics that hold my interests. If you give me a book about the Industrial Revolution, it would likely sit on my bookshelf for the remainder of my life, but if you give me a book like The Body Keeps The Score, now you have my interest. From being an entrepreneur to a public speaker and now an author, I have had to educate myself the old-fashioned way through the written word.\u00a0\n\nThe amount of education that you can receive from a few bucks in late fees at the library or awesomely-random Goodwill finds will blow your minds. Currently and for the last couple of years, I have read about a book a week but typically no less than three a month. It is the words scribed on these countless pages that have helped me understand myself, the world, how to heal childhood trauma, and how to show up for myself.\u00a0\n\n## These are my 10 favorite books of the last 10 years that have helped me heal trauma \n\n(In no particular order and not based on year released but when I read them):\u00a0\n\n1. Life of Pi - Yann Martel - I don\u2019t ever read fiction. This is one of two I\u2019ve read as an adult. Life of Pi is so beautiful and inspiring.\n2. Jay-Z Decoded - Jay-Z -My first real hero. If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.\n3. Jab, Jab, Jab Right Hook. - Gary Vaynerchuk - A real entrepreneur bible of sorts.\u00a0\n4. Mindset - Carol Dweck - Everything you need to know about the capacity for change is in these pages\n5. Radical Acceptance - Tara Brach - The way we talk to ourselves will either make us better or worse. One of my favorite books ever.\n6. The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog - Bruce Perry - The stories in this book will haunt you and make you want to change the world.\n7. Can\u2019t Hurt Me - David Goggins - READ THIS BOOK\n8. Bossy Pants - Tina Fey - There is no such thing as an overnight success\n9. On Writing - Stephen King - If you want to be a good writer, you have to be a good reader.\n10. Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill - Just read it!  \n\n\n**9:** If you don\u2019t stand for something, you will fall for anything. - I had to figure out what the hell my values were and not just in a figurative sense. I had lived so much life without meaning or purpose and without acknowledgment of the person that I wanted to be. I had no idea of the person that I was because I hadn\u2019t dived deep enough into myself to make a declaration about what it meant to be me. MOST people have no idea of what their values are, and for the majority of my life, I was right beside them. Values are the baseline for the way I now live my life. It may have taken me thirty years to figure them out, but without doing so, I would not be where I am now.\n\nTake time and think about what values hold true to the person that you are and the person that you want to be. It is in understanding myself in an authentic way that I was able to make healthy choices and create agency where needed amid difficult choices.\u00a0\n\nThese are my core values (in this particular order):\n\n1. Honesty\n2. Kindness\n3. Leadership\n4. Self-Actualization\n5. Momentum  \n\n\n**10:** The road is long. - I used to think there would be an end to this whole \u201ctrauma thing.\u201d I would come home from a therapy session or massage or finish another world-changing book and think, \u201cthis is the last piece of the puzzle.\u201d I don\u2019t think this way anymore. I understand the scope of healing in such a way that I have acknowledged that this process simply will not end. I don\u2019t know that it will always be so arduous, but there is no day in my future that I get to hang up the child abuse hat and get to wear the \u201cI\u2019m a normal guy now\u201d hat. I have rationalized that in every way that I can and it has left me with the idea of there is no other choice than to put my boots on, step onto the road, and to continue the journey until there is no more. This is why I wrote my book Think Unbroken and why I believe that no matter what we must stay the path!\n\nMichaelUnbroken",

        "original": "Hello folks,\n\nI stumbled upon this subreddit and felt like writing. To be perfectly frank... things have been better before, I feel pretty clueless as of late.  \nFirst of all my first language isn't English so I want to apologize if I write in a confusing manner.  \nWhat brings me here is ADHD that has been diagnosed one year ago - I am 30 years old today. I guess my ADHD was apparent most of my childhood, although it was said that I am just lazy and I could be so much better in school if I simply \"was working harder\" and all sorts of negative messages like this.  \nTurns out... I am in night school today and about to fail another time. I have literally failed every school I have ever attended and didn't graduate from high school.  \nMost of my friends are academics, my girlfriend is as well. I feel like everyone gets math but me. It's like the final enemy I can't seem to beat.  \nLanguages? Anything else that is of interest of me? No problem whatsoever! But math, and lots of scientific subjects for that matter, simply are impossible for me to fully grasp. I have issues with the simplest things like order of operations or prime factorization...  \nThe frustrating bit is that I always get it as long as I study, but I have so many gaps in that subject that I just can't seem to study it systematically. There is no real progress, no flow. It feels like I always have to start from the beginning which becomes very, very frustrating.\n\nI have tried stimulants to sharpen my mind, to get a hold of it. But somehow... The emotional component of ADHD gets the better of me and chokes off my every try.  \nActually I think I have big attachment issues. Well, my mom was 16 when she gave birth to me and my father bailed. Today I am very focused on my girlfriend and I think at times it scares her. Problem is... Her attachment style is obviously dismissive/avoidant while mine is 100% anxious.  \nTo those who heard about the \"anxious avoidant trap\" this might be a clear no-no. And well, what should I say... Sometimes we both are completely irrational. She obviously pushes my buttons, I push hers. The closer I get, the more she backs off. And what confuses me is that sometimes she gets really close, wants to cuddle all day, laughs a lot with me... And then she gets all distant and dismissive again for a few day which completely wrecks me every time it happens - it's a cycle that is repeating itself.  \nSaddest bit is... Whenever a conflict comes up, I just can't seem to get a hold of my emotions - they get the better of me. I write incredibly long letters, shower her with affection, try to be as close to her as possible, all while she just wants to be left alone and wants some me-time.  \nCommunication completely shuts down during this times, it's perfectly normal for her to disappear for hours and not answer me.  \nWe talked it through countless times... And she actually thinks we're onto something with the subject of attechment theory - at first she dismissed the idea and said it was a load of bull... But now she openly states that she sees the pattern and realizes her own part of the misery.\n\nPeople, I just don't know where to go from from here.  \nI have seen a shrink for a few months but I couldn't really progress with him... I have been reading quite a lot on attachment issues and ADHD as well, but somehow all the information I have gathered doesn't really help me with my core issues.\n\nI feel like losing it sometimes... As if it's all some sort of self-fulfilling prophecy that blows itself up once one of the two things fails - school or my relationship.  \nDon't get me wrong, I am really a calm guy. I talk to my girlfriend in the sweetest manner, never yell and never become physical - but her ways make me constantly seek \"serious talks\" about the way she acts that are just like fights or conflicts to her... And it clearly is not doing us a favor.\n\nI'm afraid my girl is no real help, either. Some of my friends say she's way too selfish and self-absorbed and part of me agrees. She really is not all that emotional and sometimes I wonder how I could ever get so close with her. But at the same time I know that she has been forbidden to cry when she was a kid and her parents are dismissive and unavailable even to this day... So I guess it's not really her fault and I can't blame her - but still have to acknowledge that her way isn't always good for me.  \nI still want her in my life and love her very much, just the thought of losing her saddens me deeply. I want to make this work... For her and me.\n\nSo... what am I to do? I think I have tried and read it all. Am I doomed to be miserable? Is there no way out of this? Will rejection sensitivity associated with ADHD always be in the back of my head, waiting to fire up?\n\n  \nI'm thankful for any insight/tips/experiences! Thank you so much for reading this far.",

        "title": "Do I have ADHD/depression/anxiety? Or am I just simply lazy?",
        "original": "Hi, everyone. I'm sorry if you get a lot of posts like mine. \n\nI'm a 24 y/o woman in college (senior year) and my life is in shambles. It has been for the longest time, but I feel like I've hit yet another new low. My gpa is in the lowest it has been because of the missed final papers and homeworks. I've long given up any hope of living a happy life, but regardless, I still want to try everything I can to fix myself. \n\nMy mental health journey--\n\nFor the longest time I thought I had depression, but the two therapists didn't think to refer me to a a psychiatrist and the doctor I visited didn't think I was depressed, he said I showed more symptoms of anxiety than depression. Still, I received no suggestion of general anxiety disorder treatments. Recently I came accross something called adult ADHD and I thought the symptom descripions really match me. I took several self diagnosis tests but only half of them came out as positive. So I want to hear other people's thoughts on it based on my symptoms. I'm not asking to be diagnosed here, of course. I'm going to a doctor as soon as possible. I just want to hear if these ring any bells to people. I just want some sort of confirmation and maybe an assurance that I'm not crazy for throwing money at random hospital bills. So these are my symptoms.\n\n\nAs an adult--\n\nI procrastinate\n\nIt takes ages to to start a task, sometimes I never start\n\nI'm forgetful\n\nI'm bad at time management (missed 2 plane rides, almost missed a plane ride because I underestimated the time it would take to get to the departure gate)\n\nI'm awful at making a plan and sticking to it\n\nIt's hard to remember names and faces, even some people I care about and like\n\nI get hyper-focused on things that interest me\n\nI am awful at keeping in touch with people\n\nI put off answering messages all the time\n\nI'm addicted to internet and smart phone\n\nI'm unable to meet deadlines\n\nEasy tasks that I find boring are hard to do\n\nSmall talks are hard for me sometimes\n\nIt's hard to stay focused listening or watching something (keep zoning out)\n\nI get hung up on one task, am therefore unable to move on to doing other tasks\n\nI hate waiting in line\n\nI constantly seek distractions. I am always reading something/watching something/listening to something.\n\n\nI feel apathetic/emotionally numb sometimes\n\nI feel stupid, lazy, and inhuman.\n\nI feel like other people are naturally capable of things that I am uncapable of doing, like I was born without an organ that other people have been born with\n\nAs a child--\n\nI missed lot of social cues\n\nI didn't follow the social rules and caused a lot of frustrations in peers\n\nI was always an outsider\n\nTasks that required patience and concentration frustrated me, to the point of giving up (origami)\n\nI would quit a game mid-way if it looked like I was going to lose\n\nI sometimes wandered off to do random things when given a group task\n\nI was horrible at doing homeworks and studying for subjects I was bad at\n\nI missed a lot of lessons on purpose, because I didn't do homeworks for them\n\nSo yeah. Basically everything I can think of.\n\n\nThis is basically my last hope. I tried therapy, I tried getting diagnosis for depression. None worked. Now it's like I'm throwing the mental health spaghetti at the wall and hoping anything to stick. At the back of my head there is always the thought that this is all meaningless waste of time, that I know the answer to my own question already but I'm ignoring it because I'm too much of a coward, that despite all these efforts to diagnose myself, I'm just simply lazy and nothing more. \n\nThat's my biggest fear. Because laziness is not a medical condition. There is no treatment for laziness. I have no excuse. \n\nI used to have some hopes in my life. I wanted to adopt 2 cats and live in a small apartment. But even that seems impossible to achieve now. I'm so behind my peers, I have no credentials, I have no qualifications, I have no career plan. I don't even know what industry I want to get a job in. I don't know how jobs or companies work. I'm a baby, but only I'm not, because I'm a god damn 24 year old. Now I just brace myself for death. If I just hold it long enough, if I close my eyes and hum to myself, some day I'll be dead. That looks like the only realistic future plan I can have. Does any of this makes sense? Probably not. I can't even make sense of what I wrote. I'm sorry for rambling. \n\nTl;dr-- I'm suspecting I have ADHD and I want to get some perspective from people if my symptoms sound familiar or relatable.",

        "original": "So I've been seeing a psychiatrist for about a year. I've given her a chance because my doctor's office and insurance are set up in such a way that I must see a psychiatrist who is in the same office as my primary care. This office shares information about their patients between the primary care, psychiatrist, and therapist (when necessary). I like this set up because it makes most things easier.\n\nI get along well with my primary care and don't want to lose him because my insurance is shit and it took so long to find him. But my psych and I have always clashed. Our personalities just don't mesh. I'm bad at being assertive, which I'm working on, but she seems to take advantage of this by pushing meds and changes in lifestyle which I don't want. I always at least try whatever she suggests and I tell her if/when it doesn't work out. \n\nShe called today accusing me of not taking my meds because I cancelled our last appointment (end of November) and her next available was not until Jan 7. I told her she sent in refills and I'd been taking them as normal. She asked \"are you being honest with me?\" I have never lied or given a reason for her to believe I'd lie.\n\nNow, since I have to go to that same office for my PCP and therapist (and for a new psych if I do switch) I'll probably be running into her - and to be honest I just don't like her at this point. I'm always respectful though and I'm sure she has no idea how I feel about her. But after being prescribed meds that made me very sick and being asked \"are you sure the problem isn't just that you don't want to take them, because you said one time that you dislike taking so many meds?\" She didn't believe I had the spins and vomiting for the 5 days I took them. And I have been over prescribed. I was on 10 meds; down to 8 now - still too many, I think, for a 32 year old. And 5 of those are prescribed by her. (I have bipolar disorder, insomnia, anxiety, high blood pressure, and nerve damage.) Being told to go to bed at 8pm is also ridiculous (I don't have to be up early for work and have never gone to bed that early, even as a child.) And being told to quit marijuana - which was understandable and I did because she said it can make other meds less effective. But I started again because it helps with my pain and anxiety issues, and because I saw no change in the efficacy of my meds either way. \n\nI'm just so tired of it all, but I'm not sure if I should leave her or just live with the fact that we often disagree and that she just rubs me the wrong way. How would I even explain my reasoning to her, especially in such a way not to raise any red flags to my therapist, PCP, or the new psychiatrist? And what if I end up not liking the other psych either - or liking them less? There are only two in that office. Would I be able to go back to her if I decide she was better than the new psychiatrist? \n\nSorry for the long post and thank you to anyone who replies. I'm just so worried and stressed about seeing her this Tuesday.",

I know it's probably kind of stupid, but I'm very active online and off, and I can't really go out without my phone or contact any of my friends because all the apps I use to talk to them are phone apps.\n\nI filed a claim with my phone company for a replacement, but I researched that the phones they send are refurbished, which I don't really like because I've dealt with fault phones because of this reason. I'm hoping because my phone type just came out 6 months ago they'll send me a new one because I loved my phone. It was brand new and so much better than my last one. \n\nEven worse is that I can't contact my boyfriend about much of anything because we're long distance and rely so much on my phone to talk to each other. All of my anxiety-reducing stuff is on my phone so now I'm scrambling trying to keep myself calm with other stuff like puzzles and word searches and music just to fill in all this time I have without talking to anyone. \n\nAnd what's worse is that they took a $99 deductible for my replacement which they said I was getting back, but now it turns out they're not even though I have insurance for my phone. Which I'm paying extra every month for. I haven't showered since I broke my phone and I probably won't until I get everything in order but its been so bad.\n\nI've had like 3 or 4 panic attacks in the past few days because it's like, I'm so reliant on my phone to handle all of my everyday tasks and to contact my mom and my friends and my boyfriend but now that I don't have that I am stuck at home with no one but myself.

I had even stages of working out, running every day. Lately I am learning so much and working so much on school that I barely have any time. I thought it would make me happy, and yeah, it makes me happy a little bit (high grades, bright and clear future), but I still have something on my mind, and I don't know what it is. \n\nCurrently the passage of time is killing me, but I am sure that I will just talk with people, think about it a lot, and in the end I will just stop thinking about time (like really, now, every good moment i have, it passes so fast I can't even see it).

I have been and am currently on medication for my depression and anxiety. This past May I was able to finally gain my Bachelor of arts degree. Although I wish to do grad school to pursue a career in Academia.\n\nI have always had difficulty finding employment, even part-time. I have worked part time at a movie theater, had a full-time job for 3-4 months a Frys electronics before the strain completely burned me out and I had to leave, managed to get a student position at my college (was super easy and I would have had to steal money to actually get fired, as I was depressed and lethargic in the job, and often late). I had to leave that job end of September as I had graduated, and even though I started applying to various positions in May, had a number of interviews, I only got a $9 per hour temp job ending end of the month at a college book store beginning of December ( my degree and job experience really took me far). I seem to have started feeling more depressed and feeling a great deal of anxiety from my job which is odd. It seems I have a pattern of quickly becoming stressed and feeling greatly depressed at the jobs i have had ( I really know know how I did the movie theater job as I'm not sure I could do it again). All this has made me start to consider if finding and keeping a job at my level of qualifications is a result of my mental health issues. I like to hope grad level work would open up doors to work I might be encouraged and motivated by having which lasts.\n\nThis is the first time I have really considered my issues my be enough of a disability to qualify for social security. My Asbpergers seems to be different enough that I actually am good at literature and like some social interaction ( had to learn almost as if by wrote to pick up social ques and learn ways to respond, especially in first meetings, still have trouble in some areas though and can get very anxious figuring out how to respond or start interacting in situations I am not familiar with it are not typical) but don't like math and am not tech savvy, so I don't seem to fit the standard image. I thought I did well in all my interviews but maybe I did not, which prevented me for being hired for certain positions, perhaps my aspbergers and anxiety effected me more than I thought.\n\nDoes it sound like I might qualify for some social security so I might be in a better situation to try and pursue a path I can actually end up with a decent job I can be satisfied in?

It would last for a couple of minutes max and I would only get it every now and then. In early 2019, I stopped getting them and I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s due to the fact that I moved from an isolated area and back to the city where my family was but those attacks being gone was short lived, as my mum passed away in April. My attacks weren\u2019t too bad after she passed but in the last few months or so, they\u2019ve escalated to the point where I have almost 3 or so a day. \n\nLast month (Dec 2019), I went to stay next to my old house where I lived with my mother because I was there for a house sitting job, but during this time my attacks escalated to collapsing on the ground, hyperventilating, almost screaming, crying and trying to pull at anything I could. This happened when I was awake and I somehow also woke up having a similar attack at 3am. \n\nThen this morning happened, again at 3am, a different type of panic attack that lasted almost an hour. While my best friend was sleeping next to me, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to wake them knowing they have work this morning. I dug my nails into my arms like I usually do and did my best to fall asleep only to wake up this morning feeling like absolute trash and crying on my best friends shoulder. \n\nAll of these panic attacks relate to being hyper-aware of my own mortality and the time I have left. It gets in the way of me being able to enjoy even the most simple things, like watching a TV series or a movie. I get triggered by so much, even words in the past tense can sometimes send me into a panic. \n\nI did see a psychologist long before, within the year it first started but it didn\u2019t help much at all.\n\nI know some people might say \u201cat least you\u2019re not suicidal\u201d but I do have depression and I do know what it\u2019s like to want to jump in front of a moving vehicle but please understand, the fear that I live with on the daily basis is now so incapacitating that I struggle to live a normal life. I can\u2019t go a day without an attack anymore. \n\nSo if anyone has any advice or can even tell me if what I\u2019m feeling are panic attacks or something else, please, do help.

        "original": "\nPART ONE:\n\u201cBaby, I\u2019m HERE! \u2764\ufe0f\u201d\n\nWhen I look at you, I still see the freshly 20-year-old, outgoing, charismatic young man who carefully gained possession of what was left of my almost non-existent trust and fragile, teenage heart 13-years-ago. I still see the confident smile that belonged to a rambunctious boy who knew the world was full of possibility and opportunity, and he could conquer any obstacles that lay in his path. That smile... oh... that smile \ud83d\ude0c it melted so many hearts, and I\u2019m so lucky to be the ONE woman who is still able to coax it out of hiding from time-to-time.\n\nYou are the man who saved my life more times than I can confess and the person who\u2019s pure and beautiful soul I have been blessed to be able to create and build my life with. You are the devoted, adoring and incredibly nurturing father to our three magnificent children. You are my kindred soul... the universes answer to my life\u2019s purpose... and... my darling... believe me when I say that I would be LOST without you...\n\nI love you. Not in the truism sense of the word. Not because that\u2019s what we, as humans, have been conditioned to tell someone with whom we show adoration toward... NO...I am chemically and cosmically connected to the fabric of your immortal energy. My spirit requires you... I NEED you in the same way I need air to breath and water to drink. You are my soul\u2019s sustenance.\n\nSo that\u2019s why... on the day when you tried to kill your self, 3-months-ago... I felt like a vital part of me died. For weeks, I have felt like I have been living with a stranger and I haven\u2019t known how to look at you or even what to say. Not because I love you any less, but because I haven\u2019t been able to understand how you could have gotten to that place where you felt so bombarded by your own mind you were forced to pushed every primal, human instinct to survive away and KNEW you needed to permanently escape. It breaks my heart to think about the agony you must have gone trough to get to that place where you felt like it was time to leave this earth, this life, our family and our love. I feel so guilty that I, your closest and most intimate friend in this world, never saw the signs and couldn\u2019t be there to save you from yourself.\n\nI\u2019m so, incredibly lucky to still have you with me, and I\u2019m trying my best to understand how that beautifully complicated mind of yours functions. I know you\u2019re not ready to talk about it, but I would hope that you would forgive me for seeking advice from other\u2019s who might also suffer from Paranoid Schizophrenia, so I can gain a better understanding of how you are wired and how I can be there for you now and everyday in our future...\n\nI love you, baby and I am HERE FOR YOU... as long as we both shall live...\n\nPART TWO\n12/27/2019\n\nWe are growing accustomed to celebrating the small victories we have encountered over these last few, unexplainably difficult months. I like to think this kind of behavior has been therapeutic for your increasingly more fragile mind. It feels incredible to witness you smile on occasion and... my love... today is Friday and the kids are asleep.\n\nIt\u2019s time to celebrate US... this rare connection we have. Our deep friendship and kindredness that has given you and I the strength to survive the ravishing fires of hell. Tonight... All we need is you and me in our purest and most honest forms, this old couch that\u2019s certainly seen it\u2019s share of better days, a couple of cheap beers and a music playlist that is rich with adolescent memories - those few years of our lives we had to struggle through alone. The years before I found you and we weren\u2019t lucky enough to have loved one another...YET...\n\nWe require this moment where nothing is expected of us. Just a few hours when nothing outside of this toy and cheerio covered living room is of any concern to our collective psyche. We have earned this sliver of time to take all of our stress and anxiety acquired through the years and store it, for a few moments, away from our present minds - somewhere it can\u2019t weigh on our cerebrum. And when our chests finally feel a bit lighter, It\u2019s time to forget today, forget last week, forget last year and remember the tiny moments and coincidences that brought us to one another. It\u2019s time to dive deep into each other\u2019s lives and emerge from the depths as stronger and more learned version of ourselves. These minuscule clips of time seem to pass so quickly, but I know we are better for them.\n\nDid you know that I love that you can still surprise me. I adore that you are still here to spend this moment with me, to share our truths and experiences tonight. I am fascinated by your life. Your story is an intoxicating book that I can\u2019t put down. You are the most incredible human who has ever walked this earth and I\u2019m genuinely grateful to be the one who gets to walk beside you, dance with you, and fall asleep in the comfort and security of your sturdy arms.\n\nWords tend to flow from me freely when I\u2019m in your presence because I know you\u2019re the only person who has ever fully accepted and loved me as I am - in my rawest form - even my ugliest and most vulnerable versions. I love that you are habitually honest with me, even when the truth is both difficult speak and digest. I need you to remain this truthful with me, ALWAYS. I may not, in every scenario, know what to say or do with your truths, but I promise you that I can carry more emotional weight than you think me capable of, and your secrets are safest when harbored with me.\n\nLaying next to you tonight, I was sorry to hear that your mind orchestrated delusions have become more negative and terrifying over the course of the past month. It\u2019s hard to imagine the fear you experience when you wake up in the middle of the night to a faceless demon aggressively attempting to infiltrate our home and harm our children. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have an independent, entity narrate my life, boss me around, bully and break me down mentally and tell me that my time is almost over...\n\nIt broke my heart to hear you confess that you had planned to take your own life the day prior, because you thought it was the only way to make the unwanted haunting images, apparitions and disembodied voices leave you forever. It crushed me to learn that you had already begun your goodbyes to our children. Though, what confuses me most is why you believe that your strength and honesty are things you need to apologize for. I\u2019m ecstatic that you love me enough to muster your strength in this moment with me today and I admire your courage to be honest about your waking nightmares. Its important for me to understand what you are going through so I can know how to help you navigate through this horror show spectacle.\n\nI promised you, the day we fell in love, that you would never have to face this life alone. I have no intentions of breaking that promise now.\n\nI\u2019m still trying to process all of this. Its a bit overwhelming to digest this instant because It devastates me to know that you spend the majority of your days petrified in fear and polarized by anxiety. I wish there was something I could do to take that burden away from you. I\u2019m not sure what those magic words are that will make all of your pain disappear...\n\nThat\u2019s why I remained silent tonight and cried with you instead...\n\nPART THREE\n01/01/2020\n\nHappy New Year, My Love!\n\nI\u2019m thankful to have had a 13th opportunity to kiss your gorgeous lips at the stroke of Midnight - Ringing in another New Year the way we always have. What would I do without you here beside me? Where and Who would I be without your influence on my emotional growth? I hazard to assume that I would DO nothing productive, BE nothing and go nowhere without you. You are my divine inspiration to exist...\n\nCliche as it may sound, I unquestionably slept as soundly as an infant, buried in your arms last night. Your scent, warmth and the weight of your body filled my dreams with pleasant, carefree imageries and I was excited to wake up beside you this morning.\n\nMuch to my dismay, the hopeful man I fell asleep with last night was not the same man I woke up next to today. The man I woke up with today was pale faced, trembling and petrified. He cried despairingly while gripping his skull and desperately pleaded with a hallucinatory force... Repeating his dissuasive mantra, \u201cPlease Stop.\u201d \u201cStop.\u201d \u201cPlease Go Away.\u201d\n\nI placed my hand on his back in an effort to calm him down. I rubbed him gently and repeatedly shushed and assured him that the voice he was hearing wasn\u2019t real and everything would be alright. His anxiety consumed him entirely and caused him to spiral downward, in and out of reality, trying desperately to maintain his grip on his own physical existence. His personal desires and conscious thought became muffled beneath the howl of a sinister cacodemon that wasn\u2019t actually there... \n\nI stayed beside the man I woke up with for the next two hours. Fearful myself, at times, hoping he would let my husband come back home to me soon. I sat, holding him tightly on my bathroom floor, as his fear caused him to violently purge every ounce of matter that existed within his gut. I began to shake uncontrollably as I held him firmly around the chest and calmly talked him down from repeated moments of hyperventilation and near panic induced shock...\n\nHe told me his angriest delusion doesn\u2019t like me. He held me gently by the face and assured me that he would never hurt me, even though the voice in his head has been ordering him to, \u201cSLIT HER FUCKING CUNT THROAT!\u201d I told him I knew he would never hurt me... and then I ordered him to leave! \n\nI grabbed the bottle of antipsychotics that you have been neglecting to consume the past few weeks and forced him to digest one. I waited for several minutes that seemed more like centuries for you to come home to me. I watched his eyes transition from a tormented shade of dark grey to the beautiful, pale green eyes of the man I fell in live with. You collapsed downward, overwhelmed with joy and relief, as you found your way back into my shaken embrace, and tears poured from our eyes as you exclaimed, \u201che\u2019s gone... I\u2019m so happy he\u2019s gone.\u201d \n\nYou are taking your meds regularly again, and we are sticking to our care plan. We had to learn a vital lesson in a terrifying fashion, but I can\u2019t be more proud of your strength to persevere through all of this madness. \n\nYou are the strongest person I have ever known, darling and I love you...\n\nLet\u2019s keep moving forward together.",

        "original": "So. As you're likely all aware due to my weirdly conceived new found fame there is a lot I've apparently done and I'm allegedly some form of atrocious psychopath that preys on people both mentally and physically. Now in this post I will not be tackling what I did not do; rather I will be making my own personal amends by coming clean about certain parts of my past and elaborating on and explaining certain situations with the truth and explanations for my actions rather then the Chinese whispers and rumours currently going around.\n\nSo I think for me the issue really starts over a decade ago, around march of 2008, I'd moved and as such was moving to a new school and I think many people really set me as a certain type here. So I'd moved from a school where I'd spent the first year and a half of my senior life bullied, for how I looked, my high grades, everything. Now my new school, Brumby Comp to be exact, my first lesson was history, and there was a test, a test thqt without prior education on I blitzed with 100% and topped the class. Now that's fine, except I was a kid that had been bullied for being a nerd and I'd walked in to a new situation where I wanted to not only fit in but be popular and on top of this just be accepted. So I was 12, insanely inexperienced, and lacked friends; I lied to fit in. About everything.\n\nI think what made this worse was at the time I met my first girlfriend, though now looking back I'd have to say since I lied to her about every aspect of my life so she liked me (I didn't want to, I genuinely likes her, I'd just dug to deep), calling her that is likely unfair; but for the purposes of this I'll go with that. \n\nNow obviously this was found out, after 3 months to be exact and I lost my first relationship rightfully. I've never really forgave myself for this but it did serve as a valuable experience in my life; of course the bullying then again continued and eventually I just avoided school entirely. A place I once loved, a place of learning for me, became a backdrop of abuse and pain that deeply affected my self esteem and mental health for decades. Frankly, I don't blame a single one of these people for their actions, I deserved it this time.\n\nNow besides the odd fight I was a model kid, I was a pain to my mother and siblings but I avoided trouble with the law and kept myself pretty clean. As such my next bad actions didn't come till Victoria, I was 16 now, and this girl was my first sexual experience. Hormones and lust took over and I became, well an arsehole. I think a lot has been said about me and her where I'm the evil one and she's the hero; somewhat true and mostly not also. The reality is we were both young, both cheated (me with former GFs with her, we were very on and off, her with other men that weren't myself). Recently we've actually both spoken and made amends here, admitted we were young and stupid and moved on. That's what adults do, the way this situation when I was a kid is being elaborates upon to make my abusive is ridiculous; even she says it never happened and she's the alleged victim.\n\nNow the next one, Courtney? That's different. While we were together I was fine. I never harmed her and had no attempt to. Now she left me for a friend, a friend I'd made through the previous ex above. As any !an would I felt betrayed by my friend and yes, acted rashly and violently. That is my error, an error I am deeply apologetic for. I acted out of passion, it was elaborately stupid. I hold my hands up and admit that.\n\nRianna is a more specific case. As the situation arising here is one of much publication, rumours, outright lies and twisting of the truth.  There is simply to much to cover here so I will start with what I can admit...\n\nI did emotionally manipulate her; albeit unintentionally.\n\nI can look back now as a 24yo and realise my mistake. Then as a young man things were different.\n\nWhat must be understood is that she'd come to me often with her own issues, friends she'd fallen out with, arguments she'd had with her parents, men making unsolicited moves on her she didn't know how to kindly reject. At this time I was inexperienced in this sorta stuff, now I'd handle things more sensitively, I'd realise these people were close to her... Back then I looked to protect her, by simply telling her to remove these people from her life...\n\nI realise now years later that yes, that was stupid, and yes it was controlling. At the time I argued against that, claiming rightfully my aim was to protect her from people treating her badly... Only years and maturity has corrected my mentality, now I'm ready to apologise openly for such things.\n\nRegarding the claims of abuse against her too, by the same individuals as above, this was claimed by friends of hers when we broke up. She herself immediately denied this in her own post. It's somewhere on Facebook, in her own words, I never laid a hand on her. Not my style, she confirmed it herself.\n\nNow regarding the last claim I care to cover here which I am guilty of?..\n\nCertain individuals have claimed through the now famous medium I took from them around 3 years ago.\n\nAnd yes, there were two people I did. I am apologetic for this and if either of these individuals contact me now I will fully refund, with further amends, that is my error and I fully intend to fix it if asked.\n\nNow before people judge, there's more to the story.\n\nAt the time I was homeless, without an address I couldn't claim, I couldn't eat. I was on the streets, and as such I unfortunately acted wrongly and I stole to survive.\n\nNow many will tell me I'm a bad person for this, hell I agree, but until you are sleeping rough and starving you cannot judge me for it. Simply you cannot understand how easy it is to do wrong when your very next meal, very next might of sleep, is always a question mark above your head.\n\nI've not had an easy decade, for myself it's been one of heartbreak, loss, attempted suicide, homelessness and more. I've been to jail abroad, I've lost my son, hurt people I care deeply about.\n\nBut when you sit there and judge me, or you claim like many others I'm pure evil don't pretend you are perfect.\n\nEvery single human alive has done wrong, we've all had our reasons too. Whether we've stolen to eat, hurt someone to protect ourselves or a loved one, we've all hurt. \n\nThis world isn't black and white. \n\nI've done wrong, and a lot of it, but I'm prepared to admit that, apologise, make amends to those that want it and keep moving forward which makes me a better person then most of those judging myself that pretend they are perfect.\n\nI know this will be used against me, spun to make me look bad once again, I don't care it's about my own personal journey to redemption and that's all.\n\nBut lastly I want people to know that for all I'm being hated for much I've done right has been forgotten.\n\n\u2022 3 years ago I fed and clothed 300 homeless individuals on Boxing Day, I ran, collected, and found volunteers for this myself and never claimed a plaudit. I only ever thanked those that helped.\n\u2022 I have helped support victims of abuse and rape, many whom weren't even people I'd met before.\n\u2022 I spent 5 years running a Tumblr blog where I helped people anonymously with issues. Talked people out of suicide, had over a million followers 2 years ago when I stopped as the workload became global and far beyond my abilities to answer everyone.\n\u2022 I saved the life of a 13yo girl by jumping in a lake and performing CPR, again while I accepted the police commendation till today I never even mentioned it. The girl is 8 now, we still talk regularly.\n\u2022 I've donated food, clothes, money. I've volunteered at food banks, I've helped animal shelters, and even coached football to down syndrome teens. I never cared to publicise this.\n\nAs humans we are all layered, we all make mistakes and yet only our mistakes are ever remembered and talked about. Yet for many of us the reasons we do the evil we do explains a lot goes ignored, just like the good we do as individuals.\n\nSo don't go and stop doing good of you're hated anyway, because that's what makes you a good person. Mistakes are mistakes, but when you help the many and expect nothing in return you are truly a great individual. And people may be accept that, hell people may hate you for the actions of your own stupidity, but that's because humans are fickle; we only ever remember what makes us view another as lesser. \n\nWe're all complex, beautiful, intricate individuals who are both good and bad. \n\nThe difference is some of us accept our evil, some choose to pretend they're perfect and judge others from a sense of truly unearned narcissistic superiority.",

My father and I desperately want to help my mother with what appears to be a drastic decline in her mental health, but we have no idea where to turn.\n\n# Some important background\n\n* Lives in the US\n* Has low self-esteem\n* Has always been an anxious person (notably social anxiety, fear of germs, religious persecution)\n* In spite of being one of the kindest-hearted people I know, she subscribes to lots of politically- and religiously-extreme media that spread fear, hate, and conspiracy theories\n* Absolutely **refuses** any kind of mental or physical health care. Though we've been trying to get her to for years, she has not been to a doctor in over two decades except for a dentist\n* Leaves the house for no more than 2-3 hours a week, and stays in the rest\n* Is very sedentary (mostly spends her time in front of the computer) and does not exercise\n* Has recently become disorganized in ways that are unusual for her (overstocking on unnecessary things, keeping a messy living, etc)\n* Lives a relatively \"safe life\" (lives in a safe community, doesn't have a lot of money, and doesn't have enemies)\n\n# Delusions of conspiracy against her\n\nThe traits above were always worrying to us, but not nearly as extreme as it has been lately. In the past year, she began showing signs of delusion and paranoia. She believes that there is an international conspiracy (with conspirators coordinating between the US and her home country) to purposely wreak havoc on her life and ravage her savings.\n\nShe believes these conspirators are:\n\n* **Actively monitoring her phone calls and emails.** I'm traveling abroad, and she will not let me say via email or over the phone my current location or any possibly identifying information\n* **Writing sophisticated software to infect her computer and online information with spyware.** Even in the face of indisputable evidence of the contrary, any time there are computer problems or trivial bureaucratic mistakes, she believes it's the conspirators behind it.\n\nRecent unusual worrying beahviors:\n\n* **Keeps windows, curtains, and doors closed.** She fears people are looking into the house. At one point, she claims the conspirators stopped in front of the house, stepped out of their car, and took photos of the house. Another time, she believed her foreign cousin, who asked for her address (in an appropriate context), was a spy.\n* **Has greatly inconvenienced herself to try to evade the conspirators.** She has deleted all of her emails, changed her online identities, canceled her phone plan, and has reduced technological communication to almost nil. She's afraid to go outside and interact with others.\n* **Believes we are fools for not seeing the \"obvious\" conspiracy.**\n* **Afraid at all times**. Most of conversation with her recently has been focused on this perceived conspiracy. Her voice is  usually loud and shaky when discussing this. Sometimes she cries mid-conversation.\n\n# What to do?\n\nI'm sufficiently convinced that this is not normal aging behavior and could potentially be something serious, but we have no idea what to do from here. It's absolutely tearing me apart to watch this.\n\nIt's clear that getting her to a doctor, or having a doctor visit, is out of the question, and even if it were, she would refuse medication. Are there any foods I can introduce to her diet to improve her mood? What can I tell her to calm her down? How can I change her life so that she doesn't live her life afraid?\n\nI'm very desperate for answers, and any constructive advice is extremely appreciated.\n\nedit: formatting",

        "original": "The last semester of uni I've just lost so much motivation and energy. The courses that I've been taking (I can not choose courses myself - they are all required for my degree) this autumn have been so boring and difficult. And I've been questioning if I'm on the right path, but I really don't want to quit either since I'm halfway through my degree and I'd be disappointing myself (and my family even though I know they support me with whatever I do). I've also gotten quite good grades so far which motivates me, but I know if I would fail a course my mind would go so negative and my self esteem would take a big hit. \n\nAs soon as I open up my book to study I get an headache and all my energy just goes away and I get really stressed out about all the things I have to study on. One day I feel like get my shit together and I clean my apartment, make a good dinner, study, take care of my skin. The next day I just lie in my bed the whole day, watch YouTube and only eat a chocolate bar for the whole day. I can get cry attacks suddenly when I am alone in my apartment, and I cry much more easily and often than what I did in the past.

On top of that, he will spend a lot of the time laughing to himself and refuses to tell anyone what is \u201cso funny\u201d.

I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t just pick up after myself but it just gets like that. You can hardly walk in it. I lay in bed all the time, especially these last few months. I come home from school and lie down in my bed and I come downstairs for dinner and then somehow I\u2019m back in my bed for the rest of the night. It\u2019s like I physically cannot get up and there\u2019s a magnet making me stay there. Today I woke up at 11 and didn\u2019t get out of bed until almost 3 but only because my sister wanted to go to Panera for lunch. That\u2019s the only thing I ate all day.

I\u2019m usually not late to school but this year I have been late to class multiple times because of this. I rarely eat breakfast and I don\u2019t have much for lunch either. I try to keep up with my hygiene but often I\u2019ll go 3 or 4 days without showering on accident.  I am also a severe procrastinator and I won\u2019t do anything unless it\u2019s right before I have to get it done. Usually I\u2019m able to get by like this but my grades have suffered this year from flat out just not doing big assignments which is unusual of me, but that\u2019s probably just senioritis.

I\u2019m not trying to get a diagnosis here or anything I\u2019m just trying to see if I should take this seriously or I just need to get my shit together.

I don\u2019t think I had depression back then either, just a really low self esteem and very insecure and confused.) obviously this isn\u2019t very severe since I don\u2019t feel sad or any significant negative emotions but to be honest I\u2019m not sure what I feel. I kinda feel nothing. I\u2019ve had a lot of shit happen this year and I\u2019ve always felt I don\u2019t feel emotions as strongly as other people.

        "original": "Hey guys, so recently I've become worried about my mental state, and I haven't been able to find any solid answers elsewhere, so I've decided to come here. And I'm not here to get attacked for any choices I've made in my life, I know they were stupid, so can we please just overlook them and talk facts instead of have an intervention.\n\nHere's some facts to start out...\n\nSymptoms:\n--headaches where my head feels like it's \"shrinking\"\n--Occasional panic attacks where I sometimes start to have difficulty reading. I can still read, it just gets sightly hard to look at the words and register them in my head. Then again I do read fast, when I slow down when this happens I usually don't have a problem.\n--Random pains, feels like ball of needles, they don't happen in just one place.\n--Sometimes extreme paranoia, but this is 99% of the time related to my health, for example, being paranoid that I might have a tumor.\n--Very occasional loss of balance, but then again I've always been clumsy.\n\n\n\nI am:\n-male\n-16\n\nI know I have:\n-autism(extremely high functioning, super-minimal symptoms, I suggest using Google to get a better explanation)\n-ADHD(I don't know much about this except for that I have it. I take prescribed Adderall)\n\nOther things:\n\n\u2022I live in a stressful household, everyone in the family has either ADHD or autism, my mom has depression issues and this leads to some unhealthy verbal interactions with my autistic father, which causes unrest in the rest of the family.\n\n\u2022Life is decently stressful due to multiple reasons(such as the aforementioned family), if you're making an equation in your head, set the stress level to high-very high.\n\n\u2022I've been saving up the past 3 months for a gaming setup, which means triple night shifts at work, so sleep deprivation I guess.\n\n\u2022Personality wise I'm kinda goofy, and I like to look for loopholes to get around difficult things when I can. I usually take bad things in stride and am not usually affected. (I think this may be due to the nature of my family life). This part is kinda vague but I felt like I should include it.\n\n\u2022I might have Hypochondria. My mom says it looks like a classic case, and from the symptoms I've seen online it kinda looks like that to me too. But I feel like I have something else. But you never know, could just be the Hypochondria...\n\nBad stuff (I know these were stupid of me to do, read the first paragraph again):\n\nDrugs that I used to do(I've quit all of them)=\n\n\u2022alot of weed(plant and occasional THC cart, but I always made sure to check the cart for legitimacy and I haven't had any of the normal cart related problems. Never had any problems smoking.).\n\n\u2022acid, 4 times but appropriately spaced, last time I took 2 tabs and smoked pot, my friend who was also dropping had a bad trip, authorities became involved and I ended up being caught. I was very shaken from being caught but every time I was tripping, the trip was positive.\n\n\u2022shrooms (once, but it was a very positive trip and nothing bad happened)\n\n\u2022one time doing Molly, but that was a small dose, spaced out from other drugs, the trip was positive and I didn't have any bad problems, so I don't think it was a problem\n\nI've never been addicted to any drug I've done. Of course there was the regular occasional teen vaping and drinking, but I never got addicted, and I rarely participated in those activities. Yes, once again I know it was dumb.\n\n\nSo if anyone has any idea about what I have/might have, just give it to me straight. Right now I'm pretty sure it could be a brain tumor or psychosis. Who knows, it could just be some stupid Hypochondria mixing with high stress and my autism/ADHD and causing some extreme paranoia/symptoms. I don't know.\n\nAny theories or answers I'll gladly accept, and I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.\n\nThanks,\n-idiot",

I haven\u2019t been for the past 5 years.\n\nSo, my problems actually started 5 yrs ago when I transferred to this grammar school. Before that, I was a straight A student despite never studying much. Paying attention at school was enough and then my mum would often study with me (or more like force me to). But, at the new school I struggled to make friends, was of the age when I thought no one understood me and constantly argued with my parents. After school (& the hobbies and clubs I attended) I\u2019d always go straight to bed. I didn\u2019t see it as a problem at first because everything seemed ok, but looking back I think I became depressed. Note that at this point my grades were still amazing.\n\nI finally overcame like a year later, made some amazing friends, became used to my school and my life started being ok again. I\u2019ve since had some ups and downs, but have since become a confident, more or less happy person who can deal with her problems and has a strong support system in the form of family and friends.\n\nIn spite of this, I have problems with concentration - I can never pay attention in all my classes for the whole time - and I can never bring myself to study even though I really want to. Everything seems too challenging. Even basic hygiene now. For the sake of my social life, I can pretend just ok - shower every morning, do the most basic stuff for school, attend all social activities and be genuinely happy around my friends, but a soon as I come home, I go straight to bed and can never seem to do anything. My room\u2019s messy and I only manage to clean it when I really have to.\n\nI thought I had depression, but besides being sad about never doing anything, I think I\u2019m happy most of the time. Then I thought about having undiscovered ADHD, but I think I\u2019m way too little impulsive & composed for that and don\u2019t really fit the symptoms.

In August, we were inseperable and madly in love with each other, even talking about getting engaged. We broke up New year's Eve at 9pm, then rang in the new year by crying into each other's shoulders and talked about what we wish we would've done better so that the distance didn't kill our connection. People drift apart and it's a tragic waste of love but that's how life goes sometimes.\n\n\nWe were halfway through a trip, her family came for Hanukkah, my family came for New year's, and it was just me and her on Wednesday when we broke up. Now I'm alone with my extended family, with all of them asking where she is and why we broke up, because we were so good together and they were just positive we'd give them grandchildren.\n\n\nI'm avoiding all of them. I can't eat because 80% of the food I eat, I puke up within the hour. Sleeping isn't even worth trying, I'll pass out from exhaustion for 20-30 minutes twice a day or so and that's all I can really get. Those naps are ended by intense nightmares. I'm having hallucinations, hearing voices, seeing paintings move, etc. I think it's because of sleep deprivation but I don't know how I'm supposed to sleep. I'm also intensely paranoid. I convinced myself that the death of Qassim Soliemani was going to cause my home city to get nuked while I'm in the airplane flying towards it.\n\n\nI don't know why I'm feeling this way, I've never taken a breakup this hard.

I've found most of my success in running, which is am incredibly mental sport.

While I have never given in to dropping out, these thoughts have completely destroyed a ton of my races, only further reinforcing these thoughts.\n\nI'm not sure if it was caused by my running, or this started before my running started to go downhill, but I ALWAYS have to be doing something. Any period of time where I sit around idly, I find my head filled with some super dark thoughts. During my most recent down time from running (I took 2 weeks of after the season) I have never been more antisocial and sad in my entire life for what seemed like absolutely no reason. I didn't want to leave my dorm room or do anything with my friends, and I really just laid around, cried a little, and did nothing for 2 weeks, which also crushed my grades.\n\nI'm very fortunate to have a Sports Psychologist on our athletic staff that I can go see free of charge but I'm not sure how to start the conversation or if that is even the right person to talk to.

        "original": "I feel so much dumber, more boring, less creative, less energized, more awkward, less happy, and more apathetic than I did a few months ago. I don\u2019t know exactly what the cause of it is, or if all of those things are concurrent with one another or they are each the result of separate factors in my life, but everything just feels generally more dull to me. My writing, which used to be one of my strong suits, now feels lackluster in comparison to what it was merely a few months ago. My social skills have been faltering, despite me being someone who is typically very amiable (or at least, I\u2019d like to think so) and outgoing, and to the point where I wonder if I\u2019m even gonna be able to make new friends this coming semester at college, which I was really hoping to do, since I was having so much trouble doing so in the second half of last semester. I feel like I have so much more trouble articulating myself now than I\u2019ve ever had in the past. My memory has gotten notably worse, at least since I\u2019ve been home for winter break. My thoughts come to me much slower, and I feel like I can\u2019t think of things to say as well as I usually can. I just feel so empty, unmotivated, like I\u2019m nothing. I feel like all of the things I like about myself are rapidly fading away, and I have no clue how to keep them from slipping away. For some context, I\u2019m 18 and a first year student in college. The main factors I suspect of causing this are:\n\n* ADHD medication. I\u2019m currently on 25mg of Strattera, and ever since I started it, I've noticed myself feeling markedly duller. However, by the same token, I tried to stop taking it for three weeks before this one that I\u2019ve been home since winter break, because I suspected it of causing the things listed above, but noticed my memory getting a lot worse, so I\u2019ve been taking it for a little less than the past week. I was on Ritalin for almost all of last year, which I stopped taking because it made my OCD much worse, and noticed myself feeling more restricted than usual, but it was never quite as bad as it is now.\n* Antidepressants. Currently on 40mg of Prozac. Once I got home from break, I started trying to take 25mg of it instead, and sometimes I just wouldn\u2019t take it at all, because again, I worried that it was causing the problems listed before, but that was probably a stupid idea, since I got a lot more depressed in the third week of being home. Eventually, I met with my psychiatrist, who got bumped down to 20mg after I expressed that I was starting to feel apathetic about things, but said that the ADHD medication should stay the same. However, my mom and I talked and we agreed that it was probably better for me to go to 30mg since I was starting to feel more depressed anyway.\n* Drinking. I\u2019ve only been drinking since college started, which has been since August, and I don\u2019t drink very often, probably about once a week if not once every other week, but typically when I do drink, I have more than the average person is meant to have, simply because I\u2019m a bit of a heavyweight. However, college is the first time where I\u2019ve had easy access to copious amounts of alcohol at any given time. I\u2019ve taken note of the fact that when I have gotten drunk in the past three months, I tend to be much more socially apt than I have been when I\u2019m not. I know they don\u2019t call it \u201csocial lubricant\u201d for nothing, but I didn\u2019t think that drinking would somehow make me *more* awkward when I\u2019m sober. There are numerous sources online saying that binge drinking can make you dumber, stunt your memory, and make you more depressed, but I don\u2019t know if that only applies to people who drink religiously or it can apply to anyone who binge drinks regardless of frequency.\n* Seasonal depression. Even though I was on the medications listed above this past fall and a brief portion of the summer, I remember feeling much happier than I currently do and just having much more motivation to do things. It isn\u2019t uncommon for me to feel worse during the winter months, but it\u2019s usually not quite this bad or prominent, and from what I can recall it\u2019s usually more tolerable than this, but it would make a good amount of sense for that to be the case.\n* College. I\u2019ve really been enjoying myself at college so far, but during the last two months of last semester, I noticed the things I mentioned at the beginning getting worse without much of a way to account for it. Although the above factors could all make sense, I definitely noticed that the amount of work I was doing and the sheer amount of socializing I forced myself to do every day was starting to take a toll on me.\n\ntl;dr: The title, basically.",

        "original": " \n\nHey everybody,\n\nI experienced a relapse in health anxiety at the start of November during college and just wanted to get some advice... (Am I just crazy??)\n\nI will not go into full detail about everything, as it is quite long/complex. A bit about myself: I am a male 20yo, entrepreneurial-minded, ambitious/workaholic with big goals. I definitely have a compulsive/obessive personality, which actually allows me to work extremely hard, and get super immersed in whatever I am doing. However, I have had some issues with OCD and hypochondria since my early teens (irrational fear of hiv, germs, cancer, deadly diseases etc.). These were just \"phases\" as I call them, so I always managed to snap out of the anxiety.\n\nBasically, 3 years ago, an incident happened  [https://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/9v3fow/bad\\_hookah\\_experience\\_should\\_i\\_be\\_worried/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/9v3fow/bad_hookah_experience_should_i_be_worried/) . After that, I continue to live perfectly well for 1,5 years, without noticing anything being wrong. I built a business during high school, got great grades etc. Then, in my final year of high school, I come across an article on fb about that same incident, where the author was saying things like \"you can get brain damage, concentration issues etc.\". Like I said, I never noticed anything being wrong with me, but when I read those articles, I spiraled into crippling anxiety, because I now thought \"I have fucked up my life/health/future etc.\". I was in the middle of my preparation for my final exams, and I consulted more than 5 GPs. All of them said that I was fine and that I had nothing to worry about. I even consulted a specialist, who also reassured me that I had nothing to worry about. I do not know how, but I managed to get through my final exams with excellent grades, under extreme anxiety. After graduating, instead of being happy like my peers, I fell into a deep deep depression, because I just thought that I had ruined my life. I did not apply to any colleges because I wanted to take a gap year to focus on my business.\n\nI was severely depressed and anxious but nobody could understand why. Nothing seemed to be wrong with me health wise, but I just cannot deal with uncertainty when it comes to health, I always drive myself crazy with \"what if\" thoughts, so I was put on an SSRI (10mg Citalopram) by my GP, but she did not mention anything about getting therapy. I was feeling like shit, laying in bed all day (very unusual of me, as I was always super productive, passionately working 10-18 hours a day), so I decided to see a psychiatrist, but the only thing he did, was listening to me for 50 minutes and telling me \"just don't think about it, it will go away\". After that, months of severe depression followed, I just felt completely hopeless about my future, and I was so mad at myself for that incident (normally I do not engage in any drugs/alcohol/smoking etc.) . A lot of people had the same thing happen to them, but they do not overreact like I do.\n\nSomehow (probably the meds were kicking in), I found back to myself and started working on my business again, started getting back on track with my goals etc. I started feeling less and less depressed, and used all of the pain and suffering as motivation to fight myself back after these horrible months. Around march, my prescription for the SSRI's ended, and because I was not seeing any psychiatrist, I just stopped taking them. I did not experience any withdrawal side-effects, and during the following months, I was doing very well mentally - feeling on top of the world again.\n\nIn September, I left home for the first time to study abroad at a highly ranked university. The first 2 months were going super well, I was very happy with the new environment I found myself in. I was running my business next to uni work, doing better than ever, waking up at 5 am, working up to 100+ hours a week (my compulsive/obsessive personality), but loving every second of it. I also managed to get very good grades, and started socializing a lot. The thoughts about my depressive/anxious episode did come up from time to time, and I remember being super proud of myself that I had digged myself out of that hole, thinking \"How the hell did you waste months dwelling on something so stupid\".\n\nThen, in November, I was not in a very good place mentally, as I had to rewrite a whole assignment, which I had spent 2 weeks on - throwing me off guard a bit (I am very structured, always like to have everything planned). I don't know how, but all of that combined (probably a burnout) triggered my OCD and I started dwelling on that incident again. At first I thought I could snap out of it, but I just started obsessing with the same thoughts again, leading me back into that negative spiral, feeling super anxious again - even had a full-blown panic attack. I saw a GP (she thought I was crazy) who gave me a 2-week prescription for a benzo to reduce my anxiety. That did help a bit, but the following weeks were awful to control my anxiety and studying for finals at the same time. I really needed help, so I am now seeing a psychiatrist and doing CBT to finally treat the root of the problem.\n\nI am currently back home for Christmas, and I must say that my anxiety is now much better than it was just 1-2 months ago. However, this relapse made me very confused about myself and my future. I thought that I had overcome the anxiety, but it just came back out of nowhere. The thing is, every time I get these obsessive, irrational thoughts, I start feeling hopeless about the future, because I think to myself \"You are not good enough anymore because of that incident, and there is something wrong with you now\". This makes me neglect my passion for business, consequently, making me depressed. I am kind of mad at myself because I have put my health at risk like that,\n\nNow, I don't know whether I should go back on an SSRI to help me during this phase. I really do not want to mess up my grades/and even uni experience (I did not feel like socializing anymore, and became very pessimistic, not attending any lectures). The anxiety/OCD definitely is not as bad as it was 1-2 months ago, but I feel like the meds could prevent me from having another breakdown. Now would be the perfect time to take it, as I still have 2 weeks of break to get over the initial phase of side-effects. My GP prescribed me 10mg Citalopram along with the benzos, but I did not take it yet. My psychiatrist said, that I should not take the meds unless it is absolutely necessary (I live in a country where they do not like putting everybody on ADs). I am planning on seeing one of the specialists that put these articles out to get that final bit of reassurance about my specific case (I would have to drive 300km for that, sounds crazy, I know). I do fear that the SSRIs would make it hard to concentrate/study, but I actually responded pretty well to them when I first took them. I also always saw my OCD as my gift in business, so I'm kinda scared that the meds would make me \"less obsessed\" about my business.\n\nThis was longer than I initially thought, but if you made it through that wall of text: Thank you!",

        "title": "Kind of struggling to take decisions in terms of how to pick a new study/life/geography path ?",
        "original": "Hi !  I've been tip toeing around the idea of writing here for a long while, so here i go. Might be a long post (EDIT : it is. he last 3 bullet points are about my situation atm if you want to skip ! )\n\nI'm a 23 yo, and I'm since quite a long time now facing a huge wave (or waves) of changes. I'm in this transitional state where the things I had to quit have been left behind, but i'm still not feeling able to take any decisions. My brain is like a slow hamster wheel, kind of under control in terms of speed, but going round and round in terms of problem solving. i'm going to try to recap the facts + feels.\n\nFirst of all, I started studying very young, I was 17, freshly out of high school. I started studying arts and fashion design in Paris, in the best schools out there, as it was my secret dream since I was 12. And it was hard, as it's supposed to be. my mental health wasn't great but it was much better in a way than what it was before I turned 18, and I was trying to grow as a person and overcome the obstacles that come up when you want to study fashion and are insecure. And then, two years in, I started to actually study fashion design, and everything started to take a bad turn. The teachers, in this famous uni, that required a very long and tough contest to get in, were the worse. I won't go into details because it's still quite traumatic for me, but let's say their methods of pedagogy were non existant and they ended up not teaching anything and only criticising the intents. I resisted 2 years, and in the middle of the 2nd year I had a big burnout, and stared at the ceiling for 2 months, unable to feel anything. During this time, I was extremely peaceful and quiet ; just before I broke down, I realised I couldn't do it anymore, and that I actually didn't want to DO it anymore. I took me 4 years to realise it, and 1 more to accept to let go of this path.\n\nThat takes us to me, stubborn as a donkey, doing an exchange program the next year (last year) to still study fashion but in another school. Usually you do a semester abroad, then you go back to your school to do your last 3 semesters and be graduated. It didn't work that way ; I was extremely weak and depressed, spent most of my days crying and having to take 3 hours long naps in the middle of the day (the hormones + the body don't deal well with acute stress). The main problem to me was that if I left my studies right there and then, what would I do ? I was learning the language of the country, having absolutely no hopes or dreams or desires about anything, struggling to feel anything but fear and tremendous loss. I had moved to another country, where I had friends and I felt good in, but couldn't see myself settle there without a plan. And going back to Paris in this university was at that point completely impossible. As I was navigating that I stupidly didn't seek help and I was really really low.\n\nI wrote my master's thesis, because I was really passionate about it, and I loved writing it. I had to go back to France in June to present it, and I had made the decision to ask for a gap year so that I could take time to think. The presentation of the thesis went good, but the rest of the contact with my uni was a disaster. Picture a fight between middle schoolers, and you'll have an idea of what it felt like. It's just heartbreaking to communicate and never be listened to or taken in consideration, even in a class of 10 students. I felt like I was going to crumble down again, so after a lot of debates with myself and friends I just quit the uni cold turkey. That means, I don't have any diploma from the 5 years I studied.\n\nI stayed in Germany because I felt better there than in France. This year I took a job in retail (ain't fun but at least my head is above the water), I'm continuing to learn german and I'm doing a Yoga teacher training, something i've been wanting to do for 5 years, and it feels nice to learn things. But here's the sticky part. My mental health is still quite bad, I'm able to have longer periods where i'm not completely not ok, but when I'm not ok I think it's to the level where I should take medications. The problem is I still cannot really feel positive emotions, I can dissociate for quite long periods of time, and I can't seem able to take any decisions. Let me bullet point it out :\n\n\\- I have to decide what I'm going to study for next year or the year after, to have some sort of a professional project. Lately i've felt a pull towards osteopathy or somatic practices, and it feels really good to have something I can think about and not just nothing as it was until then. But when I look at the studies, I would have to go back to France for 5 years, and I have people I love there but so many things that are for me really traumatic : the language, the mentality, the fact that you need some money to just get by in Paris (where i'd study).\n\n\\- there comes the 2nd choice, the geography of things : I really like Berlin but I feel completely unable to settle down here and enjoy the present moment because I feel like the city doesn't carry a future for me in terms of studying (I would need to master the language, which I can do, but I don't want to realise half way there that I actually don't want to live in Germany) (living abroad is so loaded, even if i'm m aware it's such a privilege for me to have the choice). Paris hurt me a lot, the mindset of the city and the political climate are very tough, but some of my closest friends are there and ready to welcome me back there. I could study there but I'm not sure I could find peace and grounding. My bonds with my friends from France are changing and getting a little looser, and i don't feel safe to explore and build my life here and now in Berlin.\n\n\\- and in the end it's this whole identity crisis that comes up : if I can't seem to know where I want to be and what I want to do, how can I make choices ? If i'm always a foot out the door in terms of everything in Berlin or in Paris, how can I be alive ?  My mom just told me it's symptomatic for me to feel lost, and that i won't ever feel ok with any thing because it's me (that was nice). I try to take all of the things i've learned in the past 20 years, to remain present and to breathe and to give me time, bu i'm really scared to never find this feeling of home and belonging somewhere, in any language, in any studies. I really want to be able to make decisions and trust what they have for me, but I need to make them first and I am completely and utterly lost. It's like I've jumped and I am floating, waiting to see an appealing place to land but I can't see anything, it's all foggy, so I keep floating. I can't think of having feelings for someone, or something, because it might leave me or i might leave it.\n\nAnywayyy this is my messy brain at the moment. I'm quite sad. It's getting slowly better, but I'm really not grounded. Does anyone have a similar experience ? How'd you get out of it ? What is home for you ?\n\nthank you for reading this novel haha\n\nxx\n\n(i could write much more in more details about different things, but i tried keeping it as tidy as possible)",

While I was empathetic for the psychiatrists who had made substantial sacrifices to achieve their professional status, I felt the greatest angst for the adolescent and young adult patients with situational dysfunctions who found themselves locked on a mixed unit with psychotic, severely depressed, demented or other seriously mentally ill adults and elderly. Part of my job was to meet each newly admitted patient and then visit them periodically. My job was to orient them to the unit and address concerns they might have.

Appearing to have my crap together on the outside does not mean I am not hurting inside.\n\nI am tired of being told that my life is easy, nothing bad happened to me, everybody has bad things also, etc. When I seek support and validation, I am not looking to invalidate others' struggles or compare myself to start a misery competition. I completely understand that I am very fortunate to be at my current position; a lot could've gone wrong. I respect everybody's battles, and I wish for everyone to keep healing.\n\nHere is my journey, thank you again for reading.\n\nAt 2, my sister was born. While I love my sister and never resented her, all family, friends, and acquaintances favored her over me (to be fair, I was an ugly kid, and she was really adorable). Nobody heard me.\n\nAt 3, I still struggled to speak properly. I had speech problems, and I had a hard time expressing myself verbally.\n\nAt 4, I was raped repeatedly over the course of a few weeks by the school janitor. After being sodomized by a mop, I get pushed down to urine and then get hosed off. When I return to the classroom, my teacher scolded me for using the bathroom for took long and playing with water. The school finally figured out what went on and did nothing. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me. Since then, I had a stutter that I could not get rid of until my late teens.\n\nAt 5, I learned to skin pick my buttocks, so blood would continue to appear on my underwear.\n\nFrom 5 to 8, I was constantly blamed and berated by my aunt for troubles her children caused and I was in no part of. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me.\n\nFrom 6 to 12, my parents took turns getting sick and checking in and out of hospitals. One time, my parents were away for almost a year for treatment abroad because they could not afford healthcare in the states. Nobody heard me.\n\nAt 7, I was the target of my 2nd grade teacher's constant bullying. I had the second highest grade in the class. Yet, that was not good enough for her. She singles me out and berates me for the entire school year in front of everyone for every little thing. No one heard me.\n\nAt 8, I moved to the states. A few kids in the classroom offered to \"help me transition\" in front of the teacher, and then proceed to emotionally and physically abuse and bully me behind the teacher. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me. I did not know how to speak English.\n\nFrom 8, my uncle, whose family sponsored us to emigrate, was terribly verbally abuse towards me for existing and causing \"problems\" in his family. He loved my sister, but hated me. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me.\n\nFrom 9, I learned to skin pick my genitals. It feels better than picking my buttocks, when I needed to feel better.\n\nFrom 9 to 13, we were told to stay quiet in the house and not go outside while my mom works, or else our semi-racist neighbor might call child protective service. We were not well off. Sometimes, my mom showed up with food that she scavenge from restaurant garbage and were just thrown out.\n\nFrom 9 to 15, I had two friends, who repeatedly stood me up for other plans. I offered kindness to others and sought friendship, only to receive manipulation and emotional abuse.\n\nAt 10, my mom had a house keeping job. My sister and I went to help wash strangers' toilets and underwear. I watch these strangers, who paid her minimum wage, berate my mom in front of me, and I could not do anything.\n\nAt 10, I ran the household, paid bills, made calls, and make sure everything is up-to-date. My parents tired their best, but both of them were rarely both home due to work and time at hospital and spoke very little English. Nobody heard me.\n\nAt 10, my PE teacher berated me in front of the entire locker room for \"attacking\" my classmate. My classmate just wanted me to feel his \"six-pack.\" Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me.\n\nFrom 10, I learned to skin pick my scalp. This feels good as well.\n\nAt 11, I constantly did not have enough food for lunch. I walked around and asked my classmates for their leftovers. I did not want to tell my parents that I was hungry. They tried their best.\n\nAt 12, we finally have healthcare. No more lining up for clinics or going to unlicensed doctors for treatment.\n\nAt 15, I discovered the guitar, and had been obsessed with getting better at this instrument every since. Music is my refuge from the turbulence inside my head and my loneliness.\n\nAt 16, I finally have my first group of real friends. I felt inadequate. While I loved them to death, I always felt like they were just letting this underprivileged kid tag along.\n\nAt 18, I got into the university of my choice on almost a full scholarship. I was told that I will not succeed.\n\nFrom 19, I started to abuse alcohol. It was not hard for me to go through bottles of wine or 6-packs when I wanted to cope with negative feelings.\n\nFrom 19, I learned that seeking validation reduces my fear of rejection. I work my ass off academically, socially, and in extra-curricular activities to maximize opportunities of being validated by others. Because of my thirst for validation, I go out of my way to please others. I don't want anybody to have anything negative to say about me anymore. My stutter went away, and I was finally confident about myself. My classmates said I was lucky to be even at school and I did not deserve to be successful academically. They said that my underprivileged background did not matter and was only used to seek pity.\n\nFrom 21 to 27, I was constantly on the receiving end of then-girlfriend (now wife)'s anger, rage, and emotional abuse due to her (most likely misdiagnosed) depression. My fear of abandonment and thoughts of self-harm and suicide worsen. I love her. When we were not hurting, she made me a better person. I will not leave her, and we will heal together.\n\nAt 21, I graduated summa cum laude in electrical engineering and received an award from the school chancellor for community service. I had no school debt. People said I was \"lucky.\"\n\nAt 21, I bought my first car, but my parents decided for me. It was not my choice.\n\nAt 22, I bought my first house, but not by choice. Grandma got kicked out of my aunt's house and needed a place to stay. My parents told me to buy a house for tax benefits and \"save money.\" I did not want to buy a house.\n\nAt 24, I completed my Master's degree while working full-time. My friends said I would die trying to work and go to school. I did not have to pay a cent for this degree.\n\nAt 25, I started a new job at a tech company. I was called \"stupid\" by my colleagues behind my back because I was new to the industry.\n\nAt 26, I received my first patent. I was one of the group's best circuit designers.\n\nAt 29, I bought my second house with my then-girlfriend. We finally have a stable home. My wife's mental health crumbled shortly after.\n\nAt 29, my then-girlfriend (now wife) was diagnosed with schizophrenia. My home life has been turbulent since then, and I was constantly put on the edge. I was constantly on the receiving end of her psychotic episodes. The voices in her head makes her angry, sad, or lose all feelings. She always wants to run away, leave me, or hurt herself. She can be a different person by the hour. When I sought support, people said I was fishing for sympathy behind my back. I need to keep everything together, for her sake.\n\nAt 31, I married my wife. I love her, and we will heal together. I will never leave her alone.\n\nAt 31, my wife relapsed and quit her job without any warning. For a few months, my days were spent caring for her and being on receiving end of her worst psychotic rages.\n\nAt 31, I received my tenth patent. Nobody questions my abilities as an engineer.\n\nAt 32, my suicide ideation worsens due to relationship conflicts and stresses from care giving. Everyday, I wanted to walk in front of a train or truck or jump off a building.\n\nAt 32, I was diagnosed with BPD. I stop drinking. I am starting DBT.

We always start talking calmly and he comes across as quite understanding, but then very quickly it's changes to him saying things like \"I'm grateful for my life because there are people struggling to survive in other countries\" \"your life is perfect because you have a family and food and shelter\" etc. He talks about how he's struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for his whole life and how he feels guilty about it, so he's happy with what he has. I then explain to him how guilt doesn't have a good effect on me, and the fact that I, having so much in life, have the audacity to hate myself and have mental issues that stop me from being able to function like a normal person makes me want to die. Because in my head that guilt makes me a horrible, selfish, useless person. \n\nMy dad won't shut up about it. I tell him I don't like talking about my mental health with him but he doesn't care. He keeps telling me to get a job, and do better in school, and figure out what I'm gonna do after I graduate, and I keep telling him that I'm working through things and I will get a job soon, and the only class I'm doing poorly in is gym class and that's because I have 2-3 panic attacks every day in class (I don't know what to do about that). \n\nHe makes me hate myself even more than I already do because now I'm feeling guilty for being unhappy.",

My Ex Fianc\u00e9 took off exactly one month ago today with no warning with our then 2 month old child to another state. Long story short, I\u2019m his father by law but have no rights keep him myself until we go to court. The problem is, I was shocked. I had no idea she was planning this, I had no idea she would ever do this, up until last night I was still head over heels in love with her and just wanted my family home.. but she\u2019s completely ghosted me. Every conversation has been her reading me down to the lowest possible level, and I put up with almost 2 years of physical and mental abuse out of her because, as I said, I was in love with her. \n\nSo an entire month goes by, she\u2019s been telling the people she stays with that I am the one that\u2019s abused her (not even once; I have proof of every argument including where she\u2019s hit me) and that part has been weighing on me. I know she needs the sympathy for a free place to stay but again, it\u2019s such a shock and surprise to me to hear her say these things that it truly pulled me out of my body almost. I\u2019ve been going back and forth with myself, essentially, in her messages trying to find out anything about why this happened and more importantly, any information whatsoever about my child, to no avail. If I ask for a picture of him, she\u2019ll occasionally send one - but it\u2019s usually an older one that she just resends me while everyone tells me she\u2019s posting 5-10 new ones on IG a every day. It\u2019s just straight up abusive behavior, but I thought I was doing okay. \n\nFast forward to early this morning: I felt like I woke up. I was already awake and I was standing in the mirror washing my face, brushing my teeth, and it hit me like an arrow in the chest. I recognized myself for the first time in a month but I looked like shit. I\u2019m exhausted, I\u2019m ashamed I\u2019ve sent her so many messages in my panic, the overwhelming guilt and anxiety of the situation has made it difficult to eat, everything tastes bad, even my favorite foods. I haven\u2019t been myself since she walked out the door with our child, and I\u2019m not sure why I can feel it now. It was like I was watching my life unfold from a different perspective.. I had never felt the type of sadness that I did throughout this experience. I feel like the person that I\u2019ve been since that day is not who I am, or who I\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019m still trying to sort through everything mentally because it feels fresh again almost. Granted, she still wants to torture me at every opportunity, but I\u2019m not speaking to her anymore and don\u2019t want to, which is why I\u2019m puzzled at the repeated texts that I\u2019ve sent her. \n\nI have no idea what this might be called, I know the recommendation is going to be to see a therapist, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any insight as to what the hell I might\u2019ve experienced over the course of the last month?

        "title": "An antidepressant success story (we need those every once in a while)",
        "original": "Hi everyone. I\u2019ve seen a lot of \u201cantidepressant use gone wrong\u201d stories online in the last year or so (in part because I was researching whether it\u2019s actually worth it to attempt them), so I felt compelled to share my story, in which they actually helped me in a very meaningful way. If anything, I hope this post will be a positive signal for someone considering medication; I\u2019ll just put the TL;DR right here - yes, if you are in a really bad place it is indeed worth a try.\n\nI\u2019m from a post-soviet country and grew up in the nineties - one of the last soviet birth certificates ever issued. My parents were intelligentsia - young academics, fairly average for the time in most ways that matter. Needless to say in the decade after the collapse of the USSR we lived in extreme poverty like the majority of citizens of those newly independent nations. My parents\u2019 marriage ended badly, and my guardian parent (mother) gradually turned into a very financially successful high functioning alcoholic. She was a very good provider with an exceptional career, but was extremely mentally and physically abusive - which actually seemed like the norm judging by stories from my classmates.\n\nI reacted to these circumstances by being a \u201crebellious\u201d edgy punk teenager. I had above average grades (and was beaten to a pulp whenever that wasn\u2019t the case), but otherwise regularly got into a lot of trouble. I started smoking at eleven, abusing alcohol at twelve (initially via stealing a swig from the aforementioned guardian when she wasn\u2019t looking), abusing over-the-counter narcotics at 14 and eventually graduating to dangerous illegal drugs by 15 (dangerous in both a medical sense, and in the sense that had I\u2019d gotten caught by authorities using them the consequences would have been pretty horrible).\n\nI had a positive outlet in music - I started playing in a grunge band at age 15, and was considered pretty talented by my peers - and got a measure of self-respect by being complemented for my art. But otherwise I was an aimless burnout loser with no ambition and an increasingly volatile and unstable psyche. This included a lot of self-harm like cutting and burning myself, provoking people into fights and sabotaging anything good that happened to me - for example, once I took first place in a state academic competition (these are a long-standing thing from soviet times) called an olympiad, which took a lot of effort and hard work to achieve - and, as the certificates were being given out and the winners got a chance to speak, I proceeded to give a long \u201cfuck you\u201d diatribe to the judges, my teachers and \u201cthe system, man\u201d. I thought that was funny and an all-round victory at the time (I won their game and still stuck it to them), but all it got me was severe trouble at home and at school. Once I pulled that stunt, I immediately proceeded to go on a celebratory drug and alcohol binge for 48 hours, not coming home and forcing my family to involve the police to find me and bring me home. That\u2019s the kind of behavior I enjoyed at the time. This continued through University, which I dropped out of despite having good grades and being characterized as a talented and promising student.\n\nDespite all of the above, I somehow managed to end up with a pretty successful and well-paying career over the next decade, and finding a loving significant other whom I eventually married. Having said that, this same decade was kind of a nightmare. I felt absolutely empty inside, frequently abused alcohol and drugs, and even my one passion - music - felt like a job - at one point a band that I put together just collectively  quit on me because they felt like I hated the whole process and didn\u2019t actually want to play with them. I gained a lot of weight and several unpleasant and embarrassing health problems. More times than I\u2019d like to admit I was so close to suicide the only thing that stopped me was fear of death - and I felt like a complete coward because I could not even end my life without being a failure at it. But most significantly, I was always in this state of exhausting apathy that seemed to overshadow anything I tried to do. It just sucked the fun out of everything, and not just for me, but for the people around me as well. I lost almost all the people I cared about (thankfully excluding my wife who still stuck by me), and if I were to ask them why it happened they would be completely justified in answering \u201cbecause you didn\u2019t care\u201d.\n\nI tried therapy several times, but it never seemed to do anything for me. I even checked myself into a properly scary mental institution at one point - nothing changed. I was diagnosed with everything from bipolar disorder to schizophrenia, and given the appropriate prescriptions, but I always ended up just swallowing ten times the dose and washing it down with liquor, because the underlying feeling of ugh was just always there, punctuating everything, reminding me that no matter what I do I will never enjoy myself until my life ends. I even had this paranoid idea that the doctors resent me because by failing to get better I\u2019m making them look unprofessional.\n\nThen my pet cat died. A guiltless companion whom I loved dearly got a sudden and severe illness that caused him extreme suffering through no fault of his own. I spent irrational amounts of money and effort to try and get him better, but it just got to a point where the vets declared that the only humane course of action was to put him down. Which I did. After which I proceeded to drink myself stupid, cry like an infant and listen to Nirvana at an unadvisable volume. This event did something to me - it showed me that if I kept on being the way I am, and someone who cared for me were watching, helpless to do anything about it, my eventual collapse into a pile of dead shit would break their heart - even if that someone didn\u2019t exist (which they did, as I now realize).\n\nSo I started from scratch by trying to claw out a tiny victory from the jaws of suck, just because it felt that if I don\u2019t try then I am really to blame. I attempted to lose some weight via a method advised by a Las Vegas magician. Which, to my surprise, worked. Then I set another tiny goal - find a new psychiatrist who would advise me on some new medication - no expectation of being magically cured, just an honest attempt, if it fails it fails. So I got the prescription and stuck to it for three months. And suddenly - another small victory. My past mistakes weren\u2019t erased, my relationships didn\u2019t magically fix themselves - but I felt a little better. I felt a little less apathy. Just a tiny little bit less.\n\nSuddenly I find myself having just enough energy to write a song. And then another one. And another one. And then I find myself being a little enthusiastic about just hanging out with a long estranged friend. And then I\u2019m carefully trying to patch things up with some family members - if it fails it fails, no harm if it all goes wrong. And then I\u2019m feeling like, after playing a gig at a club with my band, I don\u2019t feel the need to drink to socialize. And then I\u2019m, all of a sudden, sending out resumes to companies that will likely pay me twice as much as I was getting before because my wife mentioned that maybe we could consider having children in the next few years - if I get no responses I\u2019m not losing anything, right? And then I\u2019m spending an evening with my mother and not feeling like I\u2019m going to have a panic attack. And then I\u2019m writing a post on reddit about how no matter how deep the hole you\u2019re in is, you can start crawling out if you just take it one millimeter at a time.\n\nThis post is about how antidepressants gave me the energy to start putting my psyche back together. But it\u2019s actually kinda about how it\u2019s fine if the victories you have in the war against your depression are small. And yes, I\u2019m convinced that the pills were the pivot point, even though the story feels more satisfying if it\u2019s about a revelation given by the sacrifice of a beloved pet or whatever the fuck. Whoever you are, reading this - getting the courage to ask for help is a small victory, while failing at achieving results in therapy isn\u2019t a defeat - you have lost nothing because you tried and failed. Sticking to instructions given by your doctor is a victory, while relapsing into destructive behavior isn\u2019t a defeat - you were actually destructive to begin with so you haven\u2019t lost anything. Apologizing to a loved one for when you were selfish and uncaring is a small victory, while being too afraid and embarrassed to tell someone you are in pain isn\u2019t a defeat - nothing has changed just because you failed this time. Being down in a hole is perversely comfortable because the dark and damp and stink are familiar - the fresh air and light above is what\u2019s scary. So gift yourself with little victories all the time - you\u2019re still in the familiar hole, but the air is a little fresher. A big dramatic breakthrough in therapy will probably never happen for you. But believe it or not - small victories mount.\n\nMaybe you can\u2019t get healthy. But you definitely can get a tiny bit healthier, and then another tiny bit to go with the first one. And it\u2019s going to be alright. Eventually.\n\nThank you for reading, and go win a little.",

        "original": "\\~sorry for my broken english, i'd really like to talk about this with someone but i'm too afraid to do so in therapy because i've always been laughed at even by my family or some of my close friends when i told them how much any of this actually hurt me, changed me like a person and how much i'm struggling to properly name these things that had happened to me. \n\nso, my question is, is any of this considered sexual abuse? \n\n\\-when i was 11, i had just met a guy online that was 19 years old at that time on an anonymous chatting site ([connected2.me](https://connected2.me)). he was basically stalking me. every day he would present himself as a different guy and try to gather as much information about me as possible. one night he was really pushy to get me to talk to him on skype, i eventually agreed to talk to him. long story short, he blackmailed me into showing myself nude on the camera (on multiple occasions) with all the information that he had gathered (and very graphic photoshoped sextings with ''me''). no matter how much i've cried on the camera and begged him to leave me alone he just demanded more. he still to this day tries to contact me and makes fake profiles on instagram to try and get me to talk to him. \n\n\\-when i was 15, a drunk solider got really aggressive towards me because i didn't want to kiss him. he was moving towards me and i was walking backwards for at least 10 meters until i bumped with my back in the fence and didn't have anywhere else to move from him. he pressed his body against mine and said something along the lines of ''why are you shaking so much, if i wanted to i could've raped you by now''. eventually two of my friends saw us and came to get me out of that situation. \n\n\\-few months later, when i had just turned 16 i got a little drunk and hang out with my friends in the park. we got bored so we went to a cafe where we were often going out. the owner was always really nice to me and i was friends with the waiter and the bartender so i always felt like i was home when i went there. time passed and it was closing time and the waiter and the father of a boy that liked me (that man insisted that i call him ''uncle Ron'' so that was weird but i thought he was just friendly and i didn't think much about that, he was my father's age) invited me and my guy friends to come with them to fair that was really near. i knew all the people that i was with so i felt safe and i went with them. everything was fine until it was time for me to go home. i couldn't get into a single taxi and i never went home by foot because i lived in the suburbs. my friend offered to walk me home even though we would walk 30 minutes to my home and i accepted. so we said good-bye to everyone and went to my place by foot. few minutes later ''uncle Ron'' picked us up and said that he will drive us home. so my friend sat in the backseat and i was just getting into the back when uncle Ron said ''no, little girl, come sit in with me in the front, i want to talk with you''. again, i was a little drunk so i didn't think much of it. he dropped off my friend in the city and then we were alone in the car. he started to drive really fast and he started to ask me really inappropriate questions like ''so, are you a virgin? i mean, i've fu\\*ked both virgins and non-virgins so i don't mind it anyways'' and then he said that i had to choose if i'm gonna seep with his son or him. i got really scared and i didn't know what to do, i tried to be as polite as i could be and tried to ignore it. he eventually started to touch my thighs and other inappropriate places. i didn't know what to do, i really thought about jumping out of the car but he was driving very fast and my phone just died so i couldn't call anyone for help. he then offered me a ''vitamin'' and handed me a pill, of course i didn't really swallow it, i still don't know what that pill was but it surely was not a vitamin. eventually we got to my neighborhood. i told him to stop about 200 meters away from my house and when he stopped the car he tried to kiss me and i still to this day don't have an idea how i've managed to get out that car and thank god nothing besides that happened. \n\n\\-last but definitely not least is the case of my ex boyfriend with whom i've broken up about 10 days ago. i told him about every situation i've just typed about and he knew that i was really scared of intimacy and that i didn't like to be touched except when i really made it clear that it was okay. at that time i didn't even let my family or best friends hug me because i was so disgusted by the thought of being touched. about a month into the relationship he manipulated me into having sex with him and i started crying during that sex at some point. he even made me feel bad because i cried and and i felt awful. few months later he made me take huge amounts of benzos that i'm taking for my anxiety because he really wanted to get high off of them but he ''didn't wanna do it without me''. i got really sleepy and he insisted that we have sex but i really couldn't do it because of all the pills he made me take. he carried me around his whole house and in every single room insisted on the same thing. after few hours i snaped and i started to shake and cry uncontrollably. after all that shit i forgave him and i even paid for an apartment for the two of us in a nearby city so we could get away from our parents. i have a really messed up sleeping pattern from my early childhood and i need to sleep at least 12 to 14 hours and it's nearly impossible to wake me up if i'm not well rested, so he took the chance to try to have sex with me while i was asleep. i cried again, i couldn't believe that my boyfriend that was supposed to support me and take care of me tried to take advantage of my unconscious body like that. thank god that i gathered the courage to finally break up with him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nso, i've told this to many people and most of them told me that i need to grow balls and that i shouldn't call my ex a low-key rapist. even. tho. he. really. messed. me. up. others blame me for these situations that happened to me. \n\nsorry for the long post, but it really felt good to vent about these things somewhere.",

It's really weird to rely on strangers and I think now that I'm alone, I'm sort of in denial right now but pushing through it as best as I can. \n\nShe woke up again but wasn't as delirious and we talked. Not much but I comforted her and she's incredibly stressed about bills and family and a lot more than I can type. I brought up Christmas breakfast and she seemed really sad about it and hurt. She probably remembers. \n\nI can't not worry about bills it feels. She's our only income. What happens when she's gone? I can't work a job and run a club and study and not fall into a hard depression. I can't lose our house. I don't want to go bankrupt before I'm eighteen. I don't have any money in savings. I'm broke and this family is broke. \n\nWe can't even afford to get me an I.D or License. It's paycheck to paycheck.\n\nOn my mother's side: my grandmother is gone and my grandfather doesn't care for her. The other side of the family doesn't care for us either (I once had a savings account for college but they tried to spend it all just so I wouldn't. I don't have any money for college because of that. Yay.)\n\nUpdate 2:\nGuess who found the answer! It's alcohol. A lot of freaking alcohol. She's been getting drunk every night and I'm assuming that stress and everything only adds to her dreams and illusions. I've spoken to my dad about things and it's bad enough that it scares him sometimes. \n\nIf she doesn't have her alcohol, she tries to cut her wrists apparently and holy fuck. She wants a fight so she can be a victim I think.\n\nI'll be making a post to the Alcoholics Anonymous subreddit to look for some help like I did in the past. She barely remembers her days I think so it can explain her memory loss, abnormal attitude, and mannerisms as well as her depression which keeps spiraling down. \n\nI'm half tempted to say \"It's me or the alcohol\" and take her keys and remove all the knives and weapons and alcohol from the house but I know that's the wrong course of action. I've dealt with this before but never like this. Who knew that the reason we were struggling financially was because of her addiction? She beats herself up for not being able to purchase gifts this year for a single child (me, but I don't want gifts) and hates herself then buys herself a big bottle of Skyy Vodka and drinks herself to sleep. I thought we were past this. Did I mention that she's had heart surgery? To replace a valve? She has, and I fear this will get her killed sooner.",

        "original": "Good evening, \n\nI am now 18 years old, and to be honest I never thought I would make it to the age of 18. 16 was a big milestone too. To start out, I was homeschooled my entire life along with my sister and spent a lot of it walking on eggshells trying not to make my mother get angry because she would go into a rage at the drop of a hat or get really depressed. Knowing what I do about her past NOW makes it a little more understandable. Probably PTSD and a whole lot of other crap. \n\nBut I don\u2019t need to bring that up now. I\u2019m 18, but I\u2019ve been suicidal as long as I can remember. It got really bad from about age 13-16 to the point of several suicide attempts and a fair bit of probably brain damage from overdoses, slamming my head into things, suffocation, etc. I have been struggling to shower, brush my teeth, change clothes, more than once or twice a week for most of my life. I don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s just never been easy to do like most things in my life. Despite that, at my job I\u2019m one of the hardest workers there, and have been told I will be offered a promotion soon after only working at target for about 3 months. In my volunteer job I have taught classes, mentored cadets aged 12-19, and taken on various staff roles including supply, and now commanding a squadron of 150 cadets. \n\nWhat I am saying is I don\u2019t have any problem handling responsibility, but when I\u2019m home I can\u2019t clean, read, work out, or do much of anything worthwhile except research on my various business ideas/projects. Basically at home I\u2019m a complete loser, but anything that doesn\u2019t involve home I excel at. If I excel at home it\u2019s despite being at home. I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s just that things went downhill at home for years in my mental state. Suicidal all the time, homocidal urges even for the only person I actually care about (my father), and I\u2019ve been a pathological liar for over a decade and I don\u2019t know why. \n\nI think I\u2019m a hypochondriac because I\u2019ve been told so for years by my mother. I don\u2019t feel emotional connection to anyone except my father somewhat. Anyone in my life could die, except my father, and I wouldn\u2019t be happy, but I wouldn\u2019t be upset. Anytime I\u2019m away from anyone I know I forget about them until I see them again. I have memories of things like being raped, about hallucinations, about seeing demons, but I don\u2019t know if they actually happened. I\u2019m super paranoid a lot of the time, and my boss accuses me of anxiety all the time now. \n\nTo sum up because I can\u2019t get my thoughts together and my memory seems to be failing like always, I used to struggle with extreme suicidal and homocidal urges (but don\u2019t anymore for some reason after snapping and losing the ability to socially connect with anyone), and every year feels like it\u2019s become worse although it doesn\u2019t affect me emotionally anymore because I\u2019ve sort of cut off my emotions. I\u2019m constantly paranoid of people, of being mentally ill, of being sick, and of hurting people emotionally. I feel like I\u2019m emotionally delayed by about 2 years. My memory is becoming increasingly horrible. I still have suicidal urges sometimes, but I don\u2019t want to act on them anymore although I still have them every time something in my life starts to go wrong. I feel sane for the first time in my life and not depressed, but everything at home goes so badly because I have no motivation when I\u2019m home. I can excel outside of my home. My hygiene is awful, showering maybe once a week, rarely brushing teeth, but I can still pass off clean cut when I need to. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t but I just can\u2019t seem to be able to keep up with a hygiene routine. \n\nWhat do I do? Am I insane/mentally ill?

I\u2019m tired of seeing the absence of humanity in humanity and of disbelieving the authenticity of reality. When the majority of what you feel is the distance between what you think you should be as opposed to what you are, your life is bound to lose its color.

It seems to occur at the worst of times, especially as I\u2019m conversing with someone and especially with my girlfriend (despite her being my closest and most trustworthy confidant).\n\nI want to love the things I love without fear of judgment or without feeling like none of my interests actually matter.

I lived in a really strict and controlling environment and had a violently autistic brother which would cause a lot of family troubles.  Always being called ugly, and fat, and lazy. Growing up I hoped and wished that I would be in a happier and loving environment. \n\nI'm almost 27 now and looking back at my life, I did think I'd still be just as unhappy. \n\nMy love life is a mess and non-nonexistent. \n\nThe first guy I was ever \"with\" just kind of dumped me but he was secretly dating a \"friend\" of mine behind my back.   \nThat \"friend\" not only did that, but tried to put all our friends against me  and cat fished me just messing with me the entire time. Luckily I moved away. \n\nJust tonight (1/4/2020) I find out that they are married and have a kid and only now did he try to apologize after like 15+ years. Sure, he tried to make amends but I didn't ever wanna hear from them again.   \n\n\nThe second guy I ever like was just a typical fuck boy. It took me forever to get over him. He would talk about me behind my back and all that other crap. Then years later he tries to apologize for being an ass only to ask to be friends with benefits. Then even some years later he tried hitting me back up again to apologize and make amends, but again, not having it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe third guy I ever liked, kind of changed my life for the better. He just kind of disappeared out of my life and to this day I haven't heard from him again. Although, I swear I saw him a few years ago visiting my friends at their school campus but ... anyways \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fourth guy, I knew him from college and I thought I'd chat it up with him again and maybe make a connection. I thought we were getting close, I thought I was winning him over but he was just using me for attention. AND he started dating her without ever talking to me about it, either of them. They were someone I saw as friends and they didn't have the heart to talk to me about it. And that friend I introduced him to, SHE KNEW I like him too. Then some other friend butt in and I thought I was gonna lose everyone in my life. It was a really dark time for me. I almost flunked out of school because of it. But I found some new friends and someone who will probably be special to me forever. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fifth guy, he's everything I've ever wanted in anyone. We know everything about each other. We accept each other's faults and we are super close. But alas, he doesn't have any feelings for me back. Yes, I did tell him. We are really good friends and its all I could really ask for. But I still love him and I always will.   \n\n\nI have been using a dating app for 6 months now no success at all. If I even get someone to reply back the conversation (if that is even what I can even call some of them) don't even last a few hours before they fall of the face of the earth after saying, \"Yea, let's meet up!\" \n\nAnd in between all these years, my first kiss was taken away from me from a guy that didn't give a damn about me.

        "original": "**Background**: I've been worried for my brother for a long time now. It all started, in summer 2016, when my family and I were getting ready to travel out of the country and on the day we were travelling, my 18-year old brother jumped out of a window. We found out where he was because we called his friend's mom. She had told us that he was in the hospital. The reason why he jumped out of the window is that he wanted to escape from my family, most specifically my dad. After this incident, there has been an ongoing conflict between my brother and father. My brother most commonly accused my father of not treating him like a man, only being focused on his work and not his family. He also claimed that my father verbally abused him. \n\nAs soon as we think everything is resolved between my father and brother, my now 19-year old brother runs away again. This time to a shelter for disadvantaged youth. We know that he's in the shelter because we received a call from the director, telling us that he's in the shelter. Once we picked my brother up, he claimed that he knew that he didn't belong there. He said that his life wasn't as hard as the people who were in the shelter.\n\n**Present day**: My brother is now 21-years old who is supposed to have senior standing. On December 30, my brother sat my father and mother down to tell them that he wouldn't be graduating on time. He also told them that he had been editing his grades to make them look good, even though he has been failing this whole time. Although he was failing out of his major, he continued studying it. The reason why he continued to study his major is that he thought that he would eventually like it. He came up with the solution to choose 4 courses from 4 completely different majors. Meaning that whichever course he likes best, he will pursue the courses in that major. \n\nMy parents, sister, and I have been trying to explain to him how this is not fair because he is essentially repeating undergrad all over again. Meaning that my parents will have to fork over thousands of dollars when all of this could have been prevented if he had spoken up about failing his courses as early as Sophomore year of school. If he had spoken up earlier, we could have found him a major that was more suitable for his interests. The issue with my brother is that he is incapable of hearing anyone elses's side and he thinks that he is always right. Even when someone makes a valid point, he ignores the person speaking and interrupts what they're saying. I have observed that my brother has this, 'I'm always right and everyone else is wrong' idea. He seems to lack concern and remorse for having to redo undergrad all over again. He acts as if money is easy to come by and he acts as if it is no big deal that my parents have to spend money on his education. Additionally, he explicitly said that the only reason he's living in my family's house is for education purposes and if education were not in the equation, he'd be living somewhere else. That sounds like exploitation to me. \n\nUnfortunately, this is only a summary of all the events that have occurred. Alas, what should I do?

It sucked and the african guy used to talk to me like shit and be aggressive.\n\nI spent the better part of a year getting blackout drunk on my own or getting a couple grams of ketamine or MDMA and staying up all night (this is how i spent my 18th birthday), i was alone. every fucking moment of my life was hell, i was seeing on social media that all the kids i went to school with were getting awesome 18th birthday presents and they were all going off to college etc. and i was sat unable to move on my bed in a puddle of tears, sweat, blood and piss high off my face on 2 grams of ket. it wasnt even about the presents they got i just wanted someone to care that it WAS my birthday, that i exist and that theyre stoked on it. but i had noone.\n\nanyway i moved back to my parents after 10ish months as i got a job there so it would make my life easier, but they insisted that if i was to live in \"their\" house (the house ive lived in all my life) that i would have to work on controlling and suppressing my mental health.\nAfter 3 months I got kicked out again because my mum said she didnt want to be stepping on eggshells in her own house, which effectively means, she felt like my self suppression wasnt enough and she was noticing that i was sad all the time. she used to tell me to just cheer up or swear at me and call me miserable and tell me that im bringing everyone else around me down too.\n\nIve got bored of typing but basically:\n\ni just smashed a 32 inch tv by repeatedly smashing my head into it, just because i couldnt think straight and i didnt know how else to release my anger. my head hurts. my heart hearts. the tv is fucked. there is no cure. i am alone.",

        "original": "  \n\nHi Reddit!\n\nFirst time posting here and looking for some outside advice. \n\n  I\u2019ve had a rough time when it comes to mental health lately, but I\u2019m slowly getting better. A big issue of mine that I constantly have problems with though, is obsessive overthinking and overworrying that makes me extremely anxious about *everything*. I do that a lot, to the point it\u2019s affecting my life. I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m the most stressed I\u2019ve been in a while now (I have lots of stuff going on: I\u2019m a 22F, a full-time student, financially independent \u2013  so I work a lot, I've got a possible big life changes coming up, I'm in a serious relationship for the first time\u2026), but the overthinking and worrying is getting out of hand. \n\n  It\u2019s affecting my relationship in particular \u2013 I\u2019ve been dating my great friend (also 22F, and a fellow student) for 3-4 months now, and though we really care for each other, the general circumstances are not ideal. My girlfriend has an extremely homophobic family, and though it\u2019s all nice and easy for us to be together when we\u2019re away from our homes during academic year, the future is very uncertain. I got stuck in a rather selfish loop of thinking that I\u2019ll obviously never be \u2018worth\u2019 risking her family\u2019s anger, and therefore she\u2019ll clearly just break up with me. Which is very, very one-sided way of looking at this whole ordeal \u2013 she truly cares for me and treats me very well, and though she doesn\u2019t like to talk about it, it clearly hurts her to think she might have to pick between me and her parents at some point. We promised ourselves to give this relationship a fair shot despite the bad circumstances, and she\u2019s been nothing but true to her promise. Me, on the other hand \u2013 I just constantly worry and overanalyze and overthink, which leads me to not properly appreciate the moments we spend with each other. \n\n  Similarly, the overthinking got my uni & job too \u2013 I worry so much about not meeting some invisible high standards I set for myself that sometimes I end up completely failing a task, because I\u2019d rather not do something at all than to do it half-assed or not well enough. And half-assing things sometimes is kind of essential if you want to complete your uni course, maintain a job that pays all bills, be in a relationship and also do a decent work on your bachelor\u2019s thesis. \n\n  Generally, the anxiety caused by all this worrying makes me completely underappreciate all the great things I've got going on in life - I'm just 22 and yet I have a job I really like in my preffered field, a loving new gf and a great group of friends. So, my question is \u2013 how do I stop this terrible cycle of constant worry/overthinking about the future? How do I stay aware of what\u2019s going on in the moment, instead of needlesly overanalyzing things weeks or months before they even have a chance to happen?",

My brain kept me up at night. I reached out to my friends and I just wanted to die.

I did something (somethings) stupid--I torched a piece of rag on a porch of an abandoned house which is now all remodled, so something good did come out of that---it is a beautiful home now), then I torched the Dumpster behind the Planet Fitness...twice. Also a shit ton of paper...and wooden pallets)...\n\n2.) My stupid ass got caught...What a moron I am...Sigh. Caught on camera torching the Dumpsters...UGH.\n\n3.) I got arrested on January 3, 2019 by our Fire Marshal...embarrassing as hell. Much deserved embarrassment.\n\n4.) Got arraigned in front of a Magistrate at 9:00 pm...got told I am a \"Danger To Society\" (direct quote) and my bail was set at $50,000 straight. Needless to say...I didn't even have the 7% ($3,500) that the one BailBondsman wanted. I went to prison (not jail...we have the Big House that houses Federal and State and County cases) and was miserable for days and weeks and month on end.\n\n5.) Had 10 court appearances and was continued 5 times....Months passed. Misery abounded and I learned a lot about myself.\n\n6.) Finally put in my Plea (Guilty of course) on October 2, 2019 and was finally told that I would get my Sentencing Date in the mail...which I did 2 weeks later. It was set for 4 more weeks from them (6 weeks from the Plea Date--normal) which I sweated out. Time passed quickly and I was starting to realize a lot more about the WHYs even though there was NO therapy whatsoever. The other girls (only certain ones) were sounding boards and an ear or three to bend when one of us was feeling extra-miserable and anxious.\n\n7.) FINALLY went to court on November 20, 2019, sat there through 3 other cases (one guy had to pay several-thousand dollars in restitution and he was sentenced to 10-30 years upstate--ouchie) and then stood on front of the judge and he lectured me (MUCH appreciated actually) and then sentenced me to 9-23 months incarceration and a 2 year tail (Probation) TIME SERVED. So I was officially d-o-n-e with the courts! Happy day.\n\n8.) Stupid holidays. Thanksgiving (Nov. 28) and Christmas Day (Dec. 25) AND New Year's Day (Jan.1) ...nobody really works from just before T-Giving until after New Year's...so yeah. I had to spend all that time still in prison. Eh. I knew that was gonna happen so I was ready for it.\n\n9.) Yesterday, on the ONE YEAR anniversary of my arrest (Jan. 3, 2020) I was woken up out of a dead sleep (for real lol) by my cellie pounding on the bottom of my bunk (I was on top bunk) telling me they want me. I said grumpily and sleepily \"What now?\" and then the Block Worker told me to get my stuff together because I was being cup & toweled (released)...and I just looked at her blankly for about 20 seconds. I was in shock all the way out...hah. I am still not used to being OUT...everything is so...Big and scary.\n\nWent to the store with my hubby (we took a long walk) and it was almost enough to make me have an anxiety attack. I didn't though and everything was fine. Everything is fine so far. The kids are over the moon to have me home. Hubby can finally relax a little. I did dishes and mopped the floor and am organizing this hot mess we call an apartment. Tee Hee.\n\nSo, please NO flaming (ooops no pun intended there lol) or negative comments. I have already suffered. I am solely responsible for the suffering of the children...That was my fucking fault. I have to live with that pain that my kids were traumatized terribly.\n\nSigh. I know what would help my suffering but I am not keen on violating Probation and making them suffer again. If anything else happens...it will definitely break our family. That is a hell of a load to carry...\n\nBut I am ready to do just that, despite the pain in my own heart trying to battle something that is such a part of me and always has been.\n\nI will be in therapy and doing other things, so I won't be around except on weekends much (late in my day I will)...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSigh.",

She has been arguing with me about the same things for 3 days but each day she resolutes it and says \u201cits okay xx we shouldnt be fighting like this\u201d \n\n\nSo recently I\u2019ve had an argument with my girlfriend and currently we are in a quiet bad financial situation we are both low on money but I return back to work in a couple of days we both smoke weed as she is quite more dependent on weed then I am but recently we have had an after pay is due and she would be the one that has to pay it because I currently have no funds in my account until I return to work she\u2019s very upset about it and hasn\u2019t now for a past four days abuse me called me names and blame me for a lot of things that\u2019s not my fault she\u2019s called my mother a bitch and called my mother a lot of names that I can\u2019t imagine she justifies her calling my mum names and get mad at me when I stick up for my own mother she expects me to side with her and agree with her every time she says something bad about my mum and only reason at the moment that she is quite upset with my mum is due to the fact that on Christmas she received a present f from my mum of $50 and three hand creams two of the hand creams had been opened my girlfriend was quite upset about it and asked me to message my mum my mum had then told me she had not opened it whatsoever and had been straight straight from the store I told my girlfriend that but she refused to believe it and continues to think of my mum as a disgusting and horrible person which is what i keep hearing from her. She also makes a lot of threats to kill yourself and I don\u2019t mean here in there but every time I hang up the phone because I\u2019m sick of hearing the horrible things about my mum she will call back and say  \u201cif you hang up on more time I will kill myself\u201d in the past fight with had she would tell me to tell her everything that she has done wrong and should be sorry for it but today I told a something that had ticked me off but rather made me quite upset to and she told me to get over it. and this is just a side note but for Christmas I received $30 from her mum and dad combined but from my side she received $50 for my mum and 100 from my dad but yet she still thinks that my mother and dad don\u2019t give a crap about her. my girlfriend and my dad never see each other due to the fact that me and I don\u2019t have a rocky relationship already but also the fact that she never wants to come to any of the restaurant we go to because she doesn\u2019t eat any of the food and most of the time it\u2019s already been a premade family event so she gets quite upset and said no I will not come. I live with my mum though and I spent quite a lot of time with her..well i used to. nowadays I spend all my days weekends and hours with my girlfriend I\u2019m not complaining at all but at the same time it just seems like you\u2019re always at her house and not at mine what nowadays I go to work from six in the morning until three in the afternoon I never get to see my mum in the morning because shes asleep and when I come home from work I have to go to my girlfriend straight away or at least like to sometimes but most times it\u2019s just to make sure that she doesn\u2019t get mad at me. \nMy girlfriend always tells me that I don\u2019t care about her I don\u2019t stick up for her but I\u2019ve dedicated my whole life to her pretty much I don\u2019t spend time with mum any more I never get a whole 24 hours a week with her only two my girlfriend always tells me that I don\u2019t care about her I don\u2019t stick up for her but I\u2019ve dedicated my whole life to her pretty much I don\u2019t spend time with mum any more I never get to spend time with my mum. She brings up all the time that it\u2019s never good to bring up stuff from the past but she always brings up about what my mum has done to her in the past even though it\u2019s nothing bad she still has a grudge against my mum from the first week that we started dating when she couldn\u2019t get any sleep because my girlfriend was sick and coughing all night nowadays it\u2019s a different story even though if she coughs my mum doesn\u2019t bother she brings up all the time that it\u2019s never good to bring up stuff from the past but she always brings up about what my mum has done to her in the past even though it\u2019s nothing bad she still has a grudge against my mum from the first week that we started dating when she couldn\u2019t get any sleep because my girlfriend was sick and coughing all night nowadays it\u2019s a different story even though if she coughs my mum doesn\u2019t ask her to be quiet any more she understands. do you have my work Christmas party was one of the worst times I\u2019ve had to experience she had gotten very very very very upset at me because I had gone to a Christmas party but that wasn\u2019t the thing that made her upset it was the fact that she thought I was going to cheat on her because of her past experiences and I completely understand that but at the same time I insured her nothing is going to happen and especially due to the fact of being together for the past two years. during the work party I had messaged her for a whole hour because we were doing an activity together and I had messages straight after to let her know that everything was okay but by the time I message to back and hour later she had already gone over to write about how angry she was. she said that I probably would\u2019ve been cheating on a lot of people and that I am a cunt and much much more horrible names. The only reason this is taken three days to write is due to the fact that she has been going over the same argument three days in a row every single day for the past three days she has gotten angry about me about how we have no money and how she will have to pay for everything until I go back to work every day for the past three days she had gone angry about how my mum got a used hand creams every day for the last three days I\u2019ve been hearing about how much of a cunt and horrible bitch in a miserable bitch my mum is every day for the past three days I\u2019ve been hearing about how I do nothing and how this is all because of my fault. \n\nThis was one of the hardest things to write, Because when so many things want to come out at once you forget how to let out each feeling. Even forgetting what those feelings were. This was the only way i was able to let you guys know whats still going on and for me to see if im going crazy with how im viewing this. \nI dont want to kill myself, but im also finding it hard to find happiness here. Im asking her to change, But instead of finding a resolution or progress, shes telling me if i dont like it i should leave despite the small progress shes made in the start. Its starting to feel like a warzone aswell, Between me and her and her mum, But not so much her mum as she gets dragged into it by my girlfriend. But then shes forced to give an opinion about the situation and most times shes siding with her but with ridiculous things obviously she understands my point of view. i dont know guys. its getting abit too much at this point but its nothing new for me.",

Though, this is what has happened within my family. \n\nMy brother had depression during his high school days and had to spend an extra 2 years to graduate. He slept all day in his room so I never saw him. When I did, he was yelling and arguing with my parents. I was about 5 when this happened. A few years ago, he was in an abusive relationship due to his poor anger management as well. He\u2019s moved in and out of my parent\u2019s house because of his depression and failure to support himself. \n\nMy sister also had major depression during high school. She self harmed and tried to kill herself. There was constant arguing and intensity within the house. I was in middle school when this went down. She\u2019s doing better now but is in EMDR and getting herself sorted out. \n\nMy mother also had a depressive episode because her mom died from cancer (which is understandably hard to deal with). My parents were at risk of divorce but never did. I was roughly age 10 when this happened. Not to mention, I ALSO have anxiety from 14 surgeries in childhood. So, there\u2019s a lot of mental health problems in my family.\n\nThis is stuff that I\u2019ve never talked about with anyone. It\u2019s just too much to think about. Fuck, I haven\u2019t even told everything in this post. Even my therapist doesn\u2019t extensively know this. Though, I plan on talking about this one day but it keeps being put on the back burner. \n\nMany of my friends are going through mental illness at this moment.

        "original": "I have had a really tough week, mentally.\n\nIt started with hyping up a crush I have had for years. I\u2019ve always known the possibility of acting on this crush was not an option, however going into the new year I wanted to speak to a couple friends about it. After some long individual discussions with these people, I came back to the realization that a relationship could never come from this crush and that I, and my friends, hyped it up to me for nothing. From here I began to spiral.\n\nThe initial thought of this crush caused me to have very bad anxiety even thinking about talking to this girl. I lost a lot of sleep over it. Then I lost even more sleep after I began to think of myself negatively and go down that rabbit hole of thinking.\n\nI reopened many mental pathways for my negative thoughts to creep back in. And only a day after I had been so happy with the possibility of finally addressing this crush after almost 6 years, I fell into a depressive state.\n\nOver the last few days, my eating habits have ranged between eating almost nothing to binge eating when I finally get myself to have something. My sleep schedule is completely off because of my racing thoughts, causing me to take hours to fall asleep and then sleeping well into the afternoon. I have begun to have small bouts of crying over small thoughts, such as \u201cyou\u2019re a fucking fat loser who doesn\u2019t deserve to be happy\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ll never find someone to love you and you\u2019re going to die alone so get used to this feeling.\u201d Ive also been very angry at myself and others because of this, as I become jealous of people who don\u2019t have to feel like this.\n\nI feel as though I want to hit a reset button on my life, start with a clean slate. I hate my current position of being a graduate student, hate my interests as nothing is truly giving me pleasure anymore. I hate details about myself ranging from my fashion to the way I interact with people to the way a small piece of my body is formed like a finger.\n\nOn top of all of my personal issues, the problems around the world, including the bushfires raging in Australia and the possible war between Iran and America further pushed my depressive state into a darker place.\n\nToday I was a little better but not much. Talking about it with friends only helps so much, as most of them just have general suggestions to fix my way of thinking that I\u2019ve all heard before. And being with friends in person has distracted me a little bit I keep getting drawn back into this state.\n\nI guess if you\u2019ve read this far into my rant/story I\u2019d like to thank you because I don\u2019t know anyone who would\u2019ve listened this long without trying to just stop me and say I\u2019m overthinking things or I\u2019m just not in the right headspace.

Since some days, I have a problem with sleeping.\nI go to bed as I've always done, but instead of falling asleep, I just start turning around, I get hot and my heartbeat accelerates. During this process I have a storm of thoughts flooding my mind I don't know how to get rid of. This goes on for hours. When I'm so tired that I start falling asleep, I get right away that sensation of suddenly falling and waking up with a gasp and my heart racing again. I noticed that this gets worst when I work/study till late, while it's less strong when I go to bed earlier. \n\nLast night was the worst ever and it started to worry me, that's why I'm writing here. I turned off the lights at past 1 am because I had been having a conversation via texts about aeronautical engines with a friend (we're aerospace engineering students at the most stresful university of our country). All I know is that at half past 3 am I was still awake, my heart pounding and thoughts storming. I experienced the fall-down-and-wake-up (I don't know how to call it) at least more than 5 times, wincing in my bed any time I was close to sleeping. I got up, drank some water, walked around the house. Got back to bed, listened to 10 mins of relaxing music and that kind of helped clearing my mind, but I never really fell into a deep sleep till when the alarm started off.\n\nAlong with this, I think I'm becoming slightly hypochondriac because I'm often worried of being sick or of getting some sort of incurable illness and I tend to see everything way worse than it actually is. Like, I realize my way of worrying and seeing things is wrong - still it happens and I don't know how to stop doing so.\n\nI don't know what happens to me at night, every time it's like experiencing small panic attacks. I did experience some panic attacks by day in June during the summer exams session that would get to me out of the blue and I would suddenly feel like I couldn't breathe, sweat cold, feel my hands freeze and my head dizzy and heart pounding. But then I would just tell myself that I was an idiot and it was all in my mind and I could breathe so I handled it in some minutes and got back to normal. I thought that was solved, but now similar things have started to happen to me again but at night and somehow I don't feel as strong as to fight them again.\n\nI'm worried and I don't know what to do.\nHas this ever happened to you? Do you have any tips? How do I get rid of all of this? Thank you.",

Consistently since sometime around middle school, my own thoughts threaten me with horrible things like deaths of others or Hell. It has made dealing with everyday things like school much more difficult than it should have been; my grades were shit throughout high school and, frankly, continue to be shit in my classes at a local community college. I went to a doctor recently and opened up about symptoms I hadn't been open about before - it had been a mix of me not knowing how to acknowledge those symptoms and downplaying them. I was referred to a specialist to check for psychosis and they found that what I'm dealing with is specifically _undertreated_ OCD. While I am relieved that it's not a psychotic disorder, it's still a pain to deal with OCD. I will be seeing a specialist soon that specifically deals with OCD; I also hope for a medication change.\n\nThe last few months made up my first quarter at the community college. Like throughout most of high school, I managed to severely fuck up the grade of one of my classes and have thus caused my financial aid (through FAFSA) to be suspended for academic reasons. This ongoing trend, caused by a complete lack of self-motivation, has caused me to feel absolutely worthless most of the time. I feel like what I'm doing isn't amounting to anything. This paired with frequent depressive episodes makes me want to stop living altogether, as a feeling of being trapped and worthlessness makes me feel like I have no reason to live, even though it's not true.

Well, this had been brewing for a decade and there were many signs but I was away a lot of the times and mum decided to ignore obvious symptoms because she was scared of her husband being \"crazy\". After he had 2 strokes, an operation due to his diabetes, he got even worse. He is 59 btw. \n\nIn any case, the fact that my father is a schizophrenic got exremely obvious and it has also impacted our daily lives due to stupid stuff he does as well his suspicious spending of money. I feel like many people out there are taking advatange of him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe basically thinks he is a messiah that connects with secret cults/aliens that rule the world and is writing a book about it. \n\nI have been very angry and distant to him due to his weird behaviour but now I sort of pity him. He used to be a very rational, street-smart fella. He still has that buried in him as sometimes he makes a lot of sense and is trying to lead us to the best lives we can, but his disorganized thoughts are becoming more obvious now. \n\nWhen I confront him about him being crazy with a bit of sense of humor, he doesnt even deny it. I sort of feel like he is even aware of his problem but still wants to stick with it or something. \n\nHe used an anti-psychotic at some point but decided to stop using it because he was using too many meds and it made him sad.

        "original": "I (M31) feel as if something bad all of a sudden clicked back into place since the holidays. About two years ago, I found my way out of an abusive marriage (which mainly included psychological, emotional, and sexual abuse) which resulted in two amazing kids. However, as I began to distance myself from her, she succeeded in essentially destroying and isolating me via reputation control, gossip, and manipulation. Since I had not yet sufficiently become aware of the effects of the abuse on me, I let it happen (and even felt it was justified). \n\nI struggled with homelessness, isolation (both self-imposed and through social alienation), and an increased sense of depression and anxiety. I eventually turned to drugs, alcohol, and self-harm to cope. Eventually, I was formally diagnosed with an adjustment disorder, which was later changed to complex PTSD. I've struggled with suicidality in the past, and through a lot of counselling and work, I got to a place where I felt stable enough to not consider myself at risk. Since then, I've refrained from substance abuse (6 mo. sober), got an apartment and a job.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned, since the holidays, I've felt as if I'm going backwards for some reason. I've isolated myself from everyone as far as I can manage (even choosing to go hungry rather than leave my room and see my roommates). I have no friends (as I don't feel as if I can trust anyone, and therefore never respond to anyone who actually does reach out). I'm starting to feel more anxious again, to the point of self-harm and more emotional outbreaks. \n\nThe stress is beginning to take its toll on my physical health again as well. When I was first diagnosed, I was given a diagnosis for HPA axis dysfunction, as the adrenaline in my system was causing all sorts of issues. As my symptoms start to reappear, I've also been noticing some other new symptoms as well (such as bloody semen and neuropathy), indicating a potential for something more serious (i.e. prostate cancer). \n\nI've withheld this information from everyone (including my therapist), hoping that I really do have cancer as a way to do my dirty work for me. It's odd to feel my suicidality creep up again with so much blatant morbidity, but also a strange subtlety. In fact, I felt comfort when I'd think about a potential cancer progressing through my body to a point where I could no longer stop it. I don't want to die, necessarily, but I just don't feel that I have much reason to live - especially since I'm so isolated. \n\nMy love for my kids saved me in previous suicidal episodes, but I'm getting back to the point where I feel that they'd be better off without me, especially since I hold myself in such contempt and with such unconditional negative regard. \n\nTo be honest, I don't know why I'm even posting. I don't care for the attention, and I don't want any emotional connections again (since I only expect for them to hurt). I think I just want these feelings out from me, and I don't know how to do that.",

It's not that she's stupid, she just doesn't really think for herself. She has OCD tendencies, calling continually to make sure she has a ride to work(I am her ride on certain days. Another staff is her ride on designated other days) We have to tell her to not call until a certain time or she'll start calling/texting at 7 in the morning and we don't start work until 3pm! I have to pick her up, and she tends to gab(talk) when I really need silence when I drive to work.

I was working towards 80 hour work weeks, but this past week I worked 48, and will continue to work 48 hours until they hire a new AM worker.

My mind feels blank, almost nothing provides me with joy, I spend most of the time walking around like a numb zombie, I seem to have zero motivation to do anything, I feel worthless, simple tasks seem extraordinarily difficult because I overthink everything and convince myself I can't do them, I constantly sabotage myself with negative thoughts. These are all things that I've struggled with to varying degrees at different times in the past  but a few weeks ago all of these symptoms of my mental illness/illnesses seemed to come back in full force and overwhelm me all at once. Due to this rapid decline in mental health, I've made the decision to return home and seek further help while I am still covered under my father's insurance for another year and 4 months. I've been seeing a therapist here - she's a fellow American and is licensed back in the states - but I feel like I need more help. \n\nYet this decision has provided no relief because I am now dealing with: Feeling like a failure because I'm returning home without having saved up much or discovered what I want to do in life, feeling like teaching didn't work out because I'm lazy and didn't work hard enough to improve, sadness at leaving the friends I've made here and not having experienced many of the things I've wanted to, and most importantly an extreme uncertainty about what I will do upon returning home mixed with crippling anxiety abut possibly never getting better.

        "original": "Very long post don\u2019t know if I should break it up, post in a different sub, etc. In short I\u2019m dealing with some difficult mental roadblocks that are negatively impacting me, and I just want to a feel of how much of this is normal, and just a part of being a functioning adult. I tied to bullet point some of my key road blocks and them how they impact me (see bold text below)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMental\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nExtreme boredom - I have yet to consistently loose interest in my hobbies (specialty coffee, whiskey, cooking, operas/symphony), any boredom typically goes away rather quickly here; but these hobbies don\u2019t take up large chunks of my day. So for the rest of it I just go through the same motions and am bored with the day before it even begins. I even got bored writing this post... It seems mundane things don\u2019t interest me as much, where as something like skydiving has really been intriguing me, the intense rush of adrenaline sounds fun. \n\nEmptiness - Other than doing my hobbies or spending times with family/friends, I find myself having an emptiness about myself, a general world cynicism and apathy (to an extent). While I can get feel happy/mad/sad at certain events, this is a brief feeling before returning to my baseline. \n\nFidgety, wanting to be on \u2018move\u2019, kind of like an engine- While I can get into a focused mindset, getting there is tough and seems like I just have to power through the initial boredom, which I cannot do. It also often turns into anger at objects/people when they don\u2019t work/think/move fast enough. I just want them to \u2018act\u2019 it get out of the way so to speak. \n\n**I\u2019m sick of my job, and while I have a math degree finding a job w/out additional training has proven to be a very difficult. But this is where my real struggle begins. Teaching myself a new skill I have to somehow overcome my boredom and fidgetiness - while it\u2019s possible to mange them, getting the task to that point requires the stars to align.**\n\n**But then, \u201cwhy do something else\u201d this is where my emptiness comes in. I really don\u2019t care about a lot of things, nothing really gets me bumped up. For instance I work as a contractor for GoogleMaps, a colleague of mine loves GMs, he has benefited from it and wants to make it better; me I could honestly care less. So how does one find a new path, a new light in a sea of gray? I\u2019m afraid to make a hobby my primary money earner as then it would be an obligation and no longer a choice, or an escape from the monotony of day-to-day.**\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nRelationships\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFamily - see/text them often, good and loving relationship\n\nFriends - not to many friends, but the ones I do have I try to talk/see/go out with as much as I can\n\nSelf confidence - I constantly seem to underestimate myself, and question what I know; for instance, even though I have a driver\u2019s license, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll get into an accident. \n\nSelf esteem - I was fairly overweight in the past, and now it\u2019s much better. While others say I\u2019m looking good I still see fat (which I actually have, probably ~20% bf). I also have things I cannot change like my voice (sounds stereotypical \u2018autistic\u2019 (lack of better word)), or the fact that I have moles/bumps on my face, head, chest.\n\n**Both of the above contributes to me having essentially no dating like what so ever. How can someone like me when there are so many issues? This then turns into a deep feeling of loneliness and a fear that my family (not so much friends) will abandon me (not by choice, but because something happens to them and they die). This feeling, along which many of the above often results in eating food that makes me not feel good as a way to sooth myself, but then it just me feel worse, and this cycle continues, until I can somehow snap out of it. **\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHow much of this is normal? How much of this is just me not being an \u2018adult\u2019 and not \u2018man-ing up\u2019 and doing what is needed?\n\nThe relationship side of things seem to come in waves, especially after seeing my family for an extended period of time (holiday, long weekend). Where the mental side of things is an everyday struggle.\n\nIf you made it this far I appreciate it. I tried to make it as short as possible. I plan to talk to a therapist soon, but wanted to (a) get what is in my head on paper and (b) just get a second opinion on is what I\u2019m feeling \u2018normal\u2019 or something that everyone struggles with? before heading into a therapists office",

I cut off all my old friends and it was a fresh start, I made a few friends and soon Id regret this decision.  we had a lot in common we had nice chats and I got to talking to them out of school but I never trusted them. soon enough they started harassing me and abusing me verbally and physically for 3 years. my confidence was even further ruined I developed social anxiety and I lost the will to live I had insomnia daily and I went through hell but it was only starting.  \na year later I was late to English class and sat by the only kid that had a spot open next to them, we started talking and we had a lot in common. I got to trust him and I shared with him everything and we were very close. the semester ended and we still talked a lot I got my confidence up and I had will to live again he gave me meaning in life, then the next semester started I was transferred to a new class and it was very difficult for me since I had social anxiety, soon enough this friend of mine stopped talking to me and it was as if I never existed he was mean and disgusting he used me and threw me away. only then I realized I had separation anxiety I couldn't see him with other people while I was completely alone and I stopped going to school and started abusing drugs to fill up his hole i was broken I was in a very deep depression and I had a lot of anxiety and suicidal thoughts.  \nuntil he returned I stopped taking drugs for some time and he heard me out gave me support and love I felt alive again then everything crumbled to shit again he got very drunk I was spotting for him then I started having anxiety randomly so I sat on the side until everyone left and it was only the 2 of us then we sat on a bench and I started breaking down and having a panic attack I tried to ask him for help and I turned to other friends and i was just thrown to the trash everyone I came to trust abandoned me and i'm broken and depressed I'm abusing drugs again this time heavy drugs I cant stop without any support withdrawals are too hard for me to handle alone and I just don't have anyone to turn to and I hate myself and I hurt myself I don't wanna get out of bed and I don't want to keep living like this I don't want to be nice when nobody cares when I'm destroyed.

For the most part it's mainly contamination OCD and Instrusive thoughts but not as much as contamination. I've been on sertraline for the last 9 months due to many things that happened last year including a friend suffering a serious brain aneurysm (he is now a lot better and recovering with only some paralysis on his right side but no cognitive impairment or memory loss) and my brother losing consciousness in front of me which wasn't as bad but still had a negative impact on my mental health. Mainly these two events caused a lot of anxiety to arise conserning mainly my own physical health which eventually led me to medication. For the last few months my bath time has increased from 30-45 minutes to 1-1.5 hours which takes a lot of my time away and it's especially difficult because hot water runs out relatively quickly causing me to spend a lot of time under ice cold water while my parents are pressuring me to be a lot quicker as I am taking way too much time to finish. I've talked to both my psychologist as well as my psychiatrist about it and although they are trying to help me it's still very difficult for me to reduce bath time and i would really appreciate some tips for reducing it.

At times when I believe I have spotted the person who can read my mind, I will spend a majority of that time \u2018talking\u2019 to them, trying to get them to leave me alone, and apologising for any thoughts they might have been disgusted by. \u00a0I have had this recurring since about 15/16.

This began when I was around 18.\n\nI have been hearing things I know aren\u2019t there, mainly computer noises or phone sounds, and sometimes chickens (yeah idk either). \u00a0I frequently hear people say random words very loudly before I try to sleep.\n\nI take 250mg effexor for major depressive disorder, and the last two times my depression worsened I felt belief in these things stronger, and they all negatively effected my depression.\u00a0Each depressive episode lasted for about four months, and were about 8 months apart.\n\nI have never really spoken to anyone about these things, as I feel people would think I am joking, lying, exaggerating, or crazy.\n\nPeople know about my depression, and it gets really bad sometimes. \u00a0My last depressive episode, I could barely function I would end up on the floor sobbing because everything was so painful, like a terrible grief as if everyone I knew had died.\n\nThe reason I am getting concerned and think I might need help is because the other week I was just browsing the internet, and saw a sentence in an article that I felt was targeted directly at me - as in it was written as code for me to decipher, like a secret message. But I know that cannot be true because it was written by a stranger and on the internet for literally anyone to read.\n\nI am worried if things like that begin happening more often, that my next depressive episode will be result in death because I won't be able to be able to tell what reality is.\n\nBut I am also incredibly worried that whoever I see will tell me I am making this up, and tell me I\u2019m lying.\n\nWhat should I do?",

I first told my mother, at the time I suspected I had anxiety or depression. I always knew I was a pretty sad person in general but it took me until then to bring it up to someone in my family because I don't trust my family for other reasons I would rather keep private. Upon hearing my concern, my mother immediately shut down my concern and said I didn't need to see a doctor.\n\nMonths later I'm moved out and on my own, now that my mother isn't too involved with my life it gave me a lot of time to think about myself, I spent a lot of time googling questions about some mental symptoms I've been experiencing, drawing conclusions to some crazy mental disorders I probably don't have. I visited a psychiatrist and after telling him all of my concerns he said I had ADHD, which I agree with. Most of my symptoms that have been affecting my life are non-ADHD related.\n\nEvery disorder that google matched to my symptoms didn't quite sound like me, until finally, just a week ago I found dissacoiative disorders, a little bit of reading and DID matched the symptoms I was feeling perfectly. Several months of googling and I feel like I finally found it.\n\nNow that we have a potential answer, I'm afraid to bring it up with my doctor because my psychiatrist says I had no other disorders but I'm convinced I have DID, I'm eager to find out for sure so I can work out a plan to cope with the symptoms that affect my everyday life.\n\nSo my question to you:\nHow should I bring up this issue to my doctor?

I started noticing that I felt empty, and reluctantly told my parents I thought I was depressed. I tried smoking again with another group of friends in college, and this was one of the worst times of my life. I remember vividly being the most paranoid I had ever been, I analyzed every body movement, every word that was spoken, and tried to read it all and come up with something to say/do given the body movements/ things said that wouldn't seem out of place/ out of character. I felt like I wasn't real, and that I didn't know how to be myself anymore. \n\nI know this sounds like just a bad time with weed, but I had smoked for a couple years at this point and it was nothing like the other times. On top of this, this feeling of not being who I am consisted and I still feel it sometimes if I let my guard down. \n I've always been super anxious in any social environment and all of this only hightened my not wanting to leave my dorm room in fear of even seeing anyone and having to \"act\" like a person. Eventually I couldn't handle the not feeling like a real person anymore and resorted to cutting, this only lasted about a month though as I still wasn't feeling anything and had decided I wasn't real, so I might as well test that theory and kill myself. I downed the vyvance I was given for anxiety and took sleeping medication I had left over to ease my way down. Before I went to bed, and I don't even remember this part, I had messaged two old highschool friends and told them not to think it was their fault and to blame me instead. \n They ended up calling campus police who carried me to their car and then rushed me to the e.r. To get my stomache pumped and 6 staples put in my forearm from where I had cut it clean open to \"feel something\" after telling someone all of this I was admitted to a facility and given anxiety/ depression/ sleeping medication and talked to doctors who never really told me what they thought was my condition. I've been to therapy and only been told \"social anxiety\" but I think it's something more and I'm not really sure what to do about it incase another \"episode\" happens.\n\nA last tidbit is that my biological mother apparently had schizophrenia, according to my adoptive mother. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I'm very sorry for the long post. \n\nTl;dr : A year and 3 months ago I was admitted to a facility somewhere in Texas after attempted suicide, and I still don't know my condition.

        "original": "I have read about people\u2019s experiences with POCD and have gathered that the people I have read about have an intense, obsessive fear that they are an actual pedophile when they are actually not, go to extreme lengths to avoid acting on their non-existent pedophilic urges, and can\u2019t fully convince themselves on their own that they aren\u2019t real pedophiles. \n\nIs there a form of this where one strongly knows internally that they aren\u2019t a pedophile and has no fear of actually molesting children, but has a strong fear of being misconstrued as one, or mistakenly viewed as supporter of them offending?\n\nSo here is my situation with this:\n\nI\u2019m an aromantic asexual. I don\u2019t particularly care for porn. I have never been sexually attracted to anyone, even adults. I have only dated someone who was older than me and I know this for sure. I have also learned while dating the one partner I had that my sensory issues make dating hard. I also struggle with physical contact on the whole. On top of that, I have no sexual trauma and am AFAB. I see most kids as cute in an infantile way, like puppies. One of my jobs involves working with kids and I feel like I am at no risk for being turned on by them and have been incredibly oblivious when people point out when one of them has tried to flirt with me. I am probably in the lowest possible risk demographic and feel like I understand that and have internalized it without much effort.\n\nHowever, I rather frequently experience spikes of strong fear that someone is going to take one of my opinions or statements completely out of its original context, or misunderstand it completely, and twist it around in the most un-nuanced way possible to say that I would be along the lines of supporting something like NAMBLA and then use it to completely ruin my life. It almost makes me want to vomit sometimes and I have a hard time lying and bottling thoughts up, and also don\u2019t know who is going to act like a completely illogical pedant when talking to me. I sometimes wish I could just be a convincing liar.\n\nI told my therapist about this and he just shrugged it off, saying that me being \u201cso articulate\u201d about my thoughts should prevent my fears from happening. He didn\u2019t seem alarmed from what I could tell.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of thought processes that end with these fears in case I haven\u2019t illustrated it well above:\n\n1. The age of consent in 31 states is 16. However, in mine, it\u2019s 18 and there are no Romeo and Juliet Laws. It is literally a crime for an 18 year old to sleep with a 17 year old where I live, though I don\u2019t know how often that gets reported when it happens. I think my state should at least be uniform with most of the country and have something to make it alright if the partners are close in age. I have literally had debates with people who think an 18 year old having sex with a 17 year old is pedophilia on par with the likes of Michael Jackson and get super emotional and aggressive about it. I then freak out about who they will tell and how they will tell it to them. \n\n2. I think we shouldn\u2019t freak out about naked toddlers running around on the beach doing typical beach stuff. I also don\u2019t think pictures of it should be sexualized. I had someone tell me they would report me to CPS and try to get me involuntarily committed if they ever found out I had kids due to this viewpoint. There was no reasoning with them.\n\n3. I get incredibly nervous each time the discussion of pedophilia is brought up, firstly because I know that there are extremely specific, yet unspoken expectations on how one\u2019s non-verbal language must be during such talk, and that I struggle with executing this. I frequently get told stuff like, \u201cThat\u2019s not funny, knock it off.\u201d, or \u201cThis is actually serious.\u201d, without really knowing what I\u2019m doing during heavier topics in general. Secondly, I think that non-offenders should be helped instead of killed, and that most  who think otherwise think that those who deviate from this view are as bad as the child molesters themselves. I also just think that this stuff shouldn\u2019t be approached from pure emotional thought and it pisses people off.",

My friends also tell me \"hey dude you give off much more positive vibes than before, wassup ?\" . \n\nI have half expected this is simply just like a temporary +5 happiness buff that will go off suddenly, plunging me back into where I came from. And because of the stark contrast it's going to be a big oof. \n\nSo now 6 jan,I feel strange and detached. It feels like a withdrawal symptom. It also feels as if I \"drugged\" myself hard and now as the holiday season faded, I come to crash and burn.\n\nAlso I should include some background. I'm 24m, undergrad student. Was oscillating on and off suicidal, have felt stupid ugly worthless most of the time. \n\nTldr: Has anyone had a similar kind of experience ? Where a momentarily period of cloud nine high stops, and you fall to the ground ?? \nApologies if this is the wrong sub.\n\nPSA: I'm not on any medication nor any kind of drugs.",

        "original": "I'm a 23 y/o woman in a doctoral program. Currently I am paying my own tuition via loans and scholarship, but still rely on my parents for most other expenses, including health insurance (I live in the U.S.). My parents have been financially supportive throughout my academic journey, but I have had a rocky relationship with my mother, who is highly critical and somewhat emotionally abusive. She is generally very well-intentioned, and I believe her behaviors come from unaddressed mental health issues of her own. \n\nCurrently I am diagnosed with ADHD (my mom often reminds me how much my medication costs), but I also have a family history and several symptoms consistent with depression. The people who are closest to me think I am probably (very slightly) on the autistic spectrum. \n\nLately I've been thinking a lot about the future, specifically about whether I ever want a family of my own. Growing up, I found my home environment very stressful. My mental health improved dramatically as soon as I left for college out-of-state, and to this day even short visits home put me back in my old space of feeling over-stimulated, out of control, and deeply guilty. The more time I spend with my immediate family, the more I appreciate the civility and emotional distance of the academic and professional world. \n\nThere's a part of me that's drawn toward creating a loving family of my own someday, but I also suspect that I might just...  not be emotionally cut out for family life? Most of the things that bothered me in the past weren't clearly abusive. I don't know the fine details of what's normal in a family. What's a normal amount of conflict between a parent and a teenage child? What about between siblings? Are raised voices on a busy weeknight normal? Is it normal for a parent to yell at a child for \"letting\" the dog knock something off a counter, or for being too shy to ask a teacher for help with an assignment? No family is perfect, but where exactly does \"imperfect\" cross the line into \"toxic?\"\n\nMy home always felt (to me) like an angry, loud, high-stress environment, where I was essentially paralyzed until I escaped to a cafe or library somewhere to clear my head and actually get some work done. But how much of that was avoidable? I need to see someone to figure out how much was the tone my mom set, and how much was my own reaction to the way that most families are. If I can expect the same sort of environment from my future home, I doubt I could be a very good mother. If I can be part of a happy family, I'd like to do that. If not, I can build a good life alone: I love being alone with books and ideas, and I'm going into a career where I'll be helping people. As long as I can keep up a few solid friendships, I'll be fine.\n\nIt's not an acute situation, but it's something I need to figure out before I can plan my career path in more detail or get into a serious relationship with anyone. So, obviously, I want to figure it out as soon as possible.\n\nAnyway, I want to see a therapist mostly because of that, and to figure out what my actual diagnosis should be. I also want to work on communication skills, time management, and overall emotional wellbeing. The biggest problem is that my family would have to pay for it. \n\nMy dad is self-employed, so our family's health insurance comes through my mom's job. Her plan has a high deductible, so any care I seek would probably come out of my parents' pocket. My family is decently well-off (sort of upper-middle class), but both of my parents think psychology is \"kind of a made-up field\" (I minored in it). They more or less laughed me off when I suggested my mom should see someone about a specific, deeply traumatic even in her past. I feel like in order for my parents to support me seeing a therapist, I would have to paint my situation as more serious than what it is, and I'm not comfortable with that.\n\nWhat I'm getting at, in a roundabout way, is that I want to see a therapist, largely about my relationship with my mother, and I don't want my mother to know or have to pay for it. My university has emergency mental health resources, but that's not really my situation. I earn a little money through tutoring and odd jobs, but nothing substantial. What I'm probably going to do is wait until I finish my degree and have a good income of my own, but are there any free/inexpensive resources I can use in the meantime?

I'm fighting this negative feeling, which I think stems from a lack of any meaningful romantic relationship, someone to share my life with. I have caring friends and family, and got a dog over the summer, but I still find my life lacking.\n\nI have no romantic experience, only a handful of second dates, and less than 36 first dates, mostly though a blind dating service over the past 2 years. I'm probably on the shallow end of the spectrum, and I'm nervous about interacting with strangers in public settings (bars, parties, etc). I feel I do alright chatting one on one over dinner, but that might be wishful thinking.\n\nI've noticed how empty my life felt about 3 years ago while traveling for work. When I'm away from friends and family, it's almost like I don't exist. Since then, I've been working gradually to improve myself, losing weight slowly, improving diet, practicing conversation and eye contact, signing up for the dating service. I'd like to say I've come a long way, but I don't know anymore. I feel like regardless of what I do or how much effort I exert, it's all going to amount to nothing. Regardless of this lack of self actualization, I feel like I can't just give up, or else any chance I would have would be lost forever.\n\nI can't find lasting worth or value in doing thing alone, but I have a hard time forming new friendships. I guess I feel utterly trapped by my circumstances and choices I made years ago.\n\nGood news is I am going to see someone to maybe help sort by head out on the 13th (even though it took a month for their next opening)\n\nI guess I'm looking for advice, encouragement, or whatever I can get.

Its so difficult for me to reach out to people for help and I\u2019ve honestly never confided in anyone for my mental health and I don\u2019t know what to do. My parents were very authoritative throughout my childhood and established very early on that they have very high expectations of me. I always excelled in school, they enrolled me in arts and dance classes, and I always kept busy with extracurriculars. Outside of home I have always been seen as a social butterfly because of my proactive and upbeat nature. Even though i have made great friends I always feel a barrier between others and myself. Whenever i struggled in school or struggled emotionally I constantly was treated like a failure by my family and compared to those around me. When I immigrated from my home country this continued to worsen. My parents make it so clear that they expect me to succeed and my current state has me feeling like I am constantly disappointing them, and wasting their resources. They work so hard to make ends meet, and work even harder for me to be able to attend university outside of my home city. Especially this year, i have been doing so poorly in school. I constantly feel incompetent because now more than ever, there are so many people around me that are smarter, more successful, have healthier support systems. I constantly feel trapped in my own body because I dont have the means to communicate my emotions to others. When I do feel good about myself, I feel like I don\u2019t deserve to.

I\u2019m constantly fatigued and overworked but have nothing to show for it. I have no confidence, no sense of good self esteem and my friends don\u2019t understand why i constantly put myself down. My parents are seeing more of the damage this is doing to me and now are trying to be more supportive but it doesn\u2019t get through to me because I know they are still so ashamed of me for not being what they need me to be, and in the end I just feel pitied. Mental health has never been a conversation in my home and the one time I tried to get help my mother begged me not to do it because she fears that I will be seen as a crazy person. I\u2019ve gone twenty years with this crippling depressiveness and I just want everything to stop. It feels like nothing will get better and my issues are so deep rooted in early traumatic experiences that I don\u2019t even know where to start. I\u2019m so tired of walking around with such a heavy heart. I\u2019m making this post because it\u2019s getting to a point where I just cant handle it anymore and i legitimately have no emotional outlet and I guess I\u2019m just looking for a small way to start finding help around me",

        "original": "As a warning, this is a mouthful and I apologize in advance, but I need to get it out of my system...\n\nThis is the best description that I can come up with describing what I am experiencing. In short, I have lived a very controlled and planned life. I made it through high school with straight A\u2019s in all AP classes and whatnot and have done this so far in college as well. This has not been easy for me as I am likely of average intelligence. In high school, I was in several highly technical extracurriculars that lasted at least four hours after school every day. In college, I make sure I work until I sleep. I have worked on the weekends since middle school. Needless to say I haven\u2019t done much besides work and study.\n\nWell, I just turned 21 and I have realized that there are many things that I haven\u2019t done. I have never had a girlfriend (or even close to one tbh), I never drank, never been to a party, etc... and I am now in this weird state where everything seems fake. Realistically, while the material you learn in school is important, most of it is just meant to occupy your time. Our political system was made up to distract people and give them the illusion of power that they don\u2019t have. God was created to act as the thought police from Orwell\u2019s 1984. The entire system is set up to benefit someone, and that someone is not you or me. A lot of the people I looked up to have done some pretty bad things. A lot of the people I was taught to hate have helped me a great deal. The rules are made up to restrict some people and keep them in their place, many of them people that I care about. I\u2019ve known these things since I was a small child, but a shred of doubt has kept me from accepting it as truth. Well, that shred of doubt is gone now, and I\u2019m not sure how to react. \n\nNow, in reacting to this, I have already done a few things that are morally questionable (nothing terrible), and I\u2019m not entirely sure what is wrong or right at the moment. It is sort of like a mid-life crisis, in that all of my achievements seem fake. Everything that I have built my life on was worthless, and many of the people I was forced to respect as authority figures are actually not very good. I am not sure of a healthy way to interpret this without taking a destructive course of action. I can\u2019t go back to believing in what I did because I know it\u2019s wrong, but in acting against it I will harm myself and others.\n\nStrangely, these conclusions have been SERIOUSLY bothering me. I can\u2019t think straight anymore and I can\u2019t sleep more than a few hours most nights. I can barely stay on the same train of thought anymore. Did anyone experience something like this in your later teenage years/early 20\u2019s, and if so how did you deal with it?",

I'm honestly looking for help because I feel quite helpless, and it's not quite about me.  \n\n\nI've met this wonderful friend online long ago, and we've been more than best friends. Lately, her thoughts/anxiety/perception of life or whatever u wanna call have been odd.   \n\n\nHere's a bit about her just to give u some insight, she is of Moroccan origin, moved to the UK at young age. Her parents got divorce at that time, and she really lacked affection/attention. Her mother was working 24.7 just to sustain the kids, and her father did not give a shit. Safe to say that she did not have the best of childhoods. She also witnessed her father passing away which was a big shock, and I feel like that memory still affects her from time to time. She was also raped at age of 15, had an abusive relationship at 18. Weed and Alcohol became slowly part of her life, I guess they were helping her survive all after all the misery and traumas she's been through. Fast forward a few years, she meets prince charming, and things go great, but it was a LDR, so you guys can guess where things end up going. They date for a year barely seeing each other monthly, and her bf was supposed to move to London for good, but that did not happen, and he pretty much gave up on her. That was I guess the last emotional hit that completely destroyed her. She led a hectic life afterwards, including the abuse of drugs/alcohol. Things stayed like that for more than 6 months, but with my constant help, and after her meeting up with some good friends, she kinda stabilized?   \n\n\nHere is where I'm completely lost. I thought that she started to get herself together and quit drugs (not weed tho). Right now, based on what she describes to me at times, she has really bad anxiety, and she will have really negative thoughts/suicidal thoughts, she would feel like she wants to give up on life. That's why what she does is always keep herself busy (was it music/weed/alcohol/reading etc ...), and that kinda refrains her from going down that hole.  \n\n\nShe sought medical help twice, and it never really helped at all. It just feels to me that she really gave up on life, doesn't seem like she really enjoys anything anymore. Sometimes for me it does make sense, going through all that went through will definitely leave an impact, but at some point life goes on and you can't stay in the past, regardless of how atrocious it was.   \n\n\nPep talk really doesn't do much for her, so most of our conversations are mainly just laughing about stuff lmao.   \n\n\nI apologize for the long post, sorry if I didn't make much sense, but yeah I just have no answer to what she is going through. I'm a very motivational and positive person overall, but I just can't get through her.  \n\n\nThanks for reading and I appreciate any sort of help/advice.",

And for the first time the gender gap in suicide  has narrowed: Though the numbers of suicides are greater in males, the [rates of suicide for female youths](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2733430?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=051719) increased by 12.7 percent each year, compared with 7.1 percent for male youths.\n\nAt  the same time, the rate of teen depression shot up 63 percent, an  alarming but not surprising trend given the link between suicide and  depression: In 2017, 13 percent of teens [reported at least one episode](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/12/a-growing-number-of-american-teenagers-particularly-girls-are-facing-depression/)  of depression in the past year, compared with 8 percent of teens in  2007, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\nHow  is it possible that so many of our young people are suffering from  depression and killing themselves when we know perfectly well how to  treat this illness? If thousands of teens were dying from a new  infectious disease or a heart ailment, there would be a public outcry  and a national call to action.\n\nWhile  young people are generally physically healthy, they are psychiatrically  vulnerable. Three-quarters of all the mental illness that we see in  adults has already occurred by age 25. Our collective failure to act in  the face of this epidemic is all the more puzzling since we are living  at a time when people are generally more accepting of mental illness and  stigma is on the wane.\n\nYou\u2019d think it  would be no big deal to see your family doctor or a therapist and get  your depression treated like any other medical problem. But the data  suggest otherwise: Only 45 percent of teenage girls who had an episode  of depression in 2019 received any treatment, and just 33 percent of  teenage boys with depression did. In contrast, two-thirds of adults with  a recent episode of depression received treatment.\n\nWhat explains the epidemic of teen depression and suicide? There are lots of theories but few definitive answers.\n\nSome  researchers emphasize the potential role of social media exposure and  use of smartphones. There is some evidence that girls, who have shown  greater rates of increase in depression than boys, experience more  cyberbullying because of their greater use of mobile phones and texting.  But most studies of digital technology and mental health are  correlational and can\u2019t prove causation.\n\nDrugs  and alcohol are always a popular culprit, but in this case they are an  unlikely explanation, as the studies cited above controlled for drug  use. In addition, there is no evidence of a significant increase in the  use of drugs or alcohol in young people during the study period.\n\nIt is legitimate (though controversial) [to ask](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1408480#article_comments)  whether the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d warning for  antidepressants back in 2004 \u2014 which said the drugs could cause suicidal  thoughts and actions in some children and teenagers \u2014 discouraged the  use of these drugs and unwittingly helped fuel the rise in teen  depression. Within two years of the F.D.A. advisory, antidepressant use  dropped by 31 percent in teens and 24 percent in young adults. Although  antidepressant use recovered somewhat after 2008, it has remained below  levels that would have been expected based on prescribing patterns  before the warnings appeared. \n\nThe  good news is that we don\u2019t have to wait for all the answers to know what  to do. We know that various psychotherapies and medication are highly  effective in treating depression. We just need to do a better job of  identifying, reaching out to and providing resources for at-risk youths.\n\nTo  start, we need a major public campaign to educate parents and teachers  to recognize depression in young people and to learn about the warning  signs of suicide \u2014 like a sudden change in behavior, talking or writing  about suicide, and giving away prized possessions. We should have  universal screening of teenagers at school, with parental consent, to  identify those who are suffering from depression and who are at risk of  suicide. And we have to provide adequate funding and resources to match  the mental health needs of our young people.\n\nEvery day, 16 young people die from suicide. What are we waiting for?\n\n*\\[If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to* [*SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources*](http://speakingofsuicide.com/resources) *for a list of additional resources.\\]*\n\n*The Times is committed to publishing* [*a diversity of letters*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html) *to the editor.

        "original": "My brother lives with me and my family, and has always been kind of a socially awkward oddball. His average day consists of going to work in the morning, sleeping the rest of the day when he gets home, and then staying up all night gaming or watching movies. I noticed a change in his behavior 4-5 years ago around the time his last girlfriend left him. He started mumbling things to himself, writing weird cryptic notes and taping them on the walls in his room, and started obsessing over conspiracy theories. My initial reaction was that he started using drugs. I knew several meth addicts growing up, and his behavior seemed similar. I asked him straight up \"are you using?\", and he denied it. I searched his room several times while he was away, and didn't find anything that would indicate drug use. I decided to just leave it at that for the time being.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, his odd behavior reached it's peak. He told me one morning that his co-workers are following him around, and spying on him. I ask why he would think that, and he said he noticed the same sequence of cars passing by the house every hour or so (exactly like in The Truman Show). I ask why he thinks his co-workers would do that, and he said he had made some people upset by \"calling them out on some things\". He had also drove his car to another location to prove he was being followed, and claimed he saw the same sequence of cars as he sat and waited. Then he confronted somebody sitting in their car in a parking lot across our street, before they got startled and drove off. I was careful not to call him crazy, or he's not really seeing these things, because I knew there would be no convincing him otherwise and I wanted to maintain his trust.\n\nThis behavior continued the past few nights; He would see the cars, drive somewhere else (like a 7-11 or convenience store), park, and observe the cars again. He even started to wave at the cars, to try and antagonize them. This reached a boiling point last night when he was walking down the street, and thought he was being approached by someone concealing a weapon. He calls the cops, tells them the whole story, the dispatcher thought he was full of shit but sends a couple cops to the house anyway. The cops show up already pissed off that he's wasting their time, and they frisk him, probably suspecting he's on drugs. They leave, and I find out all about this the next morning. I told him I don't think he should go out at night antagonizing these people anymore, and if he sees anyone outside our house looking suspicious to come wake me up instead of calling the cops. This put a band-aid on the situation, but I'm worried his mental state could get worse. My childhood friend's dad had schizophrenia, and he hung himself in their garage, so I've seen firsthand the damage it can do. I'm worried he could be both a danger to himself, and my family. My wife wants him out of our house, but I just can't put my brother on the street. What's the best thing to do for him in the situation?\n\nTL;DR: My brother started believing there are people out to get him, and I'm not sure how to convince him it's all in his head.",

Medications to help mental illness however ARE covered.\n\nlong paragraph describing my mental health concerns (dont have to read if u dont want to its just in case it makes a difference in terms of my question): My current problems mainly consist of irritability, constant mood swings, panic attacks (VERY often when I was younger (ages 7-13, few times a week) now only about once a month or less/when under a lot of stress), disassociation and manic/depressive episodes. I also tend to spend a lot of time in my own head (daydreaming, talking to myself and most of all just staring into space without actually thinking about anything (this tends to happen without me noticing until someone snaps me out of it)). these things tend to impact my day-to-day life and has become a huge reason a few friendships have turned sour. when i was younger i used to experience many agoraphobic symptoms such as panic attacks when forced to leave the house and faking illnesses to get out of school for long periods of time (this was enough for my step mother to say that i have a 'complex' (in her words) but they still didnt want to do anything because of religious views) but this has calmed down a lot since I started high school and doesn't affect me much any more.\n\nIt's been affecting my social and school life and I know I can't talk to my parents about it because of their views, but in ontario at 16 I can go to the doctor and receive prescriptions without parental consent (I got pretty sick a few months back and my parents refused to take me to the doctor, so i went to a walk-in clinic and got a prescription for antibiotics on my own, and I've since been taking care of medical needs on my own, which is only financially possible because of OHIP (thanks, canadian healthcare!))\n\nI'm just looking for genuine advice since I'm told all the time that I should 'get some help' but I'm not actually sure... uh... how... keep in mind i dont make a lot of money and use most of what I do make for grocery, things like shampoo and deodorant and etc., and saving up for driving school and similar, so I wouldnt be able to afford therapy.\n\nthose of you who have gotten diagnosis, how did you go about it? what kinds of questions do you ask? how do i make it not seem like im 'self-diagnosing'?

Sometimes she will send these emails out as soon as I leave for the day only for me to see them in the morning and make me upset in less than a whole minute of being there.\n\nMy parents have put a lot of pressure with me on this job because of the endless possibilities they can see me end up in when I feel I have no real future than just being front desk.\n\nI feel that if I didn\u2019t live where I am then I would have a more normal job like my friends who work at stores and restaurants. They have no problem with their jobs and some seem to enjoy it but my parents always tell me that they have loser jobs that will get them nowhere. Partly true if they plan on other things but still harsh I feel.\n\nThe only two good things I can think of is that my other coworkers see me as valuable and do compliment me about my hard work ethic and do make me feel like I\u2019m not a damn burden. And also that I have saved money while working there and not wasting it.\n\nI am in the probationary period as they call it and I have only until July of this year to fully complete it. I feel mixed about this. Part of me knows I can quit now but there\u2019s another part that wants me to see the end and make my decision then since I have had already survived a year and a half. I am more on the edge to leave if that happens and will probably start job searching a month or two in advance that isn\u2019t in this industry and something I\u2019m more into.\n\nWhen I was nearing the end of highschool, my first thoughts were to the join the military or a trade. But because of the program I was in didn\u2019t go through with either. I still wonder if I would have been happier if I had quit and pursued these two.\n\nTo anyone who has read this far, thank you.

        "original": "Yesterday I was in my room when I noticed my body started feeling slower, more rigid, and like gravity was too heavy and it took a lot more force than usual to move my limbs. I had had this exact thing probably 4 times in the past few months and it never lasted more than an hour (but was also always accompanied by violent shivering), so I just decided to wait it out. Hours passed and I still felt it, but I was also feeling very hot so I decided to go check my temp, 99.6. I started feeling really sick, nauseas, and I had this sensation going up my right arm and right calf. I I started feeling worse so I tested again it had risen to 100.5 Was laying on the floor and my brain was so uncomfrotable, with my eyes closed I saw a rainbow of changing colored bright lights, that phenomen lasted a whole 5 or so hours even after the event. The room was spinning, I thought to myself maybe I'm having a stroke and dying and I called 911 and they sent an ambulance. But I got up and felt better for a bit, went up to my room to turn candles off. Ambulance came and I sent them away saying I felt better and would go to a doctor tomorrow. Then it came again on the couch and I thought oh my god, I'm really dying. I was slurring my words on the phone to my dad and I couldn't think well. Ambulance came back, I got in. They checked my vitals, blood pressure was 143/??. For the past two weeks my blood pressure had been high like that, even though before that it tended to be too low. I'm only 21 and fit but I was laying there thinking for sure I'd had a stroke and what if I was going to die, and the ambulance worker tells me it was probably non-emergency panic attack or I had the flu, I didn't even feel any relief from that just anger because what I had gone through was so terrifying I knew something had to be wrong and I didn't want them to let me die because they think I'm being dramatic\n\n\nAll the problems I'd been having that were getting worse starting coming to my mind making me panic, how I couldn't recognize people, didn't know where my classes were even on the last day of the semester, not remembering entire conversations I've had with people, having to meet people 3+ times before remembering them or ever talking to them, forgetting common words, thinking multiple people are the same person or someone is a different person with glasses off etc. I have schizophrenia so I thought it was that. I took my phone and started googling stroke symptoms and brain clots and all this terrifying stuff and it was so similar I thought for sure that had to have been what happened. But by this point it was like I was disconnected from myself, I didn't even panic about this, I just layed there well I guess it's not so bad to die\n\nI got to the hospital and layed in the bed feeling vague discomfort and like my head was heavy, and the colors were still doing that rainbow shifting thing. I had all these impulses to move in my body, I'd randomly puff my checks, move my arm, kick my leg, twitch my mouth, etc. I layed there like that for two hours before the doctor came. At one point my temperature felt high so I pressed the nurse button and asked her to come. She responded over the remote told me they had already checked it on the ambulance and didn't need to again. He did that neurologic exam by having me push on his hand and stuff and said it was normal so he wouldn't perform an MRI or anything as it would be useless exposure to radiation and that I just had a virus or dehydration. My bloodwork was normal so he said they could send me home. By that point I felt like a fucking dramatic idiot, I thought I was dying from just a virus or dehydration? My mom seemed upset with me after that, she had come to the hospital thinking I was really dying and now she was complaining about an ambulance bill and having to miss work from being up so late. I started crying from guilt, I felt so so so unbearably guilty from knowing how scared she was, she thought I was dying too, she had come all the way to the hospital. I cried from then until they sent us home, I felt so guilty, I felt so stupid, I felt like I could never show my face at a hospital or doctor again because surely they wrote in the notes about what a dramatic idiot I am\n\nWe we to the 24 hour open store and I got stuck staring in the mirror at the bathroom. My eyes flashed green and pink and it felt like I was trading eyes with the mirror. My face became scary and distorted.  I stood there over half an hour with tears streaming down my face but unable to move or make sound. My vision started warping. I felt the stress triggering psychosis, as we left the whole grocery store turned bright glowing blue\n\nWhen I left I couldn't say anything but one word responses, I could only move slowly, and my face just stared blankly in the same direction. The car ride open I sat stiffly with my head crooked to the side and drool and snot dripping from my face. It felt like catatonia. I was still and blank the whole ride, I just existed in the rain and swirling shifting colors in my head\n\n\nI got home and threw myself like a zombie bean bag onto the floor in my room, then laid there staring at my hand and drooling with voices saying things and transfixed for I don't know how long. I went down the stairs eventually and had a panic attack in front of the fireplace watching shadows dart around and objects morph into beings while my mom laid on the couch. Then something changed, I felt more comfortable, even happy, warm. But my head was so different, it was like the bottom of my brain didn't exist, my thoughts were just a handful of small green \"legos\" floating high above a black void, everything on the bottom deleted. I was saying things that didn't make any sense, word salad, but like a child, I would look worried at my mom and ask things like \"Are you okay?\" and reply to questions she never asked or sometimes not reply when she said something to me. I felt like I was inside a horror movie, I would lean into the fireplace and it would gain more sides and I'd be on the highest one laying, with many little \"arms\" pulling the top slab into my head. I was holding my head with my hands and it felt like my hands  morphed into hands with only two fingers that grew really long. I was acting like a child for hours, I was being rude, and then I would be very friendly, and I sat in front of the fireplace drawing heavenly structures I was seeing with crayons and writing important things voices said. I couldn't spell basic words, it was a struggle to control my right arm for some reason so I was sloppily writing and everything misspelled.\n\nToday I'm okay but still having trouble responding to people normally, but my body feels completely fine so maybe it was just dehydration.

        "original": "So basically I am 1 year out of high school and I am struggling to decide with path to take with my life and I am having to deal with other factors that are causing me stress and extreme anxiety. Basically all through school I had planned to get a trade and start up like that, however as encouraged by one of my teachers I decided to try university studying marketing as it was an area that interested me. I ended up hating it and wanted out so I decided to try something else which was paramedicine. Now this is where the dilemma begins, most of my senior years of school I had struggled with mild depression and abit of anxiety mainly due to my unattractive looks and inability to get any interest from girls, so subconsciously I thought that studying paramedicine which would be something abit more interesting for me would dull the pain and give me something to focus on rather than not getting girls and feeling lonely. This worked only for a short while but eventually I realised that no matter what I studied I still wouldn\u2019t get any interest from girls just because I was studying something different. So now I am back on the trade path but now am feeling the lonely and isolated feelings again and I now have ambition to try studying nursing as I feel it would be more interesting and give me the human to human contact that I crave. I just need advice now, am I choosing this career path again but subconsciously I am lonely and feel that doing that would somehow cure it because I hate my current situation? Or am I just genuinely interested in it but I am letting my emotions question it? Should I purse nursing or stick to becoming an electrician? Note that I live in a small country town and feel like getting a trade would lead me to missing out on experiencing a new place and new people however I like the idea of being setup financially by getting a trade. \n\nThankyou.",

        "original": "\nSo, around April of this year I experienced what was assumed to be a psychotic break. Im 21 years old, was diagnosed ADHD, conduct and bipolar all before age 10. I've been diagnosed Bipolar 1 (rediagnosed in foster care at age 17)\nfor about 10 years, complex PTSD, persistent depression, parent-child relation issues and so on and so forth.\n My mother is Schizoaffective, both uncles are diagnosed as well and my sister is full Schizophrenic with \"do not record me\" signs on her doors, thinks ATT is spying on her and calls the police regarding the 'bugs' aka listening devices someone put in her house.\n\nDuring a night in April, I went into a 6 hour long episode that was a complete break from reality.\n(This actually continued until November.)\n I dont remember this, but at the same time know it happened- sort of as if through muscle memory and looking as a third person type view.\n\nIt was late one evening, I was coloring with my wife one of her favorite bonding activities and just zoned off. I thought I'd been staring at it too long, I saw like I was in a fish bowl, so I used eyedrops. No drugs or alcohol within 2 months and then it was just weed before.\nStarted to free draw and scribbling off the lines. I started making absurd and dark shapes which changed, and morphed and became one thing into another into another.\nExact lines as if they were intentional and concious, detailed and done in a way I can't actually draw, I was talking to them out of range from my wifes voice, answering her back in a dull and monotone voice and answers that didnt make sense-- answering her swift and chop to get back to my multiple conversations I was already having.\nTelling them to calm down, wait their turn, to come back and quiet down-among other things. I'd spend half an hour scouring through the lines trying to find where one went or was hiding. Mad they left, exasperated. \nOne request towards the end was an odd one that struck a bell with me. \nSpecifically they had, or wanted silver eyes. Even now I know that is something I heard a long time ago but cant place, the silver eyes.\n\nI just kept circling the black pen for hours, talking to them. I'm not sure how I \u201ccame back\u201d. After that, it got really bad and really fast.\n\nThe voices, I'd never had quite as noticable or distinguished before. I'd hide, afraid to leave the house or under blankets afraid someone was coming, never a certain fear just a doom feelings. Whatever was coming, whoever would bring the end. Aggression, memory loss, paranoia and personality changes. \nI thought the kids in the neighborhood were always staring, always judging me and \u201cfrowning\", they stood in a line-- the youngest to oldest.\n Every day I'd drive home and get angrier everytime I saw them until I was foaming at the mouth, cussing out my window.\n I dont think they ever actually looked at me.\nI sped, pulled dangerous maneuvers and ran lights at intersections. I've never done this. I stopped driving and still dont because of the fear I'd react like this.\n\nAs time progressed, I saw the figures I drew standing outside in the street in a small crowd every night. I was convinced I was safe if I didnt listen for them, try to hear or catch what they said and safe if I didnt go outside at night. They couldnt reach me on the second story, so at night I wouldn't go downstairs either. The lights would always have to be on.\n\nThey never left, they followed me and waited for me at three different homes I lived in--over about six months. The last house it took them a while to show up. They were taller then.\n\nEventually, they talked. Whispers from the windows on the first floor telling me to come outside, then the voices of friends acting like they were real and needing my help with something outside.\n\nOne night, I went out. I saw all of them in the back yard, the figures tell and black. Like a black animated sketch with just lines and eyes. One specifically stood out, from the drawing, he felt powerful and reminded me of the undertaker. Fur Cape, feather shoulder pads, long black hair. He had a figure, defined with different tones not just black. His eyes were silver and he started coming towards me, ran inside and upstairs and jumped in bed, covering my ears with my knees on my chest. \n5-6 voices at once, more than ever, overlapping and female. \nThey were on the roof, the closed windows were wide open to me, louder and louder as they were up the stairs, one behind the dresser. 6 on each window ledge, climbing in. They were never able to come inside, never able to come upstairs before, I never had to scream shut up before this. They surrounded me, my eyes closed but I could feel them towering and closing in.\n\nI dont remember much, hazy after. I went outside and stood there, my one roomate had security cameras where I was able to watch it over later. I waved at something off in the dark, automated steps and wide blank eyes. I came inside and starred into nothing for 3 hours before being brought to bed by my bestfriend who'd seen me like this just once before over four years. Gave me some of my medicine which I hadnt been taking.\n\nSince then, nothing has happened. My memory is better, no mood swings or voices or hallucinations.\n I feel like it's starting to resurface, 2-3 months later I can feel it oddly and faintly starting to click again, everything make sense and feel real again.\nLess like a foggy dream and more like a memory.",

Im currently laying next to my sleeping gf and I feel like I cant even talk to her at all (when shes awake just in case yall thought I was stupider than I am) about how I feel because she'll think less of me, no matter how open minded she claims to be she'll think of me as lesser for showing vulnerability anymore than I do, and for all I know that lack of patience is justified. I hate this feeling of \"oh shit I need to get all of these things done!\" (writing resumes, finding better jobs, finding that last class for spring that will let me get financial aid and fulfill major reqs, stop staying over at my gf's so much and confront my home with my dad, get enough money to pay for my own phone, etc) when Im supposed to be asleep.\nThen in my head theres someone telling me how Im complaining over nothing and Im just overreacting because im a pussy or that Im lucky i get to worry about half of those things. Then i feel upset because I feel that for all the things my parents did, they never prepared me to be my own person or do what I want to do, and now I dont even have a feeling of want to do anything.\nThese feelings anger me because I wanted to be an NYPD cadet, and them having a problem with me seeing a therapist in the past year makes me feel so useless. I figure maybe I can apply to be in the national guard as theyre always recruiting at my campus I just want to stop being a useless, talentless, low on the food chain, piece of shit.

Sure whatever I dont know the rest of the stories and theres undoubtedly something going on to make me more wrong and be reason for me to be more appreciative of my life, but I need to remind myself that I need to make my life better and nobody I know now wants to/ is going to help me do that, not my bickering parents or my siblings who are already figuring their lives out, not my gf since I might as well be dead to her when I enlist, and not my therapy group since Im not going to be able to have that. Nobody else got me those perfect grades busting their asses like I did, even if theyre just useless fucking numbers I know I can do the same on my bio and organic chem classes, because being a fuckup is not an option, and Once I get my degree, then what?

She had lost her appetite, ate 80% less than usual and would usually throw up the food. \n\nA week later it became worse, she started to develop panic, she would get scared and scream by insignificant things like for example turning the lights on without notifying her or something that accidentally fell and hit the floor making a noise, she was aware she shouldn't get scared by those things but she said she couldn't control it and that she wasn't crazy. \n\nDays later she woke up happy, and was VERY talkative (5x more than when she was fine) was very positive and could finally eat by herself in bed without making a mess. After this day she was never the same... Next day she denied all food and all liquid, she wouldn't open her mouth and kept spitting everything, then started to act differently, she was not the same person, wouldn't talk, would scream for whatever reason and call her mom for help (her mom is an elderly handicapped woman) when we were trying to feed her or give her the prescribed medication. \n\nFast forward to today, she's with sedans, it's been over three weeks since she ate so we decided to get her a nasogastric feeding tube but she took it off. Last time she wasn't on sedants she had an arrhythmia due to her extreme panic, now she doesn't speak at all, she seems to understand when people talk to her and laugh at some jokes but won't reply. It's just like if she wasn't there anymore, sometimes she gets aggressive and bite people who try to open her mouth to give her the medication. When she is barely conscious she would ask for food to then deny to eat. \n\nShe's being treated by two psychiatrist, a doctor, a cardiologist and a nurse. \nThe psychiatrists say she isn't cooperating and that she is the only one that could stop this. \n\nIt's unbelievable how she was completely fine 2 months ago being a regular 65 yo adult and now she gave up and is on the edge of death. \n\nMy question is, is it still possible for her to recover?

laugh (Highschool) I'd get suspended Interschool suspension all that and as long as I made someone laugh I'd not care even when I got into fights I'd mock the other person and make jokes about them to make my friends laugh when they were watching I didn't care what happened to me I failed all my classes every year (I past 2 classes from Year 7-9) I wasn't held by for god knows why I've never really got scared I used to get home sick when I was around 10 but that faded as I got older I can count the times Ive gotten mad on one hand in my life I never actually expressed or experienced my own emotions I didnt care for my own personal growth only time I looked in the mirror was when I brushed my teeth which was rare or showered I'd not tell anyone if I was hurt or go to the doctors I ripped my nose open and arms/knees in 2011 and stuck into my house avoiding my parents untill one came in and asked if I was hungry and they rushed me to the hospital which I didnt want to go and said I was fine I later found out I required several stitches and had a infection due to somthing I cant remember. so I cared not for my health/emotions up untill 2012 which is when something happened that I can't remember to this day which changed me I lost all my social skills I couldn't talk to anyone I stopped riding bikes/hanging with friends being the class clown I could only talk to someone if I knew them years I could talk if someone spoke to me completely fine i wasn't nervous or anything i cant really explain what it was like but I couldnt start the conversation  the school sent me to a school therapist who said I was \"borderline\" to this day I still don't know what that means but I was kicked out of my new school due to my attendance (2014) after that everyone I grew up with and everyone I had met seemed to have abandoned me and to this day I haven't heard from 99.9% of them theyd ask my brother where I was and all that fake shit but never asked for my number or for me to meet up for about 1 year I went through alot of emotions that I feel like I had bottled up for my entire life but I feel like it changed me in a good and (bad) way I went back to doing MMA n going to the gym to the point it was all i did the next year 2015 I went back to another school and I sort of changed again to another person it was like letting out all of my emotions made me \"better\" for myself but I now have this sense of superior I don't care for anyones opinion even if it would benefit me people I cared for my entire life untill the end of 2014 died and the feeling I had for the situation was like the feeling you have before your born there is and was nothing everyone around me was crying at the funerals and telling me how im holding it together but in my head I was wondering when I could leave not caring even to this day I have that feeling about everyone but myself I do not believe I've ever loved anyone nor If Ive ever said it to anyone including my parents but skip a few years and this has only now been amplified  to the point where people have noticed and think I'm a \"socipath\" which I don't believe I am I dont care for others nor seem to have any empathy I manipulate everyone, I lie but I lie in a way that i tell the truth but use word play to trick them so its if i'm caught I can play it off as they just didn't understand what I was saying I know I'm superior I think people who require confidence are weak same as nervous nus I'm told I'm the most relaxed person they have ever met I do not experience social anxiety, anxiety, depression I somewhat understand depression but when it comes down to it I'll tell people there weak for it even know in my head I know its not about that I can understand when I do things that are wrong but I don't have an emotional response to the understanding of the wrong I don't apologie to people if I hurt them unless I'm sorry which i'm not sorry for the things I do because I believe I'd not be true to myself for such due to the fact that I did it so is stand by what I did even knowing it could help the situation but I do believe I could care about someone which is one of the reasons I don't think I'm a sociopath + they say they dont have emotions my natural state is happy I do get annoyed but only at myself if I lose or something not really at anything else I've never been in a serious relationship and I dont care for casual sex I smile when girls approach me instantly knowing who is worth my time and not I'm also never really bored I also seem to like going into town to walk around for no other reason but just for people to see me but that might be the fact that I peaked when I grew facial hair I have no worries or anything never stressed I believe stressed people are sort of just mentally weak I heard sociopaths fake emotions but due to the way I see my self I don't care to I have no filter and I dont care who hears what I say i've been fired several times due to it and simply had no emotional response just applied at others and went on with my day the only desires I have is for others to see me not caring if I never see them again just aslong as they have seen me and I know they've thought about me I believe I'm beyond confidence to the point that I talk very loudly everywhere and even bait people into fighting me knowing I can beat them due to my years of MMA experience (I'm beyond cocky af If you cant tell) I've had several people tell me that I walk and act like I own the place I'm also a perfectionist for my own looks/dressing I never pay for anything I either steal it or convince others to buy me stuff I've lived off others for years now with barely spending my own money and on my childhood it wasn't bad I think mine was really good only \"negative\" side I could think of is my parents fighting every day and I dont believe they like each other and there only together to not deal with the hassle of devorce I've never seen them care for each other nor do i believe they cared for me seeing I have 0 memorys of them actually doing/being apart of anything impactful to my life but they have/are with my brothers my brothers are the opposite of me they care deeply for everything but they were also raised in a different state and both 10 years older then me the photos of them back then makes them seem happily married and there are photos of my brothers around there housr but no one seems to have photos of me which never bothered me but might have influenced me deep down Wwhen I was a kid without me knowing also I've never really been afraid of anything as a kid when people tried to scare me I wouldnt react like it was relevant to me but now I'm still not really afraid of anything to my knowledge apart from the feeling of not being incontrol I dont drink/do drug anymore due to it not letting me being incontrol 100% which is what I'd say to my knowledge being the only thing I'm 'afraid' of I don't know if I'm afraid of it but I believe I am due to never not being in control since I changed if that makes sense I was raised in a ghetto place In australia but I lived in the not so ghetto part I hang out in the ghetto suburbs and basically lived with people in \"gangs\"  dealing drugs and all that from a very young age up untill 2014 my brothers didn't do that which may explain my numbness to violence due to being in \"my first\" gang fight when I was 12 I wasn't standing fighting people but I was hitting people with poles and shit while they fought I was involved with bikies and all that from young age aswell seen people get stabbed/ cut off things with machettes guns pulled/held on people even on myself when I was 14 I've never thought about suicide or cutting myself I think people who kill themselves are weak and pathetic I love every aspect of life the good and 'bad' I say 'bad' as in I dont have anything bad in my life for years now So to end this rambling If anyone has any advice on what mental \"disorder\" I have or could possibly or if I should seek \"professional\" help let me know I'm not sure if any of that made sense or was clear but I find it difficult to explain emotions or even identify them thanks.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I was also hit in the face with a brick when I was a child and split my forehead open had to get stitches could that have caused any impact on my emotions\n\n\n(TLDR 1st one btw) \"I lost emotions from somthing that I have no memory of and ever since then I lost all my friends/family and gained then relost emotions that made me into a \"bad\" person but I understand whats good n bad but aslong as it doesn't negatively affect me  I don't care. I don't experience sadness anger nervous ness anxiety depression My neutral state is happiness em I fucked in the head?\"",

Luckily in the last few days I have been off work with flu so have been able to be on the phone to her for most of the day. However, anytime I try to suggest advice or support services such as advice helplines, support groups in her area and even offer to pay for private therapy she simply tells me that it is not worth the time/effort/money as she doesn't want any of those things to force \"fake happiness\" but simply not be here so her pain can end. \n\nShe has had a history of depression for the most part of the \\~5 years (caused in part by family deaths and the suicide of her ex-boyfriend, which was very hard to deal with for her) that I have known her but it has not been this bad until the last couple of weeks following Christmas/new years. In the past she has received counselling and benefited from it but since moving back to her mums house recently she has gotten worse and is basically refusing all help and explicitly telling me it won't be long left until she is gone because she can't deal with the pain of \"being forced to live this life.\" \n\nI spend every second of every day in a constant state of worry that she is going to do it and I really am pleading with anyone out there if you have any advice on how to help someone suicidal who is unwilling and unreceptive to any help.

I haven't really talked to any of my friends or family. I worry they're mad a me for doing this, but the thought of reaching out to tell them, \"hey, sorry I'm distant, I just feel overwhelmed by talking to anyone right now. I'll definitely try to reach out once this mood has faded.\" scares me. I know they say they understand. But I can't help but think they're secretly upset I don't talk to them. \n\nI mean I only have two friends I actually talk to and both live in different states than me. I talk to my siblings and parents often (but not in the last few weeks). My mom and in laws think I should get back on Facebook to make it easier to keep up with me, but I hate the platform. It causes a lot of triggers and I just don't like to go on it. \n\nI used to have more friends. I'm just not the type of person who enjoys texting or communication over the phone/internet. I like to have conversations in person and spend time with someone. This is hard because I move a lot due to my husband's job. I've made friends over the years, that I now don't talk to because I feel more comfortable having an in person, irl, relationship. I tend to disassociate when I only have communication over the phone or internet. Like they really aren't real. \n\nProblem with all this is, I have trouble making friends irl.

So it's hard to explain to a new potential friend that I'm not ignoring them, I'm just needing quiet time because I get overwhelmed easily. \n\nThere are days I will sit in silence and not do anything because it helps me not feel so overstimulated. I'm technically doing it now! I've been sitting in my room quietly for an hour, and I really am not ready for anyone to be home. My stepchild gets out of school in a few hours and my husband will be home from work around the same time. It makes me a bit anxious because I'd rather just be alone for awhile. And this makes it hard to make friends. Most people I've met want to talk to you often, meet up weekly, or text daily. I don't really care for that and it causes me not to be able to keep friends. \n\nI just don't know what to do.. I don't even know why I'm writing this...",

Id also like to excuse my grammatical mistakes in advance as English is not my first language.\n\nBut there is one thing that is making me question my sanity and how healthy I truly am. And that is the fascination with fires Ive had for my whole life but only started noticing lately. Let me tell you everything from the beginning. \n\nAs a kid I always enjoyed when I got to put things on fire and that was fairy common as me and my family used to live on a farm where my granddad would burn things all the time, and out of 4 kids (there were for of us) Id always be the one volunteering to take care of the fire, and Id stand there and look at the fire, oh yes Id stand and not only look at it but even try to play with it (trying to put my shoe in and get it out super fast so it wouldn't catch on fire and games like those). It would be kinda ok if it were only those kind of games but it got to a point where id burn a stick and run after my other 3 cousins. Id also catch bugs and put them in a pan and fry them above the fire... I know it all sounds terrible. \n\nIn recent years it has only been getting worse, while I stopped burning bugs and trying to burn my cousins there is another type of behaviour Ive been noticing. I would (and still do) buy a lighter and sit behind my desk and watch a movie, and I am a very energetic person I can never just sit and do nothing, I always have to be doing something. So the thing i'd do and still do is burn those little stick notes and then just stare at the fire. And the thing is that when im looking at the fire it makes me enter a trans like state where I just stare at it thinking nothing and I could do that for hours and hours. Its getting dangerous to the point where I once almost burned my apartment. I threw a still burning piece of sticky note in my trash can full of paper and it semi caught on fire. And I cant seem to be able to just stop doing it. \n\nNow Im coming to reddit as I dont want to assume anything and just seek professional help which is expensive and would also make everyone in my family know im going somewhere for my mental health (and that just doesnt put the best light on me does it). Also as far as im aware there is no cure for pyromania, so it doesnt make sense to start visiting the doctor to me.\n\nIm sorry if my English is a bit off and terrible to read and understand, and Id like to thank you for your time and advice!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsincerely PilotSB",

I\u2019ve gotten black out angry before, on multiple occasions, only now my body is actually significantly trained, I\u2019m terrified of doing something I can\u2019t take back, and the worst thing is, I hate fighting people, I mean for god\u2019s sake, I\u2019m an INFJ personality type, all I want to do is help people, I will help anybody I physically can even if it means forsaking my literal future, but I could also go lurking in a city for a few hours and come back with blood stains without realizing I even did it, \n\n\nI feel like I\u2019m living in an actual hell, completely devoid of humanity, I don\u2019t dream, I barely feel anything, I can hardly stomach any food anymore without almost throwing up or my body rejecting it in some way, and I\u2019m 45 pounds underweight now, I feel like I\u2019m being forced to watch myself fall because of impulse decisions or complex consequences of innocent actions, I have a girlfriend, and for all intensive purposes, she is the single last thing keeping my brain off of the walls, she is my single lifeline that is holding me down and I love her dearly, I would die and kill for her, but I feel like I\u2019ve made a mistake I dating her, we\u2019ve been together for 5 moths but we\u2019ve know each other for 6 years, and we\u2019ve even dated previously before, I\u2019ve seriously thought she\u2019s the one sometimes but also she\u2019s my biggest mistake, and god how horrible it feels to say that, but she\u2019s hurting me and I can see it, she has her own set of mental issues, and in my opinion, to her dislike, I consider hers more important that mine, I won\u2019t reveal anything too personal about her but she\u2019s in a very severe condition, explosive anger to where she reds out (her vision gets covered in a red tint) and she destroys everything in sight with brute force, it terrifies me, I\u2019ve never seen such sheer rage in someone before, and I\u2019m trying to take all of her problems onto me, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve done with everyone I\u2019ve ever met, and it\u2019s destroying me, she\u2019s making me lose all my friends and I can\u2019t talk to any of the girls I used to know because there all \u201cstupid whores\u201d some of them are like, or at least we\u2019re, like sisters to me, people I grew up with from really early grades, basically my only actual family, and I lost them, even my real family, I got kicked out, addicted to weed and tobacco, I\u2019ve even looked at getting really hard stuff like DMT or MDMA, just so something feels real, I contemplate about suicide and mass murder or massacring my family and friends, I catch myself staring out into space and staring at blades or broken pieces of glass, I\u2019m living with my girlfriend right now and it\u2019s a horrible house, one bedroom, one bathroom, one living room, one kitchen, that\u2019s it, bachelor pad essentially, it\u2019s over run with cockroaches, 7 people sleep here, 4 cats and 2 dogs, sheer chaos, I\u2019m disconnecting from reality and I can see it happening, my head feels like it\u2019s splitting in half from the inside and sometimes it feels like it being pushed together, sometimes I want to claw my cheeks or claw at my eyes, other times I scratch my head until I bleed, I burn myself, beat myself, I don\u2019t cut myself because it to noticeable, it\u2019s easier to hide bruises and burns, I\u2019ve thought about what way I would kill myself, I think I\u2019ve settled on drug over dose, something trippy like a psychedelic, I\u2019ve tried to kill myself 6 times before I turned 12 I gave up after that because I didn\u2019t see a point, I wasn\u2019t a solution, sure I wouldn\u2019t feel pain anymore, but I\u2019d be dead, so, kind of for nothing in the end, plus I\u2019m afraid that heaven is real and suicide is a sin, on that note I feel like I\u2019m going to hell on a first class ticket because I feel evil and disgusting, even though I haven\u2019t done anything that could describe me that way, I\u2019m starting to here voices and I catch my fingers moving on their own, like they\u2019re trying to do something, the voices aren\u2019t quiet either, screaming at me to hurt or be hurt, to kill or be killed, that everyone around me wants me dead and that I\u2019m nothing but dead weight, and they\u2019re all my voices, screaming at me, and I can hear where they come from in my head, like my conscious and the voice I\u2019m using to wright this right now is coming from the very back on my skull and the bottom, it feels like it comes from where skull connects to spine, but the other voices come from different places, like the front left of my forehead or right above me ear, one screaming in rage, another sobbing nonsensically, radical muttering for hours about how we\u2019re being watched by something, very specifically something, not someone, it seems like they converse with each other, like they want something as a collective group, i once heard a voice that told me to somehow come into possession of a super weapon like a nuke, and systematically set off the end of the world, because he hates humans, there\u2019s a voice in me somewhere that hates humans so much that it not only wants them to end, but wants to be the reason they end, I\u2019m not looking for help, I don\u2019t know if I can be helped, I needed to say that, all of it for the first time ever, it feels kind of relieving almost, but I\u2019ve accepted that my life is doomed and I\u2019ve rectified that my illnesses are here to stay, and before anyone suggests, under no circumstance would I leave my girlfriend even if it were to help me, as it\u2019s not exactly her fault she\u2019s like this and I know how much it would destroy her, with the state she\u2019s in now I can 100% guarantee it would end in suicide, and that would lead me to do the same, thank you for listening reddit, this might be my last time using social media, I guess in case these are my last words; To my girlfriend, I love you, more than anything, please don\u2019t let this destroy you, in no way is it your fault that this is happening, to my sisters, I love you both so much and I hope you can grow to be better than me, to my mom, I\u2019m sorry, to my dad, I wish we could\u2019ve done better, to anyone I\u2019ve ever harmed, or done anything negative in anyway to affect you, I apologize, it\u2019s entirely my fault, all of it, to anyone reading this who\u2019s struggling with depression and anxiety, please for the love of god never ever, ever, forsake your emotions because you think it will help, it\u2019s not better, it\u2019s worse, far, far worse, at that point you lose and literally definitive point of being human, and you become aware of that,

Fashion is my ultimate vice and the only thing I look forward to in my life, hoping I can make a career out of it one day. But it is literally taking over my life.

I know that I'm a junior in high school and that such problems should really be the least of my concerns since I'm still a kid but I'm really worried that one day it'll come to a point where either my family, or when I grow up, there'll be no way to buy something that is the \\*only\\* reason I'm here. My whole mental stability depends on these pills due to the numerous mental illnesses I have (ADHD, OCD, social anxiety, and depression) and traumatic experiences in my childhood that probably would've never been able to deal with if I never had any medication for it. I know the pill thing kinda sounds like an addiction but I do genuinely believe that I would never be here had medication never entered my life (and therapy too, albeit I don't do it anymore because it's too expensive for my family so I use resources at my school as much as possible).\n\nThe biggest fear to me, though, is the thought that I'll end up as my unmediated self, but homeless. It's already scary enough about how people treat the homeless (especially those who are mentally ill too) by videotaping them, harassing, etc. Like of course it's not okay for someone to- lets say- shave themselves on a subway train but I feel the real thing people should be angry at is the system which didn't even take care of them in the first place. It's scary how a person can be viewed as nothing unless they have money on them. I hate it so much. I never chose to be this way, I would love to be neurotypical in a heartbeat. I want to be normal so bad but such a thing for me relies on a substance and it's scary how easily it can be taken away from me.",

I thought we had a pretty good day but we had a massive fight on the car ride back and separated angry. She started calling and texting me incessantly so I turned my phone off. I finally got a message on Instagram when I was watching tv on my laptop, that she had taken a lethal amount of pills. \n\nI called the cops, took a car to her house and showed the officers the message. They took her in an ambulance to the hospital, where she stayed for the next two days. I felt really compassionate for her and went to visit her as soon as I was allowed to. She ended up being released that day so I brought her home, made her dinner, and slept over to keep an eye on her.\n\nThe next day I went home and haven\u2019t seen her since, but she is making my life a living hell. It started out as constant texting and calling again; I tried to respond whenever she got in touch because I was worried, but i was getting absolutely nothing done. I told her I needed space and she got upset. Many angry escalating text exchanges later, we talked over video chat and decided not to text anymore, as it always seems to go wrong. About ten minutes after hanging up, she started texting me again. I told her that if she didn\u2019t stop I would block her. She didn\u2019t, so I did it.\n\nShe has continued to find new ways to contact me, including email and texting from another number. I just got a message from her while I was at work, saying that she dropped her cat off outside my house, she couldn\u2019t take care of him and \u201cthanks for my help\u201d. I can\u2019t even bring the cat inside because of my roommate\u2019s pitbull, who she is well aware of. \n\nI am fucking furious and a little scared. I suspect she\u2019s trying to force contact even though I clearly told her I do not want to talk to her. She claims she has been diagnosed as bipolar but this behavior suggests borderline personality disorder to me (I\u2019m a new psychotherapist and have never seen anything like this, but matched her behavior to this diagnosis in the DSM). \n\nI called the therapy center she goes to and left a message for her therapist. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019ll be able to do because of HIPPA (confidentiality laws) but I want this shit to stop NOW. Is there anything else I can do?

All I know it's when it started when I had a period of of constant stress due to the loss of a family member and that caused issues within my then relationship with my partner. Because my life before that precise turning point was starting to get better and been leaving the happiest after previous years suffering depression, then tragedy strikes an do lose a family member. I got angry with myself for feeling distant from friends and partner, so I force myself to love someone I didn't out of pure anger. That cause so much stress and anxiety that after a year-ish I started developing said symptoms including constant extreme anxiety, feeling like everything is unreal/fake, loss of appetite, concentration, lack of Motivation, lack of empathy, lack guilt, emotion overall weather positive or negative. Before you say anything no this is not depression, I've had depression previously and more than a few time throughout my life... This however is completely different. The best way to describe this is imagine your entire self within a cave with a small dirty and blurry window and the cave is your body. You feel like life just passes by and you watch events like a boring movie, like a ghost no mission in life no motivation just lost in a limbo of anxiety, doubt and sometimes sadness but rarely. I don't feel down and in tears I just feel empty no emotion at all for so long and there have been moments of realization and it feels like me again although only lasted for a day and the second time for 3 days. Put of the cave it felt. Also you can't concentrate, you feel like a zombie just walking eating and sleeping. It's hard to remember things no matter how small of a priority it is. I'll go more into detail but first I want to see, if there is anyone that have come through with this and got out of free and happy from something similar. If there is anyone please reach out to me and help me. Tell me how can I get rid of this forever it's been haunting me for a long time.

I've struggled with these feelings, but this is the first time I've come to grips and have tried to combat them and reintegrate myself into society as a more fun, social and comfortable person.

I am, at this point, basically a leech off my parents. \n\nI know I should be working more, but I can't find the motivation. When I was speaking with my intake rep earlier today, she suggested it was because I was doing a lot of the same things whenever I work, which isn't far off. And I don't feel like leaving where I work now, because I've been working there for a few years; I know what to expect from them. It is familiar.\n\nYet it seems, as the saying goes, that familiarity breeds contempt. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on what to do in this situation?",

        "original": "So, I'll start with my story I posted on r/concussions. \n\nAbout 4 years ago now I slipped and hit my head on concrete and seems like every since then my anxiety and depression have gotten worse ( along with the start of extremely vivid and multiple dreams each night and I can remember every dream I have) \n\nBut also around that time my parents got divorced and it wasn't the prettiest divorce, dad left one night with suit cases telling me that he loves me and he probably wont be able to talk to me for a while. \n\nAnd here is some mental illness backstory. \n\nMy grandpa has bipolar- diagnosed. My mom had frontal lobe psychomotor epilepsy as a child and I'm pretty sure she has some form of bipolar based on her actions and drug abuse. \n\nAlso, I have the same symptoms as my mom had as a kid with her epilepsy where things will begin to look really far away and when i was a kid it only happened when i was sick or really tired, and stopped for a while but after hitting my head it came back starting when I got sick or tired and now it happens at least 15 times a month but only at night after a stressful event. Things begin to look really far away and also if it gets really bad my thoughts will start to sound really loud like I'm screaming them and if I'm typing on my phone it feels like I'm slamming my fingers down really hard. \n\nAlso I have had moments in the past where I had really bad waking arousal which is where you wake up extremely confused and for me I get really confused and I keep thinking that the world is ending then next second it's okay then back to ending its hard to explain. But these dont happen often. \n\nOn top of all that like I said before I have bad anxiety and depression. Especially if I have made plans with someone (especially if the plans were made far in advance) and then they cancel or try to change the plans I go from being really anxious and upset and trying to get them to reconsider to just upset and mad at myself for making the plans and trusting people to follow through to just generally depressed that I have to go alone or not at all. \n\nLike I said, I'm lost. I've been trying to figure out why I have anxiety and depression and why I have these episodes of wierd perception. I've gone to a psychologist and he helped me a little but not really because all my symptoms dont really impede me from functioning day to day like I hold a job I feed myself I bathe. But I'm just constantly worrying about what could be causing all this? Is it all connected ? Or is my anxiety and depression separate from my perception issues? Was all brought about by the fall ? Or was it just worsened by the fall? Do I have a brain tumor ? Am I going to developed bipolar or schizophrenia? \n\nIm so lost and I've tried to do so much research trying to figure something out. My insurance won't cover a brain scan of any kind. \n\nIf any of you know anything that could help or have any advice please tell me. \n\n\nSorry that this whole post was so jumbled, portion of it was typed out while having one of those perception episodes/seizure I had a stressful day today and I'm tired too so it was one of the worse episodes.",

It's probably fur to the anxiety that I've felt as I'm kind of a loner in my class, so of course coming back to school was not the best thing for me. I started feeling very alien to others, and I don't know exactly why or when, but I started to believe that I'm experiencing the onset of schizophrenia. Of course, I researched schizophrenia a lot.\n\nThen it just passed around the end of october, and I diagnosed myself with asperger's syndrome. Same thing happened, I was researching it a lot, I was convinced that I have it.\n\nThen I had a winter break from school and during that I came to the conclusion that I'm a psychopath, which was the scariest. I was telling myself stuff like remember when you fell in love with that girl? Then I told myself that I'm just very good at pretending that I have feelings.\n\nDuring these months I've had moments when I was afraid that I may be a pedophile as well.\n\nAnd two days ago, when winter break ended, I started believing that I have ocd. There's some sort of \"paradox\" in my mind. So there's the thought that I have ocd. Then ask myself why do I have ocd? Because I think that I have ocd. Why do I think that? Because I think about havind ocd. So I should tell someone. But I actually don't have ocd, I'm just overthinking. Then the cycle starts again. Am I overthinking this? And if I'm overthinking, is it because I have ocd?\n\nWhat frustrates me is that I don't really have compulsions, just this self-diagnosing thought loop bullshit.\n\nAlso, when I was 14-15 years old old, I was convincing myself that I was gay, when I'm actually not (like I was watching a lots of gay porn, joining online gay communities). Around that time, I was also afraid that I have cancer for a very long time.\n\nWell, the only compulsion I have is that I'm researching ocd (and the other mental illnesses that I've mentioned) a lot. And it's going to sound kinf of bizarre, but when I'm sitting on the toilet, for like 30 minutes I'm sticking up paper towels up my ass... (like lots of it)\n\nAnyways, I decided that I'm gonna tell my mom (who's a psychologist). I just needed to write this down somewhere and get others opinion.",

        "original": "So... this might be a bit of a scatter session. But here are some basic facts.\n\nI am 11+ year member of the USAF. Aircraft Maintenance (Fighter Avionics)  \nNever been fully deployed, (activated, selected, then stood down twice)  \nCurrently A Reservist finishing out the last 3/4 of a year on my second contract. Have done 6 years on active. I will not be reenlisting.  \nHave been stationed in Alaska, South Korea, and England\n\nSo in general, my career field is pretty demanding. People trust you with their lives to ensure they can accomplish their mission with the assets of the aircraft, defend themselves, and return home. There are some thing you can slack off on while at home station, but when you are generating for a deployment or a Real world tasker (think Lybia) we run everything through the wringer. This is vital and a timed metric.\n\nNot to mention, even on local sorties, we are chasing metrics. The busiest squadron I worked for had 28 aircraft that are combat coded, and some shops would have like 60% manning of what they actually needed. This drives long days for the worker bees (3&5 levels), and even longer for the front line supervisors (7 levels) who not only have to man the aircraft repairs, but also do other duties like programs and performance reports for their troops. \n\nIts a high octane, long day, where you have to keep your head on a swivel, cause even on the ground planes can seriously injury, or kill a person if they are not in the right place at the right time. You are basically on an adrenaline high as the plane is running.   \nThe flight line is run on JP-8, adrenaline, caffeine, nicotine, and hate. hah. But I love it.\n\nBut here comes the not so fun stuff.  \nIt puts an intense amount of stress on the workers. When 12hr days become the normal. Weekend duty comes in every weekend. Beef up crews for said weekend duty. It wears down the moral of the unit. And it starts to affect the mental states of people. The Officer core sees it. Some of them try to fix it. I had a commander who made the maximum amount of time you could be on shift to 10 hours. The fleet became healthier, and the morale came back. Literally the month after he left, we went back to 12s and it was awful again.\n\nMy colleges around me were being diagnosed with clinical depression. Most of us are away from home, halfway around the world. Morale is low, drinking ensues. People get DUIs or ARIs. Group punishment, ect., ect. I am pretty sure I was an alcoholic while I was at my last duty station. But not the kind that would drink every night. I was the binge drinker sort. I would walk down to the pub or ride my bike, starting at like 10-11am and closing down the pub at like 2 am Sunday morning. Somehow stumble the two miles to my empty house and then pass out. I was incredibly lonely there.\n\nFast forward to my separation from active duty. Basically what happened, was denied extension, re-enlistment due to the Air Force \"Hunger Games\" brought on from the Sequestration. I wasn't the greatest troop, but I didn't get in any serious trouble, Pt was my main issue. And still is.  \nBut anyway, my flight chief went to bat for me with the senior. Senior wouldn't have it. Wouldn't even route it to the chief. I was devastated. I had just gotten back from a TDY from Utah and Nevada that was 6 weeks long. I had 28 days so out-process, move out of my house, ship my crap, and do taps. I still talk to that flight chief. Even though he has retired. I understand it was completely out of his hands. It just sucked. Basically during these 28 days, I made a generic resume. it wasn't special.\n\nArrived home back in Alaska. Unemployed. Living with my parents. Basically the lowest time of my life so far. In the first 18 months of being back home, I was unemployed for half of it. Finally got picked up by the local telecom that I have friends that still work at. Use them as reffs. Boom job. This is while I'm awaiting training for my reserves job. Two years of waiting for a slot for training. So I basically work all the overtime I can stand. I'm talking 12hr days 6-7 days a week sometimes, and I was only making 12/hr for the first 3-4 months. I do not wish Customer Service at a call center on anyone. Like there are good calls and then there are the real crap ones. That make you go I want to go home and its the 3rd call of the shift. And you are only like 10 minutes in. But it paid the bills and got me out of debt from being unemployed for so long.\n\nAt this point, I don't really drink that much anymore, mostly because I cant afford it. Have beers here and there. And maybe 1 or 2 every couple of weeks.\n\nAs time goes on at the call center, I get pretty deep into my depression. I try to date but, that doesn't go so well. I keep seeing my friends from high school, being more successful, and getting married, havin' kids and the such.(this is around the 8 years post high school time frame.) Work is literally driving me mad. I feel like crap. I dread going there. 1 night, I'm over at one of my best friend's house, having a couple of drinks with them (I was their best man at their wedding).  I don't know what triggered it, but I was talking about how I feel like I'm not appreciated in my current work at the call center, getting literally screamed at for things I can't control, and how I literally had peoples' lives in my hands when I worked on airplanes. I break down. I cried for like 30 min straight.

For as long as I can remember there's always been something that triggered me I guess.  For example when I was as young as 5/6?  I had a fixation on the number 7, it just felt right somehow, and everything I did I had to do 7 times. \nMy finger accidently brushes past a glass on the table?  Well then I had to brush it another 6 times then. \n\nI accidently bit my tongue?  Well it doesn't matter how much it hurts I HAVE to do it again until I reach that perfect 7. \n\nBut tbh I thought I had gotten past it by myself (Not that I really even knew what I might be at the time). \n\nHowever in the last 2/3 years my tendencys seem to have gotten SO much worse not only have I been getting disgusting/graphic intrusive thoughts on what feels like a ridiculously frequent scale (it's quite hard to estimate the number but at the very least 20 a day all of which can take up to 5 minutes to dispel before they pop right back a little later). \n\nI've also been struggling with germs as well, they don't bother me in a \"germs are bad for you so I don't want them on me way\"  but in a more irrational \"I'm dirty, I'm dirty get everything off me now\"  way.  This has led to me taking over \n1h 30 in the bathroom just trying to achieve cleanliness and it's horrible.  I've washed my hands so much that they dried up and hurt to touch,  I've wiped myself so much after going to the toilet that I bled a bit and honestly... I just have no idea what to do. \n\nI'm writing this post because after starting to (what felt like) manage my tendencys I have now started to notice some of then re-emerging and I don't wanna go through the whole process again. \n\nI know that I should I probably tell my mum about all of this but she is only just starting to feel able to go to the doctors about her own mental health issues (depression)  and I really don't want to add any compound stress on to her already huge pile. I also just don't think that there's enough money for me to go therapist (Not that I've looked into therapists) so I feel a bit lost... \n\nIdk what I really want to achieve with this post in all honesty (Reassurance?,  advice on what to do next?

I stayed awake the entire time which was horrific and when I got to the er and asked the surgeon if I was going to live he told me to tell the people that matter that I loved them. Other than my heart and one lung the surgeon had to take all my organs out rearranging them then put them back in. The surgeon told my father that he was surprised I survived. \n\nI was in shock when I woke up and had a fire lit in me to get healthy again. In under a year I was told I could go back to living my life like normal but I don\u2019t think the Dr.'s realized how active I actually was (rock climbing, mountain bike, race motorcycles, rebuilding classic cars, etc). Within 6 months I blew out my intestines in a foot long hernia tear across my chest while rock climbing. I end up having hernia surgery in May 2019 and got a huge mesh put in me from my chest down to bellow my bellybutton. This set me back mental a bunch, more so than the actual wreck did. Then I ended up having complications from the top part of my hernia mesh not taking and a few weeks ago had to have the entire surgery over again and this time I am just utterly crushed and really fell the life I am used to living is over. \n\nBefore the wreck happened I was looking for a business/ life coach to help me reach goals that I have. I was inspired by the type of therapist in the tv show billions. Someone who could help me be better and push me to reach my goals. \n\nBut now I am not sure if that\u2019s the type of therapist I need.

I am diagnosed PTSD, I had a very traumatic school experience and it has hurt my social and emotion skills, I tend not to trust people easily and I really have to try and make conversation it does not flow naturally and I am not a conversation starter. Been like this for over 10 years now. My siblings all have one thing or another going on with themselves as well, my sister is depressed, my other sister has damn near crippling anxiety, my little brother is depressed, my older brothers are either angry or something else, they arent as open as the rest of us. My family has loaded with drama, over reactions to EVERYTHING, when I was 19 I met a guy, and I felt like we instantly clicked and I fell in love soon after, I was feeling like I was in a good place, but soon after the questions and comments poured in \"Does he even love you?\" \"I don't like him\" \"are you sure this is the person you want to be with?\". Then he purposed that summer, and I said yes, shortly after that I moved in with him, and then we found out that I was pregnant, our relationship seemed fine, and I was happy to be pregnant, having needed something to help me get over my anorexia. My family however were very unhappy with my choice to move out, they were very upset with my quick engagement, they were unhappy with my choice of partner, they felt like in the midst of my choice I disregarded all their feelings and only thought about mine, and said I was acting very selfish. Backstory, I actually made the choice to move out because my dad has always mocked my mental illness, and my mother had been calling all my issues due to panic attacks \"fake\", so I wanted to leave because I felt unhappy being home. So, I get pregnant and I have to tell my catholic mom, and my dad who already doesnt like my fiance, needless to say, it did NOT go over well. I went home that night and I cried myself to sleep. I didn't expect a good reaction by no means, but the way they treated me was unhuman. They kept telling me to leave him, they told me he was a deadbeat, they said just awful things about this person they didnt even know. Of course this very much put a strain on my relationship with both my family and also my fiance. My mental health went from getting better to getting worse overnight, I kept crying, I felt like my fiance really did not understand, and I felt alone. I lost my job after that, and I didnt have a license, so I had no way around but my own two feet, this is where the reason for me not having a license comes in, my dad never wanted to pay for drivers ed, and when I was 18 I asked for my permit and they said they would not pay for it, when my sister turned 18 they paid for hers, then my little bros and other sisters, and I had no extra money, they still refused to pay for mine. I lived about 45 minutes away from my doctors office, so my mom, once things settled, would come and pick me up for my appointments. Then my fiance lost his job, and I had to get a job, I started working at walmart, and eventually decided when it got closer to my due date that I needed to be closer to the hospital, my doctor and so on, I moved in with my parents again. I lived with them until my son was 3 months old, I really hated it because they just kept reminding me of all the 'shitty' things I did, and  on top of this, they became extremely evasive into my personal/private life, I had extremely awful post partum depression, and struggled bonding with my son, my fiance would come vist me and I would go stay with him on the weekend, I had my son all the time unless I needed to go to the store, I'd leave him with my sisters to babysit, which bit me in the butt because then they claimed that I wasnt taking care of my son, and I was...I had him every day, until I went back to work, and then my fiance had him all day once I went back to work fulltime, and then like I said, my son turned 3 months and I took my son and we moved out to live with my fiance, we shared a place with his parents, which was fine for a bit, then some drama went down over there the food bill/rent (I got pregnant again and I couldnt work as much because of complications) so I moved out as to avoid more drama I didnt need while pregnant, moved back in with my parents (I didnt want to, I dont actually know why I did) still stayed with him on my days off, then I left my job, and my fiance got a job at a oil shop, fulltime, and we planned on getting our own place that spring, more drama went down, I had to stay with my parents, that summer we finally moved into a place together, no parents, it was nice at first, my daughter was 3 months old, and we were happy for a while. My parents minded the distance, and I avoided their house as to not get a repeat lecture about how I dont care about them. I felt happy. Then some other drama went down, my fiance ended things with me, and we got back together a week later, and then a month after that, he ended them again, and we were apart for 2 weeks, got back together, the lease ran out that march, we moved to another city, my parents were in a good place, and so was I, everyone was genrally happy, until one of his relatives started saying I was a liar and yelled at me for every little thing, so I moved back to my parents 200 miles away when I got so unhappy I tried killing myself, we agreed it was the best option, I'd get therapy and he'd eventually move down too and we'd get married. Thats exactly what happened over that 6 month course, I got pregnant too, our youngest son. Moved in with my parents to be able to live rent free and save our money. I am grateful for that, he got a job making okay money, and we started searching for apartments. My parents have not been very considerate at all of anything, tantrums over when my therapy is, refusing to give me a ride, refusing to watch the kids while I went, if I wanted a shower I had to wait for everyone in the house to shower first as to be considerate of all of them, then if I wanted to do laundry I couldnt not interrupt someone else doing laundry but everyone could interrupt me, over and over, no one told my husband what they needed done or needed help with, they relied on me to do all of it, that started issues in my marriage, nevermind the obnoxious parenting directions, the constant nagging about \"when are you going to move out?\" As if apartment complexes would just give us keys and we could move out, it became so straining on our relationship, and taxing on my mental health, that we ended up seperating recently because we've both been so depressed making eachother miserable.

        "original": "I am a 20 year old male student and I have been struggling a lot with my mental health for a really long time (I am not solely talking about stress because of my studies etc. I do have this but it is the \"smallest problem I have\"). Also this account is made because others could recognize me otherwise. Please understand that English is not my first language.\n\nSo my mental health was already declining for a long time but stuff is finally getting to me. I don't know if this is the right place to post this and this might also be disturbing for some of you. (Or maybe just to me)\n\nFirst I like to begin with my childhood. Nothing terrible ever happened to me but I was quick to understand most stuff (and pretty naive when it came to reality in some subjects).   \nWhen I was about 6-7 years old I firstly got sleep-paralysis (I never got diagnosed for some stuff in this post. It is very hard for me to talk about with relatives etc. but if they knew I went to a doctor etc. things would escalate very badly (they kind of know probably but they are ignorant when subjects like that come up)\n\nSorry for the interruption, so when I was 6-7 I first got it. It stayed a few months (definitely more than 1.5 years). They went away but always came back. I dreamed of seeing myself hanged (like gallops) by my own intestines, eaten alive whilst burning alive, drowning (more like waterboarding), getting operated on without proper medication or painkillers. The list goes on and on but these are the least disturbing in my opinion. Also before \"dreaming\" (was sometimes half awake and saw stuff in my room) these things I had some traumatic events before.\n\nSo I would lay completely stiff on my bed limbs spread and my fingers \"clawed\" into my mattress. I got  cold-sweat (warm and cold at the same time), felt my blood flow (I even heard it sometimes, very weird stuff). With the latter I also felt and heard my heartbeat even in my skull which seemed to expand when the pulse repeated itself. My eyes spread wide and I don't blink for a long time (probably longer in my experience than the time which went by in reality). My room also came alive (changing shapes etc.) and I saw \"that thing\" (It is pretty obvious I have a trauma about \"this thing\" but it is also very difficult to describe). I got an enormous amounts of cramps but somehow managed to not move just out of pure fear. Also I didn't dare to open my mouth (as if it was sewed tight) and only breath with short breaths through my nose. Sometimes this happened multiple times per night. It mostly stopped when I passed out.\n\nIf this sounds like something from the exorcist it just might be I only twice vomited over myself during this. I only was able to get help from my mother once. And she also became traumatized by my \"possessed pose\" I was in. She especially remembers my eyes. Sorry about this long section but I also want to vent a bit. My declining mentality makes me scared to go asleep (It's 2 am here). Also I hear voices and see stuff that isn't there for a long time now.\n\nI also do not easily (if at all) make close relationships with people. I worry a lot about them if I do (more than about myself). My further career went good (not perfect but never had major issues) until I got to college. (Went pretty decent but the college was very bad with people (only 2 or 3 people I know from there still study there, the rest mostly left)). I did change too and found a better place. But my mental problems make it unable to even think clear let alone study etc.\n\nNow as I already said my mental health is rapidly declining. I think I probably have some immunodeficiency. I feel my nerves in my head \"move\", when it is cold my back feels like spiting and hurts like hell. Also I have a big pain-limit when it comes to my inside. I once walked around with something that should have been a direct trip to the emergency-room for more than 1 day. When the doctor saw it (surely didn't expect it) he immediately send me to the operation-room and couldn't believe I felt no pain. Also I am temporarily infertile which is probably also a consequence of being born too soon. (Might be fixed by yet another operation). I don't feel like having kids and I won't be a good father. (Hell I have problems taking care of myself let alone children)\n\nEnough about the physical stuff. Mentally I feel like a mess. I feel almost no enjoyment anymore, have mood-switches, I don't recognize myself and feel like something took over my head (\"that thing\" maybe?). Hell I don't recognize myself in the mirror if I look into one at all (other nightmares where my reflection strangled me or I got stabbed/impaled by an insane amount of glass-shards made me aware of mirrors). Maybe it is also self-shame and guilt. A lot of my close friends say that I need more self-esteem and to not feel guilty (goes kind of hand in hand with the worrying). I oppressed the shit out of things and they never saw me angry (in a decent anger) or cry. Now I don't even feel like \"myself\" or remember what I used to feel like.\n\nFor anyone here wondering if I am addicted to alcohol etc. The answer is no. I had 2-3 months where it was especially hard where I drank more than usual but I still drink way less that the average student to this day.\n\nFor the ones wondering if I harm myself the answer is regrettably yes. I harm myself with boiling water (the damp not the liquid) by letting it condensate on my skin. (Mostly hands from a hot cup)  \nIt probably started when I began to feel empty and began to take hotter baths and showers to feel warmth again (to this day my only source of warmth). I shower at a minimum of 42\u00b0C if not higher. This method also leaves no scars/wounds but makes me feel something.\n\nFor the ones wondering if I consider suicide the answer would be I don't know. But that probably means yes. I have struggled with the thought for years. However regrettably someone close to me did it before me. (I won't go in further detail it gets darker and darker the more you know and whilst it is a huge deal to me I feel not like discussing this (might be wrong but I can't handle this)) That is why I am probably here. If that person didn't do it I would definitely have done it myself. (Sounds bad I know but it is the harsh truth). I still think about it all the time. Even when I don't I only need to see any object and I begin to think how I could stab/crush/... myself with it. I am someone who has \"experience\" from both sides (my god I hate how I worded that). I do not go on balconies and roofs anymore since that doesn't help me right now. Also please don't recommend r/SuicideWatch to me. I am familiar with the subreddit (on another account). I did help (only a handful) of people there but I can't help myself. (Pretty ironic but true). Also I have some things I like to take care of before I make my final decision.\n\nBtw I do not in any situation hurt anyone else. I am not a danger to others but I am to myself. I literally feel myself mentally die constantly in my brain. (Don't know how to explain it)\n\nI do feel myself brake and oppressing doesn't seem to keep it controlled anymore. I can go on for a bit longer but I can literally feel it tearing me apart.\n\nWell I probably let things out since you can't really type it all but I tried. I am sorry it became this long and all over the place with the shifting back and forth (I know my style is kind of hard to follow).   \nAlso sorry if the NSFW tag wasn't needed but yeah. I still have no idea if this is the right place to post this tbh.\n\nI do not expect an answer to be honest but at least it's out here now. I am going to try and \"sleep\" now (just blank darkness and waking up tired). Please help some other people out there too.",

        "original": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI have two friends from my previous place of work. Both friends have admitted to being rather checked out at work over the past few months, but they still continued to get stuff done. One friend, call him G, has been trying to turn his side hustle into a full time gig, so he's been especially checked out. I know it's not going all that great because he had to borrow some money from me a couple weeks ago. He also has a family to support: wife, two young kids, and his aging mother. He is the sole breadwinner.\n\nI hung out with G on Friday. We sat and talked and drank for hours, literally until 1 in the morning, having a great time. Monday we texted for a little bit. We made plans to hang out this coming Friday. All seemed fine.\n\nThen yesterday, our other friend (call him N) told me G hadn't been at work all day, and he couldn't get ahold of him. No one from their team could. So I texted him. No response. After work, N called me. Said he'd just stopped by G's apartment, and he was there with his wife and two kids, and all seemed fine, but he didn't really pry all that much.\n\nThen today, N reports that G has resigned, effective immediately. Again, sole breadwinner for a family of 5. Now I'm kinda freaking out. So I text him again. \"Hey man seriously are you doing okay?\" No response, so I follow up with \"I'm coming to your place tonight. That cool?\" Finally get a response. \"I'm fine. Don't need to come here. I am good though.\" I reply \"For real though man. Worried about you.\" He insists he's okay, so I ask him about meeting up Friday, and he says No. I tell him he's really making me anxious, to which he says \"don't be.\" I say \"an explanation of what's going on would put me more at ease,\" and he says \"Wish I had one. It's an excuse. No reasons. Scares the shit out of me. Sorry bro.\"\n\nA few minutes ago, N calls me to tell me he stopped at G's apartment once again on the pretense of getting some work stuff. Said he was once again there with his wife and kids, and once again they all looked perfectly normal.\n\nBut I'm still very concerned for the guy. A perfectly normal person doesn't quit their job on a whim with a family to support, and then have no explanation as to why, even for his closest friends. And even if a perfectly normal person *did* do that, then they sure as hell shouldn't *look* normal. Honestly, I'm not even sure if his wife knows. I'd love to contact her, but I don't have any of her contact information.\n\nI talked it over with N. I proposed calling a crisis center. He thinks that's too drastic, and would rather we both just pay him a visit tomorrow AM. I agreed to that, because what else can I do? He's concerned they might take his kids away. I think considering there's two other lucid adults present, odds of that are low, but honestly have no clue. I definitely don't want to make things worse for the guy.\n\nSo I'm not sure what to do here. Is a crisis center the right option? Or are there better first steps? I'm in central TX.",

        "title": "What can I do to steer my life in a direction that will make me feel a bit better ?",
        "original": "Hello\n\nExcuse my poor english.\n I\u2019m a Norwegian 18 year old guy who\u2019d like some advice. \nHalf a year ago I quit organized skiing training. Skiing is something I had done practically all my life and something I heavily identified myself with. Whenever we had those Introduction/get-to-know-eachother games in class I would always introduce myself only by my name and the fact that I liked skiing. However in the past few years I have not enjoyed skiing training much and while in school I'd often dread the fact that I had to go skiing afterwards. I am relieved that I stopped skiing. Nowadays, the time that skiing training used to fill up is now filled with just momentary satisfactions I get from the Internet, watching TV-shows and reading. Reading has always been important for me, but especially when I was younger. I think I used books as a way to escape reality, not because reality was horrible or anything, but imagining myself as a person in the fantasy books was always much more desirable. There were times when I would literally spend a bigger part of the day reading than not reading. I didn't sleep enough because I'd be reading instead. Everyone around me stopped reading after becoming teens though and I am also reading less and less. I've also been lucid-dreaming a lot lately which is even more so an escape from reality. \n\nI think I am lacking an identity. If someone asked me today to introduce myself I wouldn't know what to say besides my name. My grades have plummeted the last half a year which I think has hit my self-esteem a bit. During school I often find myself too tired to work even though I haven't been doing anything special and when I have the strength to work I can't help but let my mind drift to think about other things (these things can be pretty random chains of thoughts sometimes involving things I've been reading or watching online. Often daydreaming too). I also have similar problems when working with school at home. My mind starts drifting as soon as I begin. I think this hurts my self-esteem a bit too. It doesn't conform with who I want to be.\nIts hard to put my finger on it, but I feel like I'm always feeling quite distant from everything that goes on around me. I think I have felt like that for years.\nLately I think I have been feeling less and less. The momentary happiness I get from reading and the Internet is slowly disappearing and I also feel like I'm drifting away from my friends a little. I have a few friends but I feel like being with them is not as fun anymore and just takes my energy. Our interests are starting to differ and sometimes when I talk to them I feel like some of their comments are so bafflingly ignorant and stupid, but I'm not articulate enough in a conversation to tell them that in a nice way. So I just pretend like I agree and try to change topic.\nI've been feeling sick an awful lot the past few months which my teacher told me could be related to the fact that I've been feeling a bit depressed, but I don't know about that. I never got sick before thought . It's hard for me to tell if I'm feeling particularly sad or not, but I am pretty sure I am a little bit depressed. \n\nI feel like a good way to get better and start feeling better about myself would be to find  something I can identity myself with quick. I have small interests, like drawing or programming and I have a book in my head that I really want to write (reading is not something I feel like I can identify myself with because I never tell people that I read, and I also have doubts about whether or not the way I read is good for me) I have also gained a great interest in 3-D animation programs recently and I want to learn how to use them so very much, but even so, when I begin using them, I just can't get forward because my mind is just not able to focus enough. I end up staring into a wall thinking about other things for a couple hours or just do something else. My mind rarely feels like it's completely in the present.\nMy grades are dropping, I'm starting to believe less in myself, I'm always tired but never working, I'm lacking an identity and I can't find one. I feel stuck. What do I do? How can I make my life a bit better?",

We started discussing some really erratic behaviors my mother has, usually forgetting specific events or remembering them quite differently. I'm a Neuropsychologist, so I know quite a lot about false memories and how human memory work, but I've never seen a case such as this. I'll exemplify: she is not dealing well with the marriage thing, my fiancee invited her to her graduation party, and I remember her saying yes. Everyone was around and remember her saying yes. When I asked her, she said (and I really believe that she believes it) that she never confirmed or said such thing. I also know that she doesn't really feel like going there, because she doesn't like my fiancee parents, so there is a gain in her not going.\n\nSame goes for a few discussions, when she says that I told her things that I would never say, like that I don't love her, or that I didn't say things that I am positive that I did, I'm very careful with words, I know what I say. My sister has the same experience than me.\n\nNow, to add it up, she has some friends that really idolize her, so she plays this social role as the good and understanding mother to a point where there is a certain cult of personality around her. People kissing her ass, this kind of stuff, because she is so wise and strong and all that. She clearly feeds on it, and wouldn't drop this situation for anything in the world.\n\nShe doesn't fill the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder, for example, but I'm still thinking about some personality- related disorder where the patient would be able to distort reality to this degree. I perceived that she behaves and feels exactly like all of these things are true, and really suffers from it, from the things that she thinks I said, but I didn't.\n\nNot exactly sure as to how to deal with that. Perhaps could be some early dementia?  Or a personality thing? Anyone ever saw this kind of situation in a recurring scenario?\n\nIf I confront her and tell her to seek a professional, she will play victim and say that I'm trying to convince her that she is crazy, so taking her to a consultation is not a possibility.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I know a lot of teens often self diagnose themselves for having depression, especially girls, but I think I might need help and I\u2019m not sure if I should tell my parents. I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder already (it\u2019s genetic, been being treated since I turned 13) and I\u2019ve heard that can also cause depression. I\u2019ve been having major scares lately with almost attempting suicide and have been contemplating cutting myself or self-harm. I\u2019m tired all the time and I really am tired of living and I feel like it\u2019d be better if I just died, plus I wouldn\u2019t be so financially burdening to my parents. My parents have been struggling with their marriage lately and my mom always talks about leaving my step dad because of his children who have special needs because they\u2019re so mentally taxing to her. I also just lost a best friend when I needed her most after telling her in August I almost tried to commit suicide, even after giving her every last drop of my love and support. I also have very low self-esteem and I just feel like such a mess, since I\u2019m always tired no matter how much I sleep I nap a lot and my parents call me lazy. My mom threatened to put me in a mental hospital last time I had a panic attack and tried to do something to myself.

The schools i have applied to all allow service/therapy animals in the dorms as long as you do what they ask before bringing it (having the proper qualifications, notifying that you will have the animal with you etc.)  which I will happily uphold. \n\nI have some family pets/low maintenance pets of my own at home who mean the world to me and are the reason why I\u2019m pursuing a career related to animals, and I know it\u2019s going to be very difficult for me to be away from them (I think about them even at work lmao). I think just having an animal with me is going to make me feel less alone when I\u2019m stressed/sad and will help to keep my mood more stable. The reason why I\u2019m choosing a kitten over an adult cat is because it\u2019s going to be easier introducing a younger kitten to my current cat who is older, as I know she would not take to another adult cat well. She\u2019s also too old for me to bring with me to school, and I wouldn\u2019t want to stress her out (shes also a bitch and would be mean to my roommate/friends lol). I know that a kitten will still take time introducing, and I\u2019ve already graduated high school so I am home and able to be hands on with getting the two cats acclimated to each other.\n\nI currently work with animals and am aware of how much a cat costs and the requirements they have, but I guess I\u2019m just looking to see if anyone has any personal experience with having a support animal through school or honestly just any thoughts on the idea, good or bad :)  Its hard to imagine what the situation will be like in school without actually having the kitten and experiencing it first hand, but I\u2019d rather know all the pros and cons before fully committing. I\u2019ll also provide more info if need be !",

I am actually going tomorrow. I just can\u2019t cope. I can\u2019t hold down even a part time job. I spent the entire time feeling like breaking down at every moment. Even almost did at times. I was tearing up just a few feet from my coworkers but none of them noticed because I made sure to hide my face. I can\u2019t sleep at night. I\u2019m always up until 4-5 am and I wake up at 3-4 pm. I avoid things that stress me out like the plague. Feels like everyone around me is pressuring me to start a career but I don\u2019t know if I can even handle a simple part time job. I feel like a deadbeat. Like eventually I will have to get a job, and the stress will put me further into depression and anxiety. I\u2019m not suicidal, but I\u2019m always the closest to suicide thoughts when I am at work. I avoid adult responsibilities. I am almost 19 and I still don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. I withdrew from my physics course at the last moment so I didn\u2019t have to go. I avoid physical confrontation and I avoid romantic relationships ever since I was molested. No one in my family knows I was molested. Only 3 of my closest friends know. I have never told anyone face to face, mostly because I suck at social interaction in general, and it wouldn\u2019t get any easier talking about such a serious topic. I just don\u2019t find joy in anything anymore. Only distraction. I sit in bed and fantasize. Sometimes when I am getting flashbacks it feels like  I am seeing something happening to someone else, not me. Sometimes I see it happening from outside my body. Every flashback feels like being stabbed. Sometimes I can even almost feel his legs wrapped around mine and his hand grabbing me through my swim shorts. I have anger issues and mood swings that I think are connected to my abuse. I can be very kind and considerate, and then someone insults or judges me negatively and I explode in anger. Sometimes I even lose the ability to feel empathy or sympathy until I have calmed down and I feel bad. I feeling sad and lost to feeling extreme anger and a wanting for revenge. I want to beat the shit out of pedophiles. There is a pedophile that rubs a video store near me and I fantasize about jumping him when he closes his store at night. I fantasize about finding a pedophile abusing a little boy and I beat the shit out of them and I hug and comfort the little boy. I want to attack all pedophiles but the fantasy always includes a little boy. I guess he\u2019s a surrogate for me. Sometimes I feel hopeful and optimistic, but it only lasts a few seconds, and then it\u2019s gone just like that. They are very fleeting. I hate the expectations people have put on me. Sometimes I just want to run away and go live on a beach or something. I hide all of these feelings. No one knows I feel them. The only one people really see is the anger when I can\u2019t hold it in. Other than that I seem completely normal. People just assume I am okay, because I look okay. I was always the kid that never had any problems so my parents paid more attention to my siblings who had more problems. I think that has caused me to crave attention. I don\u2019t seek it out, but whenever I get it I am happy. It\u2019s a great feeling. I won\u2019t lie, I get excited whenever I get a notification here or on any other social media. I get excited in anticipation. Anyways, I think I am rambling now. I just wanted to say whatever came to mind. Thank you for anyone who reads this novel. I appreciate you taking the time.",

This is bad because before hand I was literally a sex fiend. Constantly horny constantly wanting to try and do new things with my BF (a very helpful and wholesome supportive man trying his best). Now it\u2019s almost all gone, and the rare event it does come it\u2019s gone in a flash. It\u2019s really impacted our relationship not just for him being accustomed to a certain amount of sex (he\u2019s not voiced any complaints but I get the vibe he\u2019s missing it) but also decreased my confidence and feeling of intimacy. \n\nSecond off, where the fuck did my trust go? Earlier in our relationship, my bf really helped learn to trust people and him. I had a rough childhood (who hasn\u2019t these days) and it lead to a huge trust in people and authorities. He helped me learn to be more trusting and proved through action he is a trustworthy and earnest man. I opened up to him in ways I\u2019ve never opened up to anyone, including my old therapist and my father who I\u2019m really close to. \n\nNow that I\u2019m on the Zoloft I\u2019m coming up with conspiracy after conspiracy that I can\u2019t trust him that he doesn\u2019t trust me that he doesn\u2019t love me that he\u2019s just with me because he\u2019s scared of my health etc etc despite his constant reassurance and proving otherwise. In my consciousness I know he\u2019d never lie to me or manipulate me and that he loves me, but we get into the smallest argument and it goes poof. I feel almost paranoid, like my brain is picking up on small things that prove he is manipulating me that don\u2019t even exist. \n\nNeedless to say it\u2019s putting a huge strain on our relationship and that\u2019s putting a huge strain on my stability. I hate to admit it, but right now I\u2019m very emotionally dependent on him. It\u2019s not where I want to be, and I have a plan to seek therapy to work on it, but it\u2019s the sad truth. He says if I can\u2019t trust him, we shouldn\u2019t be together, and that freaks me out despite being a pretty reasonable assertion. \n\nHow do I talk to my psychiatrist and soon to acquire therapist to tinker with my meds or start the right path to working on this? The Zoloft has stopped the irrational \u201ckill yourself it\u2019s the easiest solution\u201d thoughts I was having before but the mental and physical side effects are killing me as well. I was able to trust my bf pretty well before I started taking it and now it seems to be working to worsen my paranoia and anxiety rather than ease it. \n\nWould like any commentary or advice y\u2019all are able to give!",

        "original": "Since elementary school, I've been a hyperactive kid who had an estranged relationship with her mother that lead to me having a hatred of her until 8th grade. She was raised with the, \"spare the rod, spoil the child\", mentality and that's how she raised us. Bad behavior was met with being hit, yelled at, and punished. My mom had mostly male siblings growing up and is EXTREMELY strong, especially to a child. As you can imagine, as an elementary school kid, my mother constantly hitting and yelling at me did not make me feel very good about myself. She also verbally attacked me such as calling me stupid, lacking any common sense, etc. Combined with the kids at school who called me fat and ugly, I had no self-confidence and a deep self-loathing. I constantly lied to her due to a hatred for the woman who caused all my hurt, which of course, made my relationship with her 100x worse. My mom hates lying above all else. I'm not going to say that everything about that time was horrible but it caused me to want to die in elementary. I prayed to God to strike me down and kill me. My mom sent me to therapy for probably 2-1/2 years to combat my pathological lies, (I kept my thoughts about death to myself), that I had grown into.\n\nFast-forward to 6th grade where our arguments were becoming extremely frequent and I would come to school crying almost every day and be comforted by my friends. Thankfully, school made life so much better because the people around me made my feel like a champion. Sure, I never thought that highly of myself but a lot of people knew me and I was pretty well liked. It was a stark contrast to how I felt when I got home. I felt like my autistic younger sister was better and more loved than me when I was at home.\n\nFast-forward to 7th grade where my life went downhill. My relationships at school had me on cloud nine but my home life got worse and worse. I started think about how all my friends probably secretly hated me, (being high so energy meant that I was a really annoying kid but I couldn't help it). Life at home sucked as always.\n\nI eventually went from praying for God to kill me to wanting to kill myself.\n\nOne day in class, and it was a Friday afternoon, (that day is burned into my memory I swear), a classmate was complaining about *something* bad going on in her life. That made me feel bad about my life. Then I snapped. I got hysterical, opened my backpack, took out my safety scissors in the middle of class and tried to *fucking stab my wrists* right then and there like a fucking maniac. I didn't get hurt because they were safety scissors tho \\\\(-\\_-)/. My friends grabbed them away and the other girl and I stepped out of class to be in hysterics away from everyone else. Needless to say, I was taken to a mental hospital that night. My mom had CPS on her ass for potential abuse, (which I ended up denying like a coward), and I was homeschooled for the rest of the semester. I wasn't allowed to be left alone because I could hurt myself. I was only allowed to write with crayons and stayed in a corner all day when I wasn't doing work.\n\nMy mother hated me then. Apparently, I only wanted attention. She told me so. I had just tried to end my life and she hated me for it. Not out of concern. I was like a piece of shit in her home. She was gonna put me up for adoption.\n\nHalf a year later, somehow we were able to bounce back from that. I went to a new middle school for 8th grade and life was never better. I got straight A's for the entire year. I was so happy to be out of the house.\n\nI'm in high school now and that entire experience has fucked up my head. Although my mother and I have never gotten along better, I came away from the whole thing scarred.\n\nMy thoughts are rapid and loud. I have the urge to harm myself via cutting. I'm typing this with 6 fresh new cuts right now. Death and killing myself is in my head every week even though I don't truly want to. At the same time, everything is pointless. My mood can change within moments. I don't sleep the same way as before. I feel perfectly fine on the 3 hours of sleep I've had. Sometimes I'm so passionate and creative that my head feels like it's gonna burst with ideas. I'm always so happy and sad at the same time and if I don't get some help soon, I'm gonna snap.\n\nMy mom hated me the last time I needed help. What do I do? I'm hurting myself emotionally and physically. If I tell the doctor what's happening to me, I don't know how she'll react to hearing my talk about suicide. I don't want to open old wounds. What do I do?\n\nTL:DR; My mom reacted badly the last time I snapped and hated my for it.

The diagnosis fit: I had a flat mood, was unmotivated/persistently tired, felt worthless and was suicidal, rapidly gained weight, got no sleep, my relationship with my parents, friends, school were strained, etc. \n\nI only started to feel better when I started dieting and going to the gym everyday. So about 1/2 - 1 year after my diagnosis I thought I had fully recovered from depression. Unfortunately it was through my obsession to lose weight and my resulting eating disorders that I managed to do so. As soon as I stopped restricting however, I started getting panic attacks and unmanageable anxiety levels. \n\nWhat I thought was depression came about 6 months later after a shoulder injury and poor performance physically.\n\nI became plagued with thoughts of suicide and my self esteem plummeted during this time. I gave into a perfection complex and believed that I was worthless and had felt so tired. I lost interest in the sport I loved because of how poorly I was playing with the injury and my first assumption was that I was relapsing and was experiencing a second depression. I sought out a therapist who confirmed this.\n\nThis was back in August of 2019 and seeing my doctor today has made me realize how different the second episode has been for me. My mood is not persistently flat, I feel quite a large range of emotions actually (anger, sadness, guilt, desire, happiness, etc); I\u2019m not bed bound and engage in social activities; I sometimes have a period of time in an elevated or emotional mood that can\u2019t really be explained; and cry all the time. Even in my first episode while I would cry from time to time, I shut down most of my feelings and don\u2019t remember doing so as frequently as I do now.

I make a conscious effort to do so, however some time ago I feel like my body stopped listening to me and just keeps me in a stagnant state. \n\nFor example: I struggle to wake up to class. But not in a normal \"I'm lazy\" kind of way. I sleep my 8 hours or more and unconsciously turn off my alarms. I tried putting my phone further. Also didn't work. I asked my roommates to wake me up. I took a shower, sat on a chair to blow dry my hair and fell asleep like that (!). It's extremely troubling. I struggle to clean my house, do laundry, even commute to work or to do groceries. I often catch myself falling asleep in random places even though I slept plenty.\n\nI also struggle remembering things. I have been well prepared for my exams this January but so far it's  been a disaster. I forget everything I've done and learned right when I'm in the class. The only thing I can focus on is that I want to get out of the room. When working out  (I'm trying to lose weight) I feel extremely weak and redundant to continue pushing myself even though I have barely started my exercise. I eat well and care to not strain my body so I don't know why is this happening.\n\nThe worst of them all is probably that I can't be arsed to care. I tried so many \"advices\" from so many people that failed nonetheless. I only feel like everything I'll try will end up being yet another failure. I feel no satisfaction from completing tasks or getting something right for a change. My self esteem is very low and I feel I'm lying to myself when I try to think positively about my appearance/personality, like I don't care to live or die. \n\nRevising and studying is twice as long as normal for me because my thought process is so slow. I can't seem to feel a kick from it anymore.\n\nMy wit and humor also faltered. I often catch myself being very obnoxious and silly without a reason. I don't feel happy or accomplished in the slightest. Any attempt to improve seems to be fruitless because my mind says \"go on\" but my body will start randomly hurting or feeling strained/fatigued. \n\nWhat do I do from here? \n\nI have no therapy or mental health aid available. I'm too poor to afford a private therapy.",

        "original": "Hello,\nI am sorry if this is long. Please go easy on me as well, I\u2019m feeling extremely self-conscious. \nI\u2019m in my first year of university. Last night I decided to go out with a couple guy friends (I\u2019m 19M), two of whom I just met before we left (they were mutual friends of one of the guy friends who invited me). I was told the place we were going to was a bar, but when I got there, it was more of a club. Anyways, we all aren\u2019t exactly sober. We sat at a booth, got some drinks, and one of the mutual friends was saying how we should all try to pick up some girls for the night. I didn\u2019t exactly hear what he said, so my one friend told him that I have a girlfriend (which is true). The two mutual friends were sort of lightly pressuring me to cheat, and I would not budge, as I politely turned that idea down. (Side note: I have absolutely no tolerance for cheaters. It\u2019s super messed up to do that to another person). Anyways, we went to the dance floor and I\u2019m dancing (horribly) with one of the mutual friends and we get in this group of other girls and whatever, nothing eventful... I obviously was not trying to hook up with anyone. Was just trying to make some friends. Now, I obviously know that going to clubs is where people want to hookup, but I guess I didn\u2019t fully realize how frequent of an occurrence that was. So a little while later My friends and I are walking back up to the bar, and I\u2019m kind of trailing behind, and one of them sees a group of girls that he knows. So I get into the little circle, and I just introduce myself or whatever. Now, I\u2019m usually TERRIBLE at reading if someone is interested in me (i guess I\u2019m just extremely oblivious, also I\u2019ve had my girlfriend for three years now) but this one girl was clearly making advances towards me, and if I was able to pick up on that, there was no way it wasn\u2019t true. Anyways, she starts dancing near me, and I kind of just start doing the same thing, and within 15 seconds of that, she turns around and starts grinding. I\u2019m caught off guard, so I slowly start backing up. To get her to turn around, I tell her my name, which would kind of incline her to turn around and tell me her name (I guess This was my thought process. I wasn\u2019t sober, and I wasn\u2019t in my prime decision-making state). It worked though, and she turned around (which was the goal). She told her her name and She was touching me, grabbing me by the arm, all that. I somehow slipped away from this situation within a minute of her turning around (I can\u2019t even remember how I did it to be honest. I wasn\u2019t absolutely wasted, I was still in control of myself, I just don\u2019t remember that detail). \nSo I ended up leaving the club as soon as I could without straight up ditching the guys I went with. I probably left around 20 minutes after it happened, which was the first opportunity I saw to leave. Wasn\u2019t feeling very good. I got home, and called my girlfriend and I told her the general story. She offered to come over (we both live on campus residence so its very close) and so she stayed the night and I told her more of the details of the story. She told me that I should have straight up told the girl at the beginning as soon as she started dancing near me that I have a girlfriend. At that point however, I wasn\u2019t fully certain she was trying to hit on me, and I didn\u2019t want to immediately say \u201coh I have a girlfriend\u201d and just leave. I thought maybe not every girl in this club is looking for a hookup (I guess that\u2019s where my naivety comes into play?). I was really tired (I couldn\u2019t even keep my eyes open) and I wanted to go to bed, but my girlfriend was super upset. I was trying to comfort her, while also feeling really self-conscious myself, on top of not being in a sober state. So yeah that didn\u2019t go very well. It\u2019s tense between the two of us right now, and I was just trying to do the right thing. In general, I felt very socially awkward during many parts of the night, and out of place, and I felt like everyone was staring at me nitpicking every little thing I did or didn\u2019t do. I just need some reassurance or something, anything. I have had depression and anxiety in the past, and I\u2019m now medicated for it. But in extreme situations (like this one) my depressed and anxious tendencies seem to surface. \nThanks a bunch to anyone who actually took their time to read this whole thing.",

He thought about it every now and then, but he never actually wanted to do that. \n\nOne day, he woke up at 10am. It was a cloudy day. The sky was dark. For some reasons, he felt different. Everything was annoying. Everything was a distraction. The sounds. The piles of clothes. The opened closets. The blanket. Himself. He wanted to be out of that place. There was something inside him trying to tell him something, but he couldn\u2019t hear it. He knew it was important, but he couldn\u2019t hear it. He sat on his bed for 30 minutes trying to think, but his mind was blank. At a moment, he decided he would kill himself that day. He texted his therapist about what was happening, but his therapist didn\u2019t answer. That was it. He - a 17 year old - would kill himself.\n\nHe knew everything was. Knives. Electric cords. Right. He knew where his meds were. He wanted to take his pills, go out to his trail, and commit suicide there so nobody could stop him. It would give him enough time.\n\nHe prepared for his death. Wrote some notes for people he loved. Wore his favorite leather jacket. He slowly walked to the room where his meds were. Every step had to be completely quiet. Nothing could stop him today. \n\nThere was someone in the room where his meds were. She said Hi to him and smiled, asking him where he was going. He was disappointed that he couldn\u2019t get the meds. \n\nHe received a text from one of his friends. It gave him goosebumps. It was very sincere. It stirred his emotions a little bit. He thought she would be really hurt if he was gonna commit suicide, and he couldn\u2019t let that happen because she was very important to him. She was his first love, his ex- girlfriend. Though he didn\u2019t love her like he was, she still had a very important place in his heart.  \n\nHe walked out of the house. It started to rain. He was very confused about what he was going to do next, because he didn\u2019t have his pills, so he couldn\u2019t kill himself as planned. He walked slowly to his favorite trail. On the way, his therapist called him, and talked him through the suicidal thoughts. He decided to not kill himself anymore. \n\nHe reached his favorite spot. The grass there was dying because of the cold, and it had a yellowish color that he really hated. He sat down and called the friend. They talked for a bit about\u2026 stuff. He finally felt better and decided to walk back home. It was raining very hard, and there was thunder and lightning. He thought he was stupid for being out that day. When he reached home, he was soaking wet. \n\n\u2026.\n\n\u2026.\n\n\u2026.\n\nHurt. Anger.\n\nHe hates it when people say: \u201cDon\u2019t kill yourself. You have to be alive for us. Don\u2019t be selfish\u201d. He hates it. Hates it. Hates it. Hates it. Hates it. Yes. Everyone has good intentions, but they should just shut up. No one listens. \n\nHe considers himself not a selfish dick. He does think about other people. He cares about other people. He loves to help other people. Whenever he thinks about killing himself, he thinks people will get hurt, and will be sad. He doesn\u2019t want that. He just cannot help himself, but other people don\u2019t think so. People want him \u201cto live for them\u201d. Do they ever think that he has to live for himself too? He just cannot live for himself. That\u2019s why he wants to commit suicide. Is that selfish? \n\n\u2026.\n\n\u2026.\n\n\u2026.\n\nCrave.\n\nHe craves physical contacts. He wants to hug someone. Someone. Enjoy the scent of the people. It\u2019s been so long since the last time he hugged or cuddled someone. He missed the warmth of people. Here, he cannot cuddles anybody. Even the dog doesn\u2019t like to be cuddled. \n\nHe craves music. Good music. He starts to listen to music a lot more. He starts to notice details in the music like the breath of the singers. \n\nHe craves the out door. He wants fresh air. He wants the sun. He wants freedom",

        "original": "Hi all. I'm hoping someone here knows more about this than I do. I'll just start off by saying that maybe I'm just an introvert. But I really loathe some of these things. I loathe them and think about them negatively to the point that it made me want to ask here. I hate crowds, I won't go to concerts. If there's a large crowd I'm getting out of it immediately. I don't like people I don't know standing too close to me, and I really don't like them to walk up and talk to me. Unless the conversation just somehow happens organically. I'm getting better about that through force of will though. Not as bad as I used to be. But I'd just really rather not talk to most people.\n\nI enjoy spending time with my friends and to some degree, my family. But people I don't know... I just don't really like them talking to me. I am married but even still, I prefer to spend most of my time alone, sitting in front of my computer. I work as a truck driver, so that my contact with random people that I don't care to associate with, is as limited as it can be. I'm even building a website that I intend to monetize, so that I can eventually quit working and stay home in my house away from the world and away from people as much as possible. I really don't care what it takes, I'll learn everything there is to know about marketing if that's what I have to do. But I'm going to get out of this job and I'm going to work at home.\n\nAnother thing is, I really dislike disorder. Like a lot. I want everything as orderly as possible. The house doesn't have to be spotless, don't get me wrong. But if there's stuff out and about, it's going to be orderly. I even order everything on the table if we go out to eat at a restaurant. I don't know if this next part has any bearing on anything, but I'm smart. I'm not some kind of braggart, I'm simply explaining this. I've taken a ton of tests over the years in an effort to remedy my social situation and my social anxiety. And most of the time I come out as being smarter than 2 people in a room of 100. I know there's no way to say that without it sounding like I'm tooting my own horn. But I said it because it's well known that a lot of \"eccentrics\" are that way. They're extremely talented in something or another, and they're also kind of weird as I am. I also feel that I don't have much in common with most people. A little here and there, sure.\n\nBut by and large, I really do need to go to the local college and talk to the professors to feel like I'm in like minded company. I know the way this all sounds and I really can't stand people who talk like this but given what I'm trying to do here, I have to. So hopefully someone can take an objective look and tell me... I don't know. Something, anything. To get over myself, or that I really do have condition x, whatever. But it's as though my wife is some kind of a social butterfly and I just can't wait to get away from people and back to my computer. I'm aware that it's a problem so I make it a point to go against it as much as I can tolerate, but even then I'm still just tolerating it. I don't like it, and I really don't want anything to do with it. Social situations, I mean. Other than with my little tight knit social circle.

        "original": "Hey ya'll. \n\nWas hoping anyone with any type of input could share. \n\nI've been struggling with intense cognitive brain fog for about a year now. Some other symptoms include:\n\n\\- Declining memory/recall\n\n\\- Lack of concentration...finding it tough to stay on certain tasks\n\n\\- Struggle to feel present in conversations\n\n\\- Lack of excitement...not enjoying things as I used to because of being afraid of how I'm going to feel.   \n  Not feeling present during these things..always in my own mind\n\n\\- Lack of comprehending/retaining things I've read\n\n\\- Lack of clarity\n\n\\- Lack of emotion\n\n**A little background:**\n\nI  accepted a job in Oct of 2018 & moved to Colorado in December of 2018 from the Midwest. Something I've always wanted to do and feel like I should be thriving because I finally accomplished it; but the brain fog and other symptoms make it nearly impossible to enjoy myself. I used to be one of the most outgoing people I knew & loved life, but I'm just not feeling myself anymore. Struggle to put myself into social settings because of being in my own mind thinking about how I'm feeling. Always analyzing myself.\n\nWork is going great...although the brain fog definitely impacts my ability at work. But overall the job is going well. I do stare at a computer screen nearly all day, but I did it quite often at my prior place of employment. & I'm making good money which allowed me to move out here. \n\nUsed to be a cannabis user, now it makes these symptoms 100x worse. Drinking alcohol makes it worse. Working out, which I do roughly 4 times a week, makes it worse. & all of these things stink because they were part of who I was/am.\n\nI got a primary care doc after moving out here. I've seen him 3 times now. At first he thought it was anxiety because of the move & also had a tragic family death right before moving out here. However, when I think back, these symptoms started in November of 2018; before the family tragedy & before moving out here, but after accepting the job. I pretty much just ignored them because of how stoked I was to be moving...but they are no long ignore-able & are impacting my daily life. \n\nAfter I told the doc I didn't feel like it was anxiety, he said it could be minor ADHD & prescribed me a super low dose of ritalin. Symptoms have still been there, if not worse. I definitely have symptoms of depression, but I cannot tell if the symptoms are a result of the brain fog/cognitive problems I am having or if they are causing them. It's like which came first...the chicken or the egg. I really have no reason to be depressed other than having these issues, which is the part that kills me. As I said, I'm finally doing something I've wanted to do my entire life. Have a great job with a lot of opportunity. Should be thriving...but these things are just limiting me in every aspect of my life.\n\nI eat healthy, workout, & am overall an intelligent individual. But these things are starting to make me feel like I'm not intelligent & have a lack of social skills, which is not my personality at all. I've always been outgoing & have LOVED meeting new people. But these things are dragging me down.\n\nI've got my first appointment with a counselor tomorrow...but I'm worried he will just assume I'm depressed & want to get me on depression meds. I'm not dead opposed, anything that will make this better, but I'm just afraid that's not the case & that its a cognitive issue. Thinking about seeing a neurologist.\n\nSorry for typing a book....I just was talking to my mother earlier today & she suggested making a post on here to see what input I get back. I'm super open minded and will seriously take any suggestions/considerations to heart. Willing to try anything and everything to get back to being myself; An outgoing, personable, excited, happy person.\n\nThanks, all.",

We had a great upbringing there and when i was 11 in 2007 I moved in with our dad and he stayed with the grandparents. \n\n while Josh was going through his therapy he moved in with me in my room. It was traumatic for me seeing my brother and best friends health declining so badly. He was fit, didn't smoke and was a complete health nut before. \n\nTo cut a long story short my relatives (not my dad) made out to me he was getting better and things were going to be okay. After his first tumour was removed a second tumour emerged my relatives told me it was just scar tissue (THEY KNEW IT WASNT) it turns out, they knew it was terminal cancer from DAY 1!\n\n Because I thought he was getting better, i bailed on him a few times, cancelled plans with him, we argued and fought real bad sometimes and I said some nasty things to him. He always had social problems, he got teased at school, struggled to get a girlfriend and had depression. I on the other hand had NONE of these problems at all. I got pissed off having to share my room with him eventually and he ended up going from my house, mum's house and Nan's house. He didn't even have a home. \n\nThey told me he was going to die 2 months before it happened.\n\nIf only they would have told me he was going to die earlier, these things never would have happened and the last part of his life would have been so much better. I'm now full of hate, and bitterness. I don't know how to deal with it. Even after 3 years I feel like crying ALL THE TIME. I have been diagnosed with  borderline personality disorder with schizotypal traits. My moods are all over the place. I am riddled with guilt. I hate my family now. All of them.\n\n I can't sleep without smoking weed, my performance at work is declining. I have 0 friends anymore apart from a top quality girlfriend. Most of the time i feel empty like a black void, I get pissed off and full of rage in a split second, I constantly lash out at people. I fantasize about suicide. (Not actually suicidal though) \nI'm never truley happy, I just put on an act for the sake of my dad and GF. My arms have scars on, my doors have holes in from being punched, my eyes are black, and i just hate everything and everyone. And I don't know what the fuck to do. \n\nI just feel so betrayed, I know they meant well by not telling me, but it has backfired real bad. I'm about to turn 24 in 3 weeks, and I have to live the rest of my life with this guilt.",

Move in day happened, but from that day my mom would not let go. She would constantly text. My father would walk around outside the dorm complex. My level of privacy was near zero. I couldn\u2019t go anywhere without them spying on me thanks to Find my iPhone. After about a month of this I gave in and left the dorm to live back at home. \n\nAcademically, my father seems to have a set path for me. I have limited role in choosing my courses even though I explain time and time again about expanding my knowledge in diverse fields. I have spoken to my mother about this, but she doesn\u2019t make any effort to convince him to change his ways. I explain I need to take the courses that will lead me to a good job/graduate program in my field. But to no avail. \n\nCurrently, I live at home and commute to school. Because roughly 95 percent of the students live on campus I have found it nearly impossible to find friends. When I mention to them the possibility of social plans they make excuses for me not to go. And, at this point my only social life consists of seeing extended family members on the weekends and attending class  for a couple hours each day. \n\nI do maintain friendships from high school, but as you all know, those friends get busy and can\u2019t be there to chat all the time.

        "original": "Edit: Apologies for the spelling mistakes - wrote this at work in quite a rush. \n\nHi everyone. \n\nI\u2019m new to the sub (form South Africa) and am posting to ask if I can have any advice on an issue that I am experiencing with my wife. It is getting so difficult to deal with because I don\u2019t understand what the issue is. If anyone could just point me in the right direction or give me any advice I would really appreciate it. \n\nMy wife (of 1 year - I am 25 and she is 23 soon) is the most loving, kind, selfless and amazing person I have ever known. However lately she snaps into what appears to be a different person - one who is unkind with her words, cruel towards me, self-deprecating and self-loathing, selfish and not herself. She has always been fairly shy since I\u2019ve known her and reserved in big groups, but with me she is open and her real self and I love her to bits. \n\nA bit of background - she grew up in a house with a verbally and sometimes physically abusive mother and a dad who travelled for months at a time. Her mom was overbearing and wouldn\u2019t let her do anything for herself. She would constantly take her phone in her teenage years and would snap at her for any normal teenage behavior that she deemed inappropriate. I believe her mother is bipolar, because she can also be the sweetest and kindest person but appears to have two different personalities for weeks at a time (I thought perhaps this is what my wife had too, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be the same at all). \n\nWhen my wife was 16, she went to a party with a friend and was raped by 3 guys. She has cut herself and self harmed on and off ever since. She had previously not been able to remember any of it but after a recent trauma that I experienced where I ended up in hospital on my deathbed, she now remembers everything about the rape vividly. We have spoken about it since and she has never told anyone about it save for me. Her mother suspected something at the time and took her to the gynecologist to examine her hymen (when I found this out I wanted to kill her mother) and because my wife was too scared to tell her what had happened, her mother punished her severely for sleeping around. \n\nI am not sure if it is her childhood that has caused her to be the way she is now or the trauma she faced at 16 that has now \u201cresurfaced\u201d that has caused this change in her, but it has gotten very bad since I was in hospital (about 3 months ago escalating until now). \n\nWhat happens is that out of the blue she will start acting strangely with me. She will be distant at first, but then she starts becoming a mean person. She will say ugly things about me or herself. She will cancel plans, make rash decisions or outright have fits of anger hitting walls and smashing things. \n\nI asked her about it today in a kind way and she said the following:\n\n\n\u201cI feel like i have something else inside me making decisions for me. And until that thing goes away by itself there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s so stupid when i say it out loud. I just feel useless and angry, like it brings out everything i hate about myself and everything i hate about other people. That\u2019s why when I say something ugly, i have no feeling while saying it. It doesn\u2019t affect me or I don\u2019t feel bad about it. I guess there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. It doesn\u2019t just fade. It just has a sudden stop. Then I\u2019m back to normal\u201d\n\n\u201cI get this rage in me, if i know people will notice hurt marks on me then i want to hit and break things around me. I\u2019ll even just hit the floor so it won\u2019t cause damage. I say ugly things to you. I cancel ok things in the moment because something about it makes me angry and that people don\u2019t deserve to have me around them and give my perfect personality everyone thinks I have. I feel lazy like it took all my energy for my brain to make me behave this way. I can\u2019t fall asleep because of it, and I can\u2019t wake up because of it\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery moment i wonder when it will happen again. But sometimes, when i am with you, when we keep busy and when we are away from everything. It doesn\u2019t even appear once. Do you know why i am this way? I feel really guilty and you don\u2019t deserve this. Please I want to get better\u201d\n\nMy heart breaks for her and it\u2019s taking a toll on our relationship.

This is my first \u201cbig girl\u201d job so I\u2019m pretty intimidated. I get a lot of advice from my mother who has a great corporate job, but I want to hear from others who are also dealing with health issues like myself and don\u2019t have as much authority in their position. \n\nI\u2019ve been seeing my therapist on and off for about a decade (currently every other Wednesday) and recently started seeing a psychiatrist once a month(usually on a Wednesday or Friday. ) In addition to those, I\u2019ve started seeking treatment for a chronic stomach condition that they believe to be gastoparesis. \n\nMy therapist has mentioned working around my schedule with me, so I\u2019m not so concerned about that. My psych office is closed on weekends and only open during the time I\u2019d be working, but I have to go to appointments or risk losing my prescriptions. I also need to prioritize gastro appointments because it\u2019s taken a massive toll on my physical and mental health, but again, usually closed on weekends. \n\nI\u2019m really worried about starting off on the wrong foot. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ridiculous to tell them about my already established appointments this month, but I don\u2019t want them thinking \u201cwhy did we hire this girl who constantly needs to go to the doctor?\u201d \n\nAnyone have experience with reconciling a normal full time day job and their responsibilities to their health?

Has anyone else done any of these to explore yourself? \n\nI will say this last year I have experienced the most growth I have experienced in my adult life and I'm 42 years old. It started with a trip to Peru and 7 ayahuasca ceremonies in March. I realized I needed to make some changes and boy have I started to make changes. Realising I had not been living an authentic life and tired of living the life I thought I was supposed to live was killing my soul.\n\nI wouldn't have thought how much these little things can way on your mental and emotional health so much. I thik eveyone knows alchahol can but I believe Porn has a bigger impact than we give it credit for.  So after I took the plunge and decided to quit and change careers, porn, booze, and masterbating and marijuana. Yup, shaking things up. Yes, I dable in occaisional psychedelics now and then. Usually a microdose (.15 grams or 15 mg) but will go deep now and then.\n\nWhat have I learned? I have learned that I have been numbing and ignoring my emotions and needs for years. I didn't feel as much joy as I do now but I have also learned that when you numb the positive emotions you also numb the negative ones. So I have also felt a lot more negative emotions during this time frame. I have openly embraced it though. With growth and change you will feel pain or at list discomfort.\n\nI have experienced better connection in my relationships. I'm single but I hve a lot of friends. I have found that I am able to connect with people on a bit of a deeper level. Maybe a more genuine level. Of course there are those people you no longer connect with because drinking was the bond but those are much less than I thought. \n\nEgo, I'm able to see more often when my \"ego\" is driving. I'm not apposed to the ego and I feel it has it purpose but I believe the ego should be in check. Most of the things the ego drives for will bring temporary happiness but it's just that, temporary.\n\nHealth, I have been pretty healthy but I think I have stepped it up a notch. I have been doing Crossfit 3-5 days a week for 8 years. I have now added a hot yoga practice 2-3 times a week and I try to meditate for 10 minutes a few times a week. These are both practices and I'm just working at getting better with them. I also have been doing acupuncture and counseling as well.\n\nIt is hard to say what has an ipact and what doesn't have an impact but I will say that I'm changing. There are still hard times and it's not a magic bullet. I have still experienced debilitating anxiety, grief, shame, loneliness, and a mixture of confusing feelings.

        "title": "Girlfriend has a few mental issues, and it's getting hard for me to help her or cope with things",
        "original": "First sorry if this gets really long I'm mostly just.... Venting idk. \n\nThis past November marked our 9th anniversary together and the last year (especially the last half of it) was really hard for us financially and in other ways. Through the years we have been through a lot including a time where some medications she was trying caused her to get really violently angry over the smallest things. I did get hit badly once during that time but once those meds were stopped nothing has escalated that far though we have had other fights. Just a bit of backstory that we have been through some shit.\n\nShe basically has no family either, her dad was the only supportive family member and he passed away 2 years ago. Her mother was abusive to her and her sister growing up... GF tried to reconnect with her mom after her dad's death but all her mom wanted was whatever she could get out of situation (mostly monetary gains)... And she just pretty much cut off contact when she didn't get anything she wanted (they had been divorced for years). Her sister had turned to drugs and random sex with random guys a long while back and never stopped despite their dad trying to help her. Even now she is wanted for drugs, theft and other things but no one knows where she is. Her uncle (dad's brother) offered to help during all the funeral stuff and selling her dad's things, dealing with lawyers etc because it was an unexpected death and we never found a will. GF was literally unable to deal with it and all her sister wanted was money, didn't give a shit about anything else (she didn't even go to the funeral). We figured out later that her uncle basically sold a lot of things for cash and didn't report it properly so he essentially stole a large amount of what should have been my GF's inheritance but there's no proof. He stayed in contact with her for part of the following year but then cut her off. Side note, I let him borrow an expensive digital camera for his family's vacation right after he \"helped\" with all of that stuff when we still believed he'd done it all correctly and nicely. I never got my camera back.\n\nSo. Suffice to say I'm really her only/main emotional support at this point. She has a boyfriend as well (yes we have a poly relationship, she asked if I was OK with this before getting involved with him). He and I are friends so it kind of like we \"share\" GF with full consent all around. But he lives in another state and can't visit often so at times he doesn't understand her as well as I do. He also hasn't been in the relationship as long and there was a period of time where they broke up but later got back together again (there are still some tensions from that time).\n\nOne way my GF tends to cope is sort of 'retail therapy' but with her it is with pets a good bit of the time. She'll get enamored of a type of pet/animal and be super focused on that for a while but then get overwhelmed and stop helping to take care of it as much/at all. Which is really frustrating because then taking care of it falls on me. We have honestly too many dogs at this point, along with a few reptiles, a conure, a cockatiel, and (the latest obsession) poultry. This includes chickens mostly but also turkeys and geese. We live in a suburban area but far enough outside the city that poultry IS allowed here but only a certain amount. We are now way over that amount. We also live in fear of animal control being called because of the animals. Though we could put some poultry outside and legally it would be ok she refuses to do so, saying our neighbors would just come and steal them etc.... So everything is in the house (which is a small 2 bedroom that's falling apart because landlords don't care about it).\n\nWe've been trying to plan to move somewhere with land asap (so we won't have close neighbors and can have most of the animals outside or at least in a separate building like a barn or shed with AC and heat) but that was supposed to be last year and it got messed up then. Now it's supposed to be this year but who knows.\n\nShe's also been wanting to go to EDC which is planned for this year but we failed to realize this is the 10 year anniversary so.... We didn't pre order tickets yet and now most of them are sold out. We don't have the cash on hand to afford the 3rd party seller tickets at $600 per ticket. And tax returns coming soon were/are SUPPOSED to be used to help us finally move out.\n\nLast night her BF really screwed up without realizing it. For some reason GF started talking about wanting to get a new dog - a Chihuahua. She wants to get this dog apparently to 'start over' and have a dog she can 'do things with' such as go to the dog parks, walks, etc. I left to get dinner and when I came back BF was on the phone and they were talking about this. We really do not need another dog right now, as I said we already have too many... I am the only one seriously taking care of them and a few have their own issues too on top of things. BF was saying no to her asking if she can get another dog etc. I agreed, no, it's not something we should do right now.\n\nSorry one other backstory. BF actually has a dog that we had gotten a while ago but we didn't really have time to give the dog all the attention/exercise/etc she needed and he wanted to take her rather than have us rehome her to someone random. She's a Shetland sheepdog named Frisk.\n\nSo eventually BF starts saying if my GF wants to spend time 'doing things' with a dog why not do stuff with one or more of the ones we have? Which is a fair point and one I kind of agree with but the way he was saying it was NOT the best way (not even a good way) to present it to GF. He was even comparing how Frisk is now that she's with him vs when she was here - not in a mean way but trying to point out that even a dog that might be difficult to train can come around with work.\n\nBut like I said bad idea. I had no way to tell him to stop without possibly making it worse so I resign myself to later damage control. GF took his remarks as saying that she's a failure to the dogs (despite a lot of their issues not being our fault, since most were rescues and just don't do super well with other dogs and/or people). Took him talking about Frisk as bragging, and mocking her because she wasn't able to do the same level of interaction and training etc. Basically taking everything in the worst possible light.\n\nSo since then (last night) sje basically didn't sleep... Has been really depressed, even saying she'd just get rid of every animal we have...\n\nAnd I.... I'm tired. I don't know how to handle this anymore or what to do. I know the root problem and cause is not about getting a new dog or not but she won't tell me what exactly brought that on. And now is just completely focused on it when I know it's a bad idea and will just be the same as before where eventually the dog will just get shoved to the wayside for the next new thing. I'd be willing to try... Maybe hope it would be different and work out but now she's beating herself up for even the idea of it.\n\nSays its stupid, how dare she want something nice, she is so selfish and a failure etc etc. She said she would be willing to rehome 1 or 2 of the current dogs (to have more time etc for a new dog) but is convinced that if we did so they would be put down (not true, the 2 she was talking about would honestly be fine they're not bad dogs at all).... And one of the 2 is a dog the BF has said he really likes... So GF also said if we rehome that dog she is SURE the BF will break up with her over it. Which I'm 98%-100% sure would not happen. But she's convinced herself that it would. \n\nSo she's backed herself into a corner more or less of her own making and I don't know how to help...",

So if anyone could help point me in the right direction here -- and it's not as simple as \"take him to a Doctor\" as he refuses to go. But what sort of mental health illness does this all sound like?\n\nSo first, this whole thing has been going on ever since he left school in 2004. My brother is 31 years old, he still lives with my mum, he hardly ever leaves his bedroom (only to go shopping with my nan) and he never really speaks and when he does it's very quiet. He has no friends -- at all, and hasnt since leaving school, and h never really did in school. He's never had a girlfriend, or partner ever. The only time that he seems happy is when Christmas time comes, or Halloween where he decorates our front garden with the most spectacular display. Parents bring their children from all across the town just to trick or treat at Mums house, and he will spend so much money on decorations (i mean upwards of a thousand pound) each year to put on a different display. Then him, my mum, sister and nieces and nephews will all dress up and hand out sweets to the trick or treaters. Truly, he has the kindest heart of anyone I know. I think he loves Halloween and the tradition of it because he seems fascinated by American culture, and the big displays that Americans put on during the holidays\n\nHe is obsessed with cleanliness, his bedroom is pretty much empty. He has a bed, and then boxes of washing up powder for when he cleans his clothes, and general cleaning products to keep germs and dust etc. out of his room.\n\nHe has this beanie hat, and he wears it [every.single.day](https://every.single.day). And has done for the last 12 years. He never takes it off, people have tried to buy him new ones but he isnt interested, he just wants this old dirty beanie. When he has a shower he will take it in with him and wash it in the sink. Though my grandad told me he will keep it on in the shower, I'm unsure how true that last part is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother is the kindest soul you will ever meet, ut no one can seem to help him.

        "original": "Hello there kind Redditors!\n\nI come to you because I need to get something off my chest and nether know how to talk about this, nor how to explain this in rl. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPls let me introduce myself:   \nI'm a 19 year old male from Europe with now particular interests beside my friends and somewhat music.   \nI've been in therapy for depression for a short time during a relationship crisis, but finished it after about 4 months in late spring last year. I broke up by now and am therefor single.   \nI'm currently supposed to study informatics and mathematics at a local university and still live with my parents.   \nI use drugs from time to time, to be precise alcohol, caffeine and cannabis but rarely in high dosages.   \nI used to sing in a boys choir for ten years and still sing in a choir at my university.   \nI think I'm at least somewhat intelligent, since I managed to finish school without problems even tho I struggled to attend regularly and managed to score high on IQ-test through out my live (I know that this is a strongly debated topic and nothing I should be too proud of).   \nI have a best friend I absolutely love, so I'm not really alone. I normally enjoy being for myself more than being in a big group. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy problems: \n\nI start to get more and more paranoid more often when I used to. By know I feel uneasy multiple times per week. I get this feeling that I can sense the presence of someone/something. That goes as far that I had to scream at my open door, \"Let me alone!\" recently (I was alone in the house at the time), while I almost cried. It's not that intense every time but still very unpleasant.   \n\n\nSadly that isn't everything. I start to see more and more \"things\". I'm used to thinking that shadows move for a long time already, but by now such phenomena spread more through my daily life. I misinterpret a lot of things at first sight, especially in the dark.   \nTrees become man walking by. A bush is a squating creature. A road sign a clown. I'm aware that what I see isn't real and I'm not always scared by them, but it is always very unsettling/hard to see it. Such experiences just make me nervous in a very unpleasant way.   \nFurther more I already have a few creatures I encounter more often. Those I can't see but \"feel\". I think they are a concept in my head that I can \"feel\" in a very realistic way.   \nTwo clown creatures, of wich one is somewhere in the dark places of my room while I'm lying in my bed and one is lurking behind the display of my laptop, also when I'm lying in my bed.   \nAnother one is a tall men with long claws standing behind me when I'm in the dark corridor of the first floor of our house.   \nAgain: I'm aware that those creatures only exist in my head, but they actually scare me more and more. I can handle the clowns and I once even had the feeling that one of them was watching over me, well meaning, while I was still half asleep in my bed and had my back towards him.   \nThe tall men always scares me, even though I know he isn't really there.   \n\n\nAdditionally I often feel very disconnected from my own live. It's hard to identify with it. It feels like I'm watching myself existing most of the time, without actually having influence on what I'm doing. I feel detached from my emotions and sometimes have trouble to even identify how I'm feeling at the moment.   \nWeirdly enough tho that isn't always the case.  \nIf I don't feel that way I'm either emotionless and only feel like I have an empty void inside me or feel very exited.   \n\n\nI also have suicidal thoughts on a daily basis, but that feels normal by now, since I experience these for years and manage not to act on them. I only selfharm from time to time.   \nI don't now why I started this habit and I mostly do that in episodes with breaks in between.   \nIt feels somewhat relaxing and good?   \nOften when I have consumed alcohol the urge to selfharm gets a whole lot stronger and I started my latest episode after I was drunk in the beginning of December.   \n\n\nStrangely my symptoms don't get worse when I'm high on cannabis... I know that there is a possibility that my usage has pushes those experiences forward, but while I'm under the influence I feel like I'm actually myself and free from those experiences. I'm just high, happy and often almost trippy.   \nDon't worry tho. I already started to heavily limit my usage since I'm aware that I probably shouldn't consume this drug at the moment. Therefore I also think that this plant isn't a suitable medicine for me.   \n\n\nLastly I lose my drive more and more. It's hard to get up in the morning, sometimes I can't even move my body for a long time. I'm often exhausted and I rarely manage to attend my classes. I feel fightend from entering the different buildings of my university and can't concentrate on the lecture.

I was spiraling down through the years\n\nMy dad believes because of the undiagnosed ADD/ADHD\n\nI was so depressed that I would not do my homework at all so my grades plummeted.\n\nSo I go to a new therapist and I get put onto antidepressants and about a few months in I feel better, but still having a hard time concentrating, etc.\n\nSo my parents bring up ADD/ADHD and we do the tests. My parents do one, I do one, and my french teacher does one, come back as (once again) extremely high chance (basically it\u2019s not something that is 100% you have it, but basically still saying that something is wrong on a high level)\n\nMy therapist says that the test says that I have ADD and to talk to the psychiatrist \n\nWhen talking to him he asks the same question \n\n\u201cHow are your grades?\u201d\n\nWell since I\u2019m failing most of my classes, I get to say I have ADD(which some a**holes are saying therapists are over diagnosing and that it\u2019s not a real thing????)\n\nAnyway, after I turned 18 last year I needed a new therapist. My old one said that I didn\u2019t really need therapy so I haven\u2019t actually been there in a while.\n\nWell I haven\u2019t been feeling horrible, but not good either. It\u2019s really hard to explain, but part of me feels like I should get an therapist for adults(since I need too)\n\nI found one that seems really nice and I\u2019m hoping that it works well, since no offense to the last one... I haven\u2019t felt like I really really clicked with her(she was great and really helped me, but now I definitely believe I need another one)\n\nSo one thing that majorly sucks is that to schedule an appointment I need to make a phone call.

        "original": "Tl;dr...as someone who needs physical/emotional comfort and closeness when I'm depressed, stressed, overwhelmed, etc, it's hard for me to understand people who need the opposite.\n\nI know this is long, thank you for reading. This may at first seem like a relationship issue or polyamory issue, but the crux of my question is as stated in the title. \n\nMy situation: I'm in an open relationship with my boyfriend of 5.5 years. That's solid. My question is regarding another person I've been seeing for 10 months. Our relationship is both friendly, we spend time doing plenty outside the bedroom, and intensely physical, with some BDSM elements and exploring things outside societal norms. Please don't weigh in on my personal life and relationship choices. That's not what this is about. \n\nSo anyway, I've been seeing this guy for 10 months. We have become good friends and have an intense physical and intellectual connection. We see each other every 3-4 weekends. After spending a wonderful weekend together, we were texting one night when I began mentioning some emotional stuff, like how it takes me some time to come down from the high of the physical intensity of our time together. I didnt expect the response I got. At all. He said he worries he can't give me the time I need/want/deserve. He said that lately he has felt increasingly overcommitted and stretched too thin. \n\nNow, I could go into all the things that may have incorrectly lead to him feeling like that but the important details are he is a grad student (in clinical psychology of all things) and recently began a new job as a therapist. He also just does a lot, volunteering, marathons, etc. I know how stressful grad school is, and I'm equally overcommitted even now, as the director of a nonprofit, member of several boards of directors, volunteering, and so on. But for me, when I'm overwhelmed I need that connection, both physical and emotional, but I get that some people don't. We have talked at length about our struggles with depression, anxiety, and for me, past abuse. So those things are fully in the open between us.\n\nSo at the end of our conversation I suggested that after a little time and space, we talk again about things. He said that sounds good. In the time we have known each other there was another time he kind of pulled away (though we didnt take \"time off\") and things went back to normal and his grandmother died unexpectedly and somewhat tragically, after which we went 2-3 weeks with little contact because he needed space. So I can confirm this is really how he responds to stress. I asked if it's ok if I text him at all and he said I could, but his responses may not be as timely because he is going to try to disconnect from his phone more. \n\nI hope that he reaches out to me, but if he doesnt, does it seem reasonable for me to text him in a couple weeks? Say, after a wedding I know he's attending or to ask how classes are going? \n\nTl;dr again...For people who need space and not comfort and attention, can you explain how it helps you to NOT hear from people that care about you?",

The problem in high school was me, I didn't know how to treat a girlfriend and i treated her like i would treat my guy friends but after that relationship. I was super hung up for her for years and i could not get over her. (I wont go into too much detail about this if you want to know more ill tell you). Fast forward 3-ish years, me and her had a very dramatic get back together I wasn't in very good standing, I was very lost and had alot of mental insecurities. The weeks leading to us getting back together were of me constantly talking about her and what not. she was was dating another man but she begun to fall in love with me again as she felt I had changed. once we got back together i realized i needed to get my life in order as i was afraid of loosing her again. so i got to work getting back into college, deciding a major, choosing a career goal, and even getting an internship. its not important what i was doing before but basically i went from nothing to entrepreneur. As our relationship went on we had a few battles over other topics but its basically been growing to where she tells me she feels like nothing to me. i have tried anything. im always clingy to her. i buy her things, i take her on walks almost every night, i take her out on amazing dates almost every week but it seems like i cant get through to her her own self worth. normally if i do this to a girl the exact opposite happens, the girl usually feels too good for me and leaves. I have realized, I talk alot about journeys I've gone on or past experiences which i realized recently. i'm trying to plan dates even vacations together. but i feel like it just makes her feel worse. What do i do i have been obsessed with this girl since junior year hs (4-5 years ago) and i feel like our relationship is slowly deteriorating because of this but we both want to be together.\n\nabout her-she is 18, about to get her associates in college, and absolutely beautiful. but the problem is her parents are Asian helicopter parents. Her mom served in the gulf war and her dad also. her mom is the biggest problem she has extreme bi-polar and cant fall asleep unless she is at home. so because of that she makes her have a bedtime. her mom is a pretty mean person and does belittle her ALOT. From my perspective she doesn't want to allow her to grow up for example wont help her get a drivers licence, do things on her own, even let her do her own laundry. her dads a nice guy hes not important. she was extremely pushed through schooling hence 18 and has associates.\n\nabout me- I'm 20 and i drifted after highschool unsure of what to do i eventually thought. I could get away by talking a working holiday to Australia for awhile after that caved in i came back and didn't know what to do next until we got back together and now i have my life so in order i have a schedule for every second of the day. i feel great my mental health is almost perfect and every insecurity i had is gone. I traveled ALOT between ages 18-20 but i'm behind in school (half way through my associates).\n\nI don't know what to do i keep trying to tell her i'm the one that's obsessed over her but its not working.

Some believe the name is to holy to speak and instead say HaShem, Adonai, or Elohim. I like El Shaddai. \nSome people pronounce it Jehovah, some people just say Jah. \nI pronounce my name YHWH Christos Elohim. It is important to me for reasons that are my own. It is important to others as well.

I carried on this way for awhile and noticed it was beginning to affect various portions of my life, so I stopped. I still had symptoms sober however much lighter.

It spoke to me and told me to cut off my finger or it would hurt my family. I curled up in fear on my couch yelling at my cat for maybe an hour, and then the feelings subsided and I realized it wasn't real. So, I quit smoking marijuana. Now I hear voices occasionally sober mostly internal garbled that gets lost or I ignore and sometimes it's external and those always freak me out. Haven't had any crazy visuals sober, just basic distortions similar to what I assume someone with vertigo will see.

        "original": "Hello guys!\n\nIt is my (F 23) first time talking about my own mental health with anyone, so I do not know where to start exactly.\n\nA few friends of mine suffer from diagnosed mental health issues, so\u00a0does my younger sister. That means I'm not completely new to\u00a0the topic.\n\nFor about two years now I know I probably should get help, or at least talk to someone, but it is so hard to describe what is even going on with me. I don't know if I really need help. Even thinking of feeling bad makes me feel guilty because others have endured worse. Does that even makes sense?\n\nMy sister, she is ten years younger than me, attempted suicide December 2018, since then everything is even worse, she is doing better with each passing day (I'm so proud of her) but since then I'm even more afraid and feel guilty somehow. We were never really close though.  \n\n\nI'm tired and exhausted all the time. Mentally and emotionally. Everything feels kind of dull?\n\nI'm still able to do what needs to be done, studying (I'll graduate\u00a0this year from university) and going to work. Maybe that is why it took me so long to talk to someone. You are okay, as long as you show up every day, aren't you?\u00a0\n\nBut well, that's it. Simple tasks like household are draining, don't to mention meeting friends. Meeting and interacting with other people is honestly the worst. I just don't have the energy to interact and stay focused long enough. I caught me even avoiding eye contact with people I don't know well. Don't want them to think I'm rude...\n\nSometimes there are phases in which I have a lot of energy and really get stuff done (usually when I have a structured timetable to do so) and feel good doing so but most of the time I'm just not and ultimately feel overwhelmed by what many tasks I have left to get done.\n\nAs most activities and feelings are draining I try to focus on things I either have to do no matter what (like going to university or work) or which keep me going but cost not a lot energy, like painting and being with my partner and our cats. But even then I just feel like I'm only giving 20 % of which I could give, at work or university for example, what really bothers me as I have so many goals I'd like to reach.  \n\n\n**TL;DR: Well, I just want to know what is wrong with me. If anything is\u00a0wrong\u00a0with me at all... Where did you guys start to seek help? And how did you fight your fears to even start to seek help? That is the hardest part I guess.**\n\nSorry for my wonky english by the way, I'm not a native english speaker.\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance and sorry for the long text!",

        "original": "I was once in the same position as you most likely are, reading this and thinking that you are one person who is eternally doomed and things won't actually get better for you.\n\nSkip to the bottom if you want coping mechanisms and advice, they aren't generic 'just exercise' types.\n\n**My hell time:**\n\nI have suffered from sexual, physical and verbal abuse along with bullying. I have ADD, borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety and severe dissociation (due to BPD). These issues completely ruined my academics (something that has always been my priority) and my relationships. My self harm got increasingly worse and I tried killing myself multiple times (luckily I backed out right at the last moment). I even secretly tried killing myself in my own fucking school (and was caught and that event traumatises me). I have been betrayed by the two I got attached to and actually let in. I found out that my ex emotionally cheated on me. In retrospect I think he genuinely has NPD. He emotionally abused me and made my mental health a thousand times worse. In a moment of weakness (my fault), I cheated on him. I confessed and he manipulated me and used me for fucking and emotional support after that because he wanted to 'make things work' and then insult the life out of me when he wasn't horny or sad. I can't explain the horrible ways he hurt me and lied to me (even before the cheating). I would cut myself while on call with him because he would be so inconsiderate about my emotions and just so so so condescending (in the subtlest ways possible). He gaslit me 24/7. My boyfriend before that treated me like absolute shit too and pressured me sexually and just so many things I'm too tired to list. And my past and even present consists of sexual assault etc. I have suicide notes stacked up in case I want to die. My best friend (who I sacrificed more things than you can imagine for) left me the minute she got a boyfriend because I was a burden. And just all my past trauma and mental illnesses couldn't handle all this. On top of that as an (ex) overachiever, unable to cope academically (as things got harder and I got sadder, I couldn't work at all - I couldn't work before also but i was less depressed etc. - I learnt I have ADD now) which made me even worse. My dreams got crushed and everyone left me and i was anyway in an awful state and I don't even have the guts to mention my most traumatic experiences here. i was genuinely banking on psychiatric euthanasia in Netherlands in a few years and my thighs have the deepest scars. I did so many impulsive things to try and fill my void and made my life a hundred times worse. I have had BPD and ADD and mild depression my entire life, but since 2018 it really really intensified. With college apps coming up and being an IB student so like extra pressure, I really didn't think I would make it alive. I saw 8 psychiatrists/therapists in just this past year and no matter how much I tried, nothing worked and I was convinced I was doomed. I had to leave a course I attended mid way because my mental health couldn't handle it. My dissociation got so bad it inhibited my functioning to a whole new level. I couldn't process sentences I was reading, even during my most critical exams. All the friends I made slowly left me for multiple reasons (sometimes I screwed it up because I am so bad at relationships). Aware of my addictive tendencies, I never touched alcohol in my life. This year, I was so sad that I drank and developed major alcohol dependency. Even now, when I'm low I try drinking in secret. I have tried to overdose (nothing really happened fortunately). I have severe dependency to some of my medication and it's not healthy at all. I was close to my seniors (the only place where i felt like I belonged), but they all went to universities abroad (IVIES). Assuming I'm still the 'smart girl', it is so painful to explain to them that i am going to some meh college most probably. I have let so many people down and my family is suffering so so so much because of me. People consider me to be this 'pretty, smart and great personality' but who is delusion-ed due to her mental illness. I feel undermined because of this because they think I have everything and no right to complain. While I understand that, why is everything so shitty for me? Why am I alone and barely passing? I even lost sense of my 'fun quirky whatever' personality, I couldn't talk about anything but depression and loneliness. Things were absolute hell for me. But no matter what, and despite trying to take my life multiple times, I never completely gave up, like I did about everything, but I continued my search for doctors, despite it being absolutely hopeless. i was scammed twice in fact. My family undermined and treated my illness as a joke for the longest time, same for my teachers. But again, I never completely gave up. And trust me, it really paid off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The effort and progress:**\n\nAfter finally finding a psychiatrist and therapist that felt right, I continuously went to them. it was so sos os o hard, in fact i avoided going to them as much as I could. I didn't want help, I was used to being miserable. But over time, it got easier to go to them. It took a while for them to pick up on my BPD, I myself didn't know I had it, but it explained a lot. After months, they finally found the right medication for me (not completely, but mood stabilizers really changed my life). Then they found stuff to suit my dissociation etc. My therapist helped me too, it was subconscious, but it worked. After years of effort, I finally began feeling better. In fact, I am perhaps the loneliest right now and have more work load than I ever did before. I am seeing people get into all my dream universities. I am seeing everyone that betrayed me doing much better than me in life. I never thought that I could feel better with these circumstances, especially since I couldn't handle myself during easier times. It is a shock, I didn't even think I would make it alive. I feel independent and strong. Nothing worked out for me, nothing. But I am doing what I can with what I have you know? I finally have the energy to put in the effort. I don't cut myself (as much) anymore and am less dependent on substances. Genuinely, everything is hell right now, but fuck I feel good (most of the times). Yes, I still have crying spells and breakdowns, especially at night when I'm alone, but I  cope with it much better now. I don't let my mental health dictate how much work I do, in fact my work improves my mental health. Of course, I have fall backs, but everything is much better. When my razors were confiscated, I banged on my mirror to break it and cut myself. I don't do that anymore. I am able to fall in love with learning again, bit by bit. I never ever ever thought i would reach this point. Ever. I felt so jealous and irritated by success stories because they felt like bullshit and I never thought I could ever ever ever write one. But now, I feel the urge to, because now I don't have good moments that fade away and I feel like shit in thirty seconds. I actually feel better overall. I understand if this doesn't give you hope, but i promise you, it gets better. Like genuinely, it does. My life is objectively more hell than it was before, but I am still doing better. I really hope that someone feels some hope through this, anyone.\n\n**Preachy:**\n\nI have learnt and grown so much, I had the shittiest preadolescence and well life. People feel confused about how I am still alive with everything I went through. I haven't even shared everything here or to them. So please understand, it can get better. I don't mean to say that I had it worst because that isn't true. But I really felt like I did and felt like there was no way out and tried to get out of this life etc etc And here i am. I just wish I could convince people who are still going through hell that it actually gets better. I understand how you feel, but keep going. I would love to tell you guys some of my coping mechanisms that might actually help.\n\n**Advice:**\n\n\\- If you're at rock bottom, give up on everything if you can't handle it, but don't give up on finding psychiatric help or therapy. Literally, ditch studies, friends, jobs, everything, but find whatever way you can to get help. I can't say don't self harm or 'exercise' because that stuff is hard. I can't say reach out to friends or fake it till you make it or try to work no matter what it will help. I understand that stuff is impossible, even fucking waking up each morning is. But just fight for one thing. One thing. Help. And if your gut feels wrong about the help you are receiving give it just a little bit of time because sometimes you can be wrong, but after that certain amount of time bounce and KEEP LOOKING. No matter what, keep looking. If you have money restrictions or anything, use online help or helplines or find some lowkey way to get help. ANYTHING. Just find a way. There always is one. Contact me if needed. Don't waste energy on anything but getting help. Please.\n\n\\- Identify your weird tendencies and habits. Everyone has a few random things that distract them or sort of help them. I obsessively make playlists. I feel much better when I am cleaning my room. Watching TV shows that i have seen before really help me. Sometimes, I want to clean my room but don't have the energy to and being alone with my thoughts terrifies me. So I watch television while cleaning it up to kind of stay distracted and when my room is clean i feel somewhat accomplished and my head feels clear. Another thing that works for me is putting on makeup. It takes a lot of energy for me. But when I start it really helps. Looking good makes you feel good yk.\n\n**To get up in the morning:**\n\n\\- So hopefully you find some random tendency. Even something you used to like. Even lighting a candle or ordering something from Amazon or listening to one song counts. Anything. Writing poems. So make chits with all these little things. Mini steps. Reading a chapter of a book or making a mug cake for yourself that takes 15 minutes. If looking good helps you but you don't have energy, keep makeup removing products right next to you and cleanse your face when you get up so you don't really wash your face and you get up and put on your makeup.\n\nNow all these tendencies you have, and things that you may not normally do but could maybe enjoy (for me it's making a mug cake), make chits for all of them. Put them in a box or jar and when you can't get up in the morning because life sucks, pick one out and trust me, if it is a small task you will have the energy to do it. Trust me. Use this box during depression episodes also.\n\nBecause my self harm addiction was so bad, I knew that I would ditch these chits and instead jump to the razor. I decided to add a chit for self harm in my box so that i know I have the option and am less likely to just harm myself. Trust me, this works. And over time your brain gets conditioned to do one of these stupid distraction thingies when you are upset. It is a slow process but very very very worth it.\n\n**If you can't deal with your thoughts and don't have the energy to work (especially at night):**\n\n\\- AUDIOBOOKS. I often can't get myself to read or even watch TV and open my eyes, but silence and even music make me sad. I listen to audiobooks as I try to sleep so I am somewhat distracted but am also relaxing and will be able to sleep. Melatonin pills etc. may also genuinely help.\n\n\\- When I am really sad I have this notebook, I doodle my emotions on it. Like I will draw myself at the edge of a cliff and all the things that haunt me would be written on the cliff, pushing me. It is stupid but it helps.\n\n**FIND YOUR SAFE PLACE**\n\nI feel safe at this specific cafe near my house and this corner in my room. I don't know why, but it just helps me.\n\n**Remember oddly specific and very very tiny accomplishments (or big ones) and compliments you have received**\n\nMaybe pen them down or list them somewhere. When you are in a less awful mood, you can remember random SPECIFIC compliments you have received or unexpected accomplishments you have achieved (it could be the stupidest thing). Make them as specific as you can so it is harder to discredit the good things. When you are hating yourself or feel completely demotivated or are stressed, go over these. They genuinely can help.\n\n**Give yourself time, and give up sometimes. It is OK. I understand. But remember to not compromise with HUGE deadlines etc. But otherwise, give up sometimes. Let yourself mourn. But again, not always.**\n\n**I am sorry if this didn't help much. But I am always here for everyone. Love you all. <3 It gets better.**\n\nAlso, a really hard thing to accept is that when you self sabotage, it is on you. Yes mental illness sucks and you can't really control it, but you need to accept that it is on you and you need to work on it instead of blaming everything on it.",

        "original": " trigger warning to victims of childhood sexual abuse &  suicide. This is going to be a sort of long post. \nWay back into my childhood, I became a victim of sexual abuse by someone I was supposed to trust dearly. My grandfather. It went on for 6 years, my family ran an at home daycare. News broke about this as he was doing the same to children in the daycare, one child told her mother, she then called the police, my grandfather saw the police pull up, the proceeded to go into the house, and take his life. Throughout the abuse he always told me if I told anyone, he would do it. He always said he\u2019d rather be gone than have to deal with what the people in jail would do to him. And how if I told someone, the family would blame me for causing his death. Shortly after his passing, is when my mother asked me if it was true. Which I then told her, because at that point as a child I felt as though I couldn\u2019t hurt anyone if he was already gone. My fathers side of the family (it was my paternal grandfather) then talked on the local news about it. Stating he was a kind man, would never do such a thing, etc. to this day, I am 21. That side of the family believes i was lying to get attention. Even though I wasn\u2019t even the one to come forward in the beginning because of the manipulation. Even my father suspected I was doing it for the attention. It effected my mother the most, she had already struggled with depression and suicidal tendencies. The rest of the years growing up... I went to therapy rarely. Didn\u2019t get the help I needed, watched my mother beaten, verbally abused, and cheated on by my step father. She tried to commit suicide more times than I could count, she overdosed twice on prescription pain killers. Held a knife to her throat while my step father held her down, and told my sibling and I to come watch in hopes my mom would calm down. \nShe then was committed to the hospital 3 times. She had seen 4 different psychiatrists and was finally diagnosed with obvious depression, PTSD (from MY situation), BPD, Bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety, the list goes on. I hold a bit of hate in my heart for never being evaluated. \nFlash forward to a month ago. My life was good, I was managing my mental health with no prescriptions (I\u2019ve never been to a psychiatrist). One day, I was at my wits end. I came home, and my step father immediately copped an attitude with me. To which I left the room and took my 2 yearold with me. I continued mumbling under my breath, and bitched. He went into my moms room, started slamming doors, and my mom busted in my room asking me why I was being such a bitch. One thing led to another, I pushed my step father away from me because he was screaming in my face, and was terrifying my daughter. He then proceeded to grab me, and throw me into the wall. I hit my daughter on the way down. Once I realized i had hit my child, I had tunnel vision. I went full force, I was punching him, he grabbed me again, slammed me as hard as he could on the tile floor in the hallway, I\u2019m 140 pounds, and my tailbone shattered a square tile. He held me down, and choked me until I couldn\u2019t breathe. My mother sat there and didn\u2019t say a word the entire time. I ended up scratching at his eyes in order for him to get off of me. I got up, disoriented, and told him he was lucky my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t there (he\u2019s a truck driver) and I told him he\u2019s lucky I didn\u2019t call the police. To which he did, the police showed up, I was calm at that point. I ended up getting arrested, me, because the police deemed me being the aggressor. I\u2019m now being ordered by the court to get a mental health evaluation. CPS, got involved. They have closed it, realizing I\u2019m not a piece of shit mother. \nI struggle with BPD tendencies, obvious depression, and anxiety. I\u2019m nervous about this evaluation. I really am. Can I bring up the fact that this is the shit I\u2019ve been through? Plus mention my mothers diagnosed disorders? Can I tell them I believe I have BPD? What happens in a mental health eval? \nI\u2019m so sorry for the long post. I\u2019ve never written it all out. This isn\u2019t even half of what I\u2019ve been through and I\u2019m literally in tears as I write this.\nThank you, everyone for adding and/or giving me advice/input.",

        "original": "The last few months have been nothing but hell. I'm stuck someplace where literally every thing is my fault, I'm pretty sure my fiance hates me, I work a shit job, I can't do anything without being questioned or told off. Any ideas I come up with are ridiculed and made fun of. I'm not sure how much more I can take.\n\nBack story: a few months back, November I think, my fiance and I lost our apartment due to a meth head saying bullshit that never happened, and we moved in with her parents. I'm grateful that they allowed us to do that, especially considering my fiance is pregnant. But her mother truly despises me, and for good reason, so I don't blame her for that. I've tried to be respectful and do has I am asked here, but it really doesn't matter due to the hate they have for me. I'd rather not get into it, but I should. Six years ago, when my fiance and I lived together in the city, I had severe anger control issues. Like bad. To the point of abusive towards her. So I get the hate, and do deserve it. But it's gone too far. Since we've been here my fiance and I's relationship is beyond strained. Alot of it is hormones, but there's quite a bit that is her mom getting in her head to go against me. At this point I'm not even sure she loves me anymore...that alone makes me suicidal. I'm already diagnosed has bipolar, but who the hell knows? I've been misdiagnosed before a few times.\n\nI'm not sure how to continue pushing through this hell. I've bitched and ranted about this situation before, but of course people just basically called me whiny and that I'm just ungrateful. You try living in a house where everyone fucking hates you. Try it and then tell me you want to continue living. Try and always be wrong, even when your right. Try and breathe and just be content when no matter what, your the blame. You try it. And then when you try to talk, be cut off and told that your issues aren't valid and your just being a baby. Try not to eat a bullet after two straight months of being completely broken down. \n\nI have nothing for support in the city I live in. I moved here to be with my family, but now my family doesn't want me. I can't stop thinking about just ending it all. Maybe they would be better off without me. I know I need help. And I know if I don't get it, I won't be able to avoid the one horrible option that keeps coming. I have appointments next week with my psychiatrist and my therapist. But I don't even think at this point that will help. I keep feeling like nothing will. \n\nI'm unhealthy. My brain is fried. I'm depressed and spiraling deeper into the depths. And not one person gives a damn about it. If I died, they'd all be happier. Everyone would. Because I'm awful. I'm a fucking monster. And monsters don't need to be saved. They can't be. Apparently we can't change. And everybody just knows what's best. And fuck it seems viable. Everybody knows everything. Except for the monster.\n\nSorry.",

By like all standards my life is going tremendous: my family is upper-middle class, I'm in a loving family situation, I (easily) have a 4.0 GPA at an honors high school and got 1580+ SAT recently, my social life is pretty dec., I just finished a pretty decent relationship that made me happy but I'm happy I'm done with, and I am super passionate about my extra-curriculars, etc. etc.. I think I look like a really happy, carefree dude to other people. Not trying to humblebrag or some shit, but just trying to get the point across I have nothing rational to be upset about.\n\nAnyways, I am still active in life, and that's kinda my outlet. Whenever I'm doing anything (legit fucking anything) I'm super happy, playing sports, doing homework or even in class etc I'm fine. Sometimes I'll just fucking crash for like 7 hours and not be able to do anything after school, but usually I'm pretty good.\n\nBut anyways, when I'm not \\*doing\\* anything actively (which is pretty rare for me; I'm a busy guy) I'm super super depressed. I really really hate life and frankly want it to be over immediately. I really want to just fucking sleep for 50 years. This is a pretty constant feeling, I haven't had a day without hating life in my downtime for over a year. Blasting music into my head is pretty much the only thing that keeps me sane.\n\nAlso, I've never self harmed or seriously considered suicide, although I would just love to feel nothing in death.\n\nAny of y'all experience this?

        "original": "I met this girl (24) at school about 6 weeks ago. She is very intelligent and organized, with a 3.85 GPA. She's also quite an artist who sings and draws really well, at a professional level even. She speaks 4 languages without an accent and is learning a 5th atm. On top of that, she likes traveling (been to 20+ countries), photography (takes amazing photos), anime, video games, etc. We began dating and shortly entered a relationship. \n\nBefore we officially entered a relationship, she told me that she had a traumatic past. Her parents did not care for her and were always busy. They left her to her grandparents when she was a kid. Her last birthday with her dad was actually the first time they celebrated together. She and her dad had just started living together again last year. According to her, her mother has very high expectations of her, while always accusing her for things she has no control over, such as being ugly (which she is not, she\u2019s gorgeous), not having perfectly straight, long legs etc. Her mother keeps telling her not to cause trouble for other people, so she speaks for outsiders instead of defending her own daughter. The last time they spent a good time together was when she came over to Canada (her mother works abroad) and they watched Stranger Things on Netflix together. They bonded well according to her, and I can tell that it meant a great deal to her.\n\nShe had 4 ex\u2019s before me, but all of them were the \u201cavoidant type\u201d, so they didn\u2019t commit and dumped her after some time. The longest relationship lasted about 1.5 years and her ex was abusive. He threatened her with a knife. As a result, she went suicidal. She showed me the scars on her leg she inflicted herself. The others all had their problems, and they were all stingy and wouldn\u2019t buy her an occasional drink. I don\u2019t blame them though since they were probably students too and had no money at the time. Feeling she was mistreated, I voluntarily paid for everything while we were together even when she asked to split the bills. I even gifted her a Kate Spade purse. She said it was the most expensive thing anyone has ever bought for her. \n\nWe took a trip during the holidays. On the first day, she said her throat was swollen up and felt miserable. We thought it could be an allergic reaction. I bought some OTC med from a pharmacy, and then rushed her to the hospital. The staff determined it was not an emergency so she was not a top-priority patient. They were also short of staff at Christmas. We waited for hours and eventually decided to take off as the symptoms lessened. At the hospital, I learned that she was taking Sertraline or Zoloft. She said she would get cramps, panic attacks, etc if she doesn\u2019t take it. It made me realize her mental condition may be more severe than I initially thought since she\u2019d need medication to stay normal. She also regularly visits a psychiatrist. On our last day back while I was driving, she suddenly burst into tears while telling me her past. There I had my first shock. I had dated some girls but had never seen anything like this. Spontaneously, I tried to comfort her, but I seemed to make it worse. It went on for about an hour and I didn\u2019t know what to make of it.\n\nSince then, we see each other almost every day. Most of the time, she\u2019s fine, but on some days, she would suddenly have a meltdown as telling me things. I\u2019d say it happens about once every 2-3 days on average. Other than that, she seems completely normal, just an overall excellent and talented student, not strange at all. \n\nYesterday, we had a date at a restaurant. In the end, out of a sudden, she had another attack \u2013 first time in public. She looked down on the table miserably. Her eyes got teary and her cheeks turned red. I tried calming her down. She texted me that talking makes her anxious, so don\u2019t talk to her for a while. I was really confused and frustrated. I did nothing wrong at all, and all I had been doing was trying to make her feel happy. I had great sympathy for her because unlike her, I was very well raised and I had a very healthy relationship. In about 20 minutes, she returned to normal. We went to see a movie. She leaned on me and held my hand but I did not return the favor as I was still recovering. In fact, I was thinking about it the whole time. As we walked out, we remained silent for two minutes. I tried to break the silence by \u201chow did you like the movie?\u201d I didn\u2019t hear anything back. I turned my head and looked at her face. I saw fear, sorrow, anxiety, the kind of expression one would only see in an anime. A thousand things came into my mind at once. In the past, my loving, caring ex would check on me to see if I was okay. She was also highly intelligent (masters from the best University in Canada), organized, and probably superior to me in just about every way. Should any conflict happen between us, she would be the one to step up and resolve. She was strong and I guess at some level subconsciously I depended on her. This time, I realized it\u2019s quite different. I looked at her eyes and paused briefly. I didn\u2019t know what to say and don\u2019t remember exactly what I said (I panicked too), but I tried to make her think everything was okay with an awkward smile. It was probably the way I said it, or the nervousness, she thought I was being sarcastic, and I was angry. She thought I was about to hurt her or beat her up. My heart was broken. I always have a soft spot for the weak, or cute animals, disabled people or women, etc. I have never been violent with a girl before. I\u2019ve never even argued with a girl before. If there was a conflict I did not want to confront, I would just walk away from it, not a good solution, but never violence. The way my girlfriend looked at me in fear really crushed me inside. I still ensured her she was safe with me and I would never hurt her. \n\nShe told me she had anxiety, OCD, and I just had to accept it. I know nothing about mental health as I don\u2019t have any family members with these problems, but I think of it as a normal illness such as a cold or fever that can happen to anyone, and it\u2019s perfectly normal. If I treat her well, maybe she will eventually climb out of her shadow. However, she\u2019s against the idea of someone changing her, but I do want to make her completely normal again. I\u2019m not just messing around, but I like to think I\u2019m dating a potential life partner. I want to help and be the one she can depend on. She said she was normal in primary school. She changed sometime during high school. \n\nCan people help me understand her conditions and what I can do to help? So far, everything I\u2019ve done just seems to make her feel worse. I have never invested this much energy and effort in a relationship (my ex was strong). Please keep in mind that the above is my own perspective and try to be objective as I can\u2019t understand her side.",

        "original": "Hi, 19F here! Earlier in 2019, around March time I experienced a series of what I believed to be \u2018mild psychotic symptoms\u2019. During that time, I had experienced extreme intrusive recurrent thoughts (literally non stop as if I had to shoot myself), someone \u2018talking to me\u2019 (I was being commanded not to eat which led to me physically being unable to pick up food and pacing around the shop), I would have recurrent dreams of waking up in the middle of the road (my bedroom window was across the road), I would feel euphoric for 2/3 days and depressed for latter end of the week. This lasted for about a month. \n\nI went to the GP who then sent me to a mental health nurse (not a psychiatrist) only in December 2019, who said I had a stress reaction not psychosis. It literally felt as if I was slowly losing my mind, during that month and hasn\u2019t happened since. I\u2019m going back to uni and scared its going to happen again. I\u2019ve been stressed before, my childhood has been full of stressors (bullying, abuse at home) and never once have I felt as if someone was controlling/talking to me, or felt as if I need to shoot myself in the head. I\u2019ve only had it once for a week in 2018 but it slowly died down. \n\nSo what is psychosis and what is a stress reaction? I\u2019m ultimately convinced that I at least have GAD, and I\u2019m not self diagnosing as such, but I just have an innate anxious, fear, paranoid state that I\u2019ve had my whole life, and I feel that \u2018explains\u2019 it.",

I just want to know what you thing about it, if you\u2019ve been there and got out, or if you want to convince me I\u2019m wrong just do it. I don\u2019t have an order for the things I\u2019ll say so I\u2019ll just say them as they come through my mind.\n\nWow, it\u2019s been 4 years since my 18. I\u2019m turning 22 in three weeks. My life was so different back then, and so many things change. I never tried to suicide, never ever thought about self harming, but there\u2019s this think I disaggre with. \u201cSuicide it\u2019s just a permanent solution to a temporary problem\u201d. See, mine\u2019s not temporary. Mine\u2019s it\u2019s time itself. I don\u2019t want to grow old, I just don\u2019t. At 22 I should be having fun and thing about all the great things I can do. But I just can\u2019t. All I know it\u2019s that in a matter of years, that I feel like they\u2019re passin by like minutes, my grandparents won\u2019t be there anymore. I still have all 4 of them, and you know, they are doing great but they still gettin old. A lot of years after this day, I\u2019ll have to watch my beloved parents get old, start to having problems, maybe lose their mental sanity due to old age, and in the worst case, have to put someone to help her and even having to think about maybe take them to an hospice. Man, I just can\u2019t.\nWhile you are reading this, think about that happy day you had 5 years ago. What does it mean in the end? I can\u2019t relive it, there\u2019s no single way you csn get to feel those things again. So why havibg to face a life full of nostalgia, thinking back bout the \u201cgood ol\u2019 days\u201d,  then watch problems and pain rise higher and higher until you die. Just Why? What cn you find to just deal with? You know, what actually makes me feel like I\u2019ll never be calm and happy again, is that I know my vision of life is the true one. You can\u2019t say it\u2019s not like that. No professional help or explanation about the human psychic can tell me that life is not an excalation of problems that become bigger as years passing by. And in fact, sometimes I\u2019m happy, or angry, or sad or maybe worried, sometimes enthusiast about something. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m all moody and depressed 24/7, I go out with friends and make music, talk with everyone and generally not being moody. I do feel things, kinda. But there\u2019s ALWAYS this feelings that reminds me that days are passing. You can\u2019t stop it, cry, be depressed, do what you want, they are passing. And they are fast. This gives me a LOT of anxiety. Constant anxiey. I don\u2019t even feel rested again from sleep. And what I don\u2019t experience anymore: you know that feeling when you wake up the next morning thinking \u201cuo, that\u2019s another day, yesterday was lit I dis this and that and today I\u2019ll do this and that, first let me get a breakfast and chill 20 minutes on the couch\u201d. Well, I don\u2019t have it anymore, from like more than a year and going on. It seems the same day to me. Really, I can perfectly rewire it back to the exact same moment as when I fell asleep the night before. Like you save a game, you close it, tweak the internal watch 8 hours beyond and just resume the game. Not to mention that the day passes by fast. Like, very fast. If I don\u2019t get enough sleep, I just can\u2019t get up from bed and fall asleep again. If I sleep as I want, I get up lowkey panicking because it\u2019s already 2 p.m and fuck day\u2019s already over?\nYou know what, I\u2019ve always been a strong believer of god. Not following any religion, but in my own personal way. And I do still believe in it. But I feel like he doesn\u2019t want me anymore. There\u2019s been a day in wich I really had this feeling that he left me. And I can\u2019t figure out why. I\u2019m the same person that I never get angry or upset, but if I do, it\u2019s the end, I lose control. And I\u2019m the same person that will get crazy emotionally or almost cry when my mom said to me \u201cthis is the peluche I had when I was young\u201d (peluche = that stuffed animals you have as a kid to play with) or when I think back at when I played with them as a little kid. Damn, i really played a lot with them\u201d.\nFinal thing: Hair is what I always cared a lot for. 22 yrs old and I\u2019m losing hair day by day. I can\u2019t hide it anymore. I\u2019m undergoind a hair transplant in I hope few months. 3k and little more, I work in a restaurant as a barista and that\u2019s like 3 of my salaries.\nThat\u2019s it, I just wanted to write it down",

        "original": "I\u2019m so helpless I don\u2019t even know what to do about it anymore to help myself out of this mess, I\u2019m eighteen and I don\u2019t have a job as I\u2019m a full time student with a few online classes on top of a full schedule at high school. (I\u2019m a senior) I can never find time and it seems like i can never just slow down, I\u2019m always moving and doing because that\u2019s what I have to do if I want to get to where I want to be. (I\u2019m so far from it no matter how many hours I put into it) school has ultimately become my happy place. I arrive half an hour early just to get away from home and I don\u2019t even leave the parking lot until almost an hour after dismissal. Coming home takes away all of my energy, my dad is always gone working to pay the bills and my mom who is partially disabled and never leaves the house + doesn\u2019t work is at home all the time. I love her to death but she adds so much onto my plate and contributes majorly to my depression. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t understand boundaries no matter how many times I bring it up to her, she goes into my room when I\u2019m not home. Rearranged my things, takes my things, goes through my stuff and when I come home and things aren\u2019t the way that I left them and things are missing I get so angry all I wanna do is throw my head through a wall because I feel so compromised mentally. We live in a hotel together so I feel confined and trapped I can\u2019t fucking take it anymore, I tried to commit suicide a few months ago just to get away from it but since then they\u2019ve been further up my ass. I was going to move In with a friend then that fell through, then my family friend was going to let me move into his apartment and now I realize he\u2019s unreliable too. Currently I can\u2019t get a job as these classes are so fast pace I\u2019m already behind + where I go to school and where I live is too far away at the moment for me to drive considering I\u2019m sharing a car because mine isn\u2019t fixed yet. I just wish things were different and THEYRE not. My main trigger is just that I\u2019m being so disrespected at home, my room is the only thing that helps my mental health. It being an illustration of me and the energy I put into my space is everything. Like when my mom goes in my room it\u2019s just so negative and it kills me, I don\u2019t like even thinking about my mother in my bedroom. Let alone going through my shit, my memories and knowing she\u2019s judging all of it. When we had a house I would lock my door when I would leave and put my most important stuff in a safe just to keep her away from my personal belongings. She thinks she\u2019s being sweet by \u201ccleaning\u201d and \u201corganizing\u201d my room for me, she\u2019s thrown away things that were seriously important to me and even washed clothes that were damaged from being washed because I\u2019m eighteen. I\u2019m 100% capable of taking care of myself, managing my own responsibilities and making sure my space is kept the way it needs to be. My parents are very controlling and don\u2019t want me to be independent they want to convince themselves that I still need them to do simple things like eat my own food basically they wanna treat me like a toddler just so they have an advantage over me. Our relationship is terrible and has been but my mom describes us as \u201cbest friends\u201d like bro no. You make my life a living hell and want me to be who you want me to be just to please the world.. I can\u2019t take my space being invaded and being judged this much anymore.

But when we smoke marijuana, he gets extreme anxiety and paranoia 90% of the time. Due to this feeling he gets, we RARELY smoke. \n\nExamples of the anxiety are that he strongly feels a \"deja vu\" feeling like we've done this before or he's dreamed the situation before. He will also think that I'm an \"investigator\" or \"undercover psychologist\". \n\nI'm coming to you guys over this because last night we went out downtown to a bar for the first time ever together. We picked up a pint of liqour and drank in the parking lot and then threw it out so we didnt have an open container with us. I've done this plenty in my past (to avoid paying a ton on alcohol in the bar) but he found this is be sketchy because it's technically illegal. Anyways. We went into the bar and had a beer and hung out briefly. However, he started getting anxious thinking i was a psychologist and investigating him again. Like i was trying to trap him doing something illegal and our entire relationship was a hoax.\n\nHe even went as far as wondering if the cars that were pulling into the parking lot were watching us and that everyone was actors. At one point there was a fight outside and he believes that it was fake. He also felt everyone was glancing at hime at the bar like they were \"keeping an eye on him\". I tried to reassure him but it went nowhere really so i downed some water and drove us home. I figured the feeling would pass with sleep but today he still believes it. The marijuana and alcohol effects are no more and he is still paranoid.\n\nThis morning he is asking if i am evaluating him for my schooling (i used to be a criminal psychology major but only made it through part of my Bachelors). He said he once found a file on my phone of me interviewing my friend (an ex heroin addict) and asking him incriminating questions. However, after much digging through my files, we found the video and it was me trying to intervention my friend after i found him ODd for the first time. I wasn't asking him incriminating questions in the video, i was trying to reason with him to get clean. I recorded it to show him once he came off drugs because he was so out of it when i was talking to him. \n\nOpinions? Thoughts? What can cause this paranoia/anxiety?

My eating has also been lowered by just having 2 small meals a day, since I usually just am not hungry.\nIf someone knows how to at least get out of this, it could be of great help to begin with.\n\nEdit: I'm at the same time scared and relieved to go to work, because I have set myself as ill for the last few days (since Tuesday) and I haven't really addressed that I was (so called) \"sick\" because of my kinda anxiety/(maybe just) unwillingness to talk to people.\nI'm afraid they will fire me, and all my income will be cut off, but at the same time, I can have the time to look for what I really want in life, but what if I just won't find it and get even more depressed (if that's what you could call it) because of having no income, and no sight for the future.\nAt the same time, I tend to overestimate everything, so nothing will probably happen tomorrow, and I'll be in a state of confusion for the whole day once again, idk really..\n\nEdit: I should probably just go to bed and try and sleep, even if it means to just close my eyes, until my alarm goes off, I will check on this in the morning, because staying up intentionally , just makes it worse, and I'm scared.\n\nUgh.. I hate waking up..\n\nEdit: I'm on my way to work, and my guts are telling me to just go back home, because today won't be of any good. I think that if they:ll fire me, that I would lose my temper and screw up my whole future, since they can write whatever they want on my raport.\nI just want to sleep until it's all over really..\nWish me luck.\nAlso, they are the kind of people who would let me come to work, just to fire me and go back home.\n\nEdit: they asked me why I didn't tell I felt sick at work, they so called \"are worried about me\" while I asked my boss to change positions to something less stressfull as I am in now, and all they could answer me was that they had to fire me, or I should change position to the only thing that stresses me out at work (well, it now is bleeding out into multiple things)\n\nEdit: 4hours passed, and I still feel like crap, idk why, but the only thing left in my mind is my bed and sleep, I just can't take interest in whatever the fuck this shitcompany wants from me.\nThey're telling me they care, but it's obvious they don't listen, nor care.\nThe only thing left in their mind is money they can put in their own pocket, nothing more.\nI just wish some people can just think like a normal human bein, and not like those moneyscratchers they are.\nApparently that's just too much to ask.\n\nEdit: I feel like the only time my mind is at rest, is when I sleep.\nBecause I never remember what I dreamt of.",

        "original": "As a kid, I was not informed about any sexual sensitivities that could occur to me and my well-being. I was a cheerful kid who knew nothing but to play with people my age. I was happy even if my extended family frequently tease me occasionally. In retrospect, I tried to be cheerful I tried to keep my spirits up but my introversion manifested the time I was in high school. I didn't gave any thoughts of everything that occurred to me up until my college graduation. I stopped being cheerful, I stopped being happy the time I was sexually abused as a kid. I don't remember when exactly or how long it happened, I just remember those vivid memories on what happened. I don't even know what to call it - sexual abuse, sexual harassment - I just know that its not rape. \n\nMy memories haunts me quite often, I tried to go about spending hours of watch time on YouTube, I finished the animes my brother sent me but it goes back. I remember my uncle calling me out frequently, right after my aunt called in for lunch. He would hold me back and say that he has something to show. I remember seeing his genitalia and him making me touch his shaft. I remember being shocked and amused by it. I don't remember much but those vivid memories made me question myself, made me built up hate towards men similar to my uncle. I didn't thought of it before because I was surrounded by guys my age. I started working Dec 2018 and that's when I realize that I'm traumatized. One specific married guy tried to seduce me or flirt with me. His subtle touches made me cry and I mentally broke down the moment he keeps on insisting to take a ride with his company car. I live along his house is located so for the first few months, I had to bear and wear a face, and just to reason everything I can to avoid his invitation. I was not comfortable. \n\nI pondered why other women in my office doesn't have the same sentiment like I have. I could witness other women making sex jokes with other married men, other men joking about cheating with beautiful and sexy women younger than their age. I couldn't bear it. Its not a joke to me. In all honesty, I make sex jokes before. I love sex jokes or any sexualized jokes but that's when I had friends (people within my age), but hearing sex jokes from older men makes me sick. It makes me terrified and horrified by the fact that they had sexually harassed me within the office and on site. Sexualized stares, unnecessary comments, I'm not comfortable. \n\nI wondered why I'm too sensitive about this and why I can't move forward with life. Why am I having a hard time? Top management are also older men but I don't get terrified of them, I see them like my father. I love those higher bosses. I go back to the time that I was sexually abused as a kid. I hated my uncle, I wanted him to just die. There's a saying that says 'forgive and forget' but the aftermath of it is that I have made myself think of being sexually abused by the people around me. I constantly imagine being forced to do anything sexual in an office setting. Contrary to before I started working, I constantly imagined being raped and murdered. My thoughts also wandered to those stuffs and even ask myself questions that I couldn't even answer: (some of the questions stated below)\n\n1.0. If I get raped, will I like it or will I be disgusted by it. \n\n2.0. If I get sexually abused, will I report it or will I keep it in.\n\n3.0. If I get raped, will I finally be able to kill myself or will I still put up with it. \n\n4.0. If I get pregnant, will I abort or will I let it live. \n\n5.0. If I get raped, will I fight back and have myself get murdered or will I be mentally insane enough to be the murderer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing back to forgive and forget, I realized that people who had it similar to mine will always forgive the person and forget the situation but will never forget the trauma it had caused. I thinking back my uncle I'm not entirely sure if I have forgave him but because its been long due, I didn't matter anymore, I just don't want to be involved or to be around him. Even if it doesn't matter anymore, no one can really take away the trauma that it had caused. Its the aftermath of any incident that we have to bear, we can be tough about it, we can pity ourselves about it, but it will still be there even if it doesn't matter anymore. That uncle is fighting for his life with an illness that I don't give a fuck about (on knowing) and my mother, being a pure soul, volunteers every single time and I'm just here conflicted whether I'll be happier if he's dead or I've tormented myself by so much because of it. I just want to forget or erase this trauma but I couldn't help but cry whenever my mother brings him up in our conversation (mentioning that he's will be at my hometown to receive treatment at the nearby hospital). My boyfriend, once, talked about this and I cried franticly at his comment to just forgive him or to let him tell my mother about all of these. Even if I want him dead, I don't want my mother to have a conflicted feelings when she's helping him in his medications. Even if I want to tell the whole family how shitty my mental state is partially because of him, I couldn't I could just cry and mentally torn about everything, about the aftermath of that incident. I definitely blame myself for not going against that aftermath, I made bad decisions and cultivated a wrong perspective in relationships because of it. My mind is mostly about sex, in a bad way, I'm trying so hard to become a better person but its a hard life with a messed up mental state.",

        "original": "It's been a while since I've posted and I feel as if I have lived several lifetimes in that space. I ended up having to put my care on hold for a while because of some physical health things that I needed to take care of. I needed a two day procedure (out patient surgery) but the months leading up to the date were hell, and I've been recovering for almost a month now. \n\n**TLDR: I'm still batshit, cutting to get by, I now have RAGE burning due to new trauma, and I can't seem to get help and I just need to get by, one day at a time**\n\nI feel like that kind of \"sick\" gave my mind  something else to focus on, but only for a little while. It was something very emotional as well, which hasn't helped. I've gotten through it, but I am definitely no where near over it. I was doing \"okay\" until a week ago, when I couldn't sleep for over four days, I had had maybe 5 hours total via short naps but every time I fell asleep it would be less than three hours before I bolted upright in bed, or a night terror would wake me. \n\nThe procedure was definitely triggering. I dream of the gas stuff they give you, breathe in four seconds, out six seconds, in four seconds, out six seconds. I was crying so much the nurse had to keep the count the entire 30 minutes and it's seared into my mind. I often have nightmares of this. \n\nAfter days and day of little to no sleep I got extra loopy. The WWIII speculation started and I dove into head first. I was making non-stop commentary, grew more social media followers than I'd ever had - I thought the the world needed me. My grandiosity and mania skyrocketed. I live in Canada, and kept saying and thinking that Russia and China want this war. They want the USA to send their armies out in masses to leave North America unattended, or not well guarded so they could invade. No one could prove me wrong. I made so many speculative commentaries and when one thing after another kept coming true I got worse and worse. \n\nIt took DAYS and a trip to the emergency room to get me a little straighter. I began (and still do) to obsessed over killing one of our neighbours. She's a horrible person, and I know I've never spoken to her, but I'm SURE of this fact. She has a dog that she walks off-leash and it gets into physical fights with other dogs, and hers isn't usually the stronger one. The poor thing. She leaves it's poop everywhere. I'm also pretty sure she's not human. Wether she's an alien or a demon I'm not quite sure yet. \n\nI collect knives and things, but anyone with a good kitchen knife could get the job done. The urges were so bad I cracked open a razor and went to town on my arms and legs instead. It helped. I tried to keep it low, only every 30-45 mins to keep that rush of the feel good chemicals steady and to get myself to morning. I had told myself that I would tell my mother and husband that I NEED emergency. We go, my mother drops us off because she doesn't want to pay for parking. I know...but at least these days she's somewhat trying. \n\nFor anyone who hasn't read my past posts, we're living with my mother currently because I lost my really high paying job ($80k/year - yeah talk about going from everything to nothing) due to my current mental state. They've been letting me float by, and with the physical medical stuff that took precedent my MH stuff was on hold.\n\nBack to it - we went in, did the typical stuff, got triaged etc, got in almost right away because saying you want to kill a neighbour, and having a plan, a very specific and concrete plan you get seen right away. The head nurse was amazing, I brought all my past medications, papers, etc along with the pages I have of my delusions, hallucinations, urges, and thoughts & feelings. At this point in life I've gotten tired of this dance every time with new doctors. I'm tired, I am sick and tired of having to prove I'm crazy. It's what I feel like happens every time. I'm just so tired of it and most of the time, I don't want to get better, I'm fine. Everyone just needs to leave me to be who I'm going to be. \n\nI finally saw the psychiatrist, and he was TERRIBLE. And arrogant piece of shit, and after giving me some drop in therapy places to go to let me go. My husband was in pieces. He has fuelled a new rage and desire in me. I want to go down and bring him with me. I want him to be known as the own who had a killer in his hospital and he let her go. Immediately I'm thinking I need to find ways to commit mass murder. How do I poison water supplies, what can i spay onto vegetables at grocery stores, or inject into fruits/veg. I even wondered...how does one get things like anthrax? and I mean the real deal, not a bag of \"white powder\" I got scammed for on the dark web. \n\nI want to hire a PI to get me everything that they can on him. I want to know when his children are born so I can send them things on their birthdays. I'm obsessive and when it comes to my MH when people don't take me seriously I feel the URGE to PROVE. THEM. WRONG. He is my number one target now. I have been holding myself back for over a decade now, and now I don't want to. He even tried to toy around with me, and the minute I sensed that the mask went on, and I began my plans. \n\nI had brought my bowie knife to the hospital. Not even my husband knew, no one checked my little backpack. It contained three stuffed animals, and my knife. It's a Hibben, it's VERY NICE. I could have jabbed it so far into his arrogant cocky body over and over, but then it would be over. There is no way I'm going down with a body count of 1. I know I sound like the worst edge lord right now, but they're just trying to be like us. They wish they could stab into flesh, feel it tear open then the relief with the warm blood spraying up, and pooling up around your hands. Warmth, a warm that the demons never let me have anymore. Funny because you would think the army of the damned would bring warmth with them, you know hell supposing to be on fire and all. But they're cold, so cold. \n\nMy family is super disappointed, and they don't know how to manage me. They're stopped sleeping in shifts. I've held myself together long enough to get myself to the point where I can now no longer sleep and be awake unsupervised and I'm ready to start making the world hurt the way I hurt. To start correcting some of the injustices in this world. I want to bring chaos. I want governments to burn. I want to set the world on fire, eat the rich then walk away to leave the common people to RISE UP and finally take back what is ours. I don't want the world, I don't want to take it over. I have no idea how to run a better functioning society, but I do want to help open the playing field for people to do better, because I know they exist.\n\nThey say they'll get me new help, try a new hospital, but it's been a week and I'm still home and I'm tired of fighting for myself. I'm just tired. I'm scared to sleep but managed 7 hours since Jan 10th. I'm keeping track in a digital note because I feel like it'll be important. \n\nI seem to always write novels here, but it helps. What brought me here tonight was trying to google how to stab myself. I don't want to die tonight, but I want to leave a series of escalating incidents to really nail this psychiatrist to the post when he is eventually sued by the families of the people I've killed. There aren't any good answers, everyone just telling the OP's to get help, to call 9-1-1, saying it's that serious. In reality aren't I fine? I sat down and wrote ALL THIS. Does that seem like something someone who isn't fine would do? I am speaking rationally, I have my thoughts together. People who are in a crisis can't make plans. I am okay. Am I sick? Yes, I know that, but I can't seem to get help for the life of me. So I need to do this my way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks to anyone who manages to read through this.",

Our family was doing great financially and all was fine. My father was almost always away with \u201cbusiness\u201d, and he was also away for a few months at a time now and then, but I don\u2019t remember this as I was little and probably didn\u2019t pay attention because I was used to it. At this pont my father was \u201cliving in another country, working\u201d. We used to talk on the phone and everything seemed normal, but then again I wasn\u2019t paying much attention. That was until I was about 12 or so. I went on to find out he was actually in prison and those times he was away for \u201cbusiness\u201d, yeah, he was doing illegal stuff, hence why our family was doing well with money. But that stopped around the same time as well. This time he was in for 3 years, 3 years which were vital for me growing up, as I was entering the \u201cteenage\u201d phase of my life and definitely needed a father figure. These 3 years changed everything. I went on to see who he actually was and we kind of fell apart in my head but on the outside I was pretending not to be mad at him for some reason. The money was now gone, and my mother was working 2 jobs to be able to provide for me and my sister, who was about 3 at the time. Her second job was cleaning offices for various companies and I couldn\u2019t leave her alone on this so at about 13 I think, I started going with her, waking up at 5:30 and going to clean offices before, and sometimes, after school. Time went by and he got out and came home. On his first day home he made me cry. I don\u2019t recall the reason, but I remember crying and wishing he went back. He started working again, so my mother and I stopped cleaning offices. He tried to \u201creconcile\u201d with me even though I never told him I was mad at him, but I guess he noticed our relationship was not the same. But this was in vain. He was not the hero anymore, he was just a regular dad whom I wished to be away from as much as possible. Time went by and he went in again, but for a quite short period of time, I can\u2019t remember exactly. When he got out he moved to another country by himself to work and support us financially (as our country is a shithole). I was around 18 at this point and finished high school. He kept trying to convince me that It\u2019s great there and I should go visit him, and if I wanted to I could make some money (legally) myself to buy a car (didn\u2019t have one at the time so it sounded pretty tempting). I didn\u2019t want to, just because it meant spending time with him, which I hated. However, for some reason I once accepted. I went there and met him, and we went to his place to get some rest. The second day I went to work with him (he worked as a driver, and had daily routes to another country nearby). Everything was alright. That was until we returned. We were going home but were stopped at the border for a routine check (he was driving a sprinter and this was back in 2017 when the immigrant crisis in Europe was full on). The authorities said they need to keep him because he had a warrant from another country. It was my second day with him and I was left alone in a country where I had no one (except my brother but he was about 600km away). He told me to wait for him until the morning (as it happened during nighttime), so I could drive back to get him. Of course he didn\u2019t come back. I had no money. Just the sprinter and enough gas to get back to his place. I Called my brother and he came to get me (we get along great). Ended up staying about a month in that country trying to get a job to support my mom and sister since he was gone again, but I couldn\u2019t do it. It was depressing for me. All of that experience in that country was horrible so I went back home (note that I hadn\u2019t spoken to him for about 2 months since it happened because he wasn\u2019t allowed to call). The sprinter was a leasing and, not paying it for 3 months led to the leasing company wanting him to return the vehicle. When we first spoke he was mad at me for not staying there to pay the lease so that he could get back to working when he got out. He told me countless times that now he had to start all over again because of me. Eventually he stopped, got out and started working again in that country for a while, before returning home \u201cto be with us\u201d. Fast forward to this late spring. He was wanted again. Turned himself in and he\u2019s still there as of now. For the first time in my life I told him that I resented him for everything he did and that he fucked me up big time and I\u2019m depressed and have mental issues and he replies by telling me he did a lot for us and that I don\u2019t need Any help because I\u2019m a Champion (he calls me that sometimes because I practiced martial arts for about 6 years and had countless trophies including many national championships under my belt, no pun intended). I Felt relieved but my mental health is getting worse as days pass and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. He fucked me up big time. I never learned how to be a man but he always wanted me to be in his absence, and this is now affecting my 2 Year old relationship with my girlfriend with whom I want to spend the rest of my days with. She\u2019s the most wonderful person I have ever met and has helped me enormously but I still can\u2019t get my shit together. I feel like everything\u2019s falling apart for me. My dreams don\u2019t really matter anymore and I just want to be well for her, but don\u2019t know how. I don\u2019t want to drag her down along with me, she deserves way better. \nI was the bravest and most ambitious person I knew. I was positive, Happy, outgoing, socially active, all of that. Now I don\u2019t know who I am anymore and It\u2019s scary. \nThe worst part? He doesn\u2019t understand the impact that all of this shit had on me and doesn\u2019t seem to me he ever will. \n\nI guess this was more of a venting post.\n\nTL;DR - daddy issues fucked me up big time and i\u2019m a fuck up now\n\nEdit: I realized I left a good deal of my issue out.\nI live with my girlfriend now. I have a car. I have a new job that I am starting tomorrow that pays me well, things seem to be fine. But really they\u2019re not. \nI wake up everyday feeling empty and unintentionally hurting my girlfriend because of this. She\u2019s a bright, positive and wonderful person but she has her limits, too. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to get my shit together for her. Almost everyday I feel like \u201cyes, this is the day I snap out of it and everything will be alright\u201d, but it never lasts. I\u2019m back to being depressed the next moment. Feeling worthless, powerless, numb. That\u2019s not the type of guy I want her to be with. But then again, I feel helpless in front of my depression. I didn\u2019t want people to know the issues I had since it affected my family as well back then, and kind of \u201clearned\u201d to keep all I Felt to myself.

My father is a strict snob who doesnt respect anyone but himself and never did anything to help me. My friends wont talk about mental problems and actively avoid conversations about them and i as my paranoid self feel awkward and scared of expressing how i feel to them.\n\nThe worst part is i do actually have a therapist. And shes helped quite a bit with realising i was abused and how terribly i treat myself. But shes also really into alternative medicine wich prevents her from even considering medication for my depression and shes incredibly homophobic and sexist.\n\nFor context i am, in fact, a barely 18 years old butch lesbian.\n\nSo talking to her isnt really the most comforting thing, it has caused me quite a bit of stress actually due to her honestly quite idiotic and offensive opinions. (she once compared gay couples adopting children to cloning. no, i dont get it either)\n\nThe thought of switching to another therapist, while appealing, stresses me quite a bit as well.\n\nWhat if it is a bad idea while im working for my final exams? What do i tell my father when he questions why i want to switch? Will he ever take me to another? Will i have to be the one to tell her? How will she react? Will she be angry? What if the next therapist is worse?\n\nI realise that most of the above are at least unreasonable but knowing that doesnt change the fact that they feel like real, plausible outcomes to me. As if they are inevitable, i struggle to avoid them, abbsolutely terrified of everything.\n\nTerrified is a great word to describe myself. Alongside angry and sad and tired, so extremely tired.\n\nSometimes i just want to go find a place where im alone and scream.\n\nSometimes i just wanna be able to lay in bed and do nothing at all and just rest.\n\nBut i cant do that because i constantly have to do something, anything, as unproductive as that is, i just need to be constantly busy or the guilt kicks in.\n\nSometimes im guilty for existing, for causing any kind of disturbance to other people.\n\nIm scared of being in environments i dont know, with people i dont know, the mind numbing feeling that they are judging me completely overcoming my thoughts, paralyzing me into constant terror.\n\nSometimes i get really panicked and  i cant breath properly and my heart pounds, my hands shake, my eyes water, my stomach and head hurt.\n\nLoud noises panick me. Things moving sharply towards me panick me.\n\nAnd sometimes everything feels dull and uninteresting.\n\nAs if ive fallen into a deep pit of tar, everything slow and dark and muddy and lifeless.\n\nI dont really want to live most of the times.\n\nI dont want to die, i have never really been suicidal i think, i just dont feel like existing.\n\nI wish time would stop so i could pick myself up, get ready for all that is to come because its moving too fast now and im getting left behind. \n\nThats how i feel at least.\n\nCompletely lost and hopeless.\n\nI have trouble with studying because it is a big part of my trauma (for the entirety of my childhood my parents used my grades as a way to measure my worth as a human being). I dont want to succeed because i dont want my parents to be pleased by me. And i think i want to get into university. I say i do. But i dont really feel like it. Dont really care that much. Id much rather divert my passion towards my fine arts exams, my country's fine arts universtity being a much more appealing option. But its astoudingly difficult to get in (about 90-130 people pass each year) so i ''need'' to first get into a normal university through the national exams to have one ensured. \n\nDo i sound like a brat?\n\nI think i could have actually liked school once to be honest.\n\nOutside of school history, philosophy, chemistry and literature are actually things i find appealing.\n\nBut in the context of studying for exams they become dull and uninteresting to the point of tears.\n\nAnd i just think that once i actually were a happy cheerfull child, full of life and wonder and confidence.\n\nAnd it was sucked out of me.\n\nOookay that's- ive written quite a bit huh?\n\nI'm sorry about that, i kinda went off the rails ranting. Dont feel like ive said even half of the stuff i need to say. Dont really feel like i have the energy to really.\n\nQuite a bit depressing too. Uh... yeah.\n\nLook, i dont want to leave this on a sad note.\n\nSo, hey person who actually sat through all this emotional baggage from a stranger. I hope you're doing okay, i really do.

Maybe 5 months ago she had a really bad episode involving visual and auditory hallucinations. I acted like a moron and told her I didn't want to have to 51-50 her. From that point on, she didn't trust me. After that episode, I didn't hear from the family about anything else (I don't live at home anymore). Evidently, the hallucinations kept going on and my dad and younger sister just didn't tell me about it. \n\nYesterday, it hit a head and my mom started calling family members while I was at work. She told them some nasty things that my dad said and they were ready to come out to our house and \"solve\" the problem.\n\nMy dad took her to an emergency room last night because she also hasn't been eating or sleeping well, been dizzy, and has fainted a couple times wherein she's hit her head or scraped her knees and elbows. My dad said he told the doctor about all that and mentioned the hallucinations, but the doctor only responded to the physical, not mental. They did some preliminary blood work and a CAT scan on her head and chest (she's been saying her ribs hurt), but they apparently came back fine. \n\nThe nurses have started another round of blood tests and fed her breakfast. They're going to be coming back for more tests at 11am and apparently the doctor will be coming around as well. I'm going to try and flag him down when he does show back up and let him know about these hallucinations. I'm just not sure what to do here. I'm afraid, so I can't even imagine how my mom or dad or sister feel. I just want her to return to normal but the more I interact with her and the more research I do... I just don't think that's possible. She's not even that old, only in her mid 50s. What the hell could be happening? \n\nIf the doctor won't admit her, theres a Crisis hotline that services my area. They come out with a clinician and police officer and do a face to face assessment of the situation. If the clinician deems her unfit or whatnot, they'll take her involuntarily.

We\u2019ve been on and off friends since 2011. We are both 18. They booked the Train and hostel. And we just came back yesterday. Parents don\u2019t really like my friend (she made fake hate accounts about me years ago and secretly video recorded my entire family calling them white trash) but they didn\u2019t want me to go with my boyfriend and they told me to pretty much babysit her before we went.\n\nWe Took a 17 hour train ride to DC from Chicago and stayed for 8 days. \n\nOn the train - She wanted me to sleep in observation car so she could lay out in our seats. Gave me an attitude when I came back to seats. Got pissy because she brought too much luggage and had me pay for her extra suitcase. \nKept going up and down aisles while others were sleeping. Inconsiderate and didn\u2019t care. Kept bitching about no service and how she\u2019s bored. I didn\u2019t want to say anything because she\u2019s argumentative as fuck. I was already annoyed on the train. She also kept calling me names and loudly announced how I need to stop sharting my pants and that I smell like an onion patch (neither are true she\u2019s just being an obnoxious jerk).\n\nWe finally got to DC. \nShe brought her speaker and She starts blasting explicit dirty rap music and porn complete with smacking noises and kept banging the headboard off the wall. You could hear the music from the elevator. When I told her to turn it down she told me to F off. She also opened the window and blasted the music and was looking for reactions from people on the streets. She also mooned people from the window and lifted up her bra and yelled t!tties in a man voice.  \n\nI believe my friend also wiped her a** and smeared feces on the walls in the communal bathroom because it wasn\u2019t there before she went in there (several times) Of course she denied it but that\u2019s something she would do (she did gross things in the school bathroom before) Somebody also took a literal dump on the shower floor itself and there was poopy toilet paper in all the sinks. She was laughing. Absolutely disgusting. \n\nShe kept talking in Australian accent through the hostel hallways and elevators and was yelling fck me baby, oh aching clitoris where are you, cum in my pu**y, I got the strap on waiting in the room and just all these disgusting sexual things and thought it was hilarious. It was embarrassing. It was also at like 1 or 2am.\n\nShe also kept calling me a dumba** and just saying all this hateful stuff really loudly and I told her it\u2019s rude and hurtful and she laughs and says she\u2019s just joking and I said I\u2019m starting to wonder. (I believe she thinks self deprecating is hilarious)\n\nShe also made us walk to Arlington in the middle of the night from dc. It was freezing cold and it hurt my lungs to breathe and she said \u201cI don\u2019t fkn care about you I\u2019m gonna keep walking bye ya fkn loser\u201d I was irritated.  \n\nI had to keep paying for ubers the entire time when the metro was closed because she refused and I couldn\u2019t leave her because if I don\u2019t see her again my parents would\u2019ve flipped. \n\nWhen she gets angry she will walk away and not answer her phone exactly why my parents told me to watch her and why I couldn\u2019t say anything to her. \n\nShe also made us stop at the pentagon when on the metro (to look at the memorial) at 10:30pm and I felt extremely uncomfortable. \n\nOn day we were suppose to come home - She wouldn\u2019t let me see the train tickets (physical copy) and kept talking about how she didn\u2019t want to go back home before it was time to board. She told me the train left at 7:30pm (it left at 4:05pm) she didn\u2019t get back until 6 and goes oh shit the train left and started laughing. My parents were furious that we missed the train and pretty much wasted their money.  My boyfriend paid for greyhound tickets back and my friend was saying how her mom would drive to dc and pick her up and told me to go myself. My boyfriend and parents bought her a ticket and my parents told me so help me if your friend doesn\u2019t come back with you and I had to practically beg her to come back with me on the greyhound. \n\nThroughout the trip She kept yelling at me to leave her alone  and to stop watching her every move. We were at a restaurant and she moved tables and I was video calling my boyfriend and I look over and she left the entire restaurant. I started crying and panicking to my boyfriend and he said that my friend is an ahole and he felt really bad for me. I told him I couldn\u2019t wait until the trip was over. My dad called and I explained what happened and he yelled at me to go look for her. Long story short she was outside the metro station a few streets down talking to someone and badmouthing me to them. She saw me and was like \u201coh look the annoying fk decided to get off the phone with her middle eastern fkboy and followed me\u201d I told her that is ignorant and she doesn\u2019t even know him (they never met) and she said and I don\u2019t want to know him he\u2019s a controlling ahole (wtf?) \n\nWe were at the air and space smithsonian and she left without me knowing and wouldn\u2019t answer her phone. I got yelled at for not watching her and I better find her. Or police would get involved. I was crying at that point. \n\nShe also got extremely angry that we left the hotel at like 2-3pm some days (because we were out all night) and she said we didn\u2019t come to dc to sit in a hotel room all day. She was limping around dc because she hurt her leg (too much walking) and was still wanting to go on more forest marches. \n\nMy parents got a $170 cleaning fee because she trashed the hotel room and they are making me pay it back because she\u2019s my friend (but I didn\u2019t trash the room). I also have to pay back for the greyhound tickets. \n\nThis was my Christmas gift and I had a miserable time but my friend loved it and she\u2019s now asking when we are going on another trip again. I left her on read. She has some nerve. I\u2019ve been getting yelled at all weekend and scolded and she\u2019s gotten nothing from her parents (probably because all they gave her was spending money and my parents paid for everything else).\n\nTL;DR - my friend made our trip literal hell, she is extremely immature and I\u2019m getting backlash from my family evenhough they booked the trip for us knowing how she is and there is so much that went wrong that I can\u2019t write in a tldr so please read and give advice thank you.\n\nWe have gotten into 3 major breakup fights in the past because of her toxic behavior and I think she abuses my forgiveness and kindness for when she needs someone because she has nobody and I\u2019m pretty positive I\u2019m over it and done being used by her.",

        "original": "Throwaway for obvious reasons, but I\u2019ve been dealing with this for almost a decade now and just need some help. I know that posting this won\u2019t solve anything, but I\u2019m hoping to at least maybe have a better understanding of what went wrong and how to get this individual some help.\n\nI will attempt to be brief in my summary of what happened and put what I feel are potential symptoms or issues related  to the overall problem in point-form to make this information more readable.\n\nJust under a decade ago my former spouse and I started having problems.  It was out of nowhere but coincided with the birth of our second child and the beginning of my spouse\u2019s use of social media (specifically Facebook). She would become irrationally hateful towards me and distant and whenever I attempted to talk to her about it, she would either be hostile or completely ignore me.  This went on for a few years and then I eventually learned (by complete accident) that she had cheated on me when our youngest was only 3 years old.  I was devastated and could not picture a world where I was only going to see my children every other week at most.  \n\nWe tried to fix things after this, but my former spouse showed little to no desire to truly fix things. My offers of marriage counseling were rebuked, and nothing really changed. The ignoring and distancing and general irrational hatred towards me remained. \n\nShe eventually told me she was leaving and taking my children to live at her parents (an hour and a half away), but my children did not want to go with her. So, we remained (and continue) living in the same home.  I have been sleeping on a couch for about two years now and every day is an absolute struggle mentally and emotionally for me.  I have done a lot of thinking about and observing of my former spouses\u2019 behavior over this time and retrospectively.  The strange thing is, it has really brought about in me an interest in psychology. \n\nMy summary above is very mild and doesn\u2019t truly present the scope of the mental abuse I have been through. And at end of the day I still do not know what happened and if it was my fault. I have never been given a reason or an answer. It was literally as if someone flicked a switch and my former spouse became a completely different person.\n\nI am going to list my observations of habits, actions, and just general thoughts below and I really hope someone can help me understand what happened and what kind of help (if any) my former spouse could get, because at the end of the day she is still the mother of my children and I want to be comfortable with them being with her and want her to be happy:\n\n\u00b7 First and foremost, she became a Facebook addict.  She often spends double-digit hours per day on her phone.\n\n\u00b7 Quit her job after our second child was born even before returning to work. She told me she would start looking for a new job in the spring, as I did not feel I could be the sole breadwinner in the family\u2026that was eight years ago. It has been a major financial struggle, but I have done my best.\n\n\u00b7 When she cheated, she did so with someone she met once in real life, who was also in a long-term relationship.  This did not matter to her.\n\n\u00b7 Sent nude and pornographic images of herself to this individual after only days of knowing him.\n\n\u00b7 To this day she continues to send every new guy that shows any passing interest in her, nudes and pornographic images, almost immediately.  If I had to estimate, she has likely sent multiple hundreds (possibly a thousand). She believes that these men can be trusted and would never share or post these images.  I very much disagree and am afraid of what will happen if friends of our children or family members ever see these images in the future.  This occurs multiple times per week, every week. Sometimes multiple times per day. Actually, the last time was just hours ago.\n\n\u00b7 Once, while I was washing dishes, she made a slapping sound against the wall with her hand and shouted to our children that I had hit her. This above all other things made me realize something was very wrong with her. It only happened once and I know my children did not believe her, but even after all these years, this still scares me. \n\n\u00b7 She tends to gravitate to the youngest members of her extended family when it comes to texting and chatting.  She always wants to chat with the teens in her family even though she is 40.\n\n\u00b7 Spends a great deal of time watching daytime talk shows and reality shows, and little else.\n\n\u00b7 One especially weird habit is the making of mouth sounds or humming/singing and dancing when she thinks she has been cocky towards me or seemingly wants to appear \u201ctough\u201d. This one really confounds me.  She will also do this whenever I enter a room she is currently occupying.\n\n\u00b7 Does not take ownership and or responsibility for any of her failures.  It\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault.\n\n\u00b7 Her emotions have always tended to be extreme or exaggerated \u2013 she will be the loudest crier at a funeral and the loudest to laugh at any joke.  It\u2019s almost as if she does not have these emotions and is trying to mimic them.\n\n\u00b7 Was coddled by her family her whole life, even as an adult. They are afraid to call her out on anything or talk to her about some of the awful things she has done, and they have always been afraid to give her bad news. They do not at all support what she has done to me and our family, but they do not call her on it at all either.  They are good people, but almost seem afraid of her.\n\n\u00b7 She would by definition be considered a pathological liar.\n\n\u00b7 She constantly talks back to the TV and has very forced and exaggerated laughter when she considers something humorous on TV.  It\u2019s as if she wants us to hear her laughing.\n\n\u00b7 Another very weird one \u2013 her steps and actions are very loud.  She does not walk, she stomps.  She doesn\u2019t close a cabinet door, she slams it shut, she doesn\u2019t push a light switch up, she slams it up.\n\n\u00b7 All of her opinions and thoughts seem to be a regurgitation of what she hears someone else say or reads on social media, but claims them as her own.\n\n\u00b7 Has become very short tempered with our children over the years.  But I would not consider her to be a bad mother.\n\n\u00b7 Has occasional times where she asks very kind towards me, as if we are friends and nothing wrong has ever happened. This can last days or even a week. But things always return to the way they were.\n\n\u00b7 Seems very into her looks now and whenever there is a new man paying attention to her she starts working out briefly.\n\n\u00b7 Her friends help her sneak around.  She will tell our children she is staying the weekend at her friend\u2019s house to help them with something, but is actually off with one of her men in a motel.\n\n\u00b7 Is obsessed with her immediate and extended family and hometown.  If anyone mentions someone who has done something well, her family or someone in her hometown has (or could) do it better.\n\n\u00b7 When she sees parents of our children\u2019s schoolmates, she acts like she is best friends with them, even though she rarely interacts with them outside of school functions.\n\n\u00b7 There is a constant need to be the center of attention, especially when around friends or family.  Always needs to be part of every story.\n\n\u00b7 Was not popular in school.\n\n\u00b7 Society would likely consider her to be of average looks and just below average intelligence.  I do not say this to be rude.\n\n\u00b7 Loves to watch horrific news. If there is breaking new about some tragedy, she will be glued to the TV. \n\nI could go on and on, but I suspect no one really wants to read much more of this. I\u2019m just hoping someone can tell me what, if any, disorder this could be. And what could cause someone to become like this, seemingly overnight.  \n\nI apologize for any spelling or grammar errors.  As I want to write this and post it quickly before I decide against it.  As you can imaging, my life is a living hell and I exist solely to care for my children and try to ensure they have a good life and are well taken care of, despite our situation. \n\nThe amount of people that know fully about my situation are in the single digits because I do not want to burden others. I just want to know that I didn\u2019t cause this and that I am not imagining things, and that I\u2019m not really the one with the disorder. \n\nI have zero desire to ever get back together with my ex, but I do want her to get help and have a better and more meaningful life, for her and for our children.\n\nThank you for reading this.",

Before children I mistakenly saw a child psychiatrist but because I was under 23, she took me on. I told her I had been diagnosed with ADD at age 17 but I didn\u2019t follow a treatment plan nor did I take medication and I also told her I wondered if I had bipolar disorder because I was always either very ecstatic or down and engaging in dangerous/impulsive behavior. She prescribed me adderall and Wellbutrin and wrote down I had bipolar and ADD. I didn\u2019t stick with that either but now finally in my 30\u2019s, I am seeing a psychiatrist and on Ritalin. It helps me to get a lot done but I kind of go into autopilot and I\u2019m not much of a person or a warm and loving wife/mother. It also makes my anxiety even worse. All last week I had panic attacks and got only the bare minimum done. My house and life are disorganized messes. I always try to be the best mom I can be and be productive and organized for my kids but I never achieve it consistently. I\u2019ve accepted that it will always be a struggle. I very much dislike the ups and downs though and I struggle with low self esteem as a result of all of this. Going back to last week, a fuse burned out in me. I don\u2019t care about anything. I never used to think \u201cI don\u2019t want to mom today or I don\u2019t feel like doing the kids laundry, what\u2019s the point, what\u2019s the point of anything.\u201d but since last week that is where I am. This morning I woke up early and got the kids to school on time so that\u2019s a small victory for this week but as the phone starts to ring and responsibilities pile up again, I feel incapable, overwhelmed, burnt out and anxious. My husband is a sweet man but he is a very simple blue collar man who is not equipped to even understand how I can feel the way I do so I\u2019m meeting with a counselor this Wednesday even though we can\u2019t really afford it.

I confessed to him on June 3rd 2018, so about half a year after realizing that I am into boys too and in love with him. He seemed to have kind of figured that this might be the case, and knowing that the situation was highly stressful, I offered him to think about it for some time first (so he'd know how to respond properly). One week later, he rejected me as he is straight. From that day on, my life just got worse and worse, I began feeling utter sadness, either due to feeling lonely or for no apparent reason.\nHe and I have actually only gotten closer since that day, but it was always difficult for me to be around him without feeling hurt, and it still is. As I also have slight social anxiety too, I went to my school psychologist. After a few sessions, it got much better and I felt that we are done, so did the school psychologist. However, tjese emotions, the love is still there and in the past few days, being on a class trip with him and thus being close to him day and night, I felt all of this much more strongly. I even experienced something like a half breakdown, where a lack of sleep, audiosensory overload and these emotions led to a massive headache as well as short and shallow breath for about 30 minutes. I drowned everything out with music on my headphones. Since the trip, it hasn't improved at all, so far that I cried last night (and even though I often want to, I rarely ever get to actually cry).\n\nI don't know what to do, how to get over these emotions and my love for him.

        "original": "Background: \nSince I was 6 I remember crying over how fucked up the world is. I have been very low for as long as I can remember (as I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with anything I\u2019m going to avoid using the term depressed, even though I fit every single symptom.) I never quite had my own personality, I remember always just giving everything I have to make other people happy and not myself, going to humiliating extents just to please others and try to fit in. I always wanted to fit in. I was sexually abused by my sister at 9. By 13-14 I got insanely self-conscious, and absolutely hated my family, I realise now it\u2019s because I blamed them for never realising what my sister used to do. I self-harmed often and was constantly suicidal. I had plenty of friends though because I always made sure it\u2019s well hidden out of a fear of not fitting in, I was even one of the most popular kids throughout all of my high school years. I could never tell anyone anything though. I also always maintained an A+ in all my subjects. My parents were quite conservative and had no clue what mental illness was, not that it mattered because I showed them no symptoms, but that\u2019s almost how the entire country was ( Arab country). The psychiatric ward is even known as the loony bin throughout almost  the entire population. It\u2019s very looked down upon and till now I could never tell them. Anyways, when I was 15 I had a chance to be an exchange student in America and I just had to pass an exam. This meant the entire fucking world to me. If only I can pass this exam I can go to a more open minded country where I can get help, where I can be myself, where I can finally live away from my toxic family. It meant the only way to happiness. I promised if I failed I would end it all. I failed. I remember reading the results and feeling this huge kind of electric charge go through my brain. And since then I have felt nothing. I\u2019m 19 now in my second year of medical school. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in my body or I can control my actions 90% of the time. I feel like I\u2019m just watching someone\u2019s life. The person in my head is completely different than the person on the outside. My personality is just a mixture of different aspects I liked of a lot of different people\u2019s personalities. I don\u2019t know who I am. I have nothing original. My personality changes depending who I\u2019m talking to so I bond with them, so I am good friends with individuals, but bring two different people together and I can\u2019t function. I can not think for my self. Whenever I try to talk to anyone about my slightest feelings I break down and start crying. That is the only time I cry. There is absolutely no way I can tell my parents anything because of how close minded they are. I want to see a psychiatrist for the first time and finally get a diagnosis but there\u2019s no way I can afford one. These past two years of medical school have been an insane rollercoaster of substance abuse and regret. I currently have this amazing gf who I greatly helped with her diagnosed mental illnesses over the course of 3 months, as I am this great symbol of positivity for everyone I meet, and she just realised that I myself, am not okay. When she did she said \u2018you helped me, now it\u2019s your turn.\u2019 I then tried pushing her away and told her that it\u2019s more trouble than she can imagine, but what\u2019s crazy is that she wouldn\u2019t budge and she stayed. I told her I\u2019m not okay and I need help but I can\u2019t afford it so that\u2019s it chapter closed, and she offered to pay for my full treatment. I rejected it because I can\u2019t let anyone do that much for me, I don\u2019t feel like I deserve it because she thinks I\u2019m all happy all the time and social, so I feel like I\u2019m tricking her, making her think I\u2019m someone that I\u2019m not. Since then I\u2019ve quit the drugs hoping being sober will make me feel better, but it changed nothing. I\u2019m at a loss. I don\u2019t feel happy I don\u2019t feel sad just energetic or tired or angry. \n\nNotes: I haven\u2019t self-harmed in 2-3 years now, I realise that my parents love me and I love them, but that still doesn\u2019t change their views. I have to interact with my sister often and she pretends nothing ever happened (she is 5 years older). The last time I felt happy was when I tried MDMA, before that I don\u2019t remember feeling happy.\n\nTL;DR: I believe I have a mental illness, but my parents and the country they live in look down heavily on mental illnesses, and they would never offer to treat me, and I cannot afford it by myself. I met this amazing girl and she\u2019s offering to pay, but I cannot accept that much from her.",

I'm a 17 year old guy who is in grade 12 and I feel so completely empty.

They talk to me less, never really call me to hang out anymore and will make plans to go to lunch when I'm literally sitting a desk away and don't invite me. Socially, school is hell but in the weirdest way. I'm not disliked but I just can't seem to connect with anyone at all. Talking to people is easy, as long as i smile and make a few jokes people don't dislike my company but I haven't been able to connect to anyone I know who I didn't meet in elementary school. All I can do is act like everything's fine because the last person people want to be around is a depressed, unmotivated person with no social life outside of school and work. And yeah, my social life really sucks. Remember in the title when I mentioned an ever-present sense of apathy? Well I truly can't find anything I enjoy doing anymore. I was never one for sports, I never enjoyed clubs like chess club, tried ski club and enjoyed the activity but I never felt welcome with my group kind of ignoring me (and abandoning me a few times \"by accident\") even things I used to enjoy I'm finding myself doing less. Two of my best friends moved away withing two years of each other and I gotta say that really sucked. I'm still in contact with one through video games online and we used to play nearly every night. But, as time moved forward, he started getting a social life and coming online less and the whole situation sucks. I'm obviously happy that he is meeting new people after he moved and he's still making friends but I'm still angry and I don't even know at what. I'm not mad at him for having a life, but I still feel so alone that I need to be mad at something. It hurts a lot because he was one of my best friends that I would have actually trusted with anything but I am seeing him less. We used to play video games all night sometimes but now I can't even play alone for an hour because I just don't find it fun without him. The few nights he's online I have a great time and act like everything's fine because the last thing I want to do is lose the few hours that I actually enjoy. I find myself at home doing almost nothing anymore. The last few things I enjoy are reading books and listening to music.  To just put it simply, I'm losing my friends, can connect with almost no one, can't seem to enjoy anything and am just always crushed by the unwillingness to care about anything. I don't know what to do anymore. University is still 2/3rds of a year away and I'm holding out hope that it will be better but im still depressed right now.

        "original": "Doctor ignores my ADHD/ ADD concerns\n\nI am a 20y/o F. So I\u2019m a university student. Never tried at all in high-school and passed with decent enough marks to get me into one of the top 5 unis in Canada. That is when things took a turn, I started noticing cognitive issues, namely, racing thoughts, to the point where I\u2019d think something was seriously wrong with me. I was annoyed with myself because of this. The harder I tried to focus, the more my mind became filled with thoughts. I had always been a procrastinator, but that habit was more costly and unaffordable in university, because the tasks needed more purposeful time to complete. I couldn\u2019t just start a paper the night before because whereas in high school, the length was 2 pages, in uni, it was 10. Things were just not working out, and after speaking to a friend who was clinically diagnosed with adhd, we concluded that I may be suffering from it too. I went to my schools counselling services, who referred me to the student academic support program, and I was somewhat assessed (nothing major and effective). That was first year. In 2nd year, I discovered nootropics; namely ginkgo biloba and rhodiola rosea. Those helped me immensely, but had some unpleasant side effects, such as headaches and upset stomachs, so I\u2019d stop taking them or I\u2019d take them cyclically, if that makes sense. After failing stats once and withdrawing twice, I decided this was not normal and I needed to seriously asses myself to see what the heck was going on. That\u2019s when I realized, that was the only class where last minute studying was not working, meanwhile it was somewhat working for the rest of my courses. That is when I first visited my doctor ( I visited her 2 more times in the past 10 months) and told her of my *symptoms*, which include the following: \n\n- restlessness\n- racing thoughts\n- trouble focusing and being present\n- horrible spending habits\n- not able to communicate plots well. (I.e, always going on tangents when speaking and not being able to tell someone a story or even without either forgetting where I was at)\n- very impulsive (often times going on shopping sprees with money I don\u2019t have, which has placed me in 4K of commodity card debt aka credit card debt.)\n- something else that I recently started noticing the more I indulged in this substance, is sleepiness when I drink coffee; like extreme exhaustion, both mentally and physically, meanwhile, when I am well rested and don\u2019t have coffee, one would mistake me for being on coffee.\n- forgetfulness (I.e., forgetting my wallet on the grocery queue carpet, forgetting things as soon as I walk into the room)\n- back to impulsivity, I started 2 business ventures in the last 3 months and often times I\u2019d be very spunky and energetic about it initially then motivation would drop to 0 after.\n- hard time retaining information and especially when reading ( I\u2019m doing a double major in Econ and pol s which requires a lot of readings)\n- overall lack of motivation at times, unless I\u2019m on some sort of stimulant.\n- lack of discipline and self control\n- very talkative\n- brain fog\n- always late\n\nSome of my coping methods have been:\n- meditation \n- time blocking ( helped immensely )\n- binaural beats when studying \n- working out in the mornings (slowly became less consistent with that and haven\u2019t gone in 2 months) \n- pomodoro timer when studying \n- nootropics I.e., ginkgo biloba, rhodiola rosea, wanting to try lions mane and ordering it soon. \n\nMany may and why I wasn\u2019t diagnosed earlier and here is why: my parents are very strict Christians, and don\u2019t believe in that stuff. Very simple.\n\nEven with all of this being disclosed to her, she ignores my concerns and tries to get me to coop through management?? IDoesn\u2019t even suggest any assessments. I\u2019m tired of going to her and have decided to go to a medicenter instead (common public clinic) What should I do? Or possibly do I maybe not have ADD and could it be something else? Forgot to mention: I went to the same doctor 2 years ago for some blood tests as I was constantly tired with heart palpitations (sleeping in class etc) and it was concluded that I was anemic, but the doctor told me I wasn\u2019t, yet she wrote it down and I found out about through a student doctor (one of her interns I\u2019m guessing) who assessed me while I was waiting for her. Don\u2019t know why he had such easy access to my file.\n\n*TLDR:* I am 20F. I\u2019m afraid I have undiagnosed ADHD/ ADD and no one I haven gone to, has helped. I\u2019m in uni so the effects on my grades and my mental health are what triggered an alarm in my head to get checked out. Was not diagnosed when I was younger because of religious upbringing which placed a stigma around mental health issues. Doctor put me down as anemic 2 years ago and never told me anything.",

It was horrible and it made me feel even worse about myself than I already did. Fast forward to 2017, I found some good friends who made me feel important and I committed myself to work out and eat healthier. I started losing weight rapidly and got down to a fairly healthy 170 pounds. I felt good and I held my head high and felt good enough about my body to take of my hoodie sometimes and just wear a t shirt around my friends, they commented on how they didn\u2019t think they had ever seen me without a hoodie on before and even told me that I had a pretty good body which made me feel so happy. That summer, I stayed at that weight for a while, but I realized that I was out of JR high and I\u2019m all of a sudden facing high school. People at school are brutal, I\u2019m stressed, my best friends split off to different schools, and here I was, exactly how I felt before. I very VERY quickly fell back into my old habits, eating myself to death, gaining weight as rapidly as I did before, wishing I could kill myself and just be done, the year now is 2018 and I\u2019ve lost my self respect and my pride, my girlfriend gave me some more confidence but stress from my parents was only making things worse at home. I gained more weight and was back to about 200 pounds. 30 pounds back already. The year now is 2019 and I\u2019m in the same habits, I\u2019m happier now and things have calmed down, my friends and I are on good terms now and we get together frequently. The issue is, I can\u2019t get rid of it. I\u2019m constantly craving the stimulation from the food and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. It takes over my mind and forces it down my throat. I want to say no but I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t control it and I hate it.

I\u2019m sick of it and all I want, all I ever wanted, was to be confident. And it scares the shit out of me that my best days might already be behind me.

It started senior year of high school during drama where I essentially lost all but 2 friends. I was extremely depressed during that time and had 0 motivation. After months I was able to pull myself back up out of that hole and regain many of the friends I lost. During freshman year of college I did a good job of putting it behind me and enjoying life. I essentially erased all those months from my memory along with the people who hurt me. However starting at the end of freshman year I kind of lost interest and excitement in life in general. It wasn\u2019t the same depression as before, I\u2019m not sad, I\u2019m more numb. \n\nI\u2019m a junior now and been this way since. Life kind of bores me and I don\u2019t have excitement for anything like I used to. I tried focusing on what used to make me happy, fishing, but I feel like I\u2019m just doing it cause it should make me happy. Over the past year I\u2019ve been thinking of my senior year more and more and remembering it and idk if that\u2019s correlated. I\u2019ve developed such a shit negative mindset about literally everything. From school, to hobbies, to the future, everything is gray and bleak when I think about it. I miss looking at something with excitement and interest. I\u2019ve also lost trust and hope in everyone. Everybody thinks they\u2019re some magician with the secret to happiness, but I think that there\u2019s nothing to improve anything and it pisses me off. \n\nI think a big issue is that before I had hope. I had hope that the future would be better, but now I don\u2019t want the future to come. I don\u2019t want to get a 9-5 job,  only be off on the weekends, settle down and have a family, and get older. I feel like I\u2019m in the prime of my life, but it still doesn\u2019t feel great. I\u2019ve started to not trust friends and think that they don\u2019t want to be friends with me and that they purposely exclude me on hanging out. It\u2019s probably related to when many of them dropped me senior year, our friendships have never felt the same, there\u2019s just always been something there between us.\n\nI\u2019m extremely fortunate to be doing good in college, have a very supportive and loving girlfriend, and be very well off financially. However I\u2019m still not happy while I have no reason not to be.I wish to relive the past, I\u2019m numb towards the present, and depressed about the future. I want to improve my negative mindset in order to regain interests and excitement. I want to take charge of my life again and enjoy every moment of it instead of just existing.

        "original": " This will be long so please bear with me.\n\nFive years ago I had my first panic attack, or at least I think it was a panic attack. \n\nAt that time, I was in college and just happened to have recently gone through a bad break up. \n\nTo get my mind of things, I started going to the gym more frequently. I was already on supplements, particularly Jack3d preworkout and creatine, prior to going to the gym more often. I did not however up my dosage of supps. \n\nOn rare occasions, I would take Adderall or Ritalin for midterms and finals (I was not prescribed for it).\n\nI was also smoking weed. \n\nA couple days after taking Adderall to study, I went to the gym and did my usual Jack3d preworkout, and creatine afterwards. That same evening I took a hit off my weed pen (not dabs, just regular weed oil vape pen) before showering. As I bent over to pick some stuff up from my closet, I suddenly felt a headrush that I have never felt before. All of a sudden, I felt cold and scared. Everything I heard would echo. As I crawled in bed miserably, I could not feel anything but physical pain \u2013 my body started aching, my muscles were spasming, and I was clenching and scratching my body (not necessarily itchy but just inadvertently grasping myself in fear). After some time my chest started aching and feeling really hot. Mentally, I felt an overwhelming feeling of doom. I Honestly thought that I was about to die. I tried to sleep it off but I could just not fall asleep. \n\nI got up and started hyperventilating. At this point, I was just overwhelmed so I had my brother call an ambulance. However, before they came, I threw up and slowly started feeling better. They brought me to the back of the truck and took my vitals, but the paramedics couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with me \u2013 he did say that he thought it was the creatine. \n\nFor about 3-4 days after the incident, I would have terrible brain fog. Life literally felt like a dream, and it constantly felt like I just woke up and could not remember clearly what happened earlier that day. I had trouble focusing in class, and I would zone out even outside of class. Things got better tho after. \n\nI have not been able to smoke weed since then except for one time. The start of the high of marijuana where you start to lose track of time felt just like what I felt when my \u201cpanic attack\u201d started. To avoid any trouble, I told myself I will never smoke weed as it reminds me too much of the traumatic experience. To this day, I have not smoked weed. \n\nNow that I\u2019m a little older and got a better grip in life \u2013 working full time, secure job, got my own apartment - I\u2019m starting to consider what went down that night?\n\nSomething tells me it was something I ingested/took, especially because I felt better after expelling something out of my stomach, but I don\u2019t think It was the weed because I smoked from the same cartridge multiple times prior and felt just fine. \n\nCould the residual psychoactive properties of ADHD medication have interfered with my brain chemistry? I am also aware that Jack3d was very controversial with it\u2019s ingredients so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was that. \n\nOr could it just be a toxic combination of all of that plus mental stress? \n\nI know only a doctor will be able to find out the real cause but I wanted to know what you guys thought. \n\nThanks!",

        "original": "One of my best friends has been really going through it ever since he went to college. Here is some information to take into account.\n\n\\-Has been dating an amazing girl who is super wholesome, wonderful, smart, and comes from a loving family for about 4 years.\n\n\\-He is near genius\n\n\\-He comes from a family who couldn't provide the most amazing upbringing, his mom got deported to the UK when he was in elementary school, and his father was never there for emotional support.\n\nOnce he got to college, he started gaining random obsessions, it started with running, he was running 80+ miles a week and basically destroying himself over this new obsession. He said he would hate himself if he didn't run. He was training for a marathon with his girlfriend, working 20+ hour weeks, and getting straight A's in university (studying computer engineering) - he would set the curve on plenty of exams.\n\nHe then stopped running and gained a new addiction that was binging and purging. He (out of nowhere) started caring about his physique which was so unlike him, he always made it seem like he didn't care about what others thought of him. This became very extreme and he then became vegan (another obsession). A little bit down the road, he started cutting himself and burning himself.  (I only learned of all of these issues once he returned to my home town during a break.) I asked him how his semester was and he started laughing really loud and said its been horrible i've been cutting myself nonstop and binging and purging and he showed me.  I was extremely surprised because all of these issues seemed nothing like him.  Of course I asked why and told him to stop, and everything that a good friend would do.\n\nHe went back to school started seeing a therapist and continued to have a hard time. He started drinking a lot. (he has addiction in his genes). This continued for a long time never getting better. He broke up with his girlfriend in the beginning of his third year in college because he needed a change in his life so he wouldn't kill himself. He attempted to kill himself about 5 weeks ago and lived. He went on a 5150 hold. I helped him through this time and offered for him to stay at my place closer to our hometown....\n\nHe dropped the semester at his school and lived with me for about a week and I would look after him and try to help him obtain a new appreciation of life by having fun with me. He would break down quite a bit but he didn't want to kill himself during this period of time which was good. I finished my quarter in college and we went back to our hometown together. He started buying xanax and adderall and taking those a lot. I would always tell him not to. (a lot of the time he would take them and not tell me because he cares of my opinion a ton, in his suicide note I was one of the 4 people he addressed).\n\nNew years eve I take him to a couple of parties and stuff and monitor his drinking, I also made sure he never binged (I had to take plates away from him) because he would hate himself the next day if I didn't. We go to some parties and then he goes into a girls car to hook up with her. Me and my other friends are ready to leave around 1am and we look for him and find him extremely intoxicated. Apparently he snuck more alcohol into his system when he was with this girl and took  a decent amount of xanax earlier that day. He could barely speak so I took him to the hospital. I waited in the room with him for several hours and he looked really bad.\n\nThe doctor asked for all of his information so I gave it to them. They asked who his emergency contact is and he just looked at me. So I am now his emergency contact even though his father is in town. He is so scared about his father knowing of all of his issues. He tells me I wouldn't understand. He says his father uses people's vulnerability against them which I wasn't surprised to hear, however I believe that if his father knew of the severity of this situation, all he would want to do is help and support. \n\nThat morning once he got released, I drove him to my place and he said he was done with substances for at least 2 weeks. I was so glad. That night he did xanax and drank alcohol, and he did the next day. He is not pleasant to be around anymore and just uses me. He says that he appreciates my relationship with him and he will try to buy me things, I appreciate the gesture, but he can't buy me. About 10 days later (now) he is on his fourth day of aggressively binging and purging and cutting all over his body. He has panic attacks. He contacts every person in his contact list every night talking about his struggles, and they all come to me and ask wtf is going on with him.\n\nTHE FINAL STRAW\n\nMy girlfriend and I (2 years 7 months) broke up (on good terms) this Christmas Eve (\\~2 weeks ago) he hit her up and they have hung out 3 times since her and I broke up. He tried to make a move on her and she deflected and left. She drove home and cried the whole way home apparently because she felt violated. I haven't brought this up to him yet because I care about his safety and don't want him to kill himself because of this but I am still infuriated. My whole family is worried about me because of this situation between my him and I, I have extended myself to him so many times. His insurance sucks and he can't get in-patient care. He gets mad at me when I say he should tell his dad. At this point in my life, I don't even care if I am friends with him, I know I could have been considered an enabler in the past, I just want him to be safe and better. He said if I told his father that he would never speak to me ever again and hate me forever. Im okay with that, its better than the current situation. But what if he kills himself because I tell his dad? What do I do? He is really harming me mentally. I can take a lot but I also have stuff going on in my life, I can't bear this weight anymore.

        "original": "I'm a 30 year old male and I'm pretty sure I have undiagnosed autism. I've never posted on Reddit before, so forgive me if I'm breaking some sort of community norms or protocols. \n\nIt started in elementary school. I didn't talk to the other children at all. I still have old report cards from 2nd and 3rd grade which say things like: \"\\_\\_\\_\\_ is still very quiet but very well behaved\" etc. I was talkative at home but at school I was basically a mute. I had a great deal of trouble with learning to read, despite having an IQ around 126. As I got older I started to get comfortable in my school. I went to a very small elementary school and I spent years around the same kids, so I knew them practically like I was related to them. \n\nOnce I went to sixth grade it all started again. Add to that mix the fun of puberty and you can imagine how things went for me. I couldn't stand sitting still for hours at a time, I felt like I was going to explode. I felt angry and nervous all the time. I didn't talk to anyone, I stopped doing my schoolwork, and I spent all my time learning to play the guitar. It became an obsession. I could play entire albums from my favorite bands. After a while, my parents realized I was never going to start improving my grades again\u2014they let me drop out. This was probably the only period of my life when I was genuinely happy. I could stay home and focus on my music without any need to interact with people. However, it didn't last long.\n\nMy parents' marriage was falling apart and they had no interest in supporting a lazy kid with no job and no future. I got a job at the local Walmart and began paying rent, but my father would scream at me incessantly, complaining about bills. I later found out he was addicted to heroine, and everyone knew except for me. I'm assuming that's where my rent money went. I finally had no choice but to move out. I've been at Walmart for the past 12 years. I despise working there, but the thought of a rapid disruption to my life and routine is even worse. I can't imagine enjoying any job where I have to deal with people, so it's better to avoid the anxiety of starting again somewhere new. Also, I had found the rare job there that didn't involve direct interaction with customers, and I'm not sure if I'd be lucky enough to find another job like that.\n\nIn my twelve years at Walmart, my interests have turned much more intellectual. I spend all my free time learning about math, finance, economics, and accounting. My goal is to free myself from needing to be around people. However, I realizing more and more lately how futile this is. Even if I were a millionaire, I'd still need to go to doctors appointments, car servicing, jury duty, etc. If I have any one of these events upcoming I am filled with dread and anxiety. I just don't understand how \"normal people\" are supposed to act in these situations. \n\nI suppose most of these details are unnecessary, but writing this all out has been therapeutic. I'll list here some of the reasons I believe myself to be autistic.\n\nQuiet, monotone voice.\n\nTotal lack of social understanding.\n\nUnable to make eye contact.\n\nSpending time around people is exhausting.\n\nGreat interest in intellectual ideas, but no interest at all in day to day life.\n\nGreatly disturbed by unexpected events.\n\nNo interest in team activities. \n\nDifficulty focusing, unless it's something I'm particularly interested in.\n\nNo sense of direction, need GPS to navigate the town I grew up in.\n\nIf a business doesn't have a website and requires calling, I'll often just find another company.\n\nIt may sound, from this post, like I'm just a coward with no will to improve but I've actually tried a lot. I thought about \"forcing myself\" to be more normal. I walked around malls asking pre-scripted questions to strangers, \"do you have the time\", \"do you know where x is\" in order to combat my social anxiety. I've done CBT, positive affirmations, meditation, antidepressants. I even became a manager at my work for a year. My thinking was, I'll force myself into the situation and I'll have to adapt. I started out pretty good actually, but after a few months I was psychologically exhausted and broken. It actually got worse over time, not better. I've tried fasting, keto diet, vegan diet, carnivore diet. \n\nTo deal with the constant, gnawing misery I've abused a lot of exotic drugs. Nothing too serious, but I've used coffee obsessively, Kratom, modafinil, phenibut, and alcohol. I've quit everything except coffee and Kratom and I take an antidepressant now, but it doesn't seem to do much at all. What should I do? I don't think it would be wise to just call my doctor and say, \"hey, I think I'm autistic\". Even if that were the correct choice, I don't know if I'd have the nerve to do it. Any suggestions?",

        "original": "Throwaway account. Sorry this is a bit jumbled. I don\u2019t even know where to start. Backstory, my mother has struggled with severe depression, bipolar, and anxiety since before i was born. She always thinks the world is out to get her and that life isn\u2019t fair. Shes threatened suicide countless times in my life for things i have no control over. She jumps from job to job because people are out to get her. She moves from house to house because landlords are out to get her. I recently found out shes only been medicated for two years of her entire life and that was for depression. She is very incapable of being financially responsible because she makes snap decisions that wind up costing a lot of money. Example, she quits jobs without lining up another and not being able to pay rent. Every time she has to move or loses a job i end up paying the costs to keep her off the street. So tens of thousands of dollars by this point. I try to hold my ground but ultimately she just threatens to commit suicide or be homeless if i don\u2019t help.\n\nNow, about six months ago i bought her a trailer to live in on my cousins property. The agreement was, all she had to do was keep her job and live rent free and pay down her debts. Well, about a month ago my cousin calls me and tells me he\u2019s on his way to my house with my mom because she threatened to commit suicide after she got fired from her latest job and her employer appealed her unemployment, etc. Anyway, fast forward to now and shes staying with me and my family because she has no where else to go. I\u2019ve taken (paid) for my mom to see a therapist and get depression meds and caught her up on her car payments so it doesn\u2019t get repo\u2019d (another thousand). Theres a lot more expenses she needs to get caught up on that i dont want to pay for, but thats a separate conversation.\n\nThe issue im having is, she is stressing out my family (wife and 3 yr old daughter) and really causing me anxiety and an inability to focus at work because of what i know I have to come home to and the financial mess i feel like i have to help her with. Now i could just not help her but if i do that shell be homeless or dead. I have no idea what to do. What i was planning to do is get her medicated and see if she can hold down a job and eventually move out. The problem is, i just really need her out of the house and not living here. The constant doom and gloom and threats of suicide is draining. I went through plenty of that in my childhood and don\u2019t want to expose my daughter to it. So what do you do with a parent in their 50\u2019s who cant hold a job, has severe mental illness, and has no where to go?\n\nOther considerations, there are mental institution but they cost about $6k per week, which is crazy expensive.

This was a first run in with mental health issues.\n\nCome 8th grade, I was kicked out of my school (private) for managing to have a .5 GPA and dragging down the class average, so I moved back into public school. I got a haircut for the first time in ~2 years. I was doing great, minus the occasional days where depression decided to rear it's ugly head again. I got my first and 2nd girlfriends, I was surrounded by friends, and it felt great. I ended up taking on a \"protector\" role. I felt the need to protect and help my friends. If I'm honest, the attention I felt with all the praise felt great.\n\nThe summer after 8th grade, came my presumed 2nd run in with mental health. I just flat out felt nothing. Not happy, sad, mad, nothing. I didn't feel empathy, and I would even watch gore videos just to feel a bit of *something*. I lied about getting a diagnosis of Antisocial personality disorder to my friends, and they all thought it was so cool so I just ran with it. During this time I had managed to memorize my parents debt card info, and would almost daily order food. This went on for a couple months, and I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up ordering over $2k during that time. My parents were understandably pissed, and my dad asked \"Do you feel bad about this?\" And honestly, I didn't. I still don't. I can see how what I did is wrong but I didn't feel any remorse.\n\n9th grade rolls around, and I'm still going through my \"feeling nothing\" thing, and I meet a ray of sunshine in my nothingness. I ended up being madly in love with this girl, going so far as to fantasize about us being married and having a salmon dinner prepared for us when she got home. I confess, and she says no. Almost immediately I'm back in my nothingness state. Pretty much just \"well that happened.\". About a month later the familiar feeling of depression creeps back, and I honestly welcome it. Feeling nothing for ~6 months is boring. The rest of 9th grade continues, switching between being happy and normal and depressed.\n\nSummer of 9th rolls around, and I'm feeling stressed. I signed up for a summer geometry course, that alongside a summer job with insane hours brought me to the edge. I was honestly suicidal a couple times due to it. I became indulgent in sex, and food. My youth group and I go down to Oklahoma for a Christian youth camp, and I have the realization I feel nothing again. My brain is also blank, I can't really visualize anymore, and I can only think if I intentionally try to. But at the same time I'm also confident, it's easier to talk to people. It was weird.\n\n10th grade (this year) comes, and I'm excited to see my friends again. I ended up failing the 2nd semester of geometry due to me not doing the work, but I still ended up in Algebra 2 which was fine by me. My confidence was being to wane though, and comments people made would suddenly cut really deep even if they wouldn't before. I'm stuck searching for a purpose, but can't find it. I have gotten involved with some groups I probably shouldn't be with. \n\nTowards Christmas, a similar feeling comes over me not unlike the previous two summers. But this time I wanted power. For whatever reason I became obsessed with the idea of becoming a dictator, invading Canada, and caring for the American and Canadian people. All of it seems a bit laughable in retrospect. Following this came a deep depression but ended up only lasting a few days.\n\nCut to now. It's 2nd semester of sophomore year, and I still can't form an image in my mind, it's a fog. I've grown a stronger affinity for math as I'm pretty good at it. I'm exhausted, but at the same time confident. I know that if I actually tried in school I could easily beat everyone. People have begun to accuse me of being narcissist. It seems even little blows to my ego piss me off, today being a great example of someone saying I'd just be pitty fuck. It just ruined my day. People aren't taking my advice anymore when I would have worked and it annoying.\n\nCouple other bits I should add, but I'm too lazy to edit into the actual paragraphs. From middle school till now I was a compulsive liar and got extremely got at it. On July 13, 2017 I tried to kill myself.\n\nI'm not looking for a diagnosis, but rather guidance. Is this just some weird depression? Am I really a narcissist? I just want a path that could lead me to being happy again.",

        "original": "I\u2019m 18, I grew up being the outcast of my family, I wasn\u2019t as social as the others were. I was the one they picked on for fun, I was the one my brother used to take all his anger out on. I can\u2019t really blame him, he was only following our dad doing the same to both of us because we were \u201ctoo weak\u201d and he would \u201cfucking knock us into next week\u201d. To my mother we were just failures and every time we got bruised we would just be too much of princesses to deal with it. She would always blame herself though saying she had to have failed so much to have ended up with us.\n\nMy first depressive episode was when I was 6, when I was 8 I tried to escape the pain and suicide but I ultimately ended up just crying myself to sleep, waking up the next day with all the bruises from accidentally laughing over a tv ad and disturbing my dad. When I was 10 I was in like a state of constant panic because I didn\u2019t want to deal with my home life and I was only ever bullied at school, so I basically just stopped eating breakfast because I would just end up throwing it up, if I threw up at home I was a \u201cfaking shit\u201d, if I threw up at school it was just another one of my problems, eventually I was just getting yelled at because I \u201cwas going to end up ruining this family\u201d that I \u201cwas going to make us have to split up because of my whining\u201d. This was also the year my mother left a goodbye note and we thought for like 5 hours that she had probably killed herself, we tried calling and calling but my siblings and I just ended up mostly sitting there crying while my dad was passed out, she eventually came back like nothing happened so yeah. Later that year my dad also got really bad and had plans of killing all of us and himself, he called an army mate and told him, the army mate then secretly told us to run. Like we\u2019re good no one was hurt so yep. After this point I kind of just started going numb and now I just don\u2019t feel most things. I kind of stopped seeing suicide as way to release me from pain that would hurt others, I started just seeing it as peace, the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\nBasically all throughout school I was an outsider I was basically just a socially awkward weirdo. I was bullied heavily all throughout school basically. Except this one class I had where they didn\u2019t bully me, people in there weren\u2019t always nice to me, but some were kind of nice, that class is probably the greatest people I have ever met not because they were my friends or anything but mostly because they just didn\u2019t treat me like shit. \n\nI\u2019ve liked two people, at the start all I could think was that if I asked them then they would be sick or embarrassed or like laugh, but I get close to them when I was 15 she stopped talking to me and avoided me. The second one I was 17 and she actually got to know me more, I actually kind of opened up to her, I then told her how I felt, she immediately stopped talking to me, she then used what I told her against me, and then screwed over my graduation a bit, she then spread some rumours and I lost another friend.\n\nOne time I had this friend she was two years younger one day she told me she was depressed, and I thought I could care about her how I always wanted someone to care about me, I tried helping her and trying to get her to a more comfortable position where she would open up more. But ultimately people started hating me for it and then she stopped talking to me.\n\nI never fit in at uni and I didn\u2019t care for the work, I don\u2019t really care about anything anymore, most things tend to just annoy me to a point that I hate them. Like I hate most things. I\u2019m so done. I hate being around people.\n\n\nA part of me though just wants someone caring to like find me and just hug me saying everything is going to be okay, but it wouldn\u2019t matter because if they\u2019re real I would never trust them, they must be getting something from it maybe they\u2019re just using me who knows. Sometimes I try and find ways to create a person in my head because if I could create like a nice hallucination maybe that would be good enough. Honestly though I just want peace, I\u2019m so done.\n\n\nNow you\u2019re probably going to say \u201cget a pillow\u201d or \u201cget a psychiatrist/psychologist\u201d I\u2019ve had plenty of both and they really don\u2019t help. \n\nHonestly I just really want to go, I just really want that peace of nothingness, but even if I stay it will probably only ever get worse, and some where done the line I\u2019m gonna want to make people hate me in order for me to just finally die, and have my peace without such an impact on them. \n\n\nI honestly don\u2019t think anyone will read this let alone comment so who knows.",

I've suffered with severe depression for 4 years, I've cut off all my friends because of it (and honestly I wasn't close with them anyway, so). I also don't speak to any of my family except my parents but I've always had a complicated relationship with them...I don't feel comfortable talking to them about anything. The few times I've even tried to open up to them about how bad I'm feeling and I've been met with either extremely bad basic advice (\"go for a walk!!(:\" or they just straight up scuff and dismiss my worries altogether. \n\nAlso, my dad is apart of some of my problems. He's always been controlling and kept me from getting a job after high school, and is still keeping me from getting one because he wants me to do what he wants. He wants me to go to college and nothing else, but I'm not currently in college because he hasn't given me the money to do so. \n\nSo I spend most of the day at home doing nothing all the time. It's incredibly isolating and lonely and it's slowly taking its toll on me. In addition to mental problems I already had, I developed tinnitus a couple years ago, which I've been struggling with profusely. \n\nI have so much sadness bottled up inside me. I went to the doctor not long ago and she was so kind...the second she started asking me if I was depressed I almost started crying. Later when I went home I DID cry. It was the first time someone had acknowledged I was in pain. That wasn't even why I was at the doctors...she just told me I looked unhappy. She could tell just by looking at me that I was suffering and I ask myself everyday how this stranger could see it and not my own parents. Anyway, she tried to help me. She put me on antidepressants but I had to stop taking those because it made my tinnitus worse. I can't even seek help for my depression. \n\nAnd I don't have anyone to talk to. There's nothing I can do to help myself. Nothing. I'm trapped. \n\nAnd I don't have the energy to fight anymore. I'm only 22 and this life has taken so much out of me. What I wrote here isn't even the half of it. Nothing has ever gone right for me. I feel like one day I will end up taking my own life because it's the only option I have.

Deep inside, I still thought medication didn't radically changed things, like it didn't affect one's personality that much so I thought I was gonna be totally fine.\nThe withdrawal symptoms hit real hard, I barely passed my classes because I couldn't be productive for shit, I was horny everyday for like 2 weeks (its not that fun when your SO is on finals too), I was exhausted all day long and needed at least 12 hours of sleep a day and everything would make me angry.\n\nAnd now, I realized I'm actually not that nice. I'm impatient and hotheaded, not as fun as I thought, don't like people as much as I used to and, basically, I didn't remember I was a bitter introvert.\nIt makes me anxious to think that maybe people like the person I was on meds but hate this version of me but hey, that's my business and I'm proud of me for doing so well and getting so far and you should too, no matter where you are now.\n\n\nAccepting you need help doesn't make you weak. In fact, for some people, taking medication made a big difference in their journey to stop feeling like shit. It's not \"depending on drugs\", it might help you control your emotions so you can approach them more calmly and try to find a way to feel better that works for you. Then, if you're gonna stop taking them, please get help from a psychiatrist, don't just fuck up your doses like I did. \ud83d\uddff\n\nI particularly feel like taking them saved me from fucking it all up during one of my panic attacks and helped me feel more comfortable with the changes I needed to make in my life.\nDo whatever you feel like you need to do but NEVER stop trying to heal yourself.

The past few years I\u2019ve been dealing with multiple health problems. \n   It started with kidney stones and that may be my worst health problem. Not only is the pain the worst I\u2019ve ever felt in my life but it\u2019s also brought on an anxiety I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll ever get past.

On top of that, the last 8 months or so I\u2019ve be dealing with severe abdominal and pelvic pain (I have another long post on that) and can\u2019t seem to get it diagnosed. I\u2019ve had a colonoscopy, xrays, ultrasound and nothing.

        "original": " \n\nI'm a 21 yr old Male who has pretty bad self esteem when it comes to my looks and when it comes to things i'm not good at. I have many things I consider problems and i'm going to address them below.\n\n**1.** I get depressed after a certain amount of time when I start to feel like I can't become good enough. I have a thing for wanting to be in the top 1% of whatever I'm currently doing. For example, I play a lot of video games competitively and when I reach the top 1% of the ranking latter in those games I feel a little better about myself. For a while... that happiness fades usually.\n\nAnother example of my competitive drive that sometimes drives me to be depressed is when I used to play sports. When I was 15 just entering high school, I've never played a sport seriously before. I played baseball and I had fun at first but as I was playing everyday I had unrealistic expectations out of myself which drove me to break down mentally and just never play the sport again because I feared I would never become a MLB player or play in the minors so I just dropped the sport completely. I don't necessarily regret it but it just annoys me that I can't have fun at most things besides watching T.V/Movies. It makes me pretty sad that I can't connect with a lot of people. There's a few I connect with but the problem is there like me which I don't believe is a good thing.\n\nThe only things I have fun at is when I know i'm one the best at the curtain activity that i'm doing. Which I believe is a terrible way to live if the only way you can have true fun is being the best at whatever you're trying to do. I also almost always envy the people that are better than me at whatever I'm doing. This for me goes for everything in life, such as there better looking than me (Or if I think they are), better than me at a sport, better than me at cooking, and the list goes on. Now I don't necessarily always envy people who are better than me at everything. It depends on the activity or subject I'm trying to be the best at. Right now i'm trying to improve my looks to become great looking. So whenever I see people I believe are hotter than me I just get annoyed/sad/almost an anger because I know there better than me. This goes for guys and girls, doesn't matter. If I think a girl is better looking than me I just get annoyed, I don't get attracted, horny, or pleased by the aesthetics which I find abnormal for me.\n\nNow I understand that you can improve your looks to a point but I realized that I can become great looking by:\n\n1. Getting to a body fat percentage between 8-13% body fat with the sufficient muscle mass. I also believe my insertions are good enough to be aesthetically pleasing (At least I hope). I made my own plan to gain muscle mass by following my routine to go to the gym on a Push/Pull/Leg split. Also by eating enough protein for my body weight and doing every exercise I can at great intensity while also having correct form.\n2. Skin care, I have pretty decent skin but I'm improving it everyday with the proper materials.\n3. Getting clothes that are stylish + fit my body very well.\n4. Whitening my teeth to a point where there white like the fitness models/models for males.\n5. Just having great hygiene in general.\n\nI also am only trying to become hot so I can get laid a lot more easier on apps such as tinder/bumble. I did tests on what kind of numbers (Matches with responses) models can pull and the numbers are staggering so I don't want anyone telling me looks don't matter if your just trying to get laid with the hottest women available on those apps.\n\nHonestly I just want to feel like I can wake up in the morning and not have to think about how I'm going to fuck hot women and how I'm going to be the best at something. I also have a sex addiction to wanting to bang hot girls consistently off of only tinder/bumble. I don't blame the women/girls that are very hot for not wanting to bang me yet because I know for a fact I don't have the muscle mass nor the right pictures for tinder/bumble yet to be considered hot on the app. As for real life goes, I see girls/guys that I think are hot but I envy them because that have what I want which is to be hot.\n\nIt just sucks that I go through this cycle a lot of trying to be the best and trying to be great looking so I can get sex a lot easier. I'm not going to go through the hassle of getting rejected by hot girls consistently to only fuck one once a month if I can even do that! I don't believe in changing my personality because I believe people who change there personality to only fuck hot girls are disgusting. I'd rather improve my aesthetics to do that because I believe it's more morally acceptable to me.\n\nThese are my main issues and I have no idea how to go about them. I'm just hoping someone knows the disorder that I have. I'm not sure if I'm just a sociopath which I don't think I am because I still have somee feelings for people. I just want to feel better in the mornings and not feel like shit when I see hot girls/guys. I'm a guy and hot girls make me feel even worse than hot guys. It just makes me feel bad because I'm not sure if I even will accomplish this goal of being hot. It's possible I still won't be hot with the added muscle mass/other things combined.\n\nI also feel like a terrible person because of my view points. I just wish I could be more normal. How do I let go of my competitive drive? Or just let go of wanting to fuck every hot girl I see on tinder or in real life, I mean In the back of my head I envy them a lot but I would still want to do them. How do I not feel bad about myself for other people just being better? I think about how I'm going to improve my workout every morning and every night. I just want to think of other things beside my goals because it makes me pretty depressed thinking about not being able to live up to the standards that I have.\n\nIf someone has experienced this behavior before please share it. I've looked over the internet and haven't found anyone with similar qualities to this. Sorry if some of you think these qualities are disgusting, but I have no one else I want to share it with.",

Literally had a therapy session, the first ever I was so excited 13 year to late. Like 12 hours before and. I felt peace? Idk how to describe it but when I clocked in yeah. 14 hours away, over 165 miles. Atlanta traffic. Definitely not \u201cI\u2019ll make absolutely sure you make the appointment no worries.\u201d \nIf I told y\u2019all a positive to the easy way is, blank, I\u2019m not saying it because I\u2019m not holding responsibility if your going through a bad time instead comment. Message me. \nRealizing this scared me. What made me leave the company all together is I understood the evil. What drives someone to become an active shooter in school, it never got that bad but at 25. The best company ever like really the managers are the only negative. If This didn\u2019t happen I\u2019d be there. But being there and their discrimination man. They have no idea what happened. I told the only person today I actually admitted I had been molested, but I don\u2019t know how many times. I know one yeah. But I just know I felt uncomfortable in another with someone else. It is who you don\u2019t expect sadly. 2 out of the acceptable zero is science. \nI\u2019ll tell anyone who reads this today, there\u2019s so much guilt because I feel responsible at 12 years old for two people deaths. Broken back in someone I had to help move, I wasn\u2019t very strong just fat. And the other, had the look on the face like he had given up. I replaced their son, who drunk driving stole. But when it came to the end I can\u2019t recall the last time I saw my dad alive. And the state alone I found him in for some reason despite the ambulance and fire trucks, my grandma whom was chief of police, I felt like he could wake up. And well it didn\u2019t help me and gran stood not even 5 feet from him. And they didn\u2019t cover him up. And yeah y\u2019all \n\nPlease understand I still haven\u2019t talked to anyone at the time of writing this. I\u2019m not going to regret hurting those I care about by me making a rash decision. But I was so close to me not hurting myself with all this shit I have not been able to answer, or come up with a reason and accept it. I want to move on. Stop being freaked out when I\u2019m suppose to freak out and show compassion I literally just said my mental health is not okay. 3 years I\u2019ve tried. And now I feel farther than ever and it\u2019s literally another job with insurance. Not hard for a truck driver. But I\u2019m . Taking a breath. Because this was by meant to be this long. \n\n\nIF YOU SKIPPED HERE\nThe books topic is from an active shooters perspective, which the happy ending is the pain he\u2019s been dealing with ending for the second time since he was 12 hours from it. AND the person truly responsible is face to face, the last one. He hears what he went through, how his family never asked about if he\u2019s okay. The time he lost control and cried reentering the home and his mother Yells and bitches at him \u201cwhy you crying like that damn attention seekin your embarrassing me crying like that.\u201d \n\nParents, NO, bad. Don\u2019t do this, ever. Okay? Okay.\nNo more of the book because spoilers. \n\nAnyway, it\u2019s exactly the opposite of how I reacted. I\u2019m not evil, I\u2019m the nicest most pushover  guy alive. So if I say I can understand what would drive it, the way I paint imagery when I actually try and write, pulling emotion from using the correct synonym, and resonating tone. I can really have the reader understanding that they\u2019re not crazy, they\u2019re driven crazy in atleast most cases. Compassion is humanity, but humanity is so afraid to show compassion. Yet it\u2019s so simple. In many cases that\u2019s all it takes. I\u2019ve been thrust through many moments, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m attracting them but they won\u2019t beat me.\n\nInstead I want to use them to try and get some good. Eventually I\u2019ll get a therapist. Eventually I know. If I can save someone who may be put in that situation, or forced into that situation of hurting others, then I will be able to say I\u2019m okay with anything in life. Because this wasn\u2019t school. I\u2019m 25 and was bullied into this at a great job, by practically the whole warehouse and I did what I was told, and made my money and went home. No extra because I was fixed on therapy and insurance. Then my great granddad beat alshymers and I can\u2019t do math very well. 10 days, not 33. Lol insurance right there. But nope bad math is over a month away and I couldn\u2019t even simply tell my boss I needed another grievance day. I had to panic attack it to him.\n\nI\u2019ll keep y\u2019all posted on the book, I feel like if I do it right maybe it will do something. Stop ignoring how you feel, it will build up. I promise. You can\u2019t keep it down forever. I tried. Now I\u2019m making it or nahhhhh YEEEEET",

        "original": "Good morning, Reddit!\n\nNot quite sure how to start this so I'm going to provide a summary of my relatively recent medical history and go from there. I've always been overweight, except for a brief period in my early teens -- I think that's probably significant and should be mentioned. Entered the realm of obesity in college, fought my way back to overweight, and have been oscillating back and forth between the two ever since. About five years ago, I started to experience symptoms of major depressive disorder. This went undiagnosed for about another two years -- I figured at the time it was SAD or similar. In March of 2016 I had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery due to severe gall stones. I've had recurring stomach attacks since then -- Possibly due to Sphincter of Oddi disorder, but it's undiagnosed. Had several bloodwork panels and MRI's to diagnose the problem, and nothing was coming up. Had a doctor specializing in lower abdomen pain suggest Sphincter of Oddi as a fairly common disorder occurring after the removal of the gallbladder. Haven't been able to afford to follow up any further as of now. In the summer of 2017, I started seeing a psychologist who diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder (unspecified), morbid obesity, binge eating disorder (Man, this is fun to write.), and of course, chronic abdominal pain. After working with the psychologist for about three months with little to no progress, I moved in to the medication side of depression management. Started with SSRI's -- Fluoxetine, moved to Trazodone, then had a prescription for an SNRI that I can't remember the name of for a while, did some mixed dosages between another SSRI and Bupropion, moved to just Bupropion, and as of now have discontinued all antidepressants. They have so far served to amplify the oscillation of my mood, without alleviating the problem in any way. The one medication I've found that has helped to some degree is Vyvanse -- Not an antidepressant, but a stimulant has helped to some extent with binge eating and helped a great deal with focusing at work and having the energy to get moving in the morning. I don't have the money to continue with ineffective treatments at the moment -- I know the process is slow and it's all about finding the right combination for my body, but I've been working at it for over two years now and I'm more depressed than I was when I started. Today is one of those rare days where I woke up with the energy to at least reach out for help, so I figured I'd start here.\n\nA couple of things to note -- I'm 29 years old, turning 30 this year. I have a steady job, and have had one for the last two years. Prior to that I was in college. I've dropped out of college in the short term, as my mental health was having a serious impact on my grades. I'm nearly finished with my degree and intend to return once I have this under control enough to be able to function. (I was a physics major in my last year, if that's relevant.) I come from a family that was upper lower class -- We always had food, but sometimes it was the same soup for a week. Some history of emotional abuse, nothing that was all that terrible compared to what some people go through. I've got a stable and fairly happy relationship with both parents and my sibling at this point. I'm in a long term relationship, been dating the same person for about two and a half years now. She's the one who encouraged me to see a psychologist originally, and has been an absolute pillar of support.\n\nI know losing weight would have a significant impact on my mental health. I've been absolutely unable to make myself go to the gym, or even do exercises at home. This hasn't always been true -- I ran daily for years (1-2 miles, occasionally a 10k) and two years ago, a friend and I went to the gym three times a week every week for six months and were making substantial progress. He and I were roommates at the time, and when he moved in with his wife (And my dog died at around the same time) our gym habit fell apart. So I'm not unfamiliar with exercising, or routine. I just can't summon up the energy or effort to start. I'm aware that my current path is very self destructive -- My job is sedentary (I work in IT providing remote support) and the only time I leave my house these days is when I absolutely have to for groceries or once a week to hang out with the same friend from before. I'm obese, and approaching an age where that will start to have a compound effect on my health. I can't bring myself to care, however -- I'm not actively suicidal, but the thought of no longer existing is relieving rather than worrying.\n\nA part of my issue right now I believe is an absolute sense of isolation. I have one friend whom I still see with any regularity, and every other friend I made in college moved away and fell out of contact. I see my partner on weekends, but she works nights and I work days, so we're on opposite sleeping schedules. I have the same issue summoning the energy to go out and form new friend groups that I do with going to the gym -- I'm introverted by nature and that requires a fairly large investment of energy that I don't know how to bring to bear at the moment.\n\nThis has been a fairly rambling and wandering post to get around to this: Do you have any advice on where to go next for help? I don't WANT to hate my life. I want to be happy again. I just can't seem to figure out how to get there. If there are any medications you would recommend, or specialists, I'd be happy to look into anything I can. I just can't afford to continue with a therapy path that hasn't provided any results in two years. I looked through the FAQ and didn't see much outside of what I've looked into when I first started down the clinical path, so I figured a post might help.\n\nThanks for your time, and sorry again for the state of the post. Having a devil of a time organizing all of this into something coherent.",

I had started going to therapy because I felt isolated and depressed after moving back home with my parents after living with friends, so that I could afford pre-Med courses. I was also having mild suicidal thoughts due to my constant low grade anxiety which caused depression. \n\nI ended up taking generic Zoloft and I remember the feeling on the first day of taking it was like the sun had come out for the first time in months and I was able to breathe without a weight on my chest. It was honestly a great feeling and the medication REALLY worked for me. That year I made a lot of new friends, met my future wife, and excelled at work. After about a year my doctor and I decided to wean me off of the pills because we had originally discussed not wanting to be on them forever. \n\nI\u2019m now a decade older, a father of a 1 year old, and happily married with more responsibilities at work. It\u2019s hard to tell if my anxiety has built back up over the years or my new responsibilities are just more stressful. I don\u2019t really have suicidal thoughts anymore (unless I have a really bad day like once a year) but I always wonder if I should be back on Zoloft to improve my quality of life. \n\nObviously this is more of a discussion to have with a medical professional, but I wanted to get third party impressions first (I\u2019ve talked to my wife but she\u2019s obviously biased and just wants the best for me). The anxiety isn\u2019t exactly preventing me from doing ok in life, but I get the feeling sometimes that being on Zoloft could greatly improve my enjoyment and fulfillment in life. Sometimes things feel a bit blunted and unemotional I suppose and I don\u2019t know the last time I\u2019ve really been super happy other than the birth of my daughter. How do I know if I should be on medication or not?\n\nEdit: although the Zoloft worked great there were some sexual side effects which were annoying (difficulty achieving orgasm mostly), so it wasn\u2019t without downsides. \n\nTLDR: have GAD and maybe some depression.

I've always struggled with my mental health throughout my life but this is different. To start this off, I was living with my grandmother for a few years. My friend since elementary (A) and a close friend I had made two years prior (B) had been staying with me for a month or so there. We all decided that it'd be a good idea to all get jobs and try to get our own place together. B and I started working construction but I ended up getting fired for being sick and B kept calling out because he would stay up all night and party. A and I found a what seemed to be a really good marketing job. A couple weeks go by and since B doesn't have a job so he got removed from the lease. My grandmother co-signed the lease to help us get it which we did. A's old co-worker said that he could move in so we let him take B's spot. Let's call him C. So we are living here now and it's been a month or so. The marketing job falls through. It's a complete bust and we get paid far less than what we were told to expect. The turnover rate was terrible as well. After this, I somehow fell into a spiral. I could barely get out of bed. Weeks went by and I didn't work. I doordashed on occasion but I just couldn't bring myself to work. I decided to try to get a job at food Lion and I got hired that day. They were going to have me work night shift which was exciting to me. I thought maybe this was supposed to be what I did with my life for a while. I went in the next day in the afternoon to fill out paperwork and do online tests and such. I loved the people who worked there during the day so I though the same would happen when I was scheduled to work. When I got in there, I was a little put off. I felt weird. My coworkers seemed a little odd but I thought they must just be tired. I ended up having to leave after 30 minutes because I had a panic attack in their bathroom. I don't know why that happened. I then fell into an even deeper state of depression. I lied to my grandmother about continuing to work there. I didn't know what to do. I relied on my Christmas money to get me through the month. Now, let's fast forward to about a week from now and I started working at a restaurant as a waiter. I'm working as much as I can but I'm not going to be able to make ends meet. I'm not getting all the hours I need but I can't work anywhere else because I don't have a phone number anymore. Onto of that, A left and my grandmother had to cover his rent for that month. Luckily my friend from a another state moved in at the beginning of this month and he's settled in. They both give me 700 a month for everything but I used all of it and only $130 of my money to pay rent because I couldn't afford it. Now, the electricity is due and the internet is coming up in a week or so. I'm working, but not enough to make ends meet and I can't live off of my grandmother, it isn't fair. I feel like a terrible person and I don't know how to get myself out of this situation and it's destroying me. I've started hurting myself occasionally and I'm miserable. I try to tell myself \"You're working all the hours you can right now and that's what matters\" but I feel so much guilt. I finally have a job I can hold but I hate that I've been lying to my grandmother. If I told her the truth, I have no clue how she'd react. I should've kept working at Food Lion like I told her but instead all I did was lay in bed and stare at the walls. I feel like a disappointment and I cry almost everyday.

I was severely unwell until my mid-twenties, when things started to turn around. I learned some management techniques, improved my self-esteem, got a girlfriend, got a good job, etc. But the OCD, BDD, and anxiety NEVER went away. I just learned to live with it without wanting to constantly kill myself. I saw therapists on and off but never one I liked. I never considered meds because I was just so adverse to the idea of it and I had stolen random stuff from my dad's assortment of anti-anxiety meds when I was a teen and they messed me up to the point where I couldn't feel anything and put my hand through a window.\n\nIn any case I had developed great coping skills over the years and learned how to mitigate many of my symptoms through working out, diet management, meditation, limiting coffee, getting enough sleep and a bunch of other stuff. But the symptoms were still there, just minimized. I would still hit a mind-shattering low usually once a month and just had to wait it out.\n\nFinally I started with another therapist about a year ago and slowly, slowly, she convinced me to try an SSRI. She also had severe anxiety and OCD and finally decided to take one and it worked for her, so very slowly she convinced me to try it. \n\nI started with a crazily low dose, and slowly built my way up to a normal dose. It did nothing at first. But as time went on the periods between when I was fine and when I would hit the mind-shattering BDD episodes got longer and longer. And then after some time passed I realized I hadn't had an episode in months. I am 33 now and I have not gone this long without an episode since before I first developed symptoms as a teenager. \n\nI have had zero side effects from the pill, and it was the first one I tried, which I realize may not be realistic for everyone. But for me this is a miracle. All of my life's problems are still there, all of my normal human feelings are still there, but I just don't have the brutal anxiety, OCD, and BDD alongside it. The relief is immeasurable. I can drink coffee whenever I want, I don't have to run marathons to stay alive anymore, I can sleep six hours instead of eight if I feel like it, all these things that normal people get to not worry about that I've had to govern so strictly for so long, I can now be flexible with. \n\nIf you haven't ever tried an SSRI, going purely on my experience, I strongly recommend it.

I have been diagnosed with MDD, PTSD, and Anxiety since I was 12 years old. I have been on and off of medication since then however always stop due to feeling numb and emotionless. I have a strong history of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse from the time i was 6 years old. I am a mother of a 4 year old.\n\nI was previously living with my husband (now separating) who was 10 years older than me. It was my first relationship and i got with him when I was 16. I ended up coming to terms with the fact that we weren't compatible and that i was blind to the red flags that were present in the relationship. So we had been in the process if separation for over a year and I've been on my own now since October.\n\nI am not happy. At all. I have moments of happiness that ate fleeting but overall, i am so unhappy. This has been going on my entire life but especially since adulthood. I started working when I was 15 to pay bills for my mom and help support my 4 sisters but i honestly hate working. I've had several jobs that i enjoyed but the more i work, the more depressed i get. The more depressed I am (whether it be from situations in my life currently or just randomly), the harder it is to work. I will often call into work because my depression is so dibillitating that i literally can't drag myself to work. I even dropped out of college because i couldn't handle all the added stress.\n\nI know people have to work and its normal but i can't come to terms with the fact. I'm so busy between working (weird schedule), being a mom, and keeping up a house that it leaves no time for myself to focus on my mental health. I see a therapist every other week but i don't feel like i get much than the opportunity to vent. I just feel like my life has no purpose. \n\nI feel so overwhelmed and like there's not enough time in a day to get what i need done. I don't know how to juggle my emotions. I don't know how to come to terms working and never having time. I don't know how to manage my depression at all. I don't have hobbies or even know what i like to do. I am not secure in who I am. I never really had friends and now that I have a couple of friends, i never even have time to see them or maintain those friendships. \n\nI know this post is all over the place and there is no real question, i suppose. I just needed somewhere to vent and maybe seek opinions or advice on how to help myself.\n\nEdit: i also have a hard time crying now. Like i used to cry alot when i was emotional. Now its even though im so upset and want to cry (or feel like i should cry), i can't.",

        "original": "I am 20 years old and I have been crippled by my anxiety since I was 5-6. I watched my mom die and get resuscitated when I was 7 and have PTSD from that and the years after of her being sick, and a couple events that happened in between and after. She passed when I was 13 after being up and down in the hospital for about a month. I've been severely depressed since at least the age of 10 and hardly went to school, and I couldn't face it again for many years after my mom died. I tried to kill myself a few times but then I just became numb. After many attempts at the charter high school my mom would have wanted me to attend, would have wanted me to take advantage of the college preparatory aspects and build a future for myself, I had to go to a credit recovery program but I did end up getting all my credits and graduating high school! Ever since then, I have had nothing going on in my life. I go to therapy once a week, maybe go get some food or a Walmart trip here and there but I have agoraphobia and its just getting worse. I have had a boyfriend the past two years but we have broken up and he doesn't reply to me so its officially over this time. I love him and can't imagine my life without him but I know breakups happen and it is probably for the best if he doesn't feel the same, so it would be fine if I really had anything left to live for. He made me laugh and feel something, he cuddled me every night, gave me something to wake up to. I have no one really. My dad is really it. I have one friend. She lives very far from me and I don't have the energy to keep up with her. I would have gone to college if I didn't have a debt that I can't pay from concurrent classes I took for one week. But now I don't think I could ever face the workload and the people and the leaving my house. Like I said, I really haven't felt energy to do anything in at least 4 years and my agoraphobia really has paralyzed me. I just feel so stuck. I've never even heard a story about someone who missed out everything including their developmental years, absolutely incapable of everything and then ever be able to jump up and have a life. The only future I  even see being a possibility is me moping around my dad's house until he dies and I'm forced to live alone, on disability just sleeping with my dog all day, or getting married and taking care of kids all day. I don't want to even witness either. I don't even want to ever witness anything besides my bed. I really have put so much thought into it and I don't see any reason to live through this misery one more day. I literally wake up every morning, think about all this and just cry. I don't know. I could have written this a lot better but I 'm so bad with words nowadays. I guess I am posting this in hopes someone will read it and tell me they went through the same thing and how they got to the other side, but every particle of me doesn't believe it is possible or even worth it for me. I have no intention of actually killing myself because I just am so pussy, but if I could just press a button and just cease to exist trust me I would in the blink of an eye.",

Already solved, but I never quite understood why or what was it.\nI never had trouble reading people, they seemed simple, kids and adults. They all functioned the same, talked the same, found funny the same things.   Doesn't matter if they thought they were different, all fell by the same tricks. Been trough so many moves from city to city. It always been the same.\nEveryone loved me, but I loved nobody, I just couldn't, nor my family, nor my friends and couples. They just seemed like sand in the desert, and I was alone. \n\nThe only thing I could ever loved was \"Shaco\", my dog, there was no cheat or trick for his true love. I gotta say, he is and was a true companion.\nI wasn't sad or happy. I just wasn't. The only moment I truly felt alive was playing skyrim with shaco sleeping besides me, the days I skipped school.\n\nIm not a 10/10 but i could get any girl I wanted, but that got old, what's the point?. I just didn't see the point in anything. During a time I couldn't relate myself in the mirror, get mad with people and react weird at everything, i really thought that all existance revolved around me, because people was so simple, and life so structured. I couldn't understand why anyone was like me.\n\nOnce someone knew how I was, thought I was a bad person. How could someone who has 10y long friendship with someone don't care for them. A year long relasionship where 1 never loved. A caring family that would have been exchanged for a dog.\nThe people that at least got where I was coming from, stayed with me(they are now my closest friends).\n\nThe girls were charmed when I told them my Oh so sad scarred past full of family dissapointments, the death of my grandpa, \"oh I have been trough so much, I'm a suffered little thing, but I'm gonna make it\" just a cool sasuke kinda past and a \"progression\" in my oh so hard to get trust. Was effective, but that made the relasionship very boring.\n\nYes, I went to the psychologist and was refreshing to take off the shell, and talk about my mind. It helped, but wasn't the thing that saved me.\nIt all ended when I decided to start over, didn't knew were to start. Months later I started dating my girlfriend, a big step because I really cared about her and im glad and proud that I still do. It was a slow process, but Im happy now, I think that I have trully good friends and I enjoy the sentiment of love, I have a nice job overall and everything is marching upfront and nice. I can't forget the tricks and shortcuts to people, but I only use it at job with clients and else. I take the longer and more ME way to people.\n\nI always enjoyed little things, but all that; drinking, playing videogames, eating, making jokes, became so much better with people that you like and care. Life became to be.\n\nBut i never quite knew why all happened in the first place, I enjoy life so much now, but the feeling of being missunderstood is still there. I just wish that never happened.\n\n\n\n\nIf the wording seems weird , odd or repetitive, it's because english is not my first lenguage. If you read it all, thanks, i mean it.

        "original": "\\*\\*Disclaimer: I'm using a brand-new Reddit account for this post, I and don't want to share too many details that might identify me. Please bear with me in this regard. I'm desperate for advice - even (especially?) from strangers - since none of the in-person \"wisdom\" I've received (including that from my therapist, who I see 3-4 times a month) is helpful beyond \"you need to do something about this\".\\*\\*\n\nI'm a 30-something female who has 3 jobs and lives/struggles with manic depression (otherwise known as bipolar disorder). My depressive states involve crying jags, calling in sick to work, fantasizing about how I might die, failing to follow basic hygiene, and other unpleasant behaviors. My manic states range from cocaine-like highs and wonderful creativity/productivity to agitation/aggression to impulsive/dangerous behavior that causes me to lose friends, money, health, and sleep. For both depression and mania, my biggest triggers are departure from routine and sensing major changes in the near future.\n\nI've tried five different psychiatric drugs over the years (Trileptal, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Effexor XR, and Latuda - in that order). The difficult-to-terrifying side effects these medications produced within me - along with the debilitating withdrawal symptoms I experienced from the Effexor XR - are only slightly outweighed by the fact that they either did nothing to help me with my depression and mania or instead \"flattened me out\" so much that I was fake and emotionless. As a result of my experiences, I've been unmedicated for nearly five years now (with the exception of one horrifying day on Latuda in 2018). None of the psychiatrists I've seen have taken psychiatric medication themselves, and my despair over hellish side effects and withdrawal has historically been ignored or disbelieved by them. They all seemed to be throwing darts instead of making conscientious decisions about my medication. \n\nAfter a series of panic attacks and breakdowns (including a three-hour one at an international airport in November), I decided in December that I needed to re-consider medication. But now I'm regretting my decision to schedule my psychiatric evaluation (which happens a week from today and will take place with the same shrink who prescribed me Latuda). What's the point in going to this evaluation, I ask myself? I'm a religious person, and I believe that God made me this way. Why fight my identity with chemicals? It's no different to me than injecting chemicals into my eyes to change their color. It's spitting in God's face, really. Why should I hate myself so much that I drug it out of existence? Life with manic depression is painful enough without having to take expensive pills that dull who I am every day.\n\nI just have no clue how to approach this situation. I think of suicide on a regular basis, and my entire life has spun out of control. I seem to have no command over my libido, organization and neatness, health, or moods. And it's well-understood that if I tell the wrong person about how I'm feeling (like I did a few times in the past), I'll get imprisoned against my will in a mental institution..causing me to lose my employment/income/sense of hope, get saddled with a massive hospital bill that will send me further back into the crushing debt I'm currently clawing my way out of, and get worse due to being surrounded by people who are even crazier than I am. \n\nI know I'm unwell, but I've got all these reservations about trying drugs again. Please advise me with reason and compassion. I'm willing to answer questions that don't reveal my identity. Thanks in advance.",

It's a little complicated, but basically she refused to give me an answer as to whether she liked me or not (she did but she wouldn't admit it to me because of later obvious reasons). The problem arose from the fact that they started dating and gaslighted me into thinking they aren't. Lots of lies and deception that just didn't need to be there.\n\nAfter finding out, I had a pretty serious breakdown and there's been a lot of weird things that resulted from that. For example, I'm not as much as a clean freak as I used to be, and I'm suddenly no longer scared of spiders. The bad thing is that I seem to have also developed a weird form of gynophobia. I'm okay with being around her and any woman I knew BEFORE the incident, but any new person immediately triggers anxious feelings. I have trouble speaking and I'm extremely anxious about being around unfamiliar women.\n\nFortunately, I don't really have to interact with unknown women at work but I'm becoming more worried since this is the polar opposite of how I used to be. I grew up with mostly female friends so I never really had issues of this sort. Something similar happened after my ex-gf broke up with me, but it kinda went away quickly.\n\nIs this a normal (ish) thing to happen for some time, or is it worrisome to the point where I should look into some counselling?

        "original": "\nI\u2019m 20. I just got back from a 10 day vacation to Orlando, FL. With an friend who is not my friend anymore. \n\nWe weren\u2019t exactly all that compatible to begin with and had prior fallouts and set up boundaries and kept trying to make it work over the years but I\u2019m kinda over it. \n\nI thought the trip went well apparently she thought otherwise and sent me nasty messages and blocked me after the trip. \n\nOh well not much money was lost on my part. It was pretty much a gift paid by her parents and all I had to do was bring spending money. \n\nAnd that was also my only \u201cfriend\u201d who wasn\u2019t really a friend because we would rarely hangout. I guess we are in different parts in our lives. She\u2019s newly engaged, has a job, getting ready to move out, almost done with therapy, weaning off meds, has other friends, has her own car, looking to start going to college...me on the other hand, going to start seeing a doctor and going to therapy soon, no job and can\u2019t keep a job, can\u2019t keep friends, emotional/mental roller coaster, pretty much my parents Maid (they make me clean a lot around house and yell when I do things wrong), no saved up money, no car, never had a boyfriend, no other friends (I bullied a lot of people in high school and no I\u2019m not proud of it)\n\nAnyways, now that I am back at home I am back  to sitting in my house day in and day out. I haven\u2019t had a job since I got fired in October. I\u2019ve had 4 jobs this year and got fired from every single one due to low performance, bad moods and fallouts with coworkers. My parents drop me off/pick me up from jobs but now they are suggesting I focus on myself and getting the mental help I need (medication, therapy, raise my self esteem etc). Because I\u2019m just going to get fired again and my resume is already trash. Both of my parents have masters degrees and work constantly. We live in a fairly nice house. \n\nI go through phases where I\u2019m up and happy and must spend spend spend or must do something and have a high sex drive (masturbate a lot to put it bluntly) appetite goes up and I engage in abnormal/risk taking behavior become childish/obnoxious/attention seeking, don\u2019t follow rules and I also go through periods where I\u2019m very irritated, all I want to do is sleep, barely eat, lash out on everyone, cry randomly and say mean and nasty things (become super defensive)\n\nI do not have a car to drive at the moment, and I\u2019m not on any insurance. I have like $7 in my bank account. Parents just put me on their health insurance and want to me to seek mental treatment, they think I might be bipolar/borderline but I always have hard times getting along with others/ I\u2019m very rebellious and stubborn/ I guess I do have age regression sometimes when I\u2019m down and I can\u2019t keep a job or go to school. My grades were terrible in high school no matter what help I received. I don\u2019t know what I want to do with my life and I can\u2019t think about it, I\u2019ve never been able too, I get very frustrated and overwhelmed. \n\nMy doctors appointment is an initial intake appointment at the psychiatrist on Jan 24th. But what I usually do is watch movies/YouTube , play mario kart, sleep (a lot), play with my dogs/cats, if it\u2019s warm go for a walk around neighborhood, broadcasting apps, or clean whatever my parents want me to clean. Designated cleaning days are Tuesday and Friday and my parents give me an entire list. They don\u2019t pay me either. They say you live here free of rent, I\u2019m paying for your food/health insurance and phone bill, the least you could do is work on yourself and clean my house. You are irresponsible and my room constantly looks like a hoarders room (I always struggle with keeping things clean) so maybe this is their way of trying to get me to be responsible? It\u2019s not really working but whatever if I do it I don\u2019t have to listen to their mouth run.",

I'm an 18 y/o male who graduated high school in 2019, and went to a community college for a month before dropping out due to my mental health. After dropping out, I began speaking through video chat to a therapist, who diagnosed me with anxiety and said that while I didn't seem to be fully depressed, I should be happier with my life. However, her treatments didn't help very much and I haven't been to talk to a professional in around 2 months now. Recently, I've had some good news in my life too. I've gotten into a school that I think will be a much better fit for me and I've met a girl who really cares about me that I've taken a liking to as well. But in the past week or so, I've been very unhappy for no discernible reason. I've been unable to think about a positive future for myself, and I feel like a complete failure. My parents are very well off and have invested a lot of time and resources into making sure I can get the future I want for myself. And I've done just about nothing with it. I am not suicidal and I have never once been suicidal, but recently there have been many instances where I've thought that it wouldn't matter or change the world badly if I were to die. My mother's side of the family (which I take after) has a long line of serious depression and I'm concerned not that I've started experiencing it, but that I haven't yet and that somehow I can get worse. I also had a fight with one of my good friends a few months ago, which led to some serious trust issues on my side, and I now have difficulties talking to people I trust about things like this, because I feel like everyone will betray me. So I came here to vent, and I really needed it. Thanks for letting me vent.",

        "original": "Be warned, this is very long. TL;DR at the end.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m an 18 year-old girl and in my last year of highschool.\n\nLately I\u2019ve been feeling a whole range of negative emotions, from anger and frustration, to sadness and numbness, and I feel like I have no way to get rid of them. I\u2019m usually a very optimistic person, happy-go-lucky, and able to make the best out of any situation, no matter how shitty it is, so this descent into a spiral of negativity really doesn\u2019t fit my personality at all. And I hate it.\n\nNow, these feelings didn\u2019t just wash over me for no reason. Being a senior in highschool, I\u2019m at that time in my life when I have to figure out what I want to do with my future and I feel like, no matter what I choose, it\u2019s gonna amount to nothing. I\u2019m not stupid by any means and I\u2019ve always had good grades but I hate studying with my entire heart and soul. I hate having to stare at a book for hours just to pass exams that don\u2019t have any real impact on my life other than giving me a diploma, a piece of paper that also won\u2019t really help in the field of work that I\u2019m thinking of pursuing. Regardless, I still want to go to college, mainly because the one I chose will require me to move somewhere else and I see it as an opportunity to start anew. My real problem here is that I don\u2019t know how to make studying easier and more efficient. For my whole life I was able to understand the material in class so I never really had to sit down and go over lessons a hundred times to pass tests, but now there is just so much to learn that I simply can\u2019t do that anymore. This leads to me feeling like I\u2019m bound to fail my exams and not get into college, which, in turn, only adds to my hopelessness.\n\nNot only am I incredibly stressed and anxious about school and my future, but I\u2019m having some issues with my friendships and family life that I can\u2019t seem to solve. I\u2019m not very close with people at school, but there are a few kids that I usually hang out with. Most of them don\u2019t cause me any trouble but my two closest friends have been hurting me severely for the past few months. My best friend, let\u2019s call her Rose, and my other friend, who I\u2019ll call Poppy, are completely disregarding my presence and treating me like a third wheel. Here\u2019s a little backstory: Rose and I are (or were) very close. I felt really safe talking to her about anything and I genuinely believed she had my best interest at heart, and I\u2019d like to think she felt the same way about me. Poppy was a good friend of ours but Rose and I have always been the BFFs. However, in the past couple of years Poppy did some very shitty and manipulative things to Rose, which entirely changed our opinions of her and prompted both of us to severely distance ourselves from her. Rose chewed my ear off about how much of a huge piece of shit Poppy is, how much she hates her, and how she never wants to talk to her again. Well, guess what? Poppy apologized to Rose and cried a few times in front of her. This made Rose forgive her and decide to give her another chance. Obviously, I tried to question her decision, considering how much she seemed to despise Poppy before, but she told me that she wants to be forgiving and not hold grudges against anyone. I personally think there is a big difference between letting go of grudges and going back to someone who emotionally abused you. The two of them started getting even closer than they were before the fight, and I seem to completely have lost my friendship badge. This is taking a toll on my mental health because I considered Rose to be my sister, even my family accepted her just as if she was one of ours. Now I barely talk to her anymore and at school she is almost always talking to Poppy, with her back turned to me. I lost some friends over the years but very few of them have hurt me on this level, mostly because I\u2019ve always had someone else to fall back on. Besides Rose, I don\u2019t have any other close friends, so I don\u2019t know what to do. I tried telling her that I feel ignored and that it bothers me to see her so close with someone who made her feel so used, but she told me that it wasn\u2019t her intention to make me feel left out and she hung out with me for a few days before going back to Poppy.\n\nSomething else that bothers me about Rose, no matter how much I love her, is the fact that she is a huge hypocrite. I ended a friendship a couple years ago and she supported me through the \u201cbreak-up\u201d, always making sure to talk me out of trying to mend it back together, saying that this person hurt me and they don\u2019t deserve me. Rose takes pride in \u201chow loving and forgiving she is\u201d, and she sees herself as this kind of benevolent angel that senses when people suffer and drops everything to help them. I used to see her like that too, and I really think that, deep down, that\u2019s exactly who she is. However, I\u2019ve been suffering for months, because of her, and literally standing next to her everyday, and she doesn\u2019t even seem to notice.\n\nI told my mom about this entire situation and her advice is to ignore them and fall back on my family. I know she means well by saying this, but it\u2019s not helpful at all and only adds to my feeling of isolation. I feel trapped in my family. My parents were very strict as I was growing up, and although they loosened up over the years, I still hate how much of my childhood I missed out on because of them. I\u2019m sorry if this sounds mean, but they are boring people. I understand that after you work 8 hours a day you don\u2019t really feel like jumping up and down, but they never do anything other than laying on the couch either watching TV or being on their phones. I don\u2019t have anything against them doing that, but, damn. I want to do stupid teenager activities, not watch the weather. Whenever I try to sit with them, they somehow end up either insulting me, or scolding me about my life decisions. This is why I can\u2019t follow my mom\u2019s advice. I\u2019m already upset; how am I gonna get better by allowing them to add even more to that? Besides that, my relationship with my dad isn\u2019t the greatest and I try to avoid conversation with him as much as possible, so making a best friend out of him is just impossible. I\u2019m an only child, so no help from any siblings either.\n\nThe issues I have with my parents bleed into the financial aspect of life. My mom\u2019s parents are both sick and can\u2019t really take care of themselves, so she has to cook for them and clean their house every weekend. All of that out of our own budget. I always hear my parents complain about how much money it costs to repair stuff around my grandparents\u2019 house, to drive back and forth every week, and to buy their medicine. I\u2019m not very close to my grandparents but we get along; either way, I\u2019d never make my mom choose between me of them, but this bothers me. I\u2019ve had my laptop for a few years and it\u2019s having some problems. I\u2019ll need a better one for college anyway, so I asked her if she could help me buy one. She yelled at me. Later she told my dad, and he also yelled at me. I tried to explain that the laptop I have right now won\u2019t last very long anyway and they blamed me for not taking care of it. I hate to say this, but this makes me feel somewhat neglected, since it happened multiple times. The situation made me cry and I guess that softened my mom\u2019s heart a bit since she agreed to get me a new one in the spring. I really understand where they\u2019re coming from with this whole money thing, but I can\u2019t help but think that I don\u2019t deserve to be put on the backburner like this. I\u2019d understand if they sat me down and calmly explained the situation to me. I\u2019m completely fine with saving money on my own, but I hate the fact that they yell at me whenever I ask for help, and then act like they want to be my friends. Am I a bad person for feeling this way?\n\nThis laptop thing matters more than you might think. Since I seem to not have friends anymore, I\u2019ve been spending a lot more time online and fell into the videogames rabbit hole. I also consider video editing to be my favorite hobby and perhaps even a talent. With my laptop breaking down, these two activities that made me happy are becoming impossible to take part in until I get a new setup. Typically, I\u2019d be perfectly fine ditching my computer for a couple months, but now I feel like an amputee with no crutches in sight. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t have any other hobbies and I really don\u2019t like going out by myself, so I feel like I\u2019m imprisoned in my house.\n\nMy physical health is suffering because of all this stuff, too. I\u2019m getting headaches and mild chest pain and I\u2019m having a lot of trouble sleeping. Last night I had a dream so vivid and real that I\u2019m afraid it might have actually been a hallucination, but I\u2019m not sure. I had panic attacks in the past and when I\u2019m under immense stress I tend to have full-blown mental breakdowns.\n\nI have a history of self harm, but I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve been clean for such a long time that I lost count of the days. I don\u2019t want to fall back into that habit, but I fear that if these feelings of hopelessness persist, I will end up there again. I know suicide won\u2019t make anything better and there are a lot of future events that I wouldn\u2019t want to miss, but I\u2019d prefer to be on autopilot for a while.\n\nI\u2019m assuming your first piece of advice would be to either talk to my parents of to a school counselor. My parents are out of the question since my dad doesn\u2019t care and my mom\u2019s only advice is \u201cignore it\u201d. About the school counselor: she is a nice and welcoming person, but whenever I went to her for mental health advice, she always made me feel like my issues were not a very big deal. For example, I told her that I\u2019m showing symptoms of ADD and she said I just need to spend less time on my phone, which I rarely use anyway. I don\u2019t want her to discredit my issues since my current state is the lowest point I\u2019ve ever been at and the last thing I need is someone to tell me that I\u2019m overreacting. A psychologist/psychiatrist/therapist outside of my school is also unlikely, since mental health treatments are expensive and don\u2019t fall under my health insurance; also my parents wouldn\u2019t take me seriously if I told them I need to see a psychiatrist.\n\nI don\u2019t know what do to. I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a horrible cycle with no way out. No matter what I do, it seems like I always end up in a bad place. I know it gets better, I\u2019ve experienced that on my own skin. I just don\u2019t know how to kickstart that process and diminish this feeling of hopelessness that I can\u2019t seem to shake.\n\nTL;DR: My entire life is falling apart (school, friends, family) and it makes me feel extremely hopeless. It\u2019s starting to make me physically sick. Besides talking to my parents and a counselor, what can I do to make this better?",

        "original": "I am a 19 year old male, freshman in college at a university. I don\u2019t exactly come from a poor family, but my parents aren\u2019t the best with money. Nevertheless, I\u2019ve never done without something I\u2019ve needed. So I am lucky I\u2019m that sense.\n\nI\u2019m currently within the first two weeks of my second semester at college. So far my entire time here has been a fucking mental battle. I have one good friend whom I love, and a couple acquaintances. I do enjoy college sometimes, but the average day consists of forcing myself to get out of bed around 9-10 am, going to lectures, getting coffee around 12, and everything is fine. \n\nBut by 3-4 pm every day I slip into this kind of sad, exhausted, depressing and anxious state where all I do is overthink and reminisce in the past.\n\nNow get ready, because I\u2019m about to tell an arguably embarrassing story, but it is the truth.\n\nI have generalized anxiety, major depression, and ADHD. Sometimes I feel like the only time I enjoy is either when I\u2019m comfortably buzzed from alcohol or weed, off Ritalin, or the 30 minutes of caffeine high after some good coffee with my friend.\n\nI may be only 19, but I swear I peaked in high school. This is fucking dumber to think about when you take into account I was homeschooled and an introvert.\n\nHowever, my years from 12-18 consisted mostly of swimming for my club team. As my career progressed I become popular and loved by everyone because I was good looking, ripped, funny, hard working and respectable, and moderately good at the sport. The girls all loved me, the younger kids looked up to me, my coach called me his self-proclaimed \u201cbest friend,\u201d and the guys my age and I were all one tight great friend group. Like brothers.\n\nNow even though I suffered moderate depression and anxiety during my high school years, I gotta say they seem like they were, and probably will be, the best years of my life.\n\nBut here I am in college. I can\u2019t tell the whole story but not only do I miss high school, swimming, home, my friends and family,  and the massively lower pressures of high school, but I also miss two things that really make me feel like a dumbass.\n\n1. I miss the social hierarchy of high school. Yes. I miss it. I miss being at the top of it. I miss girls who actually put effort into their grooming and physical shape. I miss the clout I got for good grades and being an athlete. I miss bonding with friends over the overly emphasized competition of sports.  \n\n2. There is a girl. She\u2019s a fucking junior right now. I had a crush on her for years but she and I never dated because we were both shy and dumb. I miss the shit out of her. We tried dating summer of my senior year but we both realized it wouldn\u2019t work because I was going to college. But I\u2019m not over her and this is causing me terrible heart break because we both like each other but the different stages of life we\u2019re in make it hopeless.\n\nSo here I am.

        "original": "I (20F) grew up with a mother (63F) that cannot accept her own mistakes. Being raised in an abusive environment with two younger sisters my grandparents clearly liked better, I can see why she has remained that way.\nUnfortunately over the years this has contributed to me internalizing very unhealthy ways of thinking and acting. I cannot bear the pain of hurting someone else even if it wasn't on purpose, the thought of having caused an inconvenience to another person makes me panic. If I misunderstand someone on reddit I feel the need to apologise a billion times, and whenever my mother gets just slightly angry it drags me down for days. It's especially bad when I'm in a student-teacher environment as I feel an intense pressure to not disappoint the teacher. Back in school I got praised for being so mature and apologetic, when in fact I was just afraid of misbehaving and disappointing others. It's less pronounced with my boyfriend because he's very understanding and I trust him when he says I didn't upset him when I think I do.\nI basically make myself the perpetrator, rather than the victim, in a conflict situation. My thoughts spiral into how I could have prevented this, what I did wrong, whether I am at fault. \nDue to external circumstances (anxiety and panic disorder diagnosis, high cost of living...) I have to live at home (Germany) with my parents for the time being. I live in the basement.\nUnfortunately my mum's and my personality clash terribly, and whenever I do something my mother perceives as unacceptable (e.g. telling her to please not go through my stuff while I'm away) she becomes verbally aggressive and starts to play games (in this case banning me from entering my parents part of the house). She's the type of person who doesn't tell you when she wants something, she just wants me to read her and gets upset when I fail to do so. She let's her emotions affect her actions directly and feeling her anger makes me want to die. My father (65M) disagrees with her behaviour but he's not opposed her until today, where he promised me to talk to her.\n\nMy mother is not a bad person, quite the opposite, but I wish I could somehow be less affected by her attitude until I can move out. She's so understanding and supportive when it comes to my mental health, but I am afraid of telling her that she might have contributed to my anxiety.\nMy therapist has helped me realize this whole pattern, but I'm just not sure how to escape this way of thinking, especially as long as I am in daily contact with my mother? Has anyone here dealt with a similar situation in the past and can offer advise as to how to stop blaming myself?",

I\u2019m male and 24 now, I have little to no friends (probably only about 2-3 actual friends currently - I have had some fall outs with previous friends over the years) and these friends of mine already are a lot more popular and have heaps of their own friends anyway when they\u2019re all I have, so they have much less time for me than I do for them and half the time I feel like these friends just use me anyway, therefore I don\u2019t really end up socialising much unfortunately even though I would like to. I have been single for about 7 years now since high school (this was my only relationship ever) and even over these past years I haven\u2019t really had many hook-ups or been on many dates either and I\u2019m pretty lonely these days. I\u2019ve mostly tried dating apps over these years so many times over and over to the point at which it's embarrassing, since I don\u2019t really have the opportunity to meet people in person much and this has had very little success (tinder, bumble, hinge \u2013 you name it). I\u2019ve probably been on only about 2 dates in this whole time and after each date I've been ghosted or cut off. So quick description of me, I try to take relatively good care of myself, I work out and am reasonably athletically built, decent face I guess and average height and Im usually pretty ok with talking to people too if that and can be confident where necessary if that helps to describe me a bit.\n\nWhat makes this even worse is that I graduated college (business degree and want to get into marketing) almost 2 years ago now and have since really struggled to land a graduate role or job or even experience in my field (I currently still work my part time hospitality job which I\u2019ve had for years so I at least have some income \u2013 I hate it but need the money). The worst part about this is I\u2019ve almost graduated too long ago to be eligible for any graduate positions let alone jobs and I\u2019m not even a very favourable candidate for internships either since I\u2019m no longer studying (I tried to land interns while studying but still wasn\u2019t successful after a countless amount of applications) \u2013 so now I\u2019m slowly falling into more and more debt etc.\n\nIt's hard considering all my friends a lot of people I know are quite successful at this point, doing what they want, are in relationships and have plenty of friends and I feel like I keep getting left more and more behind and that Im getting nowhere.\n\nOver these years I\u2019ve tried various hobbies, through my last few jobs and tried making friends when I was at college but never really had any luck and also of course dating apps with my relationship issues which has also been pretty much successful too as I find people just don\u2019t like me, and in terms of work its practically been a second job for me constantly looking for work, applying, reaching out, seeking advice etc.\n\nIf anyone is or has been in a similar position or has some ideas, I would love your advice, as I\u2019m kinda at the point where I really don\u2019t know what to do anymore\u2026 \n\nThanks :)",

        "title": "Writing this is scary, and yet I somehow feel like it might help.",
        "original": "Hi Reddit,\n\n\nI'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish by writing this. I guess it's just cause I've never tried writing about my life experiences on the internet so I'm interested in seeing what happens. I guess I haven't before because I often feel like my experiences are somehow \"not real\", invalid, or would offend someone. Also, my apologies if this is a bit \"stream of consciousness\", I have a very hard time expressing the way I feel and organizing those thoughts in a way that make sense.\n\n\nIt's hard for me to quantify the level of success that I've had in my career as I feel largely dissociated from it. Or at least, ashamed or scared of it. Talking about it often makes me feel like I'm actually talking about someone else's experiences. In the past, I've had people described me as \"one of the best if not the best in my city and/or country\". Some might refer to me as being fairly recognizable in my field, and it's possible that I've gotten work just based on who I know or who I've worked with (I work in an industry that is very reputation based). I certainly don't identify with any of these descriptions in case anyone was wondering. I have delusions (I think) about how others might think of me in a professional setting. I'm constantly in fear that someone will somehow find out that I know nothing about what I'm doing and that if that \"secret\" gets out, my life will be over and everyone will hate me for deceiving them. On bad days, I will try and find places at work to hide from people. On the worst days, I can't go into work. Sometimes I've even believed that someone is watching me in secret while I work trying to catch me making a mistake or not doing my job. Sometimes I'll believe that person is someone who has nothing to do with my job or even doesn't work at my company (like a construction worker, for example). I know these experiences are ridiculous, even when they are happening, but I can't shake the anxiety and feelings that come with it. I'm also deeply afraid that these same people will find out that I struggle with these issues and will think I'm unstable and not fit to be working, leading to the same disaster scenario, which is confusing when you are hiding from people so they don't find out you are a fake. Kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\nI've always had a lot of self-doubt. I grew up with a lot of adults (teachers and parents) yelling at me about how I wasn't smart, would never be mature, would never be successful, etc. As a result of this, my drive to be successful has largely been fuelled by anger as a sort of \"fuck you\" to all those people. I do truly have a passion for my work, but my drive to be successful has been based mostly on being angry and afraid of those people being right about me.\n\n\nSocially, I'm specifically scared of people seeing me as \"a child\". Like as if, somehow I even LOOK less like an adult than everyone around me (which is kind of true, I have a very young looking face). My friends often describe me as being very intelligent which makes me feel like I have to live up to that. I also feel like I need to live up to that in order to prove to people who think I'm stupid wrong. As a result, I overcompensate on a feature of my personality that I likely possess anyway. I believe this makes me come off as arrogant and unapproachable which adds to my paranoia in professional settings as well as social settings.\n\n\nMy last job was extremely intense. I was working almost 80 hours a week while having huge issues in my relationship (no surprise there, working too much doesn't help relationships). I had, what I think was several mental breakdowns, and then finally quit after my will to work was mostly destroyed. I stayed in this job because I believed I was doing the right thing as my girlfriend and I needed the money very badly. I look back on this time as a period of immense failure. I failed myself, my girlfriend, and proved those people from when I was a kid right about me. Additionally, I feel as if there is now a company out there that knows that I can't perform my job adequately and I find that terrifying. Is it possible for a situation like this to trigger everything I'm going through? Even though much of it seems to be rooted in my upbringing?\n\n\nThese days, I drink a lot. I'm probably an alcoholic, and I'm definitely addicted to cannabis. I drink every day and smoke every day. Smoking is the only thing that will make me calm and let me sleep and it's hard to imagine a version of myself without it. I have no excuse for the drinking as it just makes me feel worse so I feel like it's just some form of self-harm. Ultimately, I hate myself. I resent the fact that I spent my 20s working instead of learning how to be a more well-rounded person. I'm not attractive and I'm scared that if things don't work out with my girlfriend that all these personality flaws will make me unlovable. I don't even know who I would be if I didn't have these flaws. I feel as if I'm already unlovable as it is and I feel guilty that my girlfriend is still around. I feel responsible for how unhappy we were and I feel like I failed her because I all brought was chaos into her life. It crushes me knowing that I tried as hard as I did and just totally missed the mark. I don't know how to tell her that I am as ugly of a human as I am because I don't know if I can deal with the guilt of having strung her along once she finds out how awful I am. I love her so much and it's hard to think about not having her in my life.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nDisclaimers (even if they are unnecessary):\n\n - I'm sorry if my own struggles take away from people with real problems. I mean none of this to be offensive to anyone and I'm deeply sorry if it does. I realize that I likely take everything in my life for granted and I feel so terrible about that.\n\n - If you are reading this and are somehow able to figure out who I am (I am not famous, not even a bit) please do not message me and please keep this to yourself. I would never interject myself into your problems if you had the same issues (or any other issues for that matter). Additionally, if you struggle with the same thing I'd rather not learn about it through this. I don't know why, it just makes me very uncomfortable. Let's just keep this anonymous.\n\n - Please don't DM me. If you do, I won't respond. I don't mean to be rude but I feel like I've written this in a way to be vague enough so that no one can figure out who I am and any additional messaging threatens my anonymity. Whatever you have to say to me, if anything, can be said out in the open. If not, just don't say it.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nWriting this was a weird experience. I feel much better than I did an hour-ish ago so maybe I need to find more outlets to express myself. Perhaps that will help lead me to some conclusions. I still don't know what I'm trying to accomplish here (attention is definitely not it so trolls, go F yourselves). I don't know if I'm looking for advice (I have a great therapist), someone to relate to, a \"hot take\", or what. All I know is that I'm not getting better. Maybe I'm just curious to see how others react as I spend so much time and effort hiding this stuff from people. I guess by writing this I am sort of soliciting advice so if you have some you can post it. Just don't DM me.\n\n\nI will almost definitely delete this if I suspect anyone knows who I am. That's not really a warning as much as it is a way to make myself feel less anxious about posting this.\n\n\nThanks for reading and for being a thoughtful human. I hope this place is as safe of a space as I'd like it to be.\n\n\nEDIT: Formatting",

        "original": "So i\u2019ll start off saying that I have never been to a psychiatrist or diagnosed with any mental illness. I don\u2019t like to say that I am depressed because I was never actually diagnosed with it and I do not want to take away from people who do have it. I know some people are so depressed that they cannot even leave their house to do their daily activities. However, ever since the start of my senior year I\u2019ve been very sad most of the time. Right around that time I also started smoking weed. I\u2019ve usually been able to keep it only to the weekends but there were some times when I realized I was becoming dependent on it for happiness. About halfway through my first semester at college I decided to stop for a while and made it about a month and a half without it. However, I noticed that this did not have a great impact on the happiness with life. Because of this I think that it is a coincidence that I became sad and started smoking weed around the same time. \n\nI have a very hard time talking about myself to anyone but I knew one of my friends takes prozac for depression/ anxiety and has seen a psychologist and used to see a therapist. So I asked him about a year ago if he felt better after doing all of those things and he said yes. A couple weeks before I asked him this I had a kind of breakdown at his house when we were hanging out (I was high at the time tho but it\u2019s also happened sober.) and he said that he thinks I might have some kind of anxiety problem. \n\nAbout halfway through senior year I got into my first real relationship with a girl which ended up lasting about 2 months. She also took prozac but I never talked to her about it. Since it was my first relationship I didn\u2019t really know what to do and it ended up being kinda toxic which I think was mostly my fault. I want to be in a relationship again but I don\u2019t think I need to improve myself more first.\n\nNow back to the period when I was taking a break from weed that same friend asked me if I was interested in doing shrooms. I was a bit scared at first but after doing more research about how they could be potentially beneficial in helping with depression/self exploration I was more interested in them. I was however scared of having a bad trip as I had just failed out of one of my classes for my major and was very stressed about that at the time. So I ended up taking a very small amount and had a good time but it didn\u2019t affect me mentally at all which is was kinda sad about since that\u2019s the main reason I wanted to take them.\n\nFast forward to present day and now I have been smoking everyday for the past two weeks. I know that it\u2019s not sustainable for the long term and I want to try and improve my situation but I have always had a hard time actually putting my thoughts into action. I think I might want to go see a psychiatrist/therapist but since I have a very hard time opening up to people I don\u2019t know how much that will really help me plus I would probably have to get my parents to pay for it and that would mean talking to them about it which would be very hard for me to do. \n\nSorry the post is all over the place. I tried to make it pretty short but there\u2019s a lot to tell and a lot that I couldn\u2019t even fit but I guess I just wanted to write it down. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",

Now a single father with sole custody so free time isn't that available along with the stresses of raising kids alone.  Anyway I have felt quite lonely for the past 2 years not being able to find time or the courage to do so.  Recently I started a long distance relationship and it brought feeling back i hasn't felt for a long time.  Here is where I know it has gone bad.  I now put 100% of my time into this girl,  it's easy because I can't go do much else with the kids around all the time so sitting at home being able to talk for hours and message had been great. But it's a Rolla coaster because of for some reason she can't reply or is doing her life and is not giving me her undivided attention I get incredible feelings of sorry in my stomach.  I actually feel sick,  I'm constantly worrying and thinking what if this ends and I go back to having no opposite sex attention.  What if I mess it up and she wants to stop talking.  Then I'll get a message and I'm fine again.  The other night she was stressed and said she wanted to be by herself for the night.  This entire night I was a mess and kept thinking I stuffed something up,  going over our texts. Then the morning came and she called me and it was all fine but  she apologised for not calling last night as she just want feeling well.  I writting this right now because I'm doing it again right now.  I can't help it and I want it to stop. But the fear of losing the connection with someone is eating me up.  I'm self aware enough that I'm pretty sure I dont let this show to her which is good. I don't really know what I'm asking,  just how can I get rid of these feelings that aren't even true,  and how do I stop fearing the end when it's not even happening.

        "original": "\n\nOne day i woke up and i have no emotions, nothing. I have NO thought process, a VERY blank mind, like you know that voice inside your head? that internal monologue? I don't have one. I don't think ANYTHING at all, I don't feel ANY anxiety, and I can't connect with anyone or anything. It feels like im half asleep or on auto pilot all the time.  Basically, I feel stupid, have no feelings of anxiety, emotions or depression, just blankness, with no thoughts, I can't for the life of my understand OTHER people, like I have no theory of mind of other people, and I lack a thought process, I really can't compose a single thought in my head really, its like just blank, like a severe mental block. It makes me feel stupid, i can't follow tv shows, or process the emotions that they \"expect\" the viewers to interrupt to feel empathetic for the character. I just feel SOOO detached from life, like im literally not experiencing it. Before when I was hypervigilant I was OVERLY experiencing it, now its the opposite. Im a dofferent person , extremely suicidal, bad things happen to me\n\nwhat does this lack of emotional/social/academic intelligence, and blank mind in sound like to you, PTSD or brain damage? I also have a HORRIBLE short term memory, like a gold fish, literally. Life has lost all its feeling, can't feel depressed, cant feel happy, cant feel sad, life is dull and flat, and empty, like nothingness.\n\nI also feel VERY tired all the time, nothing excites me or gets me going (while when I was hypervigilant I was almost maniac), I can sleep FOREVER. I just don't FEEL like im in the world, I don't feel attached to my surrounds, its like my brains stopped integrating stuff, and I'm just some empty robotic shell.\n\nIt's like I'm not attached to my thought process, I can feel it going on somewhere, but I cant FEEL it, or get in sync with it, its like I'm outside of it, just numb and empty minded 24/7. Everything is like a movie and nothing matters. My life is like a box and im not a person. Ive lost my soul or something . Nothing stimulates me not even games or Tv. I cant laugh or ever have a moment where i feel like me or good. I look at things strange and empty. I feel trapped . Like im burried alive. I just want to live\n\nBefore this happened i was PERFECT. Really into spirituality, connected to god , had everything going for me and nothing wrong.i was so happy and into life now i just feel like darkness like evil. I didnt have any traumatizing events. I feel like a loser and that no one likes me, that they can see my negative energy or whatever this is and thing bad and wrong of me. Im not in reality and not aware of anything. I feel like im in a different world and the days are the same and keep going. Im in a relationship and dont feel anything. We fight everyday because i dont love him and im not me or in control and i do stupid things. I dont feel emotions or anything. I need help. I feel like i\u2019ll be stuck like this and want to die. I feel like there\u2019s something else here. If someone died who i knew i wouldnt feel anything or care. I cant get satisfied or anything its like im not alive or here. If i watch a video im completely blank and empty and i feel like i\u2019m 5. I feel immature and as if i have autism or something (i dont). I need help im in a different reality. My minds empty and i mean it. Theres no self. I feel like theres this shiled around me where im in a different reality. I stare blankly into space and think of nothing. Im zoned out 24/7 and dont feel grounded or in my body.im going crazy every second, i have no control at all and no stimulation and feel so cut off from reality everything looks blank and slow. I feel so stuck i just want to die. I feel cut off from EVERYTHING, and every day and second is hell. Theres no grasp of anything, i feel like smashing things and going crazy. i ignore everyone because im blank inside and not in reality to be in a conversation or anything (not like i can). Im scared what this is. Im scared if its some negative energy, another dimension, lost my soul, my mind, im possessed, i wont ever be the same, my life going to hell and etc. no one could understand this or how it feels. If u talk to me i will literally say \u201c... im not me\u201d \u201cif i were me...\u201d and literally nothing. I have no self, no likes , interests or anything. I cant go out anywhere because its like nothing, completely empty, meaningless, and no feelings. I feel stuck in my head and not in the outside world. No drugs help, i dont feel anything. I dont feel relaxation from going in a hot tub, cuddling, or anything. I dont know what this is considering one day i woke up and felt this, but the first couple days and week i was just so confused and disorientated and acted so differently. I woke up felt like a slob, acted like a slob, was lifeless, ate CHIPS for breakfast and only ate junk food. I would never do that. I was always classy, clean, active, happy, at a high vibration and etc. i cant get turned on, horny, exited or anything. I feel so far from my mind and body and everything. Theres no days and every day is the same. This isnt normal. I get very violent and get into physical fights with my boyfriend and feel out of control. When i was me i had the biggest heart, the most sweetest girl, spiritually connected and would never hit or hurt anyone mentally or physically. I just want to escape this but dont know how. Its been since august 2019. I feel outside of reality and my body. Like I\u2019m just watching everything. I feel like my mind is actually blocked and its not open.",

        "original": "I need help. I dont know what to do anymore.  I think I have a dissociative disorder. \n\nIm going to split this into 2 sections to make it easier. (1). A bit of background / growing up experiences and (2). how i feel\n\nPlease forgive my spelling or grammar or whatever im typing this on my phone at like 1:30 am\n\n(1). Im just putting this here for background purposes weather it will give some sort of insight on how im feeling or not , i dont know.\ngrowing up i didnt have the worst childhood or the most difficult but it still messed me up and i think this stems from that. \n\nIm a male in my early 20s now but At a young age i was diagnosed with pretty severe ADHD and later on really bad anxiety and depression. Growing up my parents were decent enough and i had a few friends like every kid but my mother and fathers work had us move later down the road.  I think i was like 6 the first time we moved. New school , new people , no family except my parents and my younger brother. Started making friends again then within the next year and a half we moved again. This kept up for a long time. we would move, settle down, id make a friend or 2 then wed move within 1-2 years, each move a couple hours away from where we lived before. In total we had moved 11-12 times from me being age 6-18. After about the 5th move i just kind of gave up trying to meet new people and make friends cause what was the point if i was probably just going to move again. I didnt have a phone or any real way to keep in contact with old friends except like one or 2 of them. So for a long time i would be that new quiet kid in the back of the class that wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone and was only around for the grade. I became shy, isolated, and basicly antisocial even though the only thing i wanted was a friend that wouldnt be gone in a year. When i got to high school i was at a new school again and i got bullied alot and had a couple mental breakdowns that almost led to suicide and to top it all off my mother and father had started to fight alot and eventually got a divorce because my mother wanted to be a party animal and made dumb decisions. I moved again at the end of my sophomore year back to my home town where i finished off high school. My junior and senior years were actually ok (ok as in i didnt get bullied and i did actually talk to some people on ocassion) but when high school was over i fell out of contact with all of them. And i guess over the years i really fell behind in the social department because i even now have a kinda hard time communicating with people (little to no eye contact, slightly awkward, difficulty conveying emotions and feelings) i still talk to those 2 friends and they are my best friends but besides them no one else really knows who i am. I haven\u2019t been in a relationship scene early middle school and i want nothing more than just to be loved, understood and feel alive again.\n\n(2). I feel empty. I space out often and stare off into the distance with a blank mind alot. I feel disconnected from everything around me like everything is fake. Like how a movie or a video game feels looking at a tv screen and it doesnt feel 3d or have any depth just like a picture, thats how i feel when i look around.  I dont take in my surroundings fully. a bright and lively room feels the same as standing outside at night in the quiet.  My mind feels foggy like it is always on autopilot weather it be at work, talking to someone, or at home alone.  Its difficult to explain like my mind and body are separate sorta like if you were to sit on someones shoulders and they did everything you would do but you yourself aren\u2019t actually doing it if that makes sense.  Ive felt like this for as long as i can remember.  I dont think its depression but i could be wrong. Ill still smile and feel emotions on rare occasion but not very often or for very long. And i know something is wrong because sometimes i get these moments of clarity where i look around and feel like im seeing everything and feeling the size and scale of the room but i loose my focus and it fades away.   \n\nI don\u2019t exactly get the best sleep at night (i say as i type this at 2:30 am) so i feel like that is a factor of some sort.  I hang out with some people now on occasion but it doesn\u2019t make me feel any different. Even when i talk to by best buddies i feel the same.  I dont have any real motivation or feeling to push onward and it feels like im only doing it cause i have to.   I still dont drive cause im terrified that because of this im going to space out or feel disconnected while driving and hurt myself or even worse, someone else.   Id prefer to not see a therapist or psychologist as i have bad experiences with them not caring or not listening to me. I know they are not all like that but it has a sort of negative association connected to them for me because of past experiences unfortunately. If i really have to ill try again but id like to know if anyone has some sort of advice or just an opinion or thoughts on how i should go about this. Im at a loss and i just want help.",

I made a promise to one of my friends, that i wouldn't consider suicide as an option a while back, but if nothing changes soon there is no doubt that i would break it eventually.\n\nI think i've been depressed since 2014, but the past year it has made my life a living hell.\n\nI can't get out of bed, answer phone, brush my teeth or get a shower and if i manage to do one of those things, i can say it was a good one.\n\nIn 2015 i got diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis. I was unable to move out of bed for several months, and even moving my hand made my whole body crumble from pain\n\n( I dont remember much from this year or from the hospitalization when the ankylosing spondylitis hit me )\n\nI didn't think alot of it back then but it must have had an insane impact on my mental health without me even realizing it.\n\nI found happiness again somehow for a solid 8 months back in 2018 when i started lifting and going to gym almost everyday. I finally had found something to do with my life that i actually enjoyed alot. I was happy that i was making alot of progress and at the end of december 2018 i injured my shoulder, and to this day im unable to go back to gym and get back into lifting because my shoulder hurts so bad that i can't lift even a coffee cup without getting pain flowing into my arm.\n\nAfter my shoulder injury, i was in a dark place. I was still finishing studies and taking a final mandatory classes to get out of the miserable school i was in. For somereason i asked if i could swap seats to sit next to a girl who was sitting alone by the time. She was really good at this subject, and would teach me, since i was terrible at it. I ended up asking her out and the next thing i know, we are hanging out quite often. Me being me , i got my feelings involved more than i should \"knowingly\" after like 1 to 2 months of doing things together, but not \" dating \" , we were just randomly chilling at our places binge watching shows.\n\nBut for me, all the good things come to an end quickly for some odd reason.\n\nThis was my 2nd time where i found something good in my life to lose it after being in really REALLY dark place.\n\nI realized that nothing good ever lasts longer than a while for me.\n\nI dont know how many times i can fall down and get up.\n\nIm getting more and more tired.\n\nI recently started \" losing time \" where i might say something and forget what i said after 1 minute and say it again.\n\nEveryday is the same and many days are all blending into one day\n\nI can't sleep or i sleep too much.\n\nI haven't been able to cry in years and i miss it more than anything in this world, I WISH I COULD CRY!!!\n\nIn the beginning of 2018 i lost the ability to feel any emotions ( other than anger and irritation ) at all for many months, and i thought wow , this is good since im not sad anymore, but the days went by and i realized feeling nothing was worse than being sad. I was lost, but later this year i found my emotions again, to find them only being 10 times stronger.\n\nfeeling sadness 10x the normal amount isn't really maintainable, but when it gets to that point, my emotions just randomly shut off.\n\nI also feel like with depression and anxiety im losing my intelligence day by day.\n\nIt gets harder to think and speak. My thoughts are slow and i can't focus at anything, also remembering even the most basic stuff is getting challenging.\n\nWhen meeting new people, you get asked THE QUESTION \" What are your future plans? \"\n\nYou need to lie everytime to everysingle new person you talk to. In what world would you just say, that you see yourself dead in 2 years ? No, you will just make something up and tell them what they want to hear. Its getting really troublesome and boring.\n\nI started cutting myself to feel better few months ago, it has been the only thing beside music to keep me going for now.\n\nIm going to try and be brave and get help before it's too late for the sake of people i care about , for the first time in my life.\n\nI feel like nothing is fixable, but hey you can't know before you try!",

However, recently she has wanted to find herself and that has meant that she is distancing herself from me, not the kids, and wanting to do things on her own.\n\nNow I dont have a problem with it in theory but we have always done things together.. since we first met, and I mean everything, so I am finding it hard to not see this as a rejection or not being good enough for her. Coupled with that is the fact she has started making friends, one in particular who is another man with who she flirts with constantly..even progressing beyond that whilst at the same time not showing any interest in me.\n\nI also have problems making and maintaining friendships, I am casual acquaintances with many people but not really friends yet she believes that they are friends which causes issues when I say this to her.\n\nIn the past I have been upset and told her what she does and more importantly how she goes about it upsets me  ut she dismisses these and tells me I'm a \"drama queen\" and just manipulating her to control her and put her down...which is not the case.\n\nAt new years I had a bit of a mental break and now I am just trying to live by the motto \"what will be will be\" and think she will do what ever she wants to do and if she wants to leave she will. My issue is that it destroys me to think I'm not good enough and that I can be everything she wants outside the bedroom  but that she doesn't want me, is uninterested and rejects me inside the bedroom.\n\nTo top it off I am overweight, feel incredibly unattractive and ugly, a waste of time and effort and generally not good enough in any aspect of my life. I have also suffered a serious of injuries that has resulted in me having surgery last week which means another 8 weeks of not being independent. I don't have an positive reinforcement about how I look or if I am doing a good job but the issues are always highlighted to me.\n\nI'm not letting her know how much its affecting me simply because she had issues which means that she cant listen to my feelings as she feels it's a lie and designed to keep her controlled, I have tried talking in multiple ways.",

My mom is a single mom and has an executive-level well paying job. She ran 5 miles every day and always was put together.  Due to her job, she worked lots of hours and I didn't see her that much growing up. (she is an amazing mom and I understand the sacrifices she had to make to raise us). My life was normal, I had never faced a single hardship. However, in my second semester of junior year in HS my mom lost her job. She became extremely depressed for two months and started sleeping all day every day. This was extremely out of character for her. She attempted to kill herself and I found her and took her to the hospital.  She spent a week in a mental hospital. Though she is an amazing person, she doesn't save money and doesn't ever ask for help. Unbeknownst to my sister and me, we were broke.  We moved out of our childhood home into a family friend townhouse, 4 of us and 3 pets. She eventually did get better and got a job about 7 months after.\n\nI never went to therapy and just continued on with my life. I had extreme paranoia and general anxiety. I stopped caring about my appearance, stopped showering, started smoking a lot of weed, I knew I was depressed. I never felt like I was in my life, just coasting through. My senior year was spent with ups and downs.. I had high functioning depression. I spent that summer in my bed. I was always numb, and since I had nothing that excited me, I began to obsess over my body. I would spend hours every day taking pictures of my naked body comparing it to the day before. I had very very bad body dysmorphia and couldn't picture what I looked like if my life depended on it.  Fast forward to college, I went across the country to four-year in new England. I carried all the same issues with me but like I said I can function a normal life with depression.  I still went to class, made friends, joined a sorority,  partied (barely), and met boys. but, I was always numb and couldn't be myself. I got a nicotine addiction because that 5 seconds of head rush gave me something to feel. I play with my sleep ((stay up all night with caffeine (for the buzz) and sleep until 1 pm.\n\nWinter break (now ) one day I woke up cleaned my room and completely reorganized (real depressioners know how crazy this is ) and began to want to read self-help books.I feel alive and happy (not manic) It's like my depression just literally disappeared? I also picked up a new brand of cart and had a very good high with it.. wondering if that had something to do with it thast caused a shift in my brain? (not new to carts I've probably owned like 30 lmao) I also quit nicotine btw :) this break.. my theory is that I've been in a dissociative episode triggered from the trauma.

        "original": "I\u2019m a 3rd year university student studying psychology and for the past year I haven\u2019t been able to get off my mind the idea that the education system is in dire need of tweaking when it comes to teaching students about mental health. IMO There\u2019s way too much time and research going into treatment studies and into identifying risk factors for mental illnesses instead of PREVENTION strategies. I\u2019m 20 now, and I realized that for the past 8 years, I\u2019ve been using a variety of different coping mechanisms and distractions to deal with the increasing occurrence of unpleasant emotional states I would experience. Children turning into teenagers naturally start to experience changes in their mood states, thought processes, etc, which is normal! What isn\u2019t normal when you think about it is that the education system teaches students next to nothing about how to manage and interact with your feelings, thoughts, and emotions. It\u2019s like throwing a baby into a pool. And 1/3 of these kids parents will have their own, completely inadequate and lacking script of how to function that they\u2019ll pass onto their children. \n\nWhen I was 12 I became anorexic. When I was 16, I moved on and discovered bulimia. My eating disorders tormented me throughout my whole high school experience and only ended in my first year university. The thing is it wasn\u2019t so much about my body image. I\u2019m still not sure what stress or emotions triggered it in me. The EDs do seem to be in my past for good as I haven\u2019t relapsed in 2 years (nothings ever permanent, but I\u2019ve moved from vice to vice and doubt I would go back to those) When I was 12 I had nothing in my repertoire - no tools in my toolbox - and I guess I thought I found something (starving myself), that made me feel good. And because it made me feel good, I hid my disordered eating from my family and friends the whole time, because if they knew, they\u2019d try and take my disorder away from me - And my daily thoughts and feelings completely revolved around my obsession with food and the control that I had over it and my body. At the time, I thought that if they took my disorder out of MY hands (by forcing me to get help), then everything was over for me. I probably felt that way because I didn\u2019t know there are practices to help you manage intense feelings and emotions.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what job I\u2019m going into yet after university, BUT I know that I need to contribute in some way to reforming school policies so that mental health and mind management techniques are prioritized, and become considered as important as the other subjects. Because aren\u2019t they?? Depression and anxiety can be so debilitating that people sometimes turn to suicide. Pretty sure learning about ways to manage negative affect are more important than trying to decipher Shakespeare plays for weeks on end in English class. I\u2019m not saying that teaching children how to navigate information, stimuli, and their consequent thought processes is the end all be all for mental health disorders. I recognize that there truly are chemical imbalances in the brain and I think medication is so important for stabilizing people and giving them a second to finally get some air from whatever they are dealing with. But why do we learn all of these techniques to reframe our thoughts SO LATE, when someones already fallen depressed and fantasized many a time about killing themselves? Only THEN it\u2019s time for a therapist to come in and try to teach you how to rewire your brain. Instead of attempting to teach an adult who has been functioning with a certain maladaptive schema for their whole life how to build an newer, healthier one, why don\u2019t we start that processes earlier, when children\u2019s life story and development is just beginning and their minds are like an empty book waiting to be printed on. We could fully equip children with all of the tools and information they need to be an objective observer of their own mind. \n\nI\u2019d love to know, anyone who works with a school board, or has younger children, what the curriculum is like now? I was in elementary school only 8 years ago but you never know, things may have changed and perhaps steps have been taken to implement this idea! \n\nP.S. I\u2019m speaking specifically about Canada and the U.S. which is where I live, and I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like in other countries. \n\nHopefully the world doesn\u2019t end by the time I get my degree",

For the past 3 or 4 months I haven't been myself, I'm super aloof, blunt, easily irritated, sad, unmotivated, and uncomfortable around most people. I'm the type of person who never talks about their own problems and I just tend to listen to others, they wont ask about me but I've gotten used to having no one to talk to. Any type of physical affection from my friends, and even my parents, leaves me feeling stiff and uneasy. I can be openly affectionate with my four year old brother without limitations, but it feels weird with anyone else. Half a year ago I'd be itching to either receive or give affection, but even talking about it (especially romantic relationships) leaves me feeling sick to my stomach. My mother is the only person who has noticed that anything has been off. I wanted to talk to my best friend about it today after we got off the bus and told her that I had something personal I wanted to talk about, but once we were walking home she was just talking about her boyfriend, so I didnt say anything. I feel so empty and alone, positive that I have no one that I can go to. I want to be like I used to be but it feels like the whole world is on my shoulders weighing me down. I cried last night for the first time in months, felt like I was crying for hours, just tying to get everything out, and then I feel ashamed afterwards. During these months I don't look both ways when I cross the street, when walking to and from my bus I blast my music so I dont hear the cars passing. I don't WANT to die, it's just like I don't care, and I want to so bad. I feel like the only thing that's keeping me is my 3 younger brothers. I'm just so tired of feeling alone and worthless, like I'm just background noise in everyone else's lives. I just wanr to feel like I'm worth it to someone, platonic or not.

However, I am now 23 and it feels like I'm not progressing towards anything that may make me happy. I usually have periods where I feel like trying something new and get out of my comfort zone, and periods like this one when I look back and feel like it was all for nothing.\n\nI think that one of my main weaknesses has always been the absence of experience in some key aspects of life, especially relationships. I never had a girlfriend. I am not bad-looking, but very insecure when dealing with girls in a romantic way (mainly because of the aforementioned lack of experience). I would even go as far to say that my behavior may sometimes be considered asexual - even though I am not. Furthermore, the situation I am in right now (and who knows, perhaps also in the future) does not allow me to meet new people that easily, especially girls (I study computer engineering so yeah... lol).\n\nI feel like this lack of experience also influences other aspects of my life. I don't feel on par with most of the people my age. I feel a not-so-much adult in an adult world, alienated, left behind. This vicious cycle will eventually get worse and worse, as people go on with their life while things will get harder and harder for me to turn around.\n\nThat said, I tried to change things - perhaps not hard enough. I asked out a girl I barely knew via DM, she eventually said yes. This was my first date of my life. It went well, or at least it seemed to me, we laughed a lot and I personally had fun. But then she said she was not interested when I asked for a second date a few days later. Thing is, she is literally the only one I could have asked out that I somewhat know. This was one month ago.\n\nAnd now I am in one of those periods in my life where I feel like this is not going anywhere. I hope it's not true, but it's been like this for all these years. The hypothesis that this may be my life until the end gets more and more realistic as time goes on.\n\nI went to therapy for most of my life - from when I was a child up until 2 years ago, when I was 21. I never had the courage to state that never having been in a relationship was a problem for me. It was something I was ashamed to express my desire of. In general, I never managed to talk freely about my problems there because of this.\n\nI quit therapy after realizing that, after all these years, I was not happy with my life. I agree that it sounds simplistic, but I also wanted to try and live without it and see how I would fare. I still am on my meds though (prescribed from a doctor).\n\nI would love to hear some valuable, intelligent advice on one or more topics I've talked about in this post.\n\nI would also like to chat with people if interested, as I tend to lose touch with people I know during these periods.",

I work on campus which is where he works. He asked me if I would be able to pick him up and drop him off because he lives on the way, but it is about 15 -25 mins extra.\n\nIt wouldnt be a big deal and I would do it BUT....I have severe anxiety and last year I got in 2 accidents (not at fault) and since ive been scared to drive and developed a tick where I squint my eyes tight/long and tense/strain my neck/shoulder muscles, so I am also constantly in pain from tensing it when it gets bad. and triggered by stress/driving which is unsafe and dont drive when its bad, however most of the time I am okay but just stressed and have painful tension, but is not affecting my driving, but i only drive what i need to...extra time is just more time being in pain and stressed. \n\nI go to class/work on campus which is 45 minutes away. I only drive when I have to. I see doctors and say its caused by stress and have tried things to help, they say I can drive unless I feel it is very bad and going to affect my driving (which sometimes it will so I choose not to drive that day/call out of work) so i do not put others on the road in danger. He understood but yesterday he called asking me to drive him and i told him i cant and he says \"It's only 5 mins out of your way not a big deal\" I told him imagine only being able to hold your breath for 3 mins and then say you needa do it 5 mins longer, you CANT. This is how I feel to drive. It goes away when I dont drive for abit.\n\nHe tells me that he told people and he said that they said what im doing is fucked up, when of course, he didn't tell them my situation other than just \"not feeling like it\". With that being said, he did this to himself and refuses to take responsibility! he got his license revoked, multiple tickets/accidents/car stolen, why should i pay for his mistakes?\n\nSo he ends up ubering to me so I could drop him off at campus next day and said I didnt need to go to his work, just park. I agree even though he wanted me to pick him up to begin with to avoid taking uber twice which he did anyways. We leave and he starts asking why I am mad and I said im upset how he acted towards me. We get there and he starts going off on me how im selfish, told me he would never do anything for me, drive me anywhere again (which he did only few times forever ago) and says how 5 mins isnt a big deal. I start crying because I feel I am constantly told it's not a big deal when im in physical pain and anxious constantly. I told him he doesnt understand which is okay, but he says he does. We park and he says \"great now I have to walk for 2 hours to get to work\" WHEN HE TOLD ME i just needed to park and he will get to his work and made me feel like shit, so I drive him to his work which was 7ish minutes away but took me 15 to get back (I hit all the lights and there was traffic on that side) and was 1 min away from being late to work. He didnt thank me just said that hed never do anything for me again and that i made this difficult for no reason, im selfish and its my fault bc I wont \"fix it\" (my twitch/anxiety). I do feel bad, at the same time I cant change it.   \n\n\nI am constantly working with doctors and doing what they advice, trying new medications/new methods to combat this and help myself but it takes time and have monthly if not more appointments to try a new medication or something else and to talk about things whatever it may be. But he keeps telling me that I'm not trying because its not \"fixed\" and keeps thinking my issues are not a big deal and that im just being dramatic. And I honestly feel awful because I constantly feel I'm not being believed....that my issues are just made up and exaggerated, that it doesnt affect me \"that much\" But then in other times he will say how understanding and supportive he is of me and always seems geniuine in times  I need it, but as soon as my issues are affecting him all hell breaks lose and he tells me he still understands, but it suddenly is not a big issue and im exaggerating.

        "original": "My younger brother (by 1 year), who I\u2019ll call Joe, is suffering from depression. He aspires to be a highly successful executive in the business or finance sector, which he would be able to achieve with his high intellectual ability, his personality, and with an economics degree that he has been working towards....on and off. However, he has had to resit his first year multiple times and is currently on a break from university (in the UK we call it uni and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be using from now on) after being told that he can\u2019t resit a couple exams he failed till this summer, as opposed to last summer when he had expected to resit them. Before that happened he had mostly been doing really well, getting many 2:1s and firsts (the two best grades) in most of his exams and courseworks. But since the news about the whole year of delay he has been relapsing into his previous self-destructive behaviour, which isn\u2019t even that bad but involves a heavy amount of League of Legends, which he is highly addicted to when in a negative mindset. He told me today that he now uses it as his way to socialise because he alienated many friends after a drunken night out; he said that if it weren\u2019t for that he would go crazy. He also told me today that he has, a few times now, considered taking all of the painkillers in the house and consuming them all in one. Since he has a few times denounced suicide as an illogical and stupid thing that people can do (an opinion I disapprove of), this came as a shock.\n\nWe both still live with our parents because he\u2019s an on/off student and I recently got my masters degree and am looking for jobs, but our parents are not supportive towards him so he only really has me. Neither of us have ever been able to rely on our parents to help us out with any social or mental issues we were having, and my mum in fact has a negative effect on his mindset and behaviour (and mine, when I was depressed, but I\u2019m ok now). She means well. She is enthusiastic about bringing up two children who have the capacity and education (both privately educated and I have that masters) to go far in life, but she is not your typical nurturing mother. She doesn\u2019t understand us, especially my brother. She came from a different culture - she moved to the UK from China when she was around my age (23-25); Chinese culture is not known for its emphasis on human psychology, instead being very focussed on academic success and the subsequent monetary rewards. Since living in the UK for 30+ years and working as a nurse, she has some understanding of mental health and how we deal with it in this country (and the Western world in general), but not enough to help my brother. Every time she sees him on that game; every time she catches him in bed past 11am; every time my brother neglects to make progress in uni or the degree apprenticeship applications that we\u2019ve all recently agreed would be a realistic alternative to uni, she will get really pissed off and say something negative about his behaviour. He tells me that he is already feeling like shit for being like that, but her being all negative like that just makes him feel worse. And that\u2019s so obvious to me, but my mum won\u2019t fucking get it even though I\u2019ve told her time after time to try and be positive towards him. I can\u2019t blame this on my mother; Joe doesn\u2019t want to either. But the fact is that we don\u2019t live in a nurturing environment where we can effectively grow as people.\n\nMy own personal development came from uni, with influence from my uni friends. As a woman it\u2019s different because I can be vulnerable in front of my friends and it\u2019s not as much of a big deal (still really don\u2019t like it though). But as a man who realises the negative effect of our culture of toxic masculinity has on him, yet still can\u2019t shake his traditional masculine ideals, he can\u2019t stand to be in a dark situation in front his friends. So he has avoided social situations altogether, with only us family members and his work colleagues (he has a part-time job as a housekeeper) as people to talk to in person. I told him that his mentality of not getting help contributes to suicide rates, of which there is a higher trend amongst men across the globe. He agrees. But he can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s hard to think positive when your mind is that deep in a black hole.\n\nToday I insisted that he get therapy, which I\u2019ve mentioned in the past but not with as much emphasis as today. He doesn\u2019t enjoy the idea of therapy because he saw some sort of counsellor at uni for some time and he says it didn\u2019t help at all. But I told him that he could see a psychotherapist or clinical psychologist with years of experience, a PhD and specialist knowledge in his sort of situation/issue. He says he will see one next week. But to me, a week is a long time. We have a family history of depression too; my granddad committed suicide when my dad was 12; my dad himself has suffered depressive episodes (which improved with therapy!) and my uncle is highly unstable. I believe we are genetically predisposed towards suicidal thoughts. I had suicidal thoughts when I was a teen. I hate to hear that my brother has the same currently.\n\nDo I have to do a TL;DR for a fucking mental health subreddit? Surely not but I will anyway cos I cba to check.\n\nTL;DR my 22yo younger brother is depressed and this has led to gaming addiction, staying in bed till 1-3pm, multiple retakes of first year of university study, current hiatus from uni, current despair at his situation and subsequent suicidal thoughts. Other than encouraging therapy and listening to him vent, how can I help him?",

I just feel like i needed advice from somebody else because i have nobody to talk to except 1 person(ill get into it later), to start things off im 17 years old and i love to be outgoing for people no matter what cause i love helping other whenever/however i can and i love to make people laugh even tho it can get me in touble, im more of the class clown. When i was born my mom noticed i didnt behave normally (shes an occupational therapist) so i was taken to the doctors and diagnosed with high-functioning autism at a very young age (also im sorry if i skip around a lot i have a tendency to do that lol) my mother has always been so outgoing for me and has been there for me. And ive always been the person to overthink a lot and i  get extreme anxiety often, so ive had a very antisocial life up until highschool when i started to break my chains finally, but up until now. Recently i feel like everything has been going downhill, first im super worried about what im going to do about life after i graduate, and when i got a job in the past summer it was very stressful because the coworkers would think im weird and think im rude by not following instructions even though its only cause i had a hard time processing things (to an average person it seems like nothing is wrong with me) and i feel like ill never be able to secure a good job and keep it without getting fired. And when school started i quit when things started getting really busy. So when my seinor year i was so happy to be just relaxed but now the past month has been nothing but doubt, mostly because when i see everything i do i always think its not good enough and i could do better but am never been able to achieve it. For example i LOVE to play music as a hobby and have been playing cello since i was 5 and have grown to play many instruments like piano, guitar, drums, ukulele, and i also sing. And at home i have a mini recording studio that i use to record myself playing and edit which i taught myself to do but as of recently whenever i record and start editing all i can do is point out the mistakes i make and can never get it to be perfect by myself even though ive watched countless youtube videos to teach myself all i can but still with that i am always finding mistakes i make and end up almost crying cause i want to be good and when i listen to my favorite bands i want to be like them but never can achieve it. I want to come out with my own little album for the fun of it but i feel like people will think it sounds bad cause it's not probably. I want to talk to my friends about it but they dont know how to talk about things like this. And i do have a therapist that i see every 2 weeks but i dont feel like he really knows whats going on inside my head, and same goes with my mom but she understands me a lot more yet she is super stressed out as of recently and i dont want to bother her, so all of this has been making me just be really quiet and more anti-social than usual and i feel like crying all the time and just dont wanna get out of bed and wanna be in the shadows all the time even tho all i want is a shoulder to cry on. Does anyone have advice? Im sorry if its a lot of rambling and i can specify if you need me too! I just want to talk to someone. Thank you for reading!",

        "original": "I've dealt with depression for pretty much as long as I can remember, but I've been able to shrug it off most of the time and live life fairly normally. About a year ago I went vegan and starting losing weight, finally escaping my lifetime obesity. I thought all my problems existed due to me being fat, and that if I could be skinny I would be successful in everything I tried. Obviously that was disillusion, but I never ever imagined that my confidence and social skills would seemingly shed off with the pounds.\n\nI've always definitely been a quirky person, obsessed with niche music and not much else. I've always had a natural talent for music but as a person with very low self-worth, other musicians with their own fragile egos have often seen me as a target, and I've developed trust issues an a feeling of nihilism towards my passion. When I talk to people I feel like the only thing I have to talk about is music, and I end up getting frustrated in most conversations about the topic, a recipe for social failure.\n\nAfter a toxic first serious relationship and an even more toxic rebound, I decided to give up on relationships. I didn't want to be hurt anymore, but moreso I didn't want to sacrifice my own personality to better suit someone else's romantic desires. Most relationships I see appear to be full of conflict and I have no interest. I came out as asexual even though I still have the desire to have sex simply because I am repulsed by how open people are about it. Before my first serious relationship got too toxic we had an okay sex life, but I still found it to be quite overrated, and I felt like the fantasies I had developed from watching porn were not nearly as satisfying in real life. I recently went NoFap and quit porn, which has helped me feel more attracted to people, but I don't feel like I have the social skills or energy to flirt and pursue. I want to find someone who's life isn't purely about sex and relationships, and don't expect their partner to change drastically for them, but I feel more and more like this doesn't even exist. Even if it does, how would even I be able to pull myself together socially to get together with that person in the first place?\n\nI am planning to spend my final year at university abroad in order to reinvigorate my social skills, and find enjoyment in sex/relationships again, but as the application deadline gets closer I feel more and more like I'm just running away and I don't really have any business going. Additionally, Japan is where I am trying to go. I am learning the language but its a very slow and frustrating process, but regardless, if I can't even talk to people in English how the fuck am I supposed to be able to talk to people in Japanese?\n\nI guess I'm just lost. I have no motivation besides to finish my degree. I'm so lonely and I just want someone to put their hands through my hair and tell me it will be okay. I don't want to feel ugly anymore, I don't want to feel like a bad musician anymore. I don't want to feel like I have to run away but I also don't see what's left for me where I'm currently at. I don't want to feel like everyone is more savvy and clever than me in conversations. I don't want to feel like the least entitled person to happiness but everyone I've ever cared about has led me to believe that. I want to make new friends that I won't drift away from or won't say terrible things to me. \n\nI really don't know where to go from here and any insight is appreciated. Thank you.",

I did read them to be safe but I just wanted to throw that in just in case.\n\nI am a 36 year old woman who has had 3 children. My oldest (may my sweet girl RIP) would have been 19 next march and my youngest just turned 12. I did not have very many symptoms until after I had my first Angel but they really hit hard and all at one time. Also, she passed away st 6 weeks old which is pain I will never stop feeling. I have just learned to do the best I can but there is no way to ever not feel the loss of a child IMO. About 2 years after she was born, (she had passed a year and 8 months before this as well) I  was diagnosed with Bipolar type 1, Schizo effective disorder and severe GAD. It was vary hard dealing with those and being a new mom of an Angel and I always prayed it was severe PPD and depression from burying my babygirl and it would go away but sadly that didn't happen.\n\nI do feel blessed that I have never had severe issues with the Schizo effective effective disorder like many other have to deal with. For many years, it was just  auditory hillusinations and paranoia where I always think people are staring and talking about me but for the past 5 years or so, the voice (its always been just the one male voice but the things he says are beyond terrible. (I would imagine anyone who suffers with any form of hallucinations, especially visual ones. That would horrify me) about 5 or so years ago it seemed like all three of my diagnoses became 1,000 times more severe at the same time and I have no idea why.\n\nOK want to add that I am a heroin addict who has been in recovery for 8 years now which I sure has to have something to do with it but why didn't it start until after 3 years of sobriety? I take 1200 mg of Lithium a day, They upped my Depekote from 250 mg to 500 mg extended release and also put me on 2 mg of Klonopin 3 times a day but haven't had them since I moved from NY in 2012.  nothing is getting better and I am so lost and feel so hopeless and have no idea what to do! I am uninsured so I go to a clinic that has sliding scale fees and normally they are still very good doctors but sadly the only I see now doesn't listen to me at all. For months I have stayed in a bad anxious state where I just know something is really wrong but don't know what is and can never figure out what it is and the panic attacks have become so severe that I have called the EMTs at least 10 times in a month. Last week I Passed out from a a panic attack and the EMTs that come every single time I call, made me go to the hospital but after Trying on 4 different BP machines including a manual one, my BP stayes so high that none couls get a reading. The hospital is 30 mons away and it wast until halfway there and even at that poont, the bottom number was 133 which is beyond stroke level. Even though I have felt the same feeling for over 16 years, each one is still  terrifying because of how fast my heart rate gets and how high my blood pressure gets. I have barely slept on months because the voice has gotten so loud and so constant that it keeps me awake. If there are any Supernatural fans in here, it feels so much like what Sam went through when Cas broke down the wall in his brain making him go insane from his time in the Cage and he was constantly Hallucinating that Luci was with him st all times, singing or throwing those poppers on the ground all night which caused him to almost doe from lack of sleep. \n\nI am honestly not sure why exactly I am posting this but K just got such a strong urge to vent to people who truly understand.

I talked to my mom just a few nights ago and I am seeing a therapist this Wednesday. Even as I type this, I can't really tell if what I'm typing is a figment of my imagination or not. I have lost motivation for school. All I do is sit at home on my computer.\n\nI'm scared. I'm really scared and I don't know how much longer I can go like this. It's all I think about. Videos and articles I've seen say try not to worry or think about it, but that's literally what having anxiety is about. You can't stop worrying. I don't want this to ruin my life.\n\nDepersonalization is one of the hardest things I've ever had to explain. I know what I see is real. I just don't feel like I'm there. I feel like a lose so many things, then when I look, I just can't focus. I feel like I'm searching for the item, but my eyes are closed. I barely talk to anyone, and I don't like my friends. But it's not like I can just get new ones. I'm shaking while typing this. I've lost emotion except for sadness. I'm so scared. Please give me advice. It was better in mid-December but has gotten worse.\n\nPain doesn't feel the same.\n\nPlease help.",

This is my fourth I think mental breakdown of January, and things just seem to get worse. I feel like my friends aren't there for me, all of them seem to be in a relationship or in a good friendship and I am just in the background. The people I really want to hang out don't seem to care about whether I am there or not. This is even harder to cope with since I am still in the closet. All of them are Christian, I am most likely the gay one out of all of them, this makes it so so so hard to hang out with the people I want to hang with, and even tougher to be in a relationship. And It makes it even worse when I see people all around me happy with people who actually give a shit whether they are going to make to the event or not, or whether everything is doing alright with them. On my social media feeds, I see happy couples, doing things couples would do, and deep deep down, there is a part of me that knows that I may never get that. Then I see the gays, some closeted some not. The ones who or not, happily being them, being who they really are and I am terrified of what people will think of me. I can't be girly, I can't hang out with the people I really want to,  I just can't do it. I barely hang out with anybody, since I am homeschooled, I don't go to public school so I don't see people that I would call my friends on a daily basis. I feel secluded in my room, typing this, tears running down my face, rather than talking to a close friend. My school work piles on me constantly, I am always finishing things at the last minute and I never really get the weekend off. I have anxiety and social anxiety so I find it hard to go out in public to try and build friendships with people. And even when I do, it's next to impossible, I just can't relate to them, I don't see them as often, I honestly don't know much about them, and they are most likely a boy and I really can't relate to things they do or say. I just feel like everything is stacked against me, no social life, the fact that I am homeschooled, restricting how much I get out of the house, my anxiety, being gay and wanting a relationship and not being able to truly express myself, and that limiting me in pretty much everything I do. My life just feels like a checklist, my mom has everything planned out for me in high school, and is expecting me to go to college, but what I really want to do for a living is to be on youtube or twitch, doing the things I love, and having a loving and supporting community, which I could really use in times like these. And with no one to vent to, everything stays bottled up and I move on and do this all over again. So here I am, posting to Reddit, to vent about my problems.",

        "title": "In serious need of advice/perspective about my mental illnesses causing me to feel a new violent \"gross\" feeling due to my first kiss",
        "original": "Hiya. I'm a woman age 21 and I am really confused. I wrote a lot of context about this issue, because I am having a really hard time with all of this, but if it\u2019s too long to read I totally understand-- I titled the main issue at hand below so you can just skip to there if you would like. No matter how much you read, I really really appreciate it.\n\n*Added a tl;dr at the end for both sections.*\n\nCONTEXT IS IMPORTANT:\n\nI wasn't interested in sex and relationships at all during my childhood and adolescence. When I first learned/ got the \"sex talk\" from my mom around age 8, I was repulsed by sex. It made me feel gross. This feeling, however, is not completely epitomized by the word gross. Thinking about sex made me feel so uncomfortable that I wanted to rip off my own skin. I felt absolutely awful. I never discussed these feelings with my mom, because I couldn't even say the word sex without my whole body cringing. Around this same time I was diagnosed with panic disorder {description of the illness, feel free to skip if you already know: Panic disorder focuses on having panic attacks; panic attacks are often caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain which triggers the fight or flight response when nothing is actually wrong. The main system symptom is extreme fear accompanied by some or all symptoms such as sweating, shaking, feeling dizzy and/or weak, heart/chest pain, as well as an inability to breathe. It is important to distinguish between those who have panic disorder and someone who has experienced one or few panic attacks. Many people may experience a panic attack in their lifetime, or perhaps something more accurately described as an anxiety attack as a panic attack is triggered by no particular reason. These people experience extreme anxiety as a result of a specific reason or incident. To be actually diagnosed with the disorder it has to affect everyday life}. My main triggers as a child were things like vomiting, blood, being in new/uncomfortable situations, and other things like that. I was really lucky in that my mom also has panic disorder so she recognized the signs. Most mental health disorders are diagnosed 8 to 10 years after the first major symptoms appear so I am really happy that my mom could help me with this so I didn't have to go through a super long period being afraid of fear. My mom took me to a therapist to talk about my problems and things began to get better. We established that I had obsessive compulsive tendencies and severe anxiety. After that I didn\u2019t really think about sex and romantic relationships for a while.\n\nAt age 17 I was a senior in high school, and for the first time ever I became interested in sex. I began to think about sex more casually and it no longer gave me the \"gross\" feeling that I explained above. In fact, I started to want to have sex. Not in a crazy way, I just become open to the idea of having a relationship, falling in love, and having sex. Now I\u2019m guessing I need to clarify that I like guys and I\u2019m a girl. And to clarify even more I *really* like guys. Not in a boy crazy way, but I obsess over my favorite musicians, actors, and stuff like that. I also like romance dramas and movies. When I meet guys I don\u2019t wanna jump them all or anything like that. I had no experience with guys really at all when I was 17. A guy had asked me out once (well the same guy asked me out three times over three years). The first time I said yes, but then he ignored me for a while and it was weird so I was like \u201cokay I guess this is over.\u201d It kind of just ended like that. The next time he asked me out I was 16 and it was a year later. I hadn\u2019t talked to him in a while and I needed help with something a project and I needed it to be a guy so I asked him and he helped me. I had to drive him home and he turned off the music and started asking me all these serious questions like \u201chow is your life? Are you doing okay now that your parents are divorced?\u201d And other stuff like that. I just gave him some surface level answers and then dropped him off. This is when I felt that \u201cgross\u201d feeling again. I was really uncomfortable and upset. I avoided him and honestly never wanted to talk to him again. It was pretty easy to avoid him so I just kinda let it go saying that I just didn\u2019t like him and then that was it.\n\nAfter high school I went to a four year college right away. I was hoping to meet a guy, him become my boyfriend, fall in love, have sexy times, all that jazz. I remember trying to convince myself that I had crushes on guys when I didn\u2019t really feel that way because my bitch ex-best friend at the time was super boy crazy and she had a crush on every guy she met. I also think another reason why I was trying so hard to have a crush on a boy was because I really wanted a boyfriend and to start my \u201csexual journey.\u201d But unfortunately I never really felt that way about a guy so I didn\u2019t really pursue anyone and no one ever pursued me either. My love life was nonexistent. After like 2/2.5 years of college I started to wonder why people even bothered with relationships-- not because I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend and felt bitter though. I honestly just didn\u2019t get it. It seemed like a lot of time to try to get along with someone. I also didn't have any close guy friends so I didn\u2019t really know what it was like to have any kind of relationship with a guy other than my dad, my brother, and some nice coworkers.\n\nAround this time I was having some issues with my mental health again. I regularly see a psychiatrist and take medication for my illnesses (I am very very pro-medication). One doctor visit, my psychiatrist broke the news that he had another diagnosis for me. In addition to the panic disorder, I have Borderline Personality Disorder {description of the illness, feel free to skip if you already know: BPD is a very difficult to diagnose disorder and is considered one of the most extreme and can be very difficult to treat. Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized as experiencing extreme fear of abandonment,  unstable relationships, distorted and often changing view of one\u2019s self, explosive anger, recurring feelings of emptiness, anxiety, and depression.} Long story short this illness sucks so much and sometimes I get so angry that I can\u2019t even think straight.\n\nAnyway, when I started to wonder all these things, I went abroad to study for four months in South Korea and the whole time I was there I was much more occupied with all the great things I was doing so I wasn\u2019t really thinking about boys or sex or that kind of stuff. I had such a great time in Korea! I learned a lot about myself. I realized that my bitch ex-best friend was indeed a bitch that made me hate myself and was super toxic. When I got home I dumped her ass (I actually cried a lot and was super sad. I\u2019m just trying to make myself sound like a cool badass). I missed my brother and sister so much while I was away; I knew that I would because I am super close with both of them, but I was surprised because I actually missed my mom and dad too. My parents are a mess in so many ways, but me being away made them realize how much they depend on me and they started to be more appreciative towards me. I really learned to love myself and for the first time I can remember, despite all the trauma and horribly difficult obstacles I have had to face in my life, I was genuinely happy and I genuinely really liked myself.\n\nTHE MAIN ISSUE THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW\n\nNow cue the issue I am having that made so much of that happiness, confidence, and comfort go away. The fall 2019 semester (last semester) was the beginning of my last year of college. I was coming back from Korea so I was getting used to going to school in the US and seeing old friends. Two of my closest friends go to school out of state and I wasn\u2019t friends with that bitch ex-best friend anymore so I was hanging out with different people. This is when a friend from a club I was in since the beginning of college reached out to me. (He is important to this story and I will just be referring to him as \u201cBoy\u201d through the rest of this post.) I met up with Boy and we had a great time. We are the same age but he graduated early. Right now he is doing freelance work in the film industry and he has a lot of free time.\u00a0We started hanging out like once a week and I really enjoyed it.\n\nHe confessed to me that during the semester I was gone he got kicked out of our mutual club. I asked him why and he told me that he did something bad to a girl. I already knew Boy was a black-out drunk, but he told me at a party he was black-out drunk and he felt up a girl without her consent. He was clearly super beat-up about it and felt extremely remorseful. Boy is a super liberal guy and really doesn\u2019t seem like the guy to do this sort of thing. Since I wasn\u2019t there when it happened, it was really hard to believe it or even get a grasp on the situation. As someone who has been sexually harassed I before, I felt super conflicted about being his friend, but like I said I wasn\u2019t here when it happened so it seemed pretty unbelievable to me. He told me he was going to group therapy and that he was having a tough time because he hated himself for what he had done.\n\nAfter a while of hanging out I started to think that I might have a crush on him-- I really think this was because I wanted a boyfriend more than wanted him. I felt super guilty, because of what he had done to that girl, but it was hard to understand. After hanging out a bunch for like 2 months we were at his place watching a movie and he started to cuddle up with me. It was fine and I was telling myself that I liked it and that it something romantic was finally happening. After the movie we ended up in a weird state-- like the vibe was weird. He was being really touchy and kept hugging me awkwardly. At the time I kept telling myself I liked it. Thinking about it now while I\u2019m writing this I feel super uncomfortable.\n\nWe hung out again next week and at first things were good as usual. We were going to my place to watch the sequel to the movie we watched last time. As soon as I turned it on he snuggled up against me and suddenly I felt painfully uncomfortable. I started thing things like \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this and I want to be somewhere else.\u201d I told myself that I was just nervous. After I calmed myself down a little I started to get irritated thinking things like \u201cthis is boring. I\u2019d rather be watching the show I\u2019m binging right now, and why is he cuddling against me in the traditionally \u2018girls position?\u2019 If I could cuddle with a boy I would want to be the one hugging; this is just annoying.\u201d His hair touched my face a bit and it felt course and I was disgusted. He touched my stomach a bit and I felt disgusted. Even though I know that was what I was feeling now, at the time I just brushed it off as being nervous. After watching the movie we were talking about all kinds of stuff. He hangs out with my bitch ex-best friend sometimes and that pisses me off because she did a lot of really horrible things to me and at some point that came up which just pissed me off again.\n\nI\u2019m not the type of person that likes uncertainties and I am also not the type of person who lets a problem be unsolved. I am what you would call a \u201cfixer.\u201d So anyway in one way or another I asked him if he liked me and he said he didn\u2019t know. Well that was kind of annoying but whatever. He asked me too and I also said I didn\u2019t know. Then he asked if he could kiss me and I said yes. I\u2019m kind of ashamed to admit this but I felt like a loser being 21 and never being kissed. I know that I shouldn\u2019t feel bad about it, but the issue still stands. So I really wanted to kiss somones-- or should I say anyone. The kiss was not good. It didn\u2019t feel good. He stuck his pointed tongue on my teeth. It was really not good. After the kiss, I wanted him to leave. I wanted to think by myself about how I felt, but he wanted to talk more. And he basically held me hostage in my own home for a couple hours. It was horrible. Everything he said made me cringe. After he finally left I called my brother and he told me it seemed like I just didn\u2019t like Boy.\n\nFor the next week I was seemingly okay, but whenever I thought about the kiss I would violently rub my mouth and have that intense \u201cgross\u201d feeling. I didn't want to think about it anymore, but I thought about it all the time. By the end of the week I was having a full-blown breakdown. I never wanted to see/talk/think about Boy again and I still don\u2019t. He texted me and everything he said was super annoying. I didn\u2019t want to explain to him what was happening so I just told him I was busy and I was going through something. He said texted me annoying stuff like \u201coh ok...\u201d and \u201cI must have really messed up.\u201d I really don\u2019t like pity parties so it just made my dislike towards him increased. This is really unfortunate because we really were good friends.\n\nIt's been about 2 months now and I am still super uncomfortable. When I think about it I get violently upset and I want to aggressively rip the memories out of my brain. I can\u2019t even say these things out loud because it makes me so uncomfortable. Just trying to say \u201cwe cuddled\u201d made me so distraught I started to feel painfully uncomfortable and I start to cry in an angry and distressed way. I am so confused and I feel so helpless. My head is constantly swirling with questions like: Are my obsessive compulsive tendencies coming back? I have to wash myself a lot throughout the day, is this related? This is too uncomfortable to just be a dislike of kissing right? Is it just because I don\u2019t like Boy specifically? Is it because I\u2019m not super comfortable with my body (I am overweight and I used to be really insecure but I\u2019m pretty confident these days)? Will I ever be able to have sex? Is it related to my mental health disorders? Or am I possibly some type of asexual, like a gray asexual? Am I alone in all this? Or maybe is this some new mental illness that I need to add to the list of things wrong with my brain? What even is normal? And when will I feel better?\n\n*tl;dr: I have a history of mental illness (Obsessive Compulsive Tendencies, Panic Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder). As a child I was disgusted by sex, but when I turned seventeen I became interested. I went from really hating myself to really liking myself in the past year.*\n\n*tl;dr: I somehow got involved with a friend of mine that is a boy. We kissed and know I have been plagued by this violently \u201cgross\u201d feeling for the past 2 months and continue to feel that way. I hate him because of it and I feel super helpless. I am worried about never being able to have sex and always feeling so violently repulsed.*\n\nI am so lost. Anything you have to say could help so please feel free. You can ask me any questions-- I am totally open book. Thank you so much for your time and I hope you are doing well and feeling happy.",

My birthday was the 4th of November, the Thursday two weeks before my parents tried contacting my girlfriend several times throughout the day, me, being the stubborn optimist thought it was to surprise me for my 25th. I went about my day none the wiser, work, gym, Thursday grocery shop. My girlfriend was overly affectionate throughout the grocery shop, and I just thought she had a bad day.\n\nHalf an hour after we get home my dad (he lives 200 kms away) and my brother (almost 350 kms) arrive, unannounced at my house, and inform me, that my cousin who I grew up with, was extremely close with, who was my first ally when I was outed as bisexual, committed suicide. Even now, I have not actually said the words out loud, even though I carried him to the hearse.\n\nLately, and when I mean lately, I mean almost every night since the 24th of October, I have had trouble sleeping, if I don't have a couple of alcoholic beverages, I struggle to get any decent sleep, which I don't like, considering I'm a PT and prided myself on being healthy and strong. My father told me to suck it up and that his parents were doing it worse, so I guess I've bottled it all inside, and it's cracking through, breaking down on boxing day, lack of sleep, irritability. \n\nI think about death a lot, but I do not want to die, however it's the unbearable dread of the notion, and the feeling of why did he die, when me myself, of the same age am still here? Is it fair if I was to succeed in life where he is no longer with us? He mentioned he wanted to speak to someone but was scared they'd take his guns away, which at this point i wish he did.\n\nWe swore after our grandfather died \"of a broken heart\" that we would always be there for each other  but i failed him and its ripping me apart inside. The guilt is suffocating.\n\nI'm fearful of seeking help as I don't want to be seen as at risk. I do not want to harm myself. At all.

        "title": "I'm afraid to seek help (Long Post)",
        "original": "Forgive me because this might be a long post for a first time Redditor like me. I've been looking for sites where I could write my story. A friend introduced me to Reddit to browse memes (so if he read this I might drop out) instead of other websites. I haven't really used it since I downloaded it so here's like my first interaction with this.  \n\n\nJust like the title suggest, I'm afraid to seek help. Well, as much as possible I would like to be anonymous but I don't know how to keep anonymity in Reddit. I also don't tell others my problems in person just like in social media.  Currently, I had already deactivated most of my social media accounts tho, except Instagram, although I don't open it as much as I did and archived thousand of my posts...  \n\n\nOne of my problems is that I forget what they are. So I'm often left sad without any reason why I'm just sad. It started when I was younger at the peak of my puberty where I'm too anxious about everything I do and when I did something that is considered embarrassing for me but normal for others, I imagine there's a vault of memories on the back of my head where I store all my \"bad memories\" and forget them. Looking back, I used to \"open\" it and just remember all the embarrassing things I did, well I don't remember why. Then it came a time where I couldn't open that vault and it takes all my mem'ries, the \"good\" and the \"bad\". I think it took a toll on my emotions as I grew up.  \n\n\nSo I'm already 18 and recently came out to my parents. Well, I thought they fuuullyy accepted me and told me they were open-minded and was fine with it. About my sexuality, hmm. I don't know how to tell you the entirety of it because I'm really new to it too because I recently (well years ago tho, like 2-3) decided to think about it. So basically I was so straight (acting like one though) but I thought it was natural, I grew up like it and thinking I was straight so I thought I was tho. But you know, this is sooo new to me, the lingo, actions, everything! So when my parents asked me to explain, I really don't know the answer. So back to my parents, a day after I opened up to them, my mom called me and asked me a series of questions and lecturing me about what a bad decision this was. Although I was quiet the whole time, a little teary-eyed (I don't want to show her I was crying because it would show that I was weak and am not ready to make that decision) so with all my power within me I stopped my myself from crying and my voice from quivering. Then I said, \"Why are you like this to me? I opened up to my friends and classmates and they treated me the same as if nothing has happened. You're supposed to be the one who should understand me first before them.\" then she answered this and it was too intense I went to my room, \"You've become gayer. How would we understand if you don't tell us.\" (I forgot to mention that they said \"they already knew\" when I came out\"). Then the next day after that, whilst I was having my brunch (It was a Saturday) she went to sit with me on the table and talked with me (Again, it was more of a one-sided conversation as I stayed quiet the whole time).  She said this, \"About the thing, you said to us the other day, you're dad was really disappointed because he has hopes for you. He would understand and accept you sooner, just give him time.\"  \n\n\nFast forward, my mom's **changed**. We used to be extremely religious (Roman Catholic), I grew up praying the Rosary every night while kneeling down (oftentimes, seiza style). So as I grew up I have learned a lot and of course, in our generation, there is an answer to almost all questions with the use of your phone. I have kept myself but I don't think I could call myself religious, tho I love and respect all religions (I think that is when I started to take a step back to mine). So yeah like I said earlier, she has somewhat changed. Although she prays before going to work, now she does these rituals. I'm not used to sudden changes to I called her out while we're eating dinner. \"Why are you doing this? This is all just a scam or fakery (I don't know the proper term), who do you really believe in? We're Catholics, we're supposed to believe in one God. (I know this part became a little religious, I'm sorry guys, please bear with me) Technically, there is no \"God\" in your rituals so who do you do \"it\" for? Please stop this already.\" So that escalated weeks later, I was taking an afternoon nap 'cause why not? It's the weekend. She called me to her room and told me, \"You, (my name), stop with your negativity! You're ruining this for me and for the energy coming in this house! I'm not doing this just for me but for us family!\" (It's too long I forgot the rest) So I was tired and still dazed because I just woke up so I said, \"I don't want to talk about this right now, I'm going back to my room.\" While walking back to my room she was shouting, \"Come back here! I am not done talking with you!\" So I was lying on my bed my sister walked into my room looking for something, a charger maybe. Then my mom busted through the door with flaming eyes and shouting, (I forgot most of it because like I was, I was sleepy all my emotions are turned off that time and my sister was still at my room and now stuck in the situation). So she pulled my blanket but could only pull half of it as I was holding the other end. So when she realized that she let go and started pointing at me (I was pulling back my blanket at the time)  \n\n\n\"You've been too much for this family! You think you're so smart, you're not! You have not contributed anything yet you're so boastful! Demon! When you came out we accepted you and you're still like this!\" (My sister doesn't know I came out, well that saved me the trouble) She called me a lot of nasty things which I couldn't translate, but she called me a Demon several times, and for me who grew up religious that is something for me. So when that happened, I officially became the black sheep of the family **\\*applause**\\*  \n\n\nWriting this is mentally draining because it takes effort to remember stuff accurately. Are you still here with me?  \n\n\nThis happened weeks ago and as of now, she speaks to me in a soft tone. Well I know she's doing that to forgive her, well I don't? Well, I'm doing all my duties as their eldest although there's really no feelings left. I don't think I could recover from this, I have already considered myself as dirt and demon as they have suggested.  \n\n\nI grew up having only myself to support me. I cried extremely silently if they ever caught me, I'd get \"lovely beating\" because **men shouldn't cry**. I have only publicly cried in front of my previous adviser when I lost my phone and in front of my previous professor. It really takes effort to keep composure is not? I literally have no one to tell my feelings, problems, and rants. I don't have anyone to lash out, I'm just by myself. I have a lot of friends though, but we're not on the level to tell our problems.  \n\n\nSo in my class, I joined this clique (one of their \"leader\" or member was kicked out and I think they were looking for replacements so I was that one but I drag along a friend so it's not hard for me to adjust) They used to gossip and make fun about me when the classes just started because of my hair. At that time I was growing my hair because I shaved my head the previous year (at the time it was my way to vent? It's crazy I know that is why I grew it out) So when I grew it out, it was ugly, I know! It's all spiky mohawk like spiky. They called me names like McSundae and Spiky (like the name of a dog). I'm extremely receptive, even though I was erasing the writings on the board, I could hear them clearly and see their reflection through the glass board. I may be ambivert but I'm not a dumb one. I never confronted them about this until I joined their clique and admitted that I knew from the start. Then after I joined their clique, a few weeks (maybe months) have passed and I started to smell bad! Like bad-bad! I couldn't stop or control it, I used products to stop it but all failed. It's because my anxiety came back (well I was not diagnosed but it is what it is) then I heard whispers again and they started picking on me again jokingly this time, but I knooow. It's gone now though, I'm really glad. Until now they didn't know that I knew.  \n\n\nIn the clique, this was this girl that I got close to and I thought I could trust her. But now the others are teasing her with a boy who used to blatantly bully me the previous years. Of course, I don't want to ruin our friendship and their growing romance so I don't tell her that he used to hurt me. Then my only escape, my friend, was gone. I couldn't trust her anymore, well maybe I do, but I don't know. I don't want to interact with anyone who's affiliated with that boy.  \n\n\nSo last year, my friend wants me to introduce myself to the school guidance counselor which helped him and two others from our class. So one day I said yes, but when we came to her office I chickened out. Luckily there was a research convention in our school at the time and she wanted to come and I used that to get out of there but I went with her and got to know her a little. She was really kind and extremely intelligent! She gave me her one and only chocolate. I'm embarrassed to talk with her again, I really want to but I can't it's too embarrassing to tell her this story of mine.  \n\n\nI am not suicidal (yet I think) but there's always a thought in my head that I want to do it but I don't (confusing? a'ight) If only if I decided to do it, I want to do it quickly with no pain. Again, it's just a thought. I'm afraid to seek professional help because I'm afraid of the truth (that I might be depressed). I don't want to open up to my friends because I know they have problems too, I really do, they had told me and I listened. I feel like they'd laugh at me or something like that and think \"Just because of that you're like that?\". This is my form of venting out. It feels so great doing this. If you finished this, daaamn!   \n\n\nThank you.",

OCD has been big on my mind, i think i\u2019ve always had it but at a young age i never acknowledged behaviors as something other than basic human functions. man lemme just spit out some shit that goes on with me/ random involuntary spasms and twitches(small magnitudes)/ recently an unkempt flurry of emotions from varying sources but primarily stress about my job caused me to punch a wall and fracture my hand(or something i don\u2019t have insurance so no professional evaluation or surgery). part of that is that i bottle up A LOT. like this boy doesn\u2019t want to be a nuisance in anyway i want to help and not throw my emotions at people, but lately it\u2019s more just been an i guess unconditional fear of speaking my emotions/ \u201cintrusive thoughts\u201d whatever part of my inner self i\u2019m still in touch with will berate me any chance it gets. i have a lot of random thoughts about being killed, or delusions(in general) that the person kind of walking in my direction not making any eye contact holding a bag of groceries is about to murder me/probably having some generalized anxiety, feels a good bit like what it sounds like but social anxiety specifically is more probably more present. i\u2019m almost never comfortable around people and (regardless of who\u2019s around) constantly feeling like somethings wrong like i\u2019m doing something wrong. although i follow the mindset of not caring what others think and try to keep in mind that their thoughts don\u2019t affect me, anxiety remains a strong force in my life. it cuts through me it really comes with a lot of pain and backlash from myself. the anxious feeling causes my spasms to increase, i\u2019ll avoid the pain of talking and looking at people.//. BASICALLY i can\u2019t isolate one disorder, illness or straight up delusion. my life really just consists of confusion, pain and numb disconnection and it\u2019s pushing me a bit. i feel like i lost who i am, like there was this person who was a little goofy but pretty great i miss the guy man. forgot i\u2019m wrapping this up, i don\u2019t have the resources to get an official evaluation. if anyone who read through the entirety of this(absolutely fucking thank you by the way you\u2019re pretty great to be using your valuable time to read through my thoughts i appreciate and love you very much even if you just get a kick out reading peoples pleads for help) has anything to offer me i will take it i have no reservations for what that may be i don\u2019t even know what i need or what to do what i should do i\u2019m pretty lost lol. that being said an accurate trusted online mental health evaluation is probably a good place to start. maybe some meditation advice, methods that could assist me(i\u2019ve practiced low level sensory deprivation meditation in the past, is that something i should go back to?). i don\u2019t know what else i should or shouldn\u2019t put here but i\u2019ll try to remember to check back here. i\u2019m sorry if it seems like i\u2019m unthankful for your time i really am but i can\u2019t think of many more words. ah fuck i\u2019m just gonna post i\u2019m sorry.\n\n-your one and only",

Today, I was also diagnosed with Bipolar tendencies. The last time I was manic was about 8-10 years ago when I obsessively played WoW for about a year with little sleep and not much care for anything. If you want to laugh along with me (because it's sort of funny, and humor is the only thing getting me through this), my current bout of mania is being hyperfocused on knitting. My kids are taking care of, but I am choosing to knit over cleaning the house, personal hygiene, sleep, and even work at times. I'm slightly sad about this revelation because I've been knitting since I was 7, but I recently decided to turn it into a business. I've made a little money, but more importantly, I have made friends, real ones, for the first time in my adult life. I have self-confidence I never had before, and I was feeling really good about everything, especially since I only work from home, and the idea of starting a business was really exciting. Now that it seems it's just a bout of mania, it's a bit of a punch in the gut. My doctor says if I can learn balance, I can continue on, which is a relief because knitting is something I have always loved. I didn't even realize it was becoming a \"problem\" until recently, and when my psychiatrist started to mention the diagnosis today, I was upset, though agreed, something was definitely \"off.\"\n\nAnyhow, now that we're done laughing at the fact I have the strangest mania obsession ever and I clearly must also be 80-years-old (hello Borderline, I usually age slide into my teens, but maybe I've slid into geriatrics?), I have a real-life issue. I have a low sex drive. I have two young kids (3 and 4) but I don't think it's because of them. Me and my partner get time alone, and I just have zero interest most of the time. I can go months and not care. Once we start, I'm into it, but I want to want it (I hope that makes sense). I am on Cipralex, Topiramate, and Seroquel, and am about to add Lithium. Is there anything I can do to want to have sex, other than just doing it? My partner isn't pressuring me at all. But I want to do it for them, and also for me (please don't turn this into something it isn't - no one is forcing me, and I don't think there is an expectation. I just recognize that sex was a healthy part of our relationship, and I miss it and would like it back, but I also don't love doing it when I'm not particularly in the mood).",

There's so many times that my health has nearly cost my life and negatively impacted those i love. I'm not discounting or negating that fact. \n\nHowever, i do want to acknowledge that everyone has strengths and the experiences we go through can cause for some interesting and surprising adaptations for us to survive in the world that on occasion may provide an advantage from time to time. So no, not romanticism, just adaptive learning that many haven't grown a skill for. \n\nFor example, my diagnoses in order of when i got them between the ages of 23 to 34 and now 35 fyi... Anxiety, depression, bipolar, panic disorder, adhd, ptsd and autism (Aspergers). So, some particular \"flavors\" or \"traits\" that it shows is that when i do something, that's all that i do. Doesn't matter if it's positive like cooking, sewing, working, contacting people or sabotaging behavior like watching videos in bed when i need to start my day, spending money i don't have or playing games when i should be working/cleaning. The end result is chronic disorganization and many things (and often people) get pushed aside. So, most of my life I've lived in mild to moderate hoarding conditions. Yes, this has and still has negative impacts on my life, no denial there. \n\nBut there's an interesting fact i noticed...\n\nWhat do people who have hoarding behaviors have in common with pecan pickers?\n\nThey are able to step lightly so they don't break what they find valuable and look at the small details of a pile to find what they want inexplicably faster than most people. So, i was laid off my job and needed some cash for Christmas. I live in a part of the country that buys pecans wholesale from growers and the public which usually pays 3\u00d7 or more what collecting cans does. It was already late in the season with only about 3 weeks of a 3 month season left. My mom owns about 5 mature pecan trees and i got permission to pick in her neighbor's yard while he was gone. In that amount of time with very little day light (i can't ever get out of bed before noon) with a rake, leaf blower and a couple storage bins, i picked over 200 lbs by myself. Most people do that over the entire season. So, i was able to pay my phone bill and get gas money so i could do other gigs while waiting for more work to come it.\n\nI also have used my lack of selective attention and hyperfocus to produce alot of sewing projects. I made my winter wardobe one year in one day. Also, i even turned some of my \"negative\" flavors of binging YouTube into saving the lives of kittens and prevented a kidnapping for someone else (don't recommend. Please learn to stay alert of your surroundings at all times and know how-to describe your location quickly and accurately at all times. Something i learned from work. Long story)  \nAlso, since i have attention and memory problems, i have learned to never rely on memory at all. So i have gotten really good at using google products, namely google docs. So i can send my resume on command, remember important medical info for myself or animals, be able to reference facts people told me etc. The way it has helped me the most was being the sole witness to a car accident. I knew the police weren't going to come since it was a busy weekend. So i wrote down what i saw and google docs has a time stamp. Now the poor guy has to go to court and i don't have to live with the anxiety of some dumbass hot shot lawyer being all abelist in my face and cause the jury to doubt me/question my memory.\n\nTl;dr mental illness can teach you some interesting stuff and sometimes it's actually useful.\n\n\nAnyone else experience this?

I don\u2019t have a job so by hour 5 of self hate I have to go do something. Hmmm let\u2019s pick- hang out with my emotionally abusive boyfriend & his friends, go to my best friends in 8 hours when she gets off work at 2am , go see my dying dad at the hospital or hang out with my crazy mother who picks fights with me everyday for simply being alive.

        "original": "I use to try so hard, maybe even too hard. I use to have so much hope even when things weren't going so well. My life feels cursed as if I'm supposed to be stuck in a mediocre life or worse, some strange kind of hell. \n\nI recently got laid off, because the company I'm working for moved to another state after not being able to find the correct person they needed to higher (or though they say). Right now I'm in a limbo of not knowing where to go or what to do. I have some ideas of a couple of things I want to do, but since so many things in my life ended in disappointment, I don't have all the hope I wish I had. I feel like a butterfly that had its wings torn off, no longer able to fly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remember, back in High School, which was over a decade ago, I was so hopeful for the future. Things weren't perfect at the time, but I was very hopeful. I always knew I was different, I didn't do very well in a school other than some select classes, which were usually classes I shared the most interest in and they usually were related with performing arts and theater. Other classes, I could focus on, no matter how much I tried. I also had a very difficult time comprehending what was being taught or what I was supposed to learn. Things just didn't make sense to me. Also, my social cues are off and I've always have had a hard time making friends or even keeping friends. I have recently discovered and realized (even though still undiagnosed) that I have Aspergers, which helped me make a little more sense of my world. When I was a child, my mom knew something was up, so she had me checked by professionals, they had the idea that I was on the autistic spectrum, but in the end, they left it at \"unknown\" because they couldn't figure it out. This was early-mid 90s, so maybe they didn't have everything they needed to give me an actual diagnosis? I don't know what happened there, I wish they could have diagnosed me with Aspergers back then, that would have helped a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Anyways, after I finished High School, I didn't continue schooling right away. Instead, I wasted a couple of years doing something for a religion I was brainwashed into, luckily I'm no longer in that cult, but it certainly had a big turn in my life and affected me in many ways, still leaving an imprint that is hardwired to my brain to this day even though I left 8 years ago. I left this cult about a year and a half after I was I finished this particular trip I went on after I finished High School. The time I left my religion was also the same time I started school again. I went to college to pursue my interest in performing arts and theater. The school was expensive, and even though I didn't do well in all of my classes, I did very well in others when it came to things that I was actually pursuing. This was a very good time of my life, unfortunately, it didn't last. My step-father at the time, who's schizophrenic and was very involved with the religion I use to be in had some very strange ideas about me that he thought were real. It was so bad that he even believed that I was having a sexual relationship with my mother (I'm disgusted just thinking about it). He belied my mother and I would sneak out at night while he was sleeping to have sex (thinking about his believes even today makes me want to barf). Anyways, this made him very jealous and I had to move out. (My mother eventually divorced him a few years after this, which I'm glad because he was also emotionally abusive). I was working part-time at a fast-food joint and was only making a quarter more than the federal minimum wage. I had to be on food stamps so that I could afford the rent for the room I was renting at the time. I was unable to keep my car because that was out of my budget. No car meant that I didn't have transportation to go to school. The area I lived at had very good public transportation... except the location of my school, so I couldn't even take public transportation to get there. So I did what I had to do, I dropped out. I dropped out and then went to a local community college instead. \n\nI changed my plans a little bit, decided to do generals and receiving an associate's degree there so that I can go to the local university instead because public transportation was very accessible to both the community college and the local university.  While I was going to the community college, I was of course still working at that fast food joint so that I could continue paying rent. I didn't have any other financial support other than student loans, which wasn't enough to pay for my rent, not to mention food, so I had to keep my job to continue to support me. Plus, I needed to have a job if I wanted to continue receiving food stamps. I wish I didn't have to keep my job so that I could fully focus on school, which would have been key to my disability. If I didn't have to work, I could have used that time to focus on my school more, which could have helped me pass a couple of my classes that I ended up failing which caused other issues a little later down the road. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen the semester ended, I registered for my new classes. Things at work weren't going so well, I worked there for a couple of years, never got a raise, I was pulling teeth to get a raise, which was unpromised. I was very loyal to my work but the general manager under-appreciated me, she even screwed me over, she would cut my hours and even illegally removed some over-time I had because she was more concerned about her bonuses than what was rightfully mine. I even have my suspicions that she clocked me out early before by an hour or two, making me unknowingly work for free and off the clock, this woman stole time from me. Eventually, she moved to another state and we got a new general manager, this was the guy I was pulling teeth with to try and get a raise. But, instead, I found another job that almost paid double of what I was making an hour. The job was full time, which did cause some issues for my school schedule, so I decided to do part-time school the time being and just changed my schedule for the upcoming semester.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround that same time, my mother separated from her husband and moved to an apartment. She couldn't financially afford this by herself, so I moved in with her to the new apartment as well as one of my sisters in a two-bedroom apartment. My mom and my sister shared the master bedroom and I had the other room to myself. School started again, which I went to class after work by taking public transportation. On the first day of class, after class, I took the bus home. While I was at the bus stop, this foreign girl that was in my class was also waiting for the same bus. So I started to talk to her. I was a very lonely guy, never really had a longterm relationship before, lol, I was even a virgin at the time. The last relationship I was in before that only lasted about a month, which I had that relationship while I was still in that religion shortly after I got back from that particular trip. So I start talking more to this girl from class. We became friends, but I wanted more than friendship. I really liked her, but she had a boyfriend I come to find out in her home country. We were still hanging out and such and even though I knew she had a boyfriend, I decided to take my chances and asked her to be my girlfriend. She said no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe still wanted to hang out with me and remain friends after that, but I had to explain that I had feelings for her and would have a hard time just staying friends. But even after I explained that we still hung out anyways and stayed friends, at least for a little while. As we hung out more, I got closer to each other, I had a strong feeling that we would soon be a couple. One day we were hanging out at her apartment. I was about to leave, but she wanted me to stay. So I did as she begged. She didn't have a couch or anything to sleep on, so she had me sleep on her bed that night. We didn't have sex or anything. She fell asleep and I couldn't fall asleep. I just laid there and kept my hands to myself, except for one time when she almost fell off the bed why she was sleeping, I pulled her back up so that she wouldn't fall on the floor. But I was wide awake the entire time. I tried to sleep, but just couldn't. This was my first time laying in bed with another girl. The next morning, she woke up. I not sure what happened, but she looks at me and then starts kissing me. I kiss her back, we are then we completely start making out and holding each other, I felt like my dream has come true. After that, she broke up with her boyfriend in her home country to be with me and then we were a couple. \n\nWe finished that semester being together. My schooling went ok. At the end of the semester, my girlfriend and I had moved in together. I think I took the following semester off and didn't take any classes, though I can't remember exactly why. My girlfriend, of course, continued taking classes and I think I just worked. Later on, my job decided to lay off some employees because it was too slow. So I was unemployed, I got laid off towards the end of the semester and the new semester was about to start. Since I was unemployed, I thought it would be good to take classes for the following semester. Unfortunately, since my grades didn't meet standards, I was unable to get student loans, so I would have to pay out of pocket. I decided, since I needed to get a new job anyway, so stick with part-time, and took two evening classes, one of those classes my girlfriend and I had together. I found a new job and was able to work and go to class, but I had to pay rent and the place we were living in was expensive, so I couldn't afford to pay for my classes. Eventually, we moved to a new place that wasn't so expensive. My girlfriend has always begged me to get a car because we were always walking and taking public transportation everywhere and she grew tired of that. After being pressured to get a car for a while, I eventually gave in and got a car. It wasn't easy to get a car, because my credit score wasn't all that great. I couldn't continue school, because my tuition was still unpaid for, I was unable to register for school. So I continued working full time. I found a new and better full-time job and left the one I had for this new job. I worked at this new job for a few years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been with my girlfriend ever since for the most part. But she is abusive, mostly emotionally and verbally but also sometimes physically. I've left her a couple of times, but she promised in the past that she changed and my stupid self would get back with her. But she hasn't changed. She wasn't abusive right away, I don't think signs of her abusiveness didn't actually show up until we were together for at least half a year. She's also got mood swings, where at one point everything seems fine and then out of the blue she just starts yelling at me for who knows what. Sometimes I'm just minding my own business and then she starts arguing with me. When people yell at me, I get really quiet and I don't say anything until it stops. With her, it doesn't really stop, and because I get quiet, I'm not giving her the attention she wants. She hates being ignored and will sometimes start hitting me to get my attention. Sometimes when she pushes me that way and the pressure builds up, I lose it and then I'm furiously screaming at her out of stress, sometimes gesturing aggressiveness even though I'm not hitting her, I'm sometimes throwing something to the other side of the room. Which scares her when I'm acting like that and that makes her angrier and then she may even hit me because of it. Things are out of control, my mind always tries to tell me to calm down and just leave, but for some reason, I can't and I'm still freaking out. Yelling at her and telling her not to hit me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's always calling me lazy, saying I don't do enough. In a way she's right. I haven't done much at all with performing arts or theater at all recently, even though I've been really wanting to. But I think my depression and my anxiety got the better part of me. Not doing what I've been wanting to do, but also struggling with money and financially, I tried getting into entrepreneurship and start my own online business. But that hadn't been easy. I tried selling stuff on Amazon using Fulfillment by Amazon, but I was actually spending more than what I was making and I wasn't selling much even though I advertised, so I ended up having Amazon send me back all my stuff. Later on, I tried again, but this time not with Amazon, I discovered Dropshipping, studied and learned a lot about that and opened my own store on Shopify. I wasn't selling on there either, even after following some strategies I found online and having a Shopify store that was opened for half a year I only made one sale even with advertising, so I gave up. Sometimes it feels like there's someone or something keeping me from being successful. Purposely stopping me from becoming successful and financially secure. But even though I'm sure that's all in my head, it almost feels real, like the big guys, maybe part of Google, Amazon (fyi, I'm not actually blaming companies like Google or Amazon, just a funny idea in my head) or some big corporation or maybe even the Illuminati or something making sure the little guys like me make sure that I stay down and never progress. But again, I'm more convinced that this isn't reality and just my imagination. But it indeed feels like I'm stuck in the low life mediocre life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm currently going through a lot of depression, stuck in this limbo of this strange hell. I don't know what to do. Sometimes I wish I was never born and have never existed at all. My girlfriend yelled at me earlier today, making me feel worthless. She's always talking about business and how great capitalism is and how I need to study more and read more books and all kinds of nonsense. It's so boring when she talks because when she's not yelling at me, that's 99% of her conversation. I'm not even allowed to have other conversations much for the things I'm interested in. Then, of course, she gets mad at me when I show boredom. I don't know what to do anymore. Since I'm unemployed, I've been delivering food using food delivery apps. And then she yells at me telling me I'm not doing enough of that and that I should deliver more so that I can afford rent. I feel lucky that she might be moving back to her home country soon because that would end this relationship by default. I don't understand why it's so hard to leave, especially a toxic and unhealthy relationship. I guess I'm afraid to feel alone because getting into a relationship is a serious and complicated task for me because I don't have the that great social skills, I'm actually very awkward to be around with, which is the reason why I even have a hard time making friends. I'm the kind of person that doesn't know what to say or how to say the things that I want to say. I'm also not all the attractive, nor in good shape and not all that healthy, so getting into another relationship almost feels impossible. But this one is toxic, so I understand that I really need to get out of this one.\n\nAs far as finding a new job, that hasn't been easy. I'm not all that great at interviews, which I think is normal for most and I know I can land a job because I've done it before. But at the same time, I'm tired of working  9 to 5 jobs, just barely making enough on slave wage. Which is the reason I tried starting a couple of business, I'm just tired of this. I hate having to work to live and that I have live to work, what is that all about. I feel like life should be so much more than just work, eat, sleep, repeat and it's causing me to be more and more depressed. I can't handle it anymore. I don't want to live like this, I hate this. I've tried so hard and I kept trying again and again and again. Always trying to find ways to find new strategies and try again but then keep watching myself fail over and over and over again that my hope that I use to have so much is hanging on by a thread. I'm only 30, but my health isn't all the great and I feel like I might die by heart attack anytime soon, which scares me, but at the same time, I'd rather be dead. I think I'm starting to become suicidal because I don't know what to do anymore. I need help, but I can't afford help. I'm in serious debt and lately, I've been getting lawsuit after lawsuit from creditors from unpaid debt from years ago because I couldn't afford to pay for this or that, which is just adding more and more on my shoulders. I don't know what to do anymore. I stay up late watching Youtube and playing video games until late to get away from the world and then sleep past noon. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as good things that are happening, I'm seeing a talent agent next week because I really want to pursue theater and performing arts and thought I should really do something about it, but at the same time, I'm filled with anxiety. Because of my personality, because of my lack of social skills, I have this anxiety that I will be turned down. So I'm really hanging on to that hope that's hanging on by a thread, hoping that this will work out, that I will pursue my dreams. But overall, I really need help in life and I just don't know where to turn.\n\nIf you've gotten this far, I really want to thank you for sticking with my story this far. I know that was a lot. I'm really hoping somebody, anybody will really analyze everything I have written. Someone that can really look into this and provide me with the help I need as far as my mental health goes at the least. There's so much more in my story that I haven't mention, something much more severe that I went through not to long ago, perhaps that'll be another post for another time because that was a very scary time of my life. But I hope that I can find what I need here in this subreddit.",

It breaks my heart and frightens me when she gets into one of diatribes about all the wrongs she's experienced in her life and it was a hard life bringing up two kids as a single parent. Parts of the diatribes border on paranoia and it's why I feel like it's time for professional help rather than \"letting off steam\" as she claims. She's utterly convinced her elderly mother has looked down on her for a lifetime. And even into her 90's, is taking the effort make sure my mom feels awful about her life. It pains me to see my mom berate my grandmother. I have told my mother that even if it's all true, what do you want your 90 something year old mother to do at this point? Her time is very limited--let it go and work on yourself...\n\nThe problem is she is adamantly against any suggestion of therapy--having the notion that it's for \"crazy\" people.  According to her reasoning, she's not crazy just badly treated and bullied all her life. I try to couch therapy as a just a good chat to an understanding and sympathetic ear. Any experiences and tips to share on how I can steer her towards considering therapy? I know I can't make her go, but I can't just stand by either. I'm afraid that if she continues down this path unabated, I'm going to lose her into a void of angry paranoia.\n\nAside from the cultural antipathy towards mental/emotional health, there is of course the issue of finding therapy in her language and social zone. She's in Los Angeles and speaks Cantonese.  I listen and try to offer some help as I went through therapy on my own relationship with my mother.  Unfortunately, my Cantonese is limited and often I cannot express the nuance needed for this extremely delicate matter.\n\nAny advice shared is appreciated.",

        "original": "I\u2019m new to reddit and am not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this, so apologies if this isn\u2019t the place for this. \n\nI recently got together with a group of friends from high school and, over drinks, the old days were the primary topic of discussion. I\u2019m not sure if these guys have superhuman memories or if mine may be deficient. So many vividly recalled stories, many of which I had no recollection of(many of the stories involved me or were about something we\u2019d done when we were young and wild). People were mentioned that I had no memory of. \nIt\u2019s not like I have no memories from that time, and there were lots of things that I did remember once they were mentioned. But it\u2019s fair to say that I remembered much less than anyone else. \nOne story in particular involved me stepping in to defend someone who was being bullied and standing up to an older, bigger kid after football practice and as the situation escalated I had to be restrained from getting into a fight. \nMy friend is like, you don\u2019t remember that??\nI don\u2019t. \nSeems like something that a person would remember right?\n\nI\u2019m now 40 years old and am a former college football player. I was never knocked unconscious while playing, but have learned in recent years that you don\u2019t always lose consciousness when you are concussed. I played linebacker and there were many times when I\u2019ve \u201chad my bell rung\u201d and have seen spots in my vision etc. My dad, who is now 71, played linebacker in the NFL for years and in the past year has been diagnosed with dementia and it\u2019s likely that he has CTE. (He\u2019s being evaluated by the NFL doctors and is part of the class-action suit against the NFL.)\nObviously this has heightened my awareness of memory lately. \n\nI\u2019m not a person who spends a lot of time in the past, and I know that high school for many people is the best time of their life(not me. Not that it was bad.it was fine)and for this reason many of their best and most vivid memories are from this period. My friend with the most stories has a nearly photographic memory of those days, but I\u2019m also pretty sure he\u2019d say that was the best time of his life.  Meanwhile, I don\u2019t really even remember my teachers from school save for a few(I would recognize them if I saw them) but I\u2019m awful with names. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone can relate to this(how can you not remember that??)\n \nThanks for reading",

        "original": "I am following a spiritual path as I have always been unhappy and was/am a binge eater and had various substance abuse problems.\n\nI believe my father was emotionally unavailable and my mother was quite submissive, holding the peace in the family.\n\nFrom my home life I developed a lot of worthlessness, self esteem issues etc (my dad basically passed these on).\n\nAnyway...\n\nI recently started really going into my self and trying to find out just what was making me tick, what am I, and the nature of my being.\n\nI began finding out a lot. Negative traits here and there and also experienced a lot of blissful feelings, oneness and peace (for the first time ever).\n\nWith the work I've been doing I went straight to an event I know has been lurking in my mind for a long time.\n\nThe event was my first 'sexual' experience with my brother at around age 11-12. We would touch and jerk each others penises a bit, mostly with boxers on. Poke each other in the bum with boxers on and he also gave me oral sex with my boxers on.\n\nMy brother was 2 years older than me and this was entirely consensual from both sides.\n\nThe sexual bit was in apostrophes as it didn't really feel arousing. Overall it just felt like exploration and curiosity.\n\nLol so anyway that was an event that always lurked around and resurfaced from time to time but I thought I had already dealt with it.\n\nGoing even deeper into my self I found something worse which I had never really brought into my awareness before other than just kind of thinking of it as curiosity.\n\nAround the same time or a year after, I was playing with my cousins (all were younger than me) as we normally would. For some reason I touched my cousin's clothed backside and sort of grabbed it.\n\nI don't know why I did this. It seemed to come out of nowhere. I believe it was just curiosity. I never really thought about it again or did anything like it again.\n\n20 years on this all resurfaces.\n\nI don't want to make myself out like a victim but I have been going through pure hell working through all of this. So many layers of emotions coming and going. Suicidal thoughts have been pondering but I don't think I would actually act. I feel as though I do have hope as a human being. Albeit this is difficult to accept.\n\nI am finally beginning to accept what I did but I just don't know where I stand.\n\nI have only ever been attracted to females of a similar age to myself.\n\nDo I tell my family? I don't think this is a good idea. It will cause unnecessary pain and confusion. Surely?\n\nI don't think this has affected my cousin's life but still I abused my position of power essentially.\n\nLooking at this from a shadow perspective; I have always done certain things that showed a complete lack of care for other people, albeit nothing like this, however things such as keeping quiet occasionally when things are to be paid for as a group, eating more than my fair share when sharing meals with people, completely ignoring people I go out with to talk to some stranger, pulling my good friend off a swing so he landed on his face. These might sound pale in comparison but there have been many more events like this.\n\nIf anyone can just give me their opinion it would really help. I am in complete turmoil. Dreams of drowning. Constant headaches. I am reaching out to therapists, forums just to have this out in the open. How do I actually integrate this experience into my character and move forward as a 'whole' person? It seems somewhat unforgivable. There must have been some form of attraction for me to grab my cousin's backside but really I see it as curiosity, and the shadow acting out. This has been deeply repressed and never faced seriously. I was working on my self so much, in an effort to help others in the future but now it feels as though there is no coming back. How can I help others if I can't be honest with myself and others? Ie, it feels as though I would need to explain this to people that want to know me well in the future.\n\nSeems very tricky but I know it is still early days. I have been crying a lot and my body is in constant pain. Either way I am wanting to face this head on and figure everything out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease help.",

I won't get into the reasons why I think that, but my mom (recently divorced from my father) and I have identified so many possible symptoms of Asperger's or OCD. I love my dad, and he does so much for my brother and I. \n\nThe main problem is just that our relationship with him is so confrontational. There are a lot of good moments but almost daily there will be a huge argument or behaviour that is simply inappropriate. It hurts him more than it hurts me, because most of the time I'm able to maintain my composure and see most of what he is saying as irrational. I don't mean to sound so self-righteous, it's possible that I could be entirely wrong. Not only this, but my dad is extremely isolated and my brother and I are all he has. We will be moving out soon and then he will be totally alone. He has let almost every relationship in his life get away from him, or he has destroyed them by being so harsh and opinionated. I would really like him to see a therapist just to talk about all the emotions he has and how much he keeps inside due to being so socially isolated. \n\nI think I could get him to see a therapist if I told him I was simply concerned that he was sad and anxious and upset and it would mean a lot to me. But should I bring up some of the behaviours he engages in that I don't see as \"neurotypical\"? Of course I have no idea if he actually has a social disorder or mental illness so I would never say that to him.

He ended up showing up at her house on Christmas and was talking in circles, didn't know what day it was etc. He recently lost his job after repeatedly blowing up on his coworkers. Now he is fixated on suing them. He never filed any FMLA paperwork even though we all urged him to do it because we saw this coming.\n\nThe last few days he has been posting all kinds of weird stuff on Facebook/Snap/Instagram, documenting every mundane thing that he does all day. His house is trashed and he just seems really unwell. He won't really listen to anyone in the family when we try to get him back on track. He is seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist but I question if he is even taking his meds at this point. I'm getting worried that he is going to snap and wind up in jail. Any advice is appreciated.",

Even though I know my parents likely feel more upset than I do , I just want to feel loved by someone or something and I feel like that's the main reason I get so upset because at the moment I feel like no one genuinely cares for me because they actually care about me if you get what I mean.  I have never been in a relationship and I just generally feel so out of league with anyone I've had an attraction towards in the past as I feel like if I see an attractive guy that they must instantly be looking at me and thinking \"Christ you're ugly\" because decent looking guys don't go for fat/chubby, ugly girls-i have a huge fear that I am never going to experience how it feels to be involved in a loving, accepting relationship as all I feel I have felt up to this point is that other people always want more from me than I can give them. I also have a lot of painful memories from my time at college (I left in autumn 2017 as i couldn't cope with the pressure anymore and the implications it was taking on my mental health) , which mainly stemmed from just a general sense of inadequacy or competition between the other students in my group, particularly the other female students. In a way, I would love to lose all my memories from say 2011 onwards, give or take a few positive memories from concerts ive been to, because then I wouldn't have to keep revisiting then and hence making myself feel even more depressed. In terms of suicide , my parents constantly tell me that I am incapable of going about the inventory required to even attempt to take my own life. One side of my brain is telling me to prove them wrong by attempting to choke/strangle myself , but then the other side of my brain is trying to stay rational and telling me that I can't go yet because even though there's a high chance that everyone hates me , that if I kill myself now I won't ever get to see what I may achieve in the future.

        "original": "Before the story, I just want to state out some facts. \n1. Me and my friend has been friends for 10 years already. Since we're in early high school. \n2. I know about my friends depression because he told me that he had one. He has his meds as well. \n3. He also have Insomnia and he got meds for that as well. \n4. He once called me when I was at work, saying that he wants to kill someone, later kill himself because that certain someone made him pissed off. I cried instantly, begging him to not do that. He managed to  resolved that peacefully with that guy. Though with some damage to ahis neighbour's property. \n\n\nOk so the story goes like this. I have a friend that is depressed. And easily get angry as well. So the story goes like this :\n\n(Me and my friend loves to play video games together)\nLast Thursday, my friend was expecting me to come over to his house and play some games and just hangout. But on that day, I got up pretty late as the day before I went to sleep at 6 in the morning. I woke up at a bit earlier before 2pm. He asked me what time I'll be coming at 1.45pm (I just woke up at this time) and I said to him that I'm still sleepy. And then after that he got a bit sad that I didn't come to his house on that day because I woke up later and he saw me playing game with another friend of mine on the night before, without inviting him to play together. I know he knows that I'm playing game without him because he could saw me online, and I didn't invite him. \n\nThe next day, I asked him through whatsapp to come over to discord and have a chat(I'm sure everyone knows what this is), And he answered this : \n\"I've been in a bad mood since yesterday, it's best if you don't talk to me for a while\" \nSo I replied \"ok bro\" and did not message him anymore on that day. I thought that he is having a problem at home so I think its best for me to leave him alone. \n\nMoving forward to the next day (today), I greeted him and said \"Good evening sir\" \"Just checking up on you\". I didn't get a reply until it was 1.56 am, and he said why I used 'sir'. And he said that am I looking for a fight?  I said no, \"I'm not, boss\". I'm pretty sure that he snaps at that time, but he didn't say anything. I said I'm sorry if I have made him mad or anything. But he didn't reply afterwards. So I thought that everything was alright, and he didn't reply anything after that. \n\nThen my friend had snapped on me through whatsapp, where he messaged me at 4 in the morning, telling me that\n\"Not only are you stupid, insensitive, but you're fucking dense as fuck as well. No wonder your gf is often mad at you.\"\n(note that my gf and me always gets mad at me because I wake up late for quite some time). \"Please kill yourself\" is what he said to me later. Then I immediately apologise to him, and I said I don't want to get into a fight with him. I asked him, what I did wrong again. I asked him was it because I did not come to his house on last Thursday? He said partially. Then he said that me and his other friends are the same, saying everyone has forgotten him. I asked him again, what did I do wrong, because I don't know and I didn't want to Repeat doing it in the future. He said to me that to remember it myself. I really didn't know what I did wrong to him at that time. Later he said \"Do me a favour and cut yourself or something\" and I replied I don't want to. \n\nThen we got into quite an intense fight in the chat. He said that thanks to me and his other 'friends' that he got a headache till he cannot sleep. Then he said that I'm insensitive because I didn't think of his feelings on the day that I should go to his house because he was kinda excited for having me, but I didn't come to his house. He kept calling me insensitive a lot in his message.\n\nHe also got mad at me because when I play game, I did not invite him anymore. It's not like I don't want to invite him, but when he plays the game, even in a fun game mode, he gets super serious and when the game is not in our favor, he kept getting mad and it made the game not fun anymore with his rage. His rage made me felt very uncomfortable. \n\nFast forward a few arguments later, I apologize to him, saying that I'm very sorry for what I did wrong, for all of my mistakes. But he relied with \"Go kill yourself\". I didn't know what I to reply, so I unconsciously typed \"Hm..\" and he said that \"what's that hm for you fkin insensitive piece of shit. This is a text chat, not a fkin role play chat\"\n\"Seriously, fucking die\"\n\nThat was the last of his message to me, at 5.10 am.\n\n\nSo that's the story. And I would really know on what to do, how should I reply to him, should I give him some time alone, or anything?\nI really love him as a friend and I don't want our friendship to end just like this. I don't ever want to lose him like this. He's my precious friend and I would really love to help him.",

An unsettled story.\n\nHe says,he will never forget the day his own sister called the NGO on his father.  His own sister had to take help from unknown women because she couldn't trust her own family. Killing her every min of every hour and every day. Seems frevilous to me. But he will forget all the time his own sister was being tortured mentally physically emotionally while being a vitness he turned his head the other side so he could sit in the evenings with his parents to gossip and raise questions on his own sisters character or conduct. Family comes first isn't it. Ofcourse he also chooses to forget the day he beat his sister at the age of 24 because she challenged him to the extent that she had to get stiches. Pulling her by the hair and kicking with his feet and banging her head against the wall. But ofcourse family comes first. Saying i deserved it. And he wouldnt apologize. That seemed pretty forgettable as well. He says i caused stress and discomfort on the entire family. Nothing has been the same ever since. He tries to get information from me on the day of the incident about the people involved and who were those people but not on why i did what i did.

Where he looks for reasons to hit her slaps her across her face. Anything from tying her hair to calling Eco instead of economics. Who really needs a reason anyway, right? You molest her but she is a slut and sadly she hasnt even had her first kiss. She comes home late from work and gets abused like she were being r**** mentally. The impact it leaves you is for life and will never be erased. While you are being abused because his day wouldn't end without it you just listen to him belittle you by calling you a whore and worse. No matter how hard you tried. Abuses you wouldn't give your worst enemy. Crying to sleep for months at a stretch with swollen eyes and soaked pillows making sure no one heard or youd be yelled for that too. Being to happy and joviel was a crime. Often shut down by words like don't act so smart. Staying a little longer each day at the bus stop to spend equally less time home. Sit in a park hopelessly so the yelling and abusing would reduce by a few more minutes. And this isnt even the worst of it. \n\nI have caused a lot of harm to these people by wanting to live my life. I have caused stress. \nHe said dont meet those people you called the day you moved out. those people are a bad influence. Funnily i hadn't spoken to P*****i in ages and she still showed up. S**d is a father i never had. Gave me hope and support no one else ever would. Like i was his own daughter. Literally the person who gave me a purpose and made me feel loved and special. Who looked after me and dealt with the worst of me. These people are a bad influence on me. That i was worth it. That i was special. Sh**** my friend for life and my biggest support.

My parents didn't like what Ritalin did to him, so they stopped giving it to him after 1 week. So growing up he did not take any medication. He has struggled in school, at home and work and with his weight. I believe he has an undiagnosed condition, but I don't know what type of doctor to go to for a diagnosis. \nHe is morbidly obese.  He is under 5\u20198\u201d and well over 320 pounds.  He is a compulsive eater, and will eat combinations of food other people simply wouldn\u2019t think of, such as spaghetti with mayonnaise (an entire large jar of mayonnaise at that) or just plain hot dog buns.  All of this has led to a number of serious health problems, including sudden onset diabetes, which he was diagnosed with in December 2018, and severe sleep apnea.  These very serious health issues, which are dangerous and scary by themselves, are made much worse by his behavioral issues.  In fact, his diabetes diagnosis was only arrived at because there was a perfect storm of his poor health and behavioral problems.\nHe refuses to wear pants and prefers the cold, so during the winter he will go and sit on the porch in shorts and a tee shirt and watch videos on his phone regardless of the temperature.  He simply does not seem to feel the cold, and if he does he simply does not care.  This leads to dry skin (in addition to a chronic cough). When he gets dry skin, he picks at it compulsively which means his legs are always scabbed or bruised.  It seems like he can't tell when he has pain.  Last December, he picked at his leg and ultimately wound up with an infection.  He didn\u2019t tell anyone about the infection until the skin was literally bubbling and oozing.  By the time he brought it to my attention (he hid it from our mom) he had a bubble the size of a golf ball by his ankle and was oozing puss to the point where there was a trail where he walked.  My sister and I insisted he go to the hospital, and when we got there he was immediately admitted (he stayed in a hospital bed for 10 days). \nWhile at the hospital they asked him his pain level on a scale of 1-10.  He calmly said it was a 2.  The Doctors did not believe that (so much so that they gave him Fentanyl).  After they administered the antibiotics via IV they ran blood work and diagnosed him with diabetes and informed him he was lucky to have his leg. \nShortly after getting out of the hospital, he got an infection in his eye (cellulitis) and, after seeing an opthamologist  we were told to go straight to the ER.  He was then transferred to two different hospitals (via ambulance) because each hospital was so worried there would need to be an emergency surgery that could perhaps involve removing his eye. Once again when he was asked about his pain level he said it was a 2, and once again the doctor said he should've been in a lot more pain and administered Fetanyl. Ultimately he recovered, though the extent of the damage to his eye is still unknown.\nBoth times he told people that his leg or eye had looked the way it did for only a couple of days, which was impossible. His leg had been untreated for a month before anyone in the family was aware of it and rushed him to the hospital and his eye had been untreated for a week before we noticed it and rushed him to the hospital. After both of the incidents we decided to start going to his doctor appointments with him. At his appointments he said he was fine, nothing bothered him and answered questions with one word answers (the same way he responds to us). \nHis health problems continue, and we once again had to take him to the hospital because of an open wound on his leg (roughly one year after he was first rushed to the ER with bubbling/oozing wounds).  They are simply made worse by his attitude/behavioral issues.  He lies to doctors, his family, and himself about his health. He is very stubborn and will do things out of spite. You can show him proof that he is wrong and he will simply deny it without offering any counterpoint. He will be sick and refuse to go to the doctor; if you ask him to do a chore he will leave and come back late at night so he doesn't have to do it; if you give him a date by which he needs to have a chore completed he will wait until an 11 PM of that date to start doing it (if he even does it all). If you talk to him about something he doesn't like (chores, doctors, weight, health, his eating, etc.) he will just ignore you and doesn't respond to you. When he is not working (he works as a cashier and is on his feet most of the day - despite doctor's orders that he limit the time spent on his feet until he loses weight) he just sits and watches tv (which, admittedly, he has done his whole life).\nHe also struggles socially.  While he is a very sweet and generous person he has struggled to find his place, and simply retreats into himself.  He goes to the movies by himself a few days a week. At any given time he has seen almost every movie in the theater (some of them twice). He has never had a girlfriend and has never had many friends. \nAdditionally, he has \u201cquirks\u201d that may be indicative of something more serious. He has motor and vocal tics - blinks his eyes multiple times, twitches/shakes his head/neck, jerks his mouth/lips, and makes a spitting/hissing noise with his tongue against his teeth.  In addition to his compulsive eating, he seems to have other compulsions such as picking his skin until he bleeds, washing his hands with scalding hot water, checking and rechecking things (like closing doors), touching things.  If his clothes are in the dryer and you move them, he will wash them again. He also hoards and keeps things that most people would get rid of immediately.  He doesn't clean his room or car and refuses to allow anyone to. \nHe also falls asleep when he is driving (he has been in many car accidents because of this). When he is not driving, he falls asleep every car ride within minutes. When he was left in charge of taking care of my parents cars that are in the garage, he would have to start them every few days so that the battery wouldn't die. He would start the cars in the closed garage and leave them running for a couple of hours nearly killing himself and me. When he was told he could not do that he got upset and just ignored me. The next time he did it he cracked the garage door, but did not realize it wasn\u2019t opened above the exhaust pipe, and once again filled the garage and house with exhaust. I told him he could not do that, he had to open the garage fully and/ or take them out of the garage. He still refuses and I have to go out there and open the garage door. He has left the air compressor running all day nearly blowing up the house.  He refuses to help out around the house or follow any of the rules set for him (clean his room/bathroom). \nHe has run up $20,000 credit card debt, 95% of it on food. He has no savings or any money. He lives pay-check to pay-check and everything else my mom takes care of. He lives with my mom. I do not believe he will ever be able to live on his own. We have tried antidepressants and nothing changed. Not too long ago I asked him about his future and he said he was going to get married and have kids one day. He is 38 and has never had a girlfriend or done anything that would lead to him one day getting married or having kids.  \nObviously, there are a lot of issues/problems.  I love my brother and want him to live the best life he possibly can, but when I look at everything that is going on and everything that has happened, I know that he will not be able to until he receives the proper care, which begins with a proper diagnosis. He does not think he has a problem, and would be heartbroken if he knew how apparent it is to those around him that he needs help.  Because he is 38 years old I am not able to direct his medical care.  I want to help my brother before it is too late, and know that he needs medical assistance but am unable to direct his medical care.  I am wondering what the proper approach is/where I can go from here.",

        "original": "I\u2019m sorry that this is long. TL;DR is the title.\n\nMy mom and my sister (5 years older, I\u2019ll call her S) have a long list of mental illnesses. My mom has mostly recovered and my sister is getting better but around 2014-2016 when I was 11-13, things were REALLY bad. Without going into to much details, my parents filled for divorce and some other things happened which broke my mom. She attempted suicide. She ended up in the hospital for two weeks and was diagnosed with a stack of mental illnesses and was put on meds. She came home and S and I basically took care of her but S wasn\u2019t doing well and was getting skinnier and skinnier. My mom was cutting a lot, I walked in on her a few times and she didn\u2019t even notice me. So much blood was dripping from her arm, so damn much blood. What is an 11 year old supposed to do when he sees this? I had no clue what to do so I ignored it. \n\nMy sister was doing worse and worse and was eventually diagnosed with an eating disorder as well as a couple other things and put in a hospital. Of course this didn\u2019t help my mom\u2019s situation and the cutting got so much worse and she was sleeping all day because of her meds. After my sister got out of the hospital, she tried to commit suicide a few times. For quite a while there was daily screaming matches between S and my mom. One would start to get upset about something then the other would get upset because the first person was upset and it would just keep escalating, all while I sat there and pretended it wasn\u2019t happening. I\u2019d see fresh bandages on my mom\u2019s arm and ignore it, I\u2019d hear my mom or my sister crying in her room and ignore it, I\u2019d see my sister secretly working out and ignore it. I though that bringing attention to it would make them upset so I didn\u2019t. They forgot my birthday that year.\n\nAt this point, I, a 12 year old, was now taking care of my mother, my older sister and myself. I made all of my own food, cleaned up the house, got myself to and from school, and made sure my mom and my sister were both breathing when I came home. I took care of them but at the same time I ignored what was happening to them and I ignored how I felt. I thought that I couldn\u2019t cause any problems or voice how I felt because I was worried that if I wasn\u2019t okay then everything would fall apart so I became the rock, the person that they didn\u2019t have to worry about. I was so focused on making sure that I ignored how I felt that I stopped feeling anything. After a few years, they\u2019ve both slowly gotten better but I\u2019m stuck. You could ask me how I\u2019m feeling right now and I wouldn\u2019t know the answer, let alone how to express it. I\u2019m numb except for the occasional time I\u2019m angry. Other than that I feel nothing. I\u2019m empty. \n\nI\u2019m probably missing a lot of events and stuff because don\u2019t remember much from the past few years but some times the stuff I do remember gets stuck in my head. I still don\u2019t like to go out with friends and I don\u2019t even have real friends because I still put on that facade but I try have friends because I feel like I have to be okay and people that are okay have friends. I just stay in my room while my family hangs out with my mom\u2019s boyfriend and his daughter. I don\u2019t care about school because I feel like I won\u2019t even make it to university but I still try to do school work because my mom yells at me and gets really upset and calls me lazy if I don\u2019t. \n\nEveryday I think about how much better everything would be if I was dead but I feel like a coward because I haven\u2019t done it yet. There are two reasons I haven\u2019t killed my self yet: \n1. Attempting suicide is something my mom and S would do and I want to be nothing like them. \n2. Slitting your wrists and taking pills have too high of failure rates, there are no tall buildings around me and I don\u2019t have access to a gun. \n\nThose are starting to feel like they\u2019re not good enough reasons to keep living. I know I\u2019m depressed but I hate admitting it because of what my mom and S being depressed did to me. I\u2019m just so done with every thing and I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing this.",

I feel like I deserve this, I deserve to suffer but I'm not sure how much longer I can hang on. I'm in massive debt with no way out. My job is stressful and I fear that I'll be let go soon but the debt keeps piling up. I don't know what to do if I lose my job. I'm alone and feel exhausted waking up to the same shit everyday. I can't even look at myself in the mirror and when I catch a glance, I feel nothing but disgust. I tried killing myself with a bottle of pills a year ago but it didn't work. I have access to a gun. I've never shot one before but I'm not confident that I can slit my wrist deep enough to do the job. I'm scared and just want to feel better but nothing changes no matter what\u00a0I do.

I'm desperately hoping a miracle will happen, something that gives me the courage to keep going. But this emptiness keeps getting heavier every day.

After my grandmother passed away on my father's arms, he started drinking a lot, which developed his liver cancer even more, which also resulted in my mother drinking a lot too.\n\nThey argued every night, making me unable to sleep. I started sleeping in class, and after my grades dropped, my friends started to bully me. My parents did nothing to help me, instead they started to hit me, choke me and crush my genitals because \"i was not their son anymore\" and \"it was what i deserved\". They would also call the police if i resisted, saying that I was harming them. They did many other things, but it would be better if i don\u00b4t disclose all the details.\n\nI don't live with them anymore, but because of all that happened, I have severe depression, constant nightmares and panic attacks. These nightmares caused me to miss a lot of days in school and pre-college preparatory classes because of my lack of sleep, which resulted in me failing to get in college multiple times.

        "original": "I've really messed up my life recently.\n\nI'm sorry this is so long. \n\nEarlier this year, I got kicked out of my home. It was actually my friend's birthday. A week before that, my mom and I got into an argument and it ended with her telling me how much she hates me and everyone hates me and no one will ever love me. I've been waiting for her confession for a long time, as I've felt that she hasn't liked me for a long time. After that incident, I started kinda just doing whatever I wanted. I thought to myself, \"if she hates me, then I'll do whatever I feel like doing now. She can't hate me any more then she already does.\" So a week later my friend invited me to go ice skating with her and our other friends. Afterwards we all decided to go to a friend's house to hang out for a while longer. I tried to call her to let her know but she didn't answer. Later at our friends house, my mom texts me that I better find somewhere to stay because \"I'm not coming home\". I was 13 at the time. My friend who's birthday it was said I could stay with them, so I told my mom that. And she told me to come home or she would call the cops and file a missing persons report. I then went home and as soon as my friend pulled away, my mom starts yelling at me and trying to hit me so I hold her back (she's pretty small so it was easy). I  decided I'm gonna call the cops and she tries to take the phone out of my hand and then my nana comes in and sides with my mom. So now there both trying to get the phone out from my hand. They get it and then my mom decides she's gonna call the cops. The cops show up and talk to me and everyone else there, and then one of the officers ask if there's anything they can do so I ask to go my friend's house and she tells me she can't do that without my mom's permission. My mom agrees to let me stay for the night. Later that week, I stay at my friend's for the weekend and then stay home for the next. After that I officially moved in with my friend. This happened March 14th.\n\nWe end up dating for a month while I'm there. This was something I was waiting for for a long time because I've always liked her. When we started dating I started to become toxic. Always trying to convince her to stay when she would want to leave, asking about who's she's talking to and what about, pretty much monitoring everything. And at some points, I would do everything I could to make her stay, even if that ended with her crying. God, I feel terrible just thinking about it. I never realized I was the way I was until recently, when it's too late to change anything. Eventually we break up. And things fluctuated between bad and good. I kept thinking I could fix us and we could get back together. I only got worse.\n\nOn Friday, December 13th, we got in an argument as soon as we got home. She wanted to leave because her cousin said she needed her. I threw a hissy fit at the idea and we argued. It got to the point where I ended up putting my hands on her. I held her in her room so she wouldn't leave. Wedged myself in front of the door. She would try to yell and I would put my hand over her mouth. Not that this excuses it, but I was just scared of someone hearing because I didn't want to get kicked out. I've already been warned a few times about my behavior, so every time we argued I would get scared that if someone heard, I would be kicked out. Anyways, things got physical. There wasn't any punching, but still physical. She eventually left, and later her mom contacted mine and my mom came and picked me up. I've been living with my mom since. I'm back at square fucking one. I went to live with my friend to escape my mom, and know I'm back here.\n\nMy friend doesn't want to talk to me at all anymore, and I'm not welcomed at her home anymore. She's blocked me on everything. She wouldn't talk to me at school either. I didn't realize it before, but I more then just loved her. I was in love with her. If that makes sense. And now she doesn't want anything to do with me. She said she just wants to be strangers again. We took a dog in from the streets together, and he doesn't know I'm not coming back. He's 13 and has heart problems. I told him I would be there with him for everything, including his death because I feel like he could die any day now. Now I'm never going to see him again. And I've fucked things with a girl I loved so much. I have no friends. The only family I have left is my mom and she hasn't changed at all. I don't want to be like my mom. I feel like everything is a dream, and I just want to wake up. And that when I will, it will be that Friday morning. And I'm gonna start fixing myself from that day on. I don't want to lose her. I feel like if I kill myself, I'll wake up that Friday morning. I plan on writing my suicide notes tonight. I fucked up things because I was scared she would leave for good. And know I've made her leave.\n\nI already know how I'm going to kill myself. I plan to plunge a knife through my heart. I've fucked up so bad. I have no one left. God, I miss my dog.

        "original": "It's finally hit me. The realization that life is just a vast, empty landscape and my baseline mood will always be \"crappy\" no matter what happens. My friend invited me to a small New Years get-together at a friend of hers' house and they kept playing card games I didn't know how to play and I kept losing and everyone kept talking about shows and movies and stuff I don't know anything about. And I spilled this drink all over myself because I tugged on the bottle cap too hard and god this all sounds so trivial when I'm typing it out but just the whole time I couldn't bring myself to just let it go and try to have a good time. I feel like years of not having siblings and not having friends have set me so far back in terms of social skills and being exposed to games, shows, and movies most people generally know and like, and no matter what I do I can never recover from this. Even when I go to college next year, and I have a fresh start and everything, I can't help the fact that I lack years of experience in socialization and being down to earth and relatable to other people, and that's gonna put me at a massive disadvantage when I'm trying to befriend people. And of course, my father had to come get me at 10:00, before the whole countdown, because of course I'm the only 17 year old on this side of suburbia whose parents can't stand the thought of their kids being out of the house after midnight, even on New Year's Eve. And that's where everything just went downhill, because I feel like for my entire life I've always consoled myself with the idea that when I finally get out of my parent's house, and I'm at college where no one knows me, I'll somehow be able to magically revamp myself, make some new friends, and finally live the life that I want to live. But that's not true. I'm probably going to have to go to my state's college purely for financial reasons, which is where over 70% of my school's seniors go, so it's not even truly going to be the fresh start that I've always imagined. Plus, even though I'll be 18 and an adult, if I decide to go out for New Year's again next year, I'm still going to be right back where I am, at my parent's house, and my dad will still come get me at 10:00 no matter what. I can't keep going on like this, just feeling shitty all the time, and keeping myself together by just telling myself that it'll all get better once I'm an adult and I have some ounce of freedom, because the truth is, it won't!! It will not!! If it's not going to get better in college, when will it??? When I'm eventually slaving away at a 9-5, 5 days a week for a good 40 years of my life?? I've been banking on the idea that depression is a result of one's circumstances for literally so long, but as I grow up and more parts of my life change, and I still feel insecure, inadequate, and awful about myself, I'm doubting it more and more. Maybe it really is just an innate thing that will follow me to my goddamn grave, and no amount of lifestyle changes will ever make it go away. If so, I guess I'll just fuck off then. \"Happy\" New Years indeed.",

        "original": "All right, I don't have anyone to talk to so I'm going to write it all down here so I can vent:\n\nTo get some things out of the way, I am an 18 year old freshman in college that is majoring in digital art. I have social anxiety and clinical depression and some eating disorder stuff (my family is unaware of this) but my family doesn't know how bad it is and how much worse it's getting. I am on meds but as the days go by, they seem to work less and less. My first semester of college was actually pretty okay and I was generally happy, but now that I'm on winter break I feel like I've reverted back to the days where I wasn't on meds, wasnt diagnosed, was in the worst shape- mentally- possible. Being at home has been great to see my family, but it made me realize and question a lot of things. First, it made me realize how little friends i really have. My friends from high school don't really talk to me anymore (after I went to college I realized they weren't the best people to hang around either). It's not like they were bad influences or anything- a lot of them were just mean-spirited people. They are motivated to do well and a majority of them are in honors programs, but they were never really nice to me, so thats lovely. But, I do keep in touch with one of them pretty often because she is one of the nicest people I have met and I love her to death! I went to an all girls middle and high school (that lasted 7 ungodly years) and since I've made it clear Im not exactly a social butterfly, I didn't have too many guy friends- except one but we will get to that later. So I was around these girls for so long I got used to being treated kind of shittily. So they don't really talk to me that much anymore. So back to my one guy friend. To make a long ass story short, a guy I was really good friends with low-key assaulted me and I only just came to terms with what he did. At the time, i just thought I seemed like I was okay with it, but now I really didn't do anything to make that even come across a little. He didn't rape me- thank god, but he still violated me and now I don't want to hang out with him because I just get nervous around him even though he profusely apologized and realized he was wrong. But, of course, I just made plans to hang out with him because I want to trust him again so bad. In college it's better. I do not have a solid group of friends which is hard for me- I have friends from all different groups of friends. My roommate is lovely and we get along really well and she is one of my best friends. But, she has a solid group of friends that come to our dorm all the time and thats fine, but it makes me feel really shitty. She can have friends I get it, but its more just that I feel like they think Im a total loser and idiot. Now am I those two things? At this point im not quite sure, but here we are. They go out a lot and drink a shit ton and smoke a ton and thats fine, but thats not what I have a problem with. When my roommate told them I dont go out a lot, they immediately shut me out. My roommate defended me telling them i was nice and lovely, but I guess i didn't make the cut. I do have two very close friends that are so great and I love them a lot which is good! \n\nNow heres the thing, I am 5'4, average weight, blonde hair blue eyed girl with a decent face. I may not have the highest self confidence, but I can realize I am not hideous and somewhat okay looking. Do I feel like anyone has ever found me attractive- no, but that is a contradiction for another time. Well, my roommate is drop dead gorgeous and the type of beautiful that is conventional beauty. I swear the girl could walk into a victorias secret and get hired as a model right on the spot. She got a boyfriend within the first few months, that is again- one of the most gorgeous people I have ever seen. And he comes over, every night to the dorm. Do I mind that he comes over a lot- not really, hes actually a really funny and nice guy. But do I feel really invalid and worthless around the two of them- oh hell yes I do. In case you didn't guess yet, I havent really had a boyfriend before, so thats also a real confidence booster. I've had little flings here and there, but nothing actually. And everyone from my high school is gorgeous- its actually a joke within the schools is my area. Every girl is no more that 115 llbs, has perfect hair, a beautiful smile, and a lovely face. I am not mad that they are beautiful, I was taken a back by how similar everyone looked and how little diversity in appearance there was. You can probably guess, this fucked up my self image to the point were Im not sure if I will ever look at myself and like what I see. \n\nLet me talk about my major for a second. I'll set a little scene up for you- it's christmas, you are at my family christmas party with way too many people in attendance. My uncle mike- a tall older guy whose personality is made up of business and golf asks me first if I have a boyfriend, then proceeds to ask me about my major (its digital art). Oh dear, did he have the most interesting points to make about how art is not a secure major. This proceeded to happen with almost every person at the party that dared talk to the weird black sheep of a niece/cousin,etc. Look aunt carol, just because you can't talk about sororities or finances with me doesn't mean you can't talk to me. Can people just not comprehend you need designers for like everything in the world. Yes, you know your company does have a lovely brochure that was designed by a graphic designer. Anyway, every day is a new struggle of if I should drop my major. But heres the kicker, I am getting a lot of money to be in the major I am - funny how that works. So, I really can't switch. And what do I want to do with it, well I wanted to go to the west coast, maybe work for a game company or animation company but OH WAIT I live on the east coast and my mom wont even let me do a job in new york so what I am going to do? Well im not fucking sure as of right now. \n\nThat brings me to my next point- my twin brothers. They are seniors in college and basically geniuses. One is a data analysis major that already has a cushy job at a business- that he very well deserves. And the other is a computer science major that works in cyber security- again, he very well deserves it. They both have gorgeous and wonderful girlfriends. Everyone, and I mean everyone, loves them, and yeah, they are awesome people. They can easily talk to anyone and everyone, and everyone actually wants to talk with them. And they know exactly what to talk about. They radiate confidence and yes literally everyone loves them, including me. And me on the other hand is shy and more quiet who is so unsure of herself. Not a lot of people can relate with me because I dont have a lot in common with the people in my family and even my friends. Do my brothers have their fair share of problems and issues- of course, everyone does. But, it is really hard to get past. \n\nSo here is were I am at right now, I spent new years at home with my parents. We hung out and watched a movie and ate great food! That is great and I love them to death- but I just kind of wish I could have hung out with some friends or maybe even have gone to a party. My brother invited me to go out with him and his friends, but i declined. Now you might be asking \"op! you should have gone! It could have been a lot of fun!\" I know this wasn't his intention, but it sort of felt like a pity invite. I dont know, Ive spent a lot of the break at home and he has been hanging with friends and working all the time. Maybe he thought I would have liked to have gone out. But, who am I kidding, why would I be hanging out with a bunch of their friends, some of them are 25! Im 18! What is their little sister doing here!  I actually really like a lot of their friends, but thats their life, not mine. Even if I dont have any friends to hang out with, tagging a long with my brother is sort of sad in a way. After the ball dropped, I said goodnight and went to my room and had a complete depressive episode. I was crying about a lot of things- loneliness, emptiness, worthlessness, uselessness, and just confusion of what I am doing and where I am in life right now. I have also been having some serious health right now that I have spent a good portion of this break dealing with. I have been bouncing around from doctor to doctor with things and one suspects a tumor in one of my bones- some pretty heavy stuff. You know, I told a lot of people that my health has been a major source of anxiety and uncertainty, but it just seems like no one really cares. I am not expecting people to be all over me, but seriously, not one person is even asking if I am doing okay. I just kind of feel left behind and uncertain about the future. So, I contemplated killing myself for a long time but as usual can't do it because my family can't take anymore death. And I cant cut anymore because ironically I told the guy who assaulted me that I would never cut again and Im keeping my word. So, starve myself it is.\n\nI feel like Im rambling and complaining now so Im going to stop. I appreciate it if you read all the way through or really even a little, sorry it was long.",

        "original": "Sorry in advance for any mistakes. I'm on mobile and tired as all hell since it's currently just before 2 am. \n\nAll my friends are out celebrating the end of a decade, and I'm curled up on the couch wishing I was dead. My meds stopped working awhile ago so I stopped taking them. I havent told my psychiatrist or my therapist, let alone my parents. I feel like I'm falling back into the horrible place I was at when I was at my worst. \n\n6 months ago, everything was amazing. I was feeling better than I had in years. Now, I'm back to... This.\n\nOver the summer, my dad finally let me try my temps. I started dating an amazing guy. I was getting closer with my friends. I was happy.\n\nThe school year started and things started going downhill. I was overwhelmed with work, I was taking out my stress on those around me, I was overall being a shitty person. I realized that after since people pointed it out to me and I started trying to fix that, trying to figure out a better way to release stress. I've always kind of been a person to lash out (not physically, but I definitely raise my voice) at others, which I've really got working on with my therapist. I felt like I had made so much progress from this time 2 years ago (when I was at my worst). \n\nFlashforward to exams. My stress is through the roof. The week before I told everyone close to me to pretty much brace themselves, cuz even though I've been able to handle stress better, I knew that exams were going to push me to my limit and that I might end up resorting back to my asshole-like ways. I apologized beforehand and told everyone that I was really going to try and not get too bad (I really did try) but that there's about a 90% chance I'll have a breakdown and end up being, well, a bitch. Friends said ok, boyfriend said ok, sisters said ok.\n\nSecond day of exams and I'm at my limit. I go to my therapists office at school and one of my friends decided to bring all of my close friends and boyfriend up to comfort me... That went badly... I pretty much yelled at all of them, broke down, cried, bitched, allllll that good stuff. \n\nAfter my little \"event\" we decided to go over to Mike's (all names will be fake names btw) and Jason's (boyfriend) house, like we usually do. So, at the house, it's me, Nicole, Mike, Jason, Grace, and Mike's parents/older brothers (situation is a little weird, Jason moved in with Mike after some stuff, but they aren't brothers). I decide to take a nap and hopefully sleep off some stress, Mike n Jason get on the Xbox, Grace and Nicole do something (idk I was sleeping). When I woke up I apologized to everyone again for my freak out.\n\nCouple days later, I'm still a mess, but I've managed to not yell again (which is good for me tbh). I'm really trying to make it up to Jason because he has issues with too much negativity, and obviously I've been rather negative. I probably said stuff along the lines of \"now that exams are over I won't be as stressed, so I won't be freaking out. Sorry, I know you hate when I'm like that.\" About a million times. That night, he breaks it off. I knew it was going to happen, but it still really hurt...\n\nSince Jason and Mike live together, and we really only hang out at their house, I pretty much isolated myself from my friends for about a week. I've only seen them once this entire break, while we usually hang out every other day, if not more. I've tried every day to not do anything to hurt myself, though it's been kinda tough, and I can't say I've succeeded every day.\n\nI'm mostly over the breakup I think, though I've only seen him once since, so I can't guarantee that I am until after school starts up and I have to see him every day...\n\nI completely understand why he broke up with me. I pushed the line. There's no reason he had to stay with me that weren't for me if that makes sense. (I'm really bad at wording things, sorry)\n\nOkay, done with stupid relationships. Whatever, ya know?\n\nMy great uncle missed both Christmas and Thanksgiving this year, missed Christmas last year and had to go to the hospital again last Thanksgiving after being at our house, and he missed the Christmas the year before too. He's the only relative who ever has celebrated holidays with us, really. He's sick (not sure exactly how, I just know that he's fallen alot, is really losing his memory, and has been in and out of the hospital alot) and probably won't be getting better. I missed the last holidays with him when he was healthy because I was hospitalized. I can't ever forgive myself for that. He showed up for Thanksgiving 2 years ago, and for the first time, I wasn't there. He got really sick before that Christmas. I still feel like I missed out on so much because of me being stupid...\n\nMy depression has come back and hit me hard. It's a struggle to get up in the morning (or more accurately, the afternoon) even when I've got nothing stressful to do that day. I want to sleep the day away. I want to sleep my life away. No dreams. No idea of consciousness. Just nothing... \n\nI want everything to just... Stop? I don't even know anymore. I'm just so exhausted. That's probably like a classic \"I'm depressed\" line but I really don't care at this point.\n\nI've lost someone I loved because of my own stupid mistakes. I've pretty much cut off my friends. My reliance on science's concoctions to keep me going has failed me. I've missed that one chance of seeing someone not sick for the last time. I've torn others down for pretty much no reason. I'm falling back into my depression. I don't know what to do. I guess this is just a rant or just a way to get everything off my chest before I do anything else. I really don't know what I'm going to do now.\n\nIt's just after 3 am now. I'm sorry for such a long post. If you actually read it all then... Well, sorry for wasting your time.",

While there I met the wrong person & I was raped for weeks and left in really bad shape at the side of a road.I spent 8 years fighting to be heard in the media and by police in both countries and it had no result & I finally gave up. This super short explanation is the reason I suffer from suicidal thoughts. I am a man and this was done to me by another man. I only told two members of my family. One response: Why did you not call? (sorry I should of untied myself I guess and find the phone that was taken from me and call you \\*rolls eyes\\*) And \"I told you so\" was the other response.\n\nI have never been with a woman I live at home at the age of 37 (which is ok but took a long time to accept that it would always be this way), I suffer from Trauma, Anxiety & Depression + got crooked teeth. (that last part really affects my self esteem but it costs a fortune to fix and I Mean more then a car)\n\nI have come to accept I will never have a home & I will end up homeless in the future because I am completely lost when alone and that is okay I made my bed and now I need to face the consequences.\n\nSo to almost everyone here: Things could be worse & yes that does not mean you should stop being depressed as it is NOT that simple but hopefully this lessens even just a tiny bit how bad you feel about your situation in life.\n\nI do not write this to get pitty as I want non but I write this to try to show you that no matter what happens in life you have to just keep going on & fight through the bad days. Suicide is not and never will be the answer & medical fact: Those who attempt it and suceed regret it as their life disappears but by then it is to late to back out.\n\n(People who suicide by hanging are ALWAYS found with tons of wounds on the neck from changing their mind and trying to claw the rope from them but they have already lost the strength to break loose when they realize they want to live, a small fact from hospital workers).\n\nAlso last by NOT least: Go see a therapist or talk to a friend. There are so many people in this wonderful world who are willing to help you.\n\nYour family cares about you even though they do not show it or rarely do (depending on your situation but they love you there is no doubt).

I was loving life until I went on my first tour in 2010. Nothing wrong with the tour whatsoever apart from missing family and friends but when I got back home that\u2019s when shit really hit the fan. I\u2019d only been back 3/4 days only to find out that she had been cheating on me the last month or so I was on tour. I was ready to break things off until I got a phone call from my sgt telling me I was posted to the same camp as her. \nSo we tried to make it work and did for a little bit.\n2012 came along and we had our son and things were really good between us. Until I got sent away on tour again, I enjoy this tour more than the previous one and communication with home was a lot than the previous tour. \nThen I got back and 10 days later out of the blue she tells me it\u2019s over. This destroyed me. I later found out that she had cheated on me numerous times while I was away, once with one of my sgts and once with one of my best mates at the time. She left the raf and moved a 3hr drive away. I had lost my wife, son, house, car and friends. This is when I tried to kill myself the first time. Had to go to a mental health counselling for a while and went on a bit of a mad one with drinking and gambling and managed to get myself a \u00a315000 debt but then I meet the partner I\u2019m with now.\nWe moved in together quite sharply and move have 3 littles girls that I love very much but over the last year or 2 things haven\u2019t been great.

I'm just tired really. tired on sleeping from couch to couch from friend to friends house. tired of not eating, tired of not having motivation to bathe sometimes. i don't care that i just graduated. i was gonna die in debt anyway. but money doesn't mean shit either it's all my family has been fighting about lately. truly if i could just die off in some ditch or car accident far from home or something id be fine with that.

I've also considered visiting my ex and jumping out his fifth floor window too. \n\nI wanted to say that this year ill try but whats the point.

I have a universal credit appointment. I've supposed to have been working on a business thing and I haven't because my mental health just crumbled over the summer. I went to hospital a few times over it but I AM PETRIFIED of whats going to happen. I was hoping people would see fucking sense and vote Labour in. Every election I eye up which is the 'best one for the current climate' and they were the correct answer. The fact that the tories have been in power for a while now and we're still this fucked up - deporting black people that were supposed to be British citizens, the number of tories that are landlords and austerity measures that led to Grenfell, the environment, workers rights guaranteed by the EU, the gutting and gradual privatization of the NHS. I just feel that the people I see in the street that have their lives benefitted by socialised services, protections and services provided by the EU because our own government lies about having no money (but can send a disproportionate amount to Northern Ireland to buy support from the DUP.\n\nI see people and I think I have nothing in common with them. This isn't my country any more. Polls have shown the majority of people would prefer the breakup of the UK than cancelling Brexit. What the fuck is going on! And I have this in my FAMILY. People that have seen that policies by the tories have precisely impacted me. That, at the time when they did, when I was close to suicide then and told them so, we spoke about \"dont vote for things that will hurt your family\". And they did in December. Just what is going on. I feel like actual thought has gone out the window replaced by lies on socialmedia.\n\nSo I have universal credit, distancing from close family both eroding my mental health. Before this I was wildly successful in my field. I was a forerunner for change in my industry. I wasn't the only one but we started something big. We all risked everything for the outcome that people inside and outside my industry now enjoy. That was maybe 15 years ago now? I employed people, won awards, life was great.\n\nBut things slowly fell apart for me. I never ever cheated my taxes as I believe in transgenerational duties. In that I will one day be old and need the state, social care, NHS and the likes to look after me. There are old people now that are in that phase and so I need to \"add to the pot\" now just like I hope people will in the future. But just 15 years later I need help that, at the time, was afforded to people in my situation. a couple of years ago the tories created a policy that limits support. So now I need the help, after the hundreds of thousands of pounds I happily paid in taxes during my success years, theres no help for me. And at the end of the month I'll be having an appointment with a woman that's going to come down hard on me. mental health collapse, suicidal thoughts, these mean nothing. It's Dickensian. If only I had the foresight to realise people would become selfish (aka tax dodging and evasion) AND a heartless party would be in power. .. that fellow POOR people voted in ... I should have been selfish too and kept what I could hidden from the gov. So right now I could live off my savings and not have this deadline looming. fuck.\n\n{sorry I should have said. my work relies on me being creative. and I just can't do that right now. there is no happiness inside me and that's the fuel for this kind of work. It doesn't even have to an excess of the stuff just an unshakeable mindset with the dial set to 'everything is okay'. }\n\nI have a fiancee. Out of everyone I hoped they'd be able to me but they haven't been able to. Not their fault at all. I'm just beyond fixing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI burst out in tears moments ago. I googled \"when is bojack horseman back on\". Jan 31st. Fuck. I realised I'd be dead by then. This has never felt so real and I don't know what to do.\n\nbut what I cant get over with any of this is how SET this seems to be. I don't know how im going to do it or exactly when. just that i wont see february.",

        "title": "One of my best friends committed suicide a few months back. Starting to think he had the right idea.",
        "original": "So about a month ago I found out that one of my oldest and dearest friends died way back in August. It took weeks after learning about his death from his family (from whom he was estranged, and who in turn waited months to tell any of his friends that he had died in the first place) to finally find out that it was indeed suicide, which many of us suspected was the cause. We all knew each other from working at summer camp together, indeed this guy was my counselor and mentor before he was a friend and an equal, and we all live all over the place so we often go months without seeing or talking with each other. Hence why none of us found out for months.\n\nBut that\u2019s not exactly what I want to talk about here. I\u2019ve been struggling with depression, often manageable but at times quite debilitating, for basically my whole life, certainly my whole \u201cadult\u201d life, and really since at least age 11 or so (for the record, I\u2019m 26 now). I\u2019m so incredibly fortunate to have family and social circles (small, but there) who are at least sympathetic and to have had access to therapy and medication for many years. And while it\u2019s hard to say I\u2019ve ever thrived living with depression, I have had some successes in my life: I finished high school and university with good grades, I\u2019ve made some really great friends, I\u2019ve done some writing which I\u2019m actually halfway proud of, I\u2019ve had one really great romantic relationship for two years - and when that relationship ended a little over a year ago, it ended on good terms and my ex and I are still friends. And, least or perhaps most of all, I\u2019m still alive. I\u2019m still here. \n\nBut this last point at least is starting to feel less like an achievement and more like a weakness.\n\nI\u2019ve never believed suicide was \u201cthe cowards way out,\u201d nor have I ever understood why people often react with anger towards a loved one who commits suicide. Or maybe I should say, I understand, but I don\u2019t sympathize with that point of view. My sympathy has only ever laid with those who kill themselves, and when I found out about my friend this was my reaction as well; now that the shock has worn off, I feel nothing but sympathy, and a hope that his pain is truly over now.\n\nI\u2019ve also for a long time now held some fairly dark and fatalistic views about life in general, which I realize is almost certainly heightened if not directly the result of my depression, but my thoughts about this still resonate. That we are all doomed to die, and anything we experience in terms of achievements and happiness are fleeting, that in the end we will all be forgotten by the nothingness of infinite time. And further, that even the easiest and happiest life is filled with suffering. Maybe even that life itself is a bad thing, defined by suffering and sustained by an impossible desire to make it last as long as possible.\n\nYes, I know. I know how doom and gloom this all sounds, that it very clearly emanates from depression and sounds a bit like an angsty teenager\u2019s pseudo-philosophical diary scribbles. And it\u2019s also worth noting that this year, the last couple of years really, has been really pretty rough. I can\u2019t hold down a job, my girlfriend and I broke up, I moved back in with my parents, and I can see all of my old friendships slowly withering. God, how much I want to have a beer with a friend and have it not feel like I\u2019m being done a favor out of pity. God, how I want to have my hand held in an intimate gesture, I miss it all so much. \n\nAnd of course, all of this is hitting me particularly hard on New Year\u2019s Day. Doubt that\u2019s a coincidence. \n\nNot really asking for specific advice, to be honest just writing this has made me feel a bit better. I also first posted this on /r/depression, felt like posting it here as well, and hope that\u2019s ok. Thanks for reading",

I knew that she might be busy and doing it for her career. I didn\u2019t want to bother her, though I went through hell. One day when I wrote her, she said that we are not together and left the chat. That is when we came back from studies, back to our country. She missed me but didn\u2019t want to be with me. Maybe she found someone else. That is fine she can go and experiment do whatever, but I don\u2019t think she cared what I went through. That just ended me. \nI can\u2019t look to my eyes, to my parents or anyone else\u2019s. \nI dearly miss her and want to be with her. \nSo I\u2019ll go and search another dimension where I might be with my soulmate. \nI truly love her. I wish her best wishes.\nAnd I\u2019m thankful for all of you :)\nMay you have more will to live than me!\nAnd enjoy what you have till it lasts!\n\nEdit:\nWe been together from childhood. And it would count as 5 years in relationship. \nWe visited the world and we would work best when we would be together. I was her escape from stress. She was my relief from loneliness. \nThis year, 2020 I would have proposed. \nOf course knowing her, she wouldn\u2019t accept, because we still have to finish our university\u2019s.\nBut this actually would\u2019ve showed that I truly am there for her. I\u2019m not pushing wedding or anything like that. I just would be happy being together as best friends or a couple with a shiba (favourite dog breed) finding adventures around the globe and helping charities. \nBut this is not to happen. Now I\u2019m being ignored. Feeling shunned by her. Truly, right now, in my life, without work that I have got, I ain\u2019t got nothing valuable or anything to care for. \nThrough  these months my body has started to deteriorate.\nI started doing heavy medicine overdosages. This led me to great pain of hugging the toilet for days. \nAnd now my kidneys and liver are not well.\nI truly don\u2019t care about myself. I care for the greatness of both us. \nMy plan now, as she doesn\u2019t want an easy life, but she feels safe with me, is to be cremated and put in to an urn that has a sapling. I want to help the environment and I want for people from my family to come back to me and just realise this as a lesson to start helping others. And might she have her freedom as she is trying to escape her past. \n\nShe is a person I sworn to protect. \nDo all I can. I might be a lunatic. And it is harder for me to let go. \nBut love justifies the means!\nAgain I\u2019m thankful for those who are following this development. I\u2019d love to get to know you people, but with this short notice of time, I might not get to respond to you all. \nGot to say this.\nHigher powers bless us all! \nSee you next day.",

I needed to find a community where I can express myself properly where people won't be judging you as all of us are at common ground but sadly my country around South East Asia does not take mental health issues such as depression,anxiety etc as a priority so I had finally found a Reddit community that I can share my thoughts with here after hours of searching from Google for answers on how to overcome my personal problems. \n\nFirst of all, forgive me for my bad grammar. I have been living with paranoia, anxiety and depression for almost 3 years now due to an incident which caused almost the whole state of my country causing to hate me. This incident happened at my own home where I shouted and screamed in the middle of the night after being overwhelmed by many personal problems. I couldn't contain my feelings anymore and I just to release it. What's even worse is that my neighbors which happens to be my cousins obviously hear me screaming and shouting at my own room. \n\nAfter that incident happened I started to lose friends slowly and when I needed some of them to hear me out explaining myself on what happen they turned their backs on me. I started to develop a very bad behavior where I built my own ego as a self defense mechanism whenever there are people talking shit about me indirectly for almost 3 years. My cousins too whom i grew up with since we were kids have done the same thing as well. One of my cousins told me that \"cousins are just blood-related human beings\" right in front me when I told him that we're family and we should take care of each other. \n\nI also have suspicions that my room has been bugged due to people who I go to college with indirectly talks to the other classmates about brushing my teeth too hard till my gum bleeds and also other things that I've done in my own room. I might be paranoid but then again how the fuck are they able to tell about the things that happened in my own fucking room if not for surveillance. \n\nI am surprised that I'm still breathing till now because before this I was diagnosed with M.D.D.(Major Depression Disorder) by my psychiatrist. I managed to pick myself up after taking a few of the medications of anti depressent pills. But then again my cousins came back again to me during Christmas to bring me and my other cousins out on a short field trip around my state. I thought everything was going well but all of a sudden one cousin of mine started to talk about how I angry i'll get and start to drop them off on the road and tell them to walk back home. I took it as a joke at first because our conversations at first were pretty much about planning the next trip. But then she got even worse by stating that im thinking about not ever going to talk again due to the way how she talks and how much of a sensitive person I am. I was shocked when she said that as I thought we were all having fun and all. \n\nI'm also sorry that I am not able to explain everything properly as I am typing this right now 6 in the morning as I have not slept yet and tired from my negative thoughts. I hope some of you might be able to understand what I am trying to say. \n\nI really just want my fucked up situation to end. Cause I've been holding this scissor for an hour already...",

I've tried different antidepressants, ketamine, talk therapy, DBT, even a new treatment for PTSD called stellate ganglion block. None of them have made any real difference. DBT's given me some skills to make things a little easier, but it's not enough. And I've had access to far more gender-affirming surgeries than most trans people are able to get.\n\nKnowing that I have to go through the rest of my life feeling like a fake, like I'm lying to people, like everyone is just humoring me is too much sometimes. I feel too broken to just live in my body, much less take pleasure in it. And the fact that I have a loving family, many close friends, an amazing full-time job, and have been in a number of wonderful relationships only makes things worse, because I feel like I must be truly weak if I still want to die with all of these good things in my life. It makes me feel like the anti-trans voices of the world must be right, that I'm a mentally ill man who's mutilated his body.\n\nBut really, though, it's not exactly that want to die. I just want to not have a body, and unfortunately dying is the only way we currently have of achieving that. \n\nThis year I'm going to try LSD and mushrooms for the first time, because a lot of people I know have said they radically changed their perspective on things. After that, I might try changing my antidepressants. If that doesn't work, I might move on to TMS or ECT. And if those still don't help, I feel like I'll probably make the second attempt of my life, and I'm so scared of being locked up again that I'll be really motivated to pull it off.",

Sometimes I have to spend 5 minutes on a single text to my girlfriend or to someone else, because I kinda simply 'lose my mind' for a lack of better word. I was always that kid that was slow sometimes or stuck in his own head, especially in social situations. General neuroticism in the form of anxiety didn't help either (probably due to my lack of cognitive ability in handling social situations).\n\nOh well, the point is I took the short stick of the genetic and developmental roulette. Using drugs probably wasn't a good idea eitner, but they probably just triggered an underlying predisposition that was there anyway.\n\nPoint is, life is unliveable. I mean, if at least I didn't have the mental dysfunctionality, I could hold down a job or *not stand around for a few tens of minutes* wondering how to accomplish literally any task. But I can't do that either. I'm 21 and never had a job, and even if it would be the simplest of things like driving for Uber, I would malfunction in times of stress or when I'd need to do some unique maneuver.\n\nMeds don't work, exercise doesn't work, meditation doesn't work. Nothing can cure retard, or any clusterfucked mental condition such as this. So the only thing I have left is suicide. Family & friends are one of the only reasons I refuse to inflict such pain, but I don't know if there's any other reasonable option, when literally every moment of life is spent in a weird dissociative & anxious state, with an incapable brain, unfit for processing information correctly. The thought of suicide is so relieving though, knowing one day all this will end. At the same time, it's frustrating because I *want* to have a life, but can't because of this mental shit.\n\nFuck me. I don't know if those of you without this disability & psychoticism should feel better because you don't have it, or feel worse because you're suicidal *even with* your cognitive functions intact.

I've smoked more weed in my life than Cheech and Chong combined. I started in college, around 2013, to avoid my problems and used it as a crutch. It was illegal where I lived, so I moved to Denver, Colorado last year. Today, I have such a high tolerance that I don't even get high anymore. This sucks because I'm unable to mask my pain from myself anymore. I'm 26 years old, I'll be 27 in May. I'm gay, and my husband and I have been married a little over a year now. I used to be a paramedic, and a correctional officer. Now I'm unemployed and I can't seem to get a grip on things. My husband provides our sole income, and we are not able to pay our rent this month so I fear that we will be out on the street with our cats in the near future. We have no family here. Everyone we know lives on the other side of the country. I want to go home but I don't want to be anyone's burden anymore. I used to have my whole life together. I was in a fraternity, had so many friends, so many fun times. And now I have no one but my suicide-driven thoughts. My husband goes to work, comes home and goes right to bed. On his days off he sleeps the entire day through. I feel very much alone and I don't see any way out. I have always anticipated that I'd be part of the \"27 Club\" - for those who don't know it's the term given to many musical artists who have died at the age 26. Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Kurt Cobain to name a few. So this year, 2020, I will turn 27. And I have this feeling in the pit of my stomach that I'm going to die. Probably by my own suicide. Is it strange that I can't tell if I'm actually a suicide risk? I don't want to worry my husband or family with this. I don't have health insurance, and I just think that fighting this may be more trouble than what it's worth. I'm not looking for sympathy really. I guess I'm looking to see if I'm truly as alone as I feel. Has this happened to anyone else? Is it just me?",

        "original": "This is going to be a long post, fair warning. I\u2019m seriously struggling with suicidal thoughts and self destructive behavior. I have literally nowhere and no one to turn to. At the moment I\u2019m trying to find a reason not to take a fistful of sleeping pills.\n\nMy story has basically been going from one fucked up situation to the next for the last several years. I was raised Jehovah\u2019s Witness. That\u2019s fine and all, the problem arises because I also happen to be transgender (male to female). Jehovah\u2019s witnesses while being tolerant in most things are extremely anti-LGBTQ. So for the majority of my life (I\u2019m currently 25) I suffered in silence, afraid to talk to anyone about the war going on inside my mind 24/7. This internalized fight slowly started to corrupt my thinking and mindset. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, I was physically and emotionally abused by my parents growing up. All of this adds up to an extremely depressed and angry person. Things continued on as they always had been, and I continued to stay silent about my struggles. I ended up getting married, she knew about my struggles (first person I ever told actually) and was happily married for a few years. My mental state continued to decay. Anger turned to hate, hate into violence. I found myself in my distaste for life and the world and everything in it, becoming the source of physical abuse in my new family. To this day, one of the greatest regrets I\u2019ve ever had. It started with \u201csmall\u201d things. Having blowups more frequently. Beating myself bloody. Destroying my prized possessions because I was convinced I didn\u2019t deserve them. Suddenly I found myself shoving my now-pregnant wife. Next thing you know, I\u2019m strangling her while she scrambles to both hold our new child and claw for her phone to call the police. Thankfully, a moment of clarity came into my mind and I realized what I was doing and let off. That night I should have gone to prison. For some reason, she lied to the police about what happened and I didn\u2019t.\n\nAs if this wasn\u2019t enough, my self destructive behaviors continued to worsen as I became more and more convinced that I only deserved the worst. I became disillusioned with the very idea of life and what it stands for. Love became a foreign concept to me as my heart continued to harden in hatred. This made it possible for me to cheat multiple times and cover it up. About 6 months later (around the pinnacle of the abuse) I decided to come clean with what happened. I suddenly had become resolved to try to fix myself, in an effort to make up for all of the harm I had done to my wife and newborn. I wanted to be better. I looked to the root of the problem and realized this would continue as long as I stayed in the closet as this is where my self hatred stemmed from (mostly). So in a sudden move I came out of the closet by disassociating myself from the religion I was a part of (which meant completely cutting myself off from all family and friends I had) to transition.\n\nThis move devastated my wife even further and whatever was left of our once beautiful marriage completely collapsed. I found out she had been messing around with my little brother and realized that this was the result of the things I had put her through. We mutually ended it and have been separated ever since. Enter 2019. Having no place to stay now I bounced from place to place until I finally got an apartment. Around this time I started to have severe financial issues as my piling debt of 30,000+ started to catch up with me. Meanwhile, though attempting to transition, I found myself absolutely wracked with guilt over the life I had left behind. So much so that it began to paralyze me. The transition I so desperately craved my entire life became just as meaningless as everything else in life. I found myself capable of only one emotion, hatred for all that is living and breathing, the very existence of life disgusted me, especially my own. I reached a tipping point where I came home from running some errands, went up to my apartment and very calmly swallowed a concoction of whatever medication I could find. (Mind you I had only been hospitalized for mental issues two weeks before). I sat there waiting for the end to come....but for some reason clarity took hold again and I let someone know what I had done. An ambulance was called and I was hospitalized for my first suicide attempt. I left the hospital ready to return to work only to find out at a crucial point in my financial history I lost my job for being in the hospital too much. At this point, my life began to completely spiral out of control. I scrambled to find another programming job, and in my desperation took a job that I was essentially bullied into, taking a massive pay cut in the process. As I got farther and farther behind financially, things began looking more bleak. I found myself being crippled by depression, oversleeping nearly every day, despite trying to set alarms and do everything I could think of to wake up. After only two months I lost this job as well. Losing this job was the breaking point for me. As time went on and I was unable to find another job, I started to have to sell things off in order to have basic necessities. I was denied unemployment as my job reported that I was let go due to misconduct. Eventually I simply got too behind, and realized I was going to lose my car, apartment, and really everything I owned. I had an utter breakdown while driving after this and ran my car into a barrier while hyping 70 miles an hour. Yet somehow, I didn\u2019t hit it straight on enough, and I was able to walk away without a scratch. Someone else who was driving reported what they had seen and the police came and picked me up and took me to the hospital where I was yet again admitted inpatient. About this time, after finding out what happened to me, my parents decided to get more involved in my life again. They, while I was inpatient offered to give me a place to stay. And here I am. 25, with nothing to my name, still unable to find a job in my career path which likely means I\u2019ve ruined that too. I\u2019m about to give up trying and just get a job wherever I can find. Waste of schooling and time. My wife who I am still separated from, has gone from my absolute best friend in the world to absolutely despising me and trashing me every chance she can get. She has started to keep my daughter from me too. Every relationship outside of my family has turned to ash, usually because of some self destructive something or other I did. I\u2019m too much of a pussy to commit actual suicide so I\u2019m doing it in other ways. I\u2019m letting my health completely go, by overeating constantly, intentionally being unsanitary, not showering or taking care of myself in any way shape or form. I\u2019ve cut all ties with any friends I did have. I don\u2019t do therapy. Taken myself off of medication. My theory behind all of this is that I simply do not deserve basic decencies of life. The transition, such as it was, completely over with. In fact I\u2019ve now found my hate of all things now turning towards LGBT members for being who they are too. Even though I feel like god is a joke, I\u2019m returning to the witnesses just to appease my parents and family. So here I am, utterly confused by who I am, appalled at what I\u2019ve become, but yet unwilling to change because I feel this is what I deserve. I guess a part of me still wants help or else I wouldn\u2019t be typing this. I know this hateful person isn\u2019t me. But I don\u2019t know how to be anything else with the life experience I\u2019ve had. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

        "original": "I'm a first generation college graduate that ended up choosing a useless major (this is entirely my fault) and by the time I realized it, I was a semester away from graduating so I couldn't really change it. Even though I recieved full tuition scholarships and graduated without any student debt, I deeply regret going to college. \n\nDuring college I participated in internships. I did work study programs. I worked my entire way through college. I even was accepted into several graduate programs, but have been unwilling to take on student debt. I see how others struggle with it and realized I shouldn't go to graduate school unless it's funded or I could afford it.\n\nI've applied to everything under the sun in the city I live in and I can't find anything. McDonald's, Target, and Walmart have even rejected me. I created a spreadsheet to track all the business I've applied to and every day I check my email and highlight more and more red for rejected. \n\nI've followed all of the generic career advice. I tailor my resume to the job, write cover letters explaining my unemployment gap/skills, and I even apply for minimum wage jobs because even a crappy job is better than no job. I've had friends, family, and my school's career services office look over my resume and have improved my resume based on their feedback. I've tried to go to staffing agencies. I drove around the city the other day and half of them either had incorrect addresses on Google and no other way to figure out where they were or they just didn't exist. I've applied for various organizations to volunteer at, but haven't heard back from any of them and it's been weeks and weeks. I thought this would be a smart way to use my time while being unemployed, but I'm apparently not even qualified to volunteer. \n\nI've begun to look at jobs in other cities, but how do you move when you have no money? The closest major city near where I live is two hours away so it's not really reasonable for me to commute every day for a crappy minimum wage job that I could potentially get. \n\nThe kicker to all of this is that my drug addict brother constantly has job offers left and right despite his record. I guess not graduating from high school and going to jail several times makes you more employable than graduating from fucking college. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that he is given this opportunities because everyone deserves to be able to provide for themselves and I hope every single day that he gets clean, but it's hard not to be frustrated. I tried to do everything the \"right way\"- the way the high school and college counselors and adults in my life said I should and I have nothing to show for it. I have a shitty ass piece of paper that sits on a wall and that is literally fucking worthless. \n\nI don't want to burden my family or my significant other any longer by mooching off of them. They all would be better off without me wasting their financial resources and not being able to contribute. I don't want to take anymore scholarship money from students who truly deserve it and can use it to get degrees that actually make them employable. \n\n I don't want to hear the generic cliches that are used to pacify people anymore. \n\n\"It'll get better.\"\n\"Keep applying. You'll find something soon.\" \n\"Make job hunting your fulltime job and you will definitely find something.\"\n\nIt doesn't get better. I have pages and pages of rejections that prove that life doesn't work out every single time. Some people are just meant to kill themselves and I'm reminded that I'm one of those people every single day. \n\nI just want to be dead and in the ground so my family, friends, and significant other can be at peace and not have to support my worthless ass anymore.",

She started with emotional cheating, then moved to physical cheating. I admit, I allowed myself to sink into a spot that wasn't making her happy. But I know that it should never make it ok. So after about 8 years, we split.\n\nShe moved the other guy in after a couple of weeks. We have a kid together and she had primary custody, so that hurt. I felt like he was taking my spot as dad (never happened, but that's just how I felt.) It was rough, but I pulled through thanks to a close friend. He kept me busy and we had a lot of fun together.\n\nAfter about a year and a half, she separated from the guy because he was abusive. We ended up hanging out at the same places. One thing led to another, and my repressed feelings for her came back to the surface. We reconnected.\n\nIt was great for another 3 years. She proposed to me, promised we were a unit. I was happy... But then, a few tragedies struck. The friend that pulled me out of my funk died. He was a mutual friend, so we were both devastated. We started drinking a lot after that. Then lots of coke. Then another friend died. Then her mother. We just kept going, trying to cover the pain of loss up. She started going out with friends more often. And then...\n\nShe cheated. Again. It started with her asking for a \"pass.\" I rejected that, but I knew in my heart she was likely already fucking around. That pushed me down hard. I was paranoid about the cheating, but I thought letting her \"blow off steam\" would help her heal from all the loss. Then she admitted the cheating. I was totally shitfaced, and flew off the handle. I wanted to die. I punched a door and broke it, put some holes in the wall.\n\nShe used my outburst as reason to separate. Acts like I did this. When we talk, she uses my flaws to make it seem like it's all my fault.\n\nSo here I am again. This time, I don't have that friend. I live in my niece's old room at my mom's. It's very pink. Maddeningly pink. The only thing I have left over from her is a drinking and cocaine habit. And emptiness. \n\nI have a picture on my phone from Christmas Eve. I keep it as a reminder of my lowest. It's my belt, hanging from a shelf in the closet, formed into a noose. It's how I tried to die that day. The only thing that stopped it was the shelf not holding up, because I'm too heavy for it to support my weight. \n\nI had my son new year's Eve, and tried to enjoy the night with him. I did, but today I feel more empty than I did Christmas Eve. And, while I think I am stronger after the first attempt, I really don't know. I'm in the same room. The only light I have on comes from that closet. So when I close my eyes, I can see the light shining against my eyelids. And im scared that it's calling me.",

        "original": "I got nothing better to do at 12:15 AM so here we go.\n\nI have been severely depressed for a good part of my life now. Been having suicidal thoughts since I was ten, which doesn't make much sense because I've had a comfortable life in nearly every way. No major trauma or anything. My brain is just broken.\n\nI was depressed with suicidal thoughts from when I was ten up until the summer before my junior year of high school. One morning I woke up, and I was absolutely fine. I stopped hating everything. There was so much beauty and joy in my life. This lasted for a full year.\n\nFalling into depression after that has been the worst thing I've ever experienced. Immediately I was panicking. I didn't want to go through this again. I started planning my death. Taking into account what I had available. It took about two weeks to make a solid plan. There were several days when I was going to end it, but wussed out.\n\nMaybe a week after I had solidified my plan, I confided in my dad everything I'd been feeling lately (obviously omitting the suicidal stuff) and he ended up yelling at me because nothing he said was making a difference. I tried to overdose on what was available to me that night. Completely not following the plan. I don't know if my dad would've blamed himself if it had worked.\n\nIt wasn't enough to make me throw up, but it was enough to make it so that I couldn't sleep at all that night. Intense nausea and dizziness, increased blood pressure, super fast heart rate. The next day, I told my friends about it, but wasn't really specific with some of them as to why I did it. One of them just assumed I was trying to get high. I was honest with some others, but I lied and said I wasn't going to try again. My parents didn't catch on because I'm a very good actor and didn't show any signs of not feeling well.\n\nNot even four days later, I was ready to follow through with the plan. Got the belt, got the stepladder. Ended up on the floor saying \"are you fucking kidding me.\" The belt was not secured as well as I thought it was.\n\nI didn't have anywhere near enough energy to try again that day, and I couldn't just go to school because my neck was bruised as shit. So, stupidly, I decided to text my friends in a group chat. They obviously freaked the fuck out and told a teacher at my school, who then told the guidance office. The teacher also called my mom to tell her what happened.\n\nNeedless to say, it was extremely uncomfortable with my parents that day. Lots of asking why I did it. Couldn't even give them an answer. After a lot of convincing, my parents agreed that I should go to school the next day.\n\nShowed up at school, and got called to the guidance office immediately. Turns out the school policy for students who tried to kill themselves is being involuntarily committed to a mental hospital. Spent a horrible five days in there just wanting things to go back to the way they were. Also I threw up on the last day. I think that's some kind of sick, next level achievement.\n\nIt's really only gotten worse from there. Now my parents and friends are on high alert. They care about me a lot, and I know it's fucked up for me to have put them through what I have. My parents locked away the obvious things I could hurt myself with.\n\nEven after all this, I want to die more than ever. I likely won't do it anytime soon, considering the lack of convenient options. I feel like I am eventually going to kill myself. May not be this year. May not be for another three years. But I'm sure it's going to happen.\n\nAnd that's the thing. I hate that fact that I'm hurting everyone around me. They all know what I'm thinking now. I have three friends who I know would blame themselves. I just genuinely cannot see another course of action that will lead to the pain ending for good.\n\nI just realized this is a big fucking thing and I'm sincerely hoping no one wastes their time with this.

It never fucking changes. My stupid fucking alcoholic dad belittling and yelling at me for no reason again and there is nothing I can do about it. I have a phone interview tomorrow for a possible fulltime job and I should be preparing like I usually do but instead I\u2019m just sitting here looking up how much hydrocodone is lethal. We have quite a bit stored in our medicine cabinets from past surgeries that people in our family have had to go through, including me\u2014I had two major and very terrible ones in only the span of a year and my body will never be how it was before or even normal... but that\u2019s a story for another day. Or maybe not ever.\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to either die or move out for a long time. I was suicidal since the age of 12. I kept hanging on because everyone always said it\u2019d get better. Now I\u2019m sort of close to being able to move out. I just finished university literally two weeks ago. Full honors and everything. And still nothing I do will make my dad happy (he legitimately tried to make my whole graduation about himself), he just comes home and drinks and bitches about his job and abuses everyone. He is possibly even cheating on my mom. And at the same time he is talking about wanting kids again, I guess to replace the rest of us because we weren\u2019t good enough for him.\n\nI didn\u2019t really mean for this to be a vent post. I doubt anyone even cares. In my actual life no one cares about me either. They never believed I had depression even though I did. Part of why I even held on this long is because of my girlfriend, but we had to break things off a few months ago. We\u2019re still friends. She is the only person who might be sad when I\u2019m gone. To everyone else I\u2019m an ugly, stupid burden and they\u2019re right. When I go I\u2019m pretty sure my dad would actually be happy and that\u2019s not an exaggeration in the slightest. I feel bad for my mom though but maybe my death would be her catalyst to finally leave my abusive dad.\n\nEven if I got the job, the area where I live is too expensive for me to be able to move out. And no one wants to room with me. If I do move out anyway then I\u2019ll just be alone. Not even my ex would be there to help me or anything. And the girlfriend thing is another problem, because I\u2019m a girl too and I don\u2019t know if my parents would even accept my sexuality if I came out to them. It eats me up inside.\n\nAgain idk why I wrote this. I might delete this soon after posting. My dad\u2019s gone to bed now so I\u2019m gonna go to the medicine cabinet to see what we have. There\u2019s a lot of heavy painkillers and alcohol in this house. And if that doesn\u2019t work it\u2019d probably be easy for me to get a gun because of where I live.\n\nMy family knew about my depression and suicidal issues for years and never did anything about it. A sick part of me wants them to regret not taking me seriously. I also want them to regret all the abuse. This would be the only way they would.\n\nGoodbye I guess. It\u2019s finally time. And if I don\u2019t do it tonight then I know I will sometime this year. It\u2019s the only thought that keeps me happy and relieved, because there will finally be an end to all the pain and hate I feel for myself.",

I no longer call myself a boy, as I am legally no longer a kid. \n\nMy father got an incurable cancer when I was 3 years old. My mother got depression. Result? My father started working really hard, as nobody knows when he will die, and my mother became unable to look after her two children, me and my younger sister, in proper way. She couldn\u2019t look after both of her children due to her instability, so she decided to focus on her younger kid, and I naturally became to an abandoned child. \n\nI\u2019m not sure whether it was because I was never been loved enough, I started having mental disorders without knowing what that exactly is. My \u201cspecial\u201d characteristics made people to isolate me from their communities, which includes school bullying, and when I tried to get out of that situation, no matter how hard I try, nothing worked due to the apathy of both my parents and teachers and some stupid government rules... I was never been able to get any proper support. \n\nI started harming myself, complaining about my life, and never forgot to say \u201cI wish I could be a victim of a psychopath murder, I would really appreciate his murder\u201d. My parents always became mad at me every time I say it, but trust me, I think that is what my parents also wanted, because my parents always considered me only as a problem or big mistake that piss them a lot. \n\nOne day, my parents decided to send me to Australia to start a college education. I wonder whether my parents wanted me to have a greater view, improve my English skill or just tried to make me be killed by a crocodile. I went to Tasmania, you know what happened there? I went to a public school and faced another bullying problem, but this one originated from racism. Those bullies called me CCC, destroyed my stuffs with no good reason and often punched me. Living an international life made me to realize that there would be no happy place for me. \n\nI finished my college course, and now I have permission to go to university. You know what else is waiting? Duty of working for military services. All Korean men are forced to work for military force for at least two years with no benefits, and when someone decided to, he will be in prison for specific amount of time and will never be able to get a job after that. What a stupid duty it sounds like, this country never offered me a safe, happy environment at all and now wants me to be a slave? I don\u2019t get this. I don\u2019t get this at all. I hate this. \n\n\nYou know what my plan is? Now I\u2019m an adult, which means that I now have permission to destroy my whole body with alcohol and cigarettes. If this does not work, I also have an alternative option, which is committing suicide with firearms during the training. I will never live my future as a toy someone can play with by giving psychological pain. I am going to show people that I can decide my future.

Then my mother went on holiday for 6 weeks to Australia (my dad died when I was 9 so I was alone at home aged 22) and I drank a bottle of wine and 60 codeine tablets. Passed out, woke up 6 hours later covered in vomit and half dissolved tablets. Cleaned up and went to work... it was bizarre being alive around people who had no idea that I tried to be dead a few hours before.\n\nAnyways, my wife's gran died last week - and I went to her funeral and realized that unless you have insurance, or a really wealthy family - your suicide will cripple your loved ones. Financially.... Funerals are so expensive, and to put your loved ones through that social stigma would be a very VERY tough duty to place on them. We think sometimes a vengeful suicide will reap some sort of \"win\" but coming from me, who hates his in laws that I want to write a fuck you note to them before I kill myself, will only mean that my wife will be a pariah, someone who had no idea - who was too ignorant to not notice he was serious etc. Causing her a life of sadness for doing nothing wrong.\n\nYou are loved, maybe not by the people or person that SHOULD or you would like to have love you, but I love you, this sub loves you and we are always here to hear your deepest darkest fears, plans or concerns.\n\nYou may think that you have royally and completely fucked up yours and your family's lives, however it will not be better without you - that is NEVER true. \n\nI know by now some have stopped reading because they don't want to think of a way of life that is not full of thoughts of ending it, because it is a coping mechanism so many of us have. \n\nI am not saying stop thinking about dying, or that life will get better or that you need to change a single thing in your life. All I want to get you to do is mouth while reading this, is that you have this sub, you have us, you have me - for anything and everything. \n\nYou are not alone, you are not better off dead, you are are you and in the entire creation of the life as we know it from the atom to the largest star know to humankind - you are the only one that is you. No one can take your place, no one will ever get over you killing yourself and people think of you all the time and they like you - whether you like it or not.\n\nWe are soldiers, we face the same fight day after day, month after month, decade after decade. Against our inner demons that know our every thought and our saddest weaknesses. But, we persevere, we fight, just to get the basics of life down. While other around us reach goals and new heights of success with zero problems, and yet we stand back humbled and burdened by a disease society is just barely getting to understand and start to accept that we are ill.... keep the fight alive.\n\nPeaceful thoughts and brotherly love to you from me,\n\nLuke",

But I get so scared of surviving so I might try to buy halatal today, which is a veterinarian medication they use to sacrifice animals I heard is painless and effective. There are a lot of ways to do it, but there is no way to do it without hurting my mom. She doesn't deserve this and that's the only reason that stopped me before, but is getting easier to think this is the most logical option.

I know is a selfish choice but I don't think there is more. I asked, I was waiting for sign and it happened, is like the universe is telling me to do it, maybe my suicide will bring someone else any lesson and motivation, maybe I am meant to do this, it gets clear every single time I think about it.

What happens if I can stop the pain?. It's been a couple of days I haven't eat, and I been drinking heavily at least a week now. My body hurts, my stomach is hurting me, feels like I am full of broken glass inside me, it cuts me everytime I move. I am tired of the pain, I am exhausted, I am tired of missing them, and tired of failing, I just want to stop the pain. If I do it today I will post my real name and also her name so if someone is reading this, you can tell her I love her and please forgive me. Thank you for reading this.

        "original": "I'm going to proceed to explain my story so,\nTl;dr: I've lost my focus,my drive,my energy. Everyday I just want to sleep because dreams and nightmares are way more thrilling to experience than real life. I trust no one and feel like a completely shallow and empty person. I want to get out of it but everytime I try coincidentally incidents have happened proving me I'm not in the right environment.I just want to be erased as if I never existed.  I've never asked help from the internet because how will the internet understand from just text and stories. But now I have no choice.\n\n\nMy story: I come from a middle class family. Money is not a big issue but it is to be valued a lot. My parents are very strict and overprotective. Since birth,I can remember my parents telling me about their childhood and how poor they were and how hard they had to work to come out of it. Naturally,a lot of pressure was put on me to be perfect and become richer than them.But I had a huge problem. I got angry quickly and when I saw my friends do something that was not considered perfect by my parents I would get angry and lash out at them.My parents would scold me and slowly I started resenting them just as my friends would start resenting me. I was 8 years old at that time. When I found out that my friends secretly hate me I felt ashamed and regretful and the only solution that I could think was to  supress my anger. Soon I saw my parents stop loving each other and become completly cold to each other. The only reason they stay together is for me and my sister's sake. I cant help but feel absolutely guilty about this.On the other hand in the name of concern and love they have done acts that I now find unforgivable. Then as I grew up I stopped talking to my friends who I grew up with. Word on the street is that they find me odd and refuse to talk to me because they are afraid of me.In school I was a completely different person. I was reserved and only spoke when needed. I was popular in school as I had won various trophies for them but I never had friends just acquaintances. I thought I am a freak. I was never invited to birthday parties or any occasion and I cant be bothered to know why.All I know is for unknown reasons I was isolated by everybody I know and to distract myself I started playing video games and fell in love with it. But my father wasn't pleased with it and instead of offering a solution he would just berate me for my faults. I started feeling used by the world. I've even have had people telling me \"why I try too hard,its not as if I have friends or anything\".I know I shouldn't be affected by such cliche comment but honestly my whole life I've never had a coping mechanism. \n            After school I made sure to take a college far away from my home and school.Far away from all the negativity. A new me. Boy did college kick my ass.To join clubs and all we had to give interviews about ourselves. That's where everything broke. Questions like tell us about yourself and what do I value etc. And they wanted personal responses and I couldn't honestly answer. College became a place where I put up a persona for everybody and I didnt enjoy it. I still didn't have any friends because that works on popularity on Instagram and snapchat and facebook and I didn't have one because I never got a reason to get one. Not only that people formed groups of similar liking and I guess I am different. The only thing I did for fun is browsing youtube and watching from veritasium to ksi to james charles. I watched youtube to kill time. Soon I wanted to kill myself. Obviously now my parents enter the scene but to my shock they took it as me rebelling because im in that phase.....WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?\n       Anyhow,we did go see multiple psychologist but failed. In the end my education is more important than my health. Now I've applied to go abroad for my higher education but I've given up. I see no point to anything. All my actions are worthless. No one has time or patience to listen to me. While I was  in therapy I  got into drugs. Had to take a drop from college. I'm no more the perfect person I was and no one cares if I succeed or fail. I hate myself for what I was and what I've become. My whole life feels like a waste of opportunities. I don't understand.\n Why is hating easier than love. Why do we have to try everyday to love but disgust just comes to us naturally. Why is it hard to trust. How do you trust. I dont feel like doing anything. I just want to close my eyes and imagine the world is empty with nothing present. My own father called me a monster. What did I do? I dont know. Where was I doing wrong.Ive hit rock bottom. My self esteem has become very fragile and screaming help doesnt work. The internet is my final option. I'm very fearful of what I've written and I apologize if I offended you",

An unpaid internship isn't going to pay my bills and will just interfere with what little work I have now.\n\nI want to die. I can't take it anymore. Something has got to give. I just want to die. I want to stop existing. But I'm afraid if I try to kill myself again I will mess up again and I will end up with another medical bill that I can't pay. I can't stand living anymore. This world is fucked. I'll never get out if this situation. I'm just going to spend the rest of my life suffering and feeling like I am drowning all the time.",

        "original": "Well, this is going to be a long one. I need to get it out somewhere and it feels too profoundly pathetic to talk about anywhere else. I don't know who to talk to but I really need somebody.\n\nI'm 21, still living at home, not in school or employed. Basically, I'm free-loading off my parent's good will and have been my whole life. I'm relatively certain they disowned me this morning and I have absolutely nobody to blame but myself. I've been numb for hours.\n\nTo give some backstory, they're immigrants from a country with no opportunities. They threw away their entire lives to relocate to the United States to give me some semblance of a chance and well, I've fucked up their entire lives. They have had to struggle so much to get where we are now-- to work awful jobs in a country where they were still adjusting to the language, live in poverty for years when I was a child that (poverty that they always did their best to hide from me), had to give up their entire families back home to attempt to raise me here. My dad did not get to be anywhere near his mom when she died, or even go back to the country for years. In 2012, my grandma on my mother's side passed away of a heart attack, and even though my mom bought last minute flights to see her one last time, she was too late when they arrived. Her siblings did not even wait for her to bury the body. It's fucking awful. I can't even imagine the amount they've had to go through for their absolute fuckup, useless daughter. I feel selfish for even making those things about my feelings on this at all.\n\nMy relationship with my parents has not always been stellar, least of all in the moments that I type this, but they grew up in a different era with vastly different cultural norms. Emotional communication is not something that people did, if you know what I mean. I've dealt with depression and what is most likely ADHD since being a teenager but mental health awareness is not really on the repertoire of things my parents are adapt at. It's been far worse ever trying to bring it up with my mother, because she tends to be volatile and unpredictable. Earlier this year, I did have an honest conversation with my dad about suicidal ideation and the sense of uselessness, and he was fairly receptive to the whole thing. He was clearly overwhelmed and unsure what to do, but he still recommended I seek out some kind of psychiatric help and that he would be okay with it. I have not gone to therapy since then.\n\nWe've had other conversations about mental health in the past that have not gone so well, but considering how open and genuine he was last time, it's better to not dwell like it. I feel like shit for still not having made any sort of appointments with a therapist despite my dad's apparent support. I suppose that I just didn't know where to start, and the longer I put it off, the harder it becomes to do.\n\nMy mom's emotional responses, on the other hand, are an entire can of worms. Things that I think will make her angry have no impact, and minor squabbles have a tendency to blow up. At one point either earlier this year or sometime last year, I tried to explain my struggles with mental illness, but she completely shut down and rejected it. It's difficult to recount exactly what happened without rambling for eons, but she essentially told me 'don't talk to me about this, you can go to your fake doctors' and refused to look me in the eye. It sounds very childish, but I broke down in tears and I asked her if I could have some emotional support and someone to just listen, but she did not want to look at me. She adopted that face she does when she is annoyed and kept repeating that it's not her job to do that. I probably ended up begging her until she told me to leave her alone. Eventually, she told me to just kill myself when I mentioned suicide.\n\nI know that, objectively, this sounds awful on her part. I will not lie and say it's not painful for me to think about. But like I said before, my parents grew up in an extremely different society with different societal norms about how you're expected to conduct yourself with emotions. Attempts at conversations regarding feelings of any sort tend not to go well. My mom has called me stupid, useless, told me that she's regretted doing all that she did. She's told me to stop crying because I only do it to make her feel bad. My dad has told me I'm a failure and that I'm not cut out for surviving myself. I know that my parents must think I am emotionally cold because I tend to shut down around them to try not to cry. I catch myself reacting defensively and responding sharply because it's painful to express vulnerability. There's a lot I can go into here and maybe I need to do that with someone, because I am unable to discuss it with any of my friends. This is already long enough.\n\nI genuinely feel as if I'm being emotionally manipulative when I bring up these incidents, as if I'm trying to justify my actions and behavior. Even if they were a shitty things to do, I'm no longer a 16 year old who can blame all their failings on their parents. I'm 21. Boo fucking hoo. I should have gotten my shit together by now. I don't think I deserve any sympathy here, as much as I want some form of comfort.\n\nI'm their only child and I often wish I had a sibling so this pressure to succeed did not fall solely upon me, which is such an incredibly selfish way to think. I hate myself for it.\n\nThis morning, it all culminated in my mom finding a receipt for a bottle of vodka. My parents are Muslim and believe drinking is morally wrong. Before anyone jumps to any conclusions, they are not particularly devout and never shoved religion on me growing up. In fact, my dad is generally quite opposed to the ways organized religion is used to control people, and we've had many conversations about how the structure of religion is weaponized against people. All they really expected was not to drink, not to eat pork, and to fast on Ramadan. Drinking is a very big deal in the country that we're from so this completely shattered them. They've given up on me. My dad told me I was a disappointment on every level, and that I'm going nowhere with my life, that I haven't been going anywhere with my life for a long time. He told me about how he lies to his friends that I'm still in school because I'm such an embarrassment, that he doesn't know what he did to deserve this. They also mentioned that I am a liar because I was initially dishonest with them about who the receipt belonged to. I have zero defenses for that- it's completely true. To a certain extent, I'm still scared of them and scared of hurting our relationships in general, so I have often lied to them. It's cowardly. I almost don't know how to communicate with them without lying to some degree, because I'm in this constant state of damage control.\n\nThey're not kicking me out, but they plan on buying tickets to go back the country after selling both our cars. I will basically be on my own after that. This seems huge, but I really do believe that they will do it and that it is likely for the best. My mom lost her job earlier this year and my dad is severely overworked at a company that sucks ass. There is nothing left here for them. Even if they don't kick me out or truly move out of the country, it's better that I leave.\n\nI'm useless, horribly selfish, and completely lack the motivation to do anything with myself. I've made no friends in real life for the past 4 years. I feel like an utterly stunted 21 year old who is incapable of existing by themselves and is so far behind all their peers. I never honestly think I'm going to make it another year. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm going to ask them if there is a way I can buy the car that I've been driving off of them, although I do not think they will take that well. I just need something. I've doubled down on applying to jobs so hopefully I can have some form of income soon enough. I've thought about suicide today and resulted to physical self-harm, and the main thing that stops me from doing it is the idea that my parents will find their dead daughter after all their faith in me has been completely destroyed. It's too fucking depressing for them.\n\nTL;DR I feel like a waste of space, as if I'm careening off the edge to no return, and since my parents discovered the alcohol I had, I will likely be out of a place to live soon.",

Although he didn\u2019t use the word useless. He didn\u2019t even ask me to help out more, explicitly. But he talks about how much money everything cost and how little I contribute. I do nothing around the house. He\u2019s not wrong. I know I can do more.  I\u2019ve always been happy to do more.

        "original": "I don't know why I'm posting this here. I think I just need to get this off my chest. I was raised in a household run by my mother who has full blown malignant narcissistic personality disorder. She got pregnant with me as part of a trap to force my father into marrying her. Then, she started slowly destroying his life by ruining his career in the Coast Guard. She told him she was allegedly raped by 5 guys in an elevator (though she didn't want to report it because it was bullshit and never happened) and it mentally broke him so badly that he ended getting discharged thanks to her. He's no angel, though, and while I grew up he was abusive towards me and would physically assault me as much as she would every time I refused to back down from what something I perceived to be wrong. Even sucker punching me isn't out of bounds for him, so don't bother feeling sorry for that son of a bitch.\n\nAnyway, after my mother divorced my father she moved on to destroying my life. She controlled every aspect of my life from who I was allowed to be friends with down to how my goddamn hair was to be styled, as if I were a goddamn doll or something. When I became a teenager, she started beating me with any object she could get her hands on and if I tried to defend myself she threatened to call the police and have me arrested for assault. One time when i was 15 she stripped me naked, tossed me into a cold shower, and mockingly laughed at me. She sabotaged my education by taking me off my ADD medication, which had been helping me concentrate in school and if reflected in my grades. After failing the 8th grade she pulled me out of school and immediately put me to work.\n\nI've had multiple jobs. None of which I was ever able to receive a promotion because I refused to kiss the asses of my superiors and, in one case, had the audacity to file a formal complaint over a boss who felt like she could abuse her power with impunity. As it turns out, the HR woman was her neighbor and they decided firing me was the easiest way to resolve the problem.\n\nBecause I was never able to get ahead I could never get away from my mother and had to stay living with her while she drained my paychecks to get her nails done and to take her out whenever she got bored and to buy her expensive gifts for birthdays, mothers day, christmases, etc.\nShe finally discarded me for good after I met a girl who changed my life so drastically that I started standing up to my mother and began refusing her demands. Then, she tricked me into visiting my brother 200 miles away and once I got there she called to tell me not to come back home. That girl I fell for is now with someone else and had a kid with him.\n\nA couple of years later, I was working multiple jobs that I hated in fields I knew nothing about and one day, I started blacking out, falling unconscious and ended up being hospitalized. After that I decided I wanted to get myself evaluated to find out if something was genuinely wrong with me. As it turns out, I have been autistic my entire life and had no idea. I'm 34 now, unemployed, waiting for 5 years now to receive SSI, and am completely alienated from all of my family and friends. I got lucky and was taken in by a friend of my boss who died of a heart attack right in front of me. So now, I'm stuck in a sort of limbo waiting for something to happen, but every day is just a reminder of how much of an utter failure I am.\n\nI want to die. I've tried twice already and both times my life was saved by my roommate. There's no future for someone like me. I'm too \"normal\" looking for regular people to accept as autistic and too autistic to do the normal things regular people do. My head is full of chaotic thoughts tearing me in every direction as I try to appease everybody's demands of me, but I can't take it anymore. All I want is for this life I never asked for and would never want to be over. The people I know repeatedly tell me that they don't want to know about the struggles I go through because it depresses them too much. Well, how the fuck do they think I feel about it?! Between the mental and emotional damage from my narcissistic mother and the difficulties I have to put up with due to the autism it's just too much for one person to deal with. I want out. If this is what being alive is supposed to be like I'd rather be dead. I'd rather die 1000 deaths than live one more day in my situation. I'm worthless, pointless, without purpose, without hope, without ever knowing what unconditional love feels like, and with no one and nowhere to turn to. I found out that a doctor in some other country created some kind of suicide pod that you lie down in and it fills with some sort of gas that puts you to sleep before it kills you, but due to it being in another country and me in America, I can't see him and on top of it, expressing how much I want to die will only land me in a hospital where they'll just drug me up against my will until I'm pacified. I've been through that twice now. If I end up back there I swear to god I'll kill the first person who dares to approach me with a syringe.\n\nI just want this hellish nightmare to be over. And nobody will just let me go. I don't want to be here anymore. Just let me die. It's not like I'm hurting anyone else by killing myself. Why won't anyone just let me die in peace? I deserve that much after everything I've been forced to live through. Does anyone know of a painless easy way to kill yourself?

I sarted to be left alone in class & during recess, I was bad at talking to people, I only knew that I wanted to study, & have a siuccesful future, I didn't want to meet people, i didn't need to, I was a fool, around that time my motehr started abusing me, getting hit ofr not achieving a perfect score on a test was a daily thing for me, according to her \"what she was doing was noting, she wasn't using her full strength, & that even her hiting me as hard as she could wasn't anything compared to what life would do to me if I didn't get perfect marks at school, well, we moved a few times more, I changed schools many times, 7 times in fact, every time I moved I lost the little progress I had in building relationships with other human beings, well, 4 years ago we moved for the last time, to Pamplona, a city where we had previouslly lived, & here, I started thinking, that what was happening to me wasn't right, I watched the news, & saw cases of child abuse, I was like, \"wait, that's exactlly what's happening to me... it's not right\".\n\nThe next time I got hit, I threatened my mom with telling my teachers at school that I was being abused, to which she replied with (I remember it perfectlly) \"You don't want your mother to go to jail... right?\" as the dumb 12 yo I was, I said \"no, but it's not right that you hit me...\" (or something along those lines) & I don't remember much more about that day, I was probablly hit again, I'm not sure tho....\n\nThat year, I met the person who, to this day, is the person I appreciate the most, she was called Irati, she was an adopted Chinesse girl, well, we became best friends, she was literally the person who opened my eyes, encouraged me to study a bit less, I'd been studying 6-8 hours on a daily basis for a few years now, she helped me, she was the only person that I found it easy to talk to, but (there's allways a but), about a month ago we started a sentimental relationship, she was my first gf, & iwas her first bf, we were cool for some time, we even kissed, I was happy for the first time in years, but, today, she was like, \"hey you wanna hang out or something?\" I said, \"sure, why not?\". Well, when I got there, i gave her her brithday present, her birthday was this Wednesday, i just wasn't able to giver her the present because I hadn't had time... well, she was thankfull, we hugged & kept on with our lifes, we talked for some time, until she told me \"hey, why don't we sit in this bench for some time? I ahve to talk to you about something important\" I replied with \"Sure, tell me whatever you want, I'll listen\" when seh started talking, I was shocked, basically, she had talked with her mother (who doesn't like me very much) & talked about what would ahppen to our relationship if she was to leave to Belgium to study there for 2 years, what would happen with our relationship, which (according to her) she replied with \"well, we'd stop going out\" which, I understand, a long distance relationship is hard to keep, I was like, \"yeah, if that were to happen I wouldn't have a problem\", because we had clearly stated that if our relationship didn't work out we'd still be friends, well, she kept talking about the conversation with her mother, her mother apparently replied with \"well, it seems you take your relationship really lightlly, like if you didn't care about him\" she then started crying while she tried to talk, she was basically trying to say that she didn't know if she loved me, or wanted to be with me just to have a boyfriend, & have the experience, I was devastated by those words, because she was the one who proposed to start a relationship in the first place, she was the only reason I thought that living on was even worth it, just needed to talk about this, I've been holding it for some time now... I need to talk about it, thank you for taking time off your life to read about mine, also, sry for the grammar errors you may find, have a wonderful day\"\n\n& this is what's happened since:\n\nbasically, a quick summmary, it's been me & my gf talking in whatsapp having a wnderful time,& every day  manage to make a comment that manages to upset her... we've also had a date, which went prety well, we hang out at the park & stuff, but the text messages are allways putting me off, after a comment upsets her she normally goes offline & then tells me off by saying why what I said is wrong, why I should regret sayin it, etc... & honestlly feel bad for making her mad...after that I endleslly tell her I'm sorry & she alwways tells me not to worry, that she isn't rlly mad, seh just got a little tense, which I understand I do too sometimes... \n\nThat would be about it, I have seen suicide as an option many times, not necesarilly anymore, but I know it will come back soon... thank you for taking your time off to read my life, plz, any advice, I appreciate, thank you again...",

I'm in university. I have a solid circle of friends, a number of which will be out with me celebrating my birthday.\n\nBut I'm ready to go.\n\nFor about 1-2 years now I've lost all interest in being alive. Actively going through phases of writing notes and getting my affairs in order, and kinda swinging back to being shit, but not necessarily wanting to be dead.\n\nAbout two years ago I got into some philosophical reading. Particularly nihilism. I think that was the start of a downhill turn. I started to care less and less about life, seeing that really there wasn't any point.\n\nDecember last year a girl I liked quite a lot, expressed her interest in me. We were out drinking with friends and she invited me to hers. We got in bed, and I couldn't bring myself to do anything. Frozen. I heard of her friends making fun of me, and as you can imagine I was rather embarrassed, but we're actually good friends now.\n\nFast forward maybe September. A girl, quite attractive, comes onto me in a nightclub. I knew obviously it was on me to make the move, but this same fear grasped me. She turned her back for a minute and I ran off and cried for about an hour in the street.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me, probably sounds pretty weird, but I just want a normal life, I don't think I can provide one for myself. Something is off in my head.\n\nSorry if you read all this for wasting your time. Happy new years.\n\nI'm probably going to take my life this Sunday.\n\nLurking here has been helpful to me and I wish you all the best.\n\nAgain thanks if you actually read this, sorry if you did,\n\nBest Regards,\n\nCameron",

My dad asked how I was doing and I replied something along the lines of \u201coh I\u2019m okay I\u2019ve just been crying but I don\u2019t know why\u201d and his response a pointed finger in my face yelling at me that \u201cwe don\u2019t cry for no reason. Also, around this time period if I would go cry to my mom she would say don\u2019t bring the drama and she would always yell at me for crying for things she deemed as unreasonable. When I was in the 10th grade I was trying to find some pants while, this was the first time i started wearing  double digits and I was so upset and crying in the car on the way home and she preceded to scream at me the entire way back.. So after these incidents and more, I just learned to started to shut down on my feelings and never tell my partners how I felt.. which led to me starting to self harm. After 3-4 years of this, I decided to tell my mother and she was pissed.  She yelled at me and said I was weak and that \u201cthe slaves didn\u2019t do this\u201d.. \nHowever, when I entered college things got better and somewhere in between things fell of the wagon. My depression was in full force and I tried to tell my parents this and I was just yelled at.. Fast forward a year later, my depression and anxiety are the worst it\u2019s ever been and I have my first suicide attempt in July.. My dad after I was out of inpatient was like \u201cwell you were just being moody right?\u201d And when I replied \u201cno, I really wanted to die and I wasn\u2019t just being overdramatic\u201d and then he preceded to tell me that I was selfish.\n When I left inpatient, I was prescribed medication and in a transition therapy program. \nWhenever I mentioned that I wanted to continue therapy this once the program ended, my mother would yell at me saying I don\u2019t need to go to therapy for the rest of my life and suggesting I get of my medication and try CBD. She also says depression doesn\u2019t exist..\nSo I was discharged from the program and I went back to college away from home and several months later I mentioned that I was thinking about going to therapy and my mother was against it but reluctantly agrees saying that I should just video chat a therapist.. \nSo December approaches and I have my second attempt..\nAfter two attempts, my parents haven\u2019t let me tell anyone in the family about it except one aunt.\nNow my parents are trying to understand but still whenever I say something it feels invalidated and I just end up sobbing and now I get really abrupt and short with them when they mention feelings and mental health..\nNow my mother says I always do what I want to do and that I\u2019m being rude and selfish because they are trying to understand.. \nI have asked them if we can not discuss my mental health because I would rather work things out and talk to my therapist about it.. \nSo now I just feel terrible and guilty for being turned off when they bring up my mental health.. \nAm I the asshole?",

        "original": "**Hello, I figure telling my story, thoughts and feelings would be helpful and maybe someone would be able to find some sort of \"communion\" in my story. I'm not native to any English speaking country so I might have some misspellings or misunderstand the translation of some words.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to my story, I've grown up overweight, which might not seem like it would fit into this subreddit, I grew up as the \"strange\" kid I guess, I had some behavior issues that would stand out to my family, such as counting my steps and if I was interrupted I would freak out and have to start all over, when I was walking over crosswalks I would have to always step on the white parts cause that was something my mind made me do.\n\nGrowing up was not exactly difficult per se, but I did not get the help I required thanks to me now being diagnosed until my teen years, I moved to a region pretty far away from my hometown when I was just entering my adolescence, before moving I was diagnosed with ADD and Autism, for those who don't know what ADD is, it's pretty much ADHD but without the added hyperactivity. I was always \"bullied\" or picked on for being overweight, I was called fat more times than I can count. When I moved and started my new life over here, I was pretty happy for the time being, I understood myself and I knew I had some issues that I could work with, I started school shortly after, the first school I entered was, let's say, not that welcoming. After a couple of weeks or a month, I changed school to another local school, I made a couple of friends, had pretty fun, sadly, however. The bullying never stopped, I remember one time when I was standing out on the schoolyard, minding my own business when some kid came up and wanted to compare height with me, like any normal kid I wanted to show how tall I was, but that was not his intentions, he pulled my pants down in front of the entire school, might not seem so bad but that memory haunts me every day.\n\nAfter a year or so of bullying in that school, I later moved on to, you guessed it, Yet another local school, a private one. This school was a pretty good school overall, I made so many friends over the years I stayed and I had a really good time, still bullied but maybe not as much. After a couple of years, I started going into a massive depressive state, I started self-harming daily, I had thoughts of suicidal every day and I started feeling more tired than usual. \n\nFast forward to the recent years, I'm 16 ish now and I am in high school, not gonna lie, high school is the most fun period of my life so far. However its outweighed by my depressive state of mind, my self-destructive thoughts and self-deprecating mindset. \n\nThe recent month or so has been worse than usual, I've had constant thoughts of suicide, I've almost done the deed a couple of times and I fear I might do it for real, maybe fear is not the right word, I want to die, don't get me wrong but I just for some reason want to see if things might change, what might happen in the next week, next month or year. To move the story forward, I take melatonin to be able to sleep, I've done so for a couple of years now and recently I have felt that even when I take it, I still have an extremely difficult time actually going to sleep, I'm more tired than usual and all I feel like doing is laying in my bed, crying. Honestly, I can't even cry anymore, I want to be able to cry so bad but I'm not capable of doing so. All I feel nowadays is a void, darkness and pain. \n\nMaybe I've gone off track with my feelings so let's get to explaining a couple of things, I'm lonely, really lonely and I want to hang out with my friends all the time, but my friends do activities without me, never inviting me or anything, forgetting about me like I never existed. I used to be with my friends a lot but I feel like they're distancing themself from me, as if they hate me, like they don't want me around and like I'm a burden. \n\nI have a psychologist that I talk to periodically, however it does not really \"help\", I used to take fluoxetine and he recently prescribed me with a new medicine that is supposed to help but I still feel shit, nothing really changes. \n\nMy parents think it's getting better, I still remember when my mom found out about my state of mind. As I stated earlier, I have and still self-harm, and one time I was a little bit less careful than usual with hiding it and my mom saw them, she then demanded me to show her and then talked to me. It was one of the worst moments of my life, I was so ashamed and I felt guilty. My psychologist also told my parents when I told him that I am suicidal and that I don't want to live, which should be a good thing, so that my parents can help me. But they don't seem to care, they never talk about it, never show any sort of care for me in that way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to know more you can just comment saying so I guess, I'm not gonna hide my feelings anymore really so for me it's fine. I don't know what more to say, this is basically my story.",

        "original": "I have something serious to share and I really need as much fair advice and/or support as possible. Please read to the end, it is truly a serious situation. It\u2019s long, maybe one or two pages only...but I have to explain all the dynamics for you to understand the end. \n\nA brief backstory: My 15 year old daughter\u2019s father has alienated her from me. He was abusive in our relationship. He held my fist and beat himself in the face until blood went everywhere and called 911 on me. They did not believe me and arrested me. He confessed the next day and was convicted of obstructing an officer. He strangled me when I was pregnant and was convicted of disorderly conduct. When I broke up with him when my daughter was one, he physically stalked me for three years, violated the restraining order but I was too afraid of him to report him, and and called me literally 60 times a day for about a year.  \n\nI filed a motion to relocate with my daughter and there was a custody trial. He slapped her in the face leaning a handprint, then told me he would use the photo of it to report me if I didn\u2019t sign over tax dependency to him. The police only took a report and did nothing. \n\nHe had my daughter put her dolls together and say \u201cthis is how mommy shows me the feel good.\u201d I was investigated and it was found to have no merit when the worker looked at the history. He admitted to me doing this and laughed. The judge decided my daughter should not relocate and he won custody, making me the every other weekend parent. The guardian ad Litem has strongly defended and recommended me. \n\nI believe there was bribery somewhere but I cannot prove it. He then told my daughter I never loved her, didn\u2019t want to be her mom, and that she wasn\u2019t safe with me for years. He would laugh to me when I would beg him to stop. I was a very loving and giving mother. I did everything I could for my daughter no matter what was going on. \n\nMy daughter is now 15. She treats me like garbage, speaks horribly of me behind my back for things like not cooking her breakfast or giving her enough money for the mall and doesn\u2019t listen to anything I say. She has thrown punches at me, tried you break down my bedroom door when I was on the phone with 911 to document her behavior for court, and raised a hand at me. She is NT, I am not. Her father told her I deserved it and she believes this. He got away with everything.\n\nNow a separate incident that relates to the end problem...\n\nIn 2016 I was drugged by a female friend so her husband could rape me. He is a professor at my University. In 2018 I wrote online the story of this betrayal, and they filed a petition of lies and got restraining orders against me. I brought evidence to court disproving their petition and showing I was the one being harassed, but the judge didn\u2019t care. I told her I was sexually assaulted by them and she didn\u2019t care. She said I had no right to write about them and granted the orders. He then took the order to school to \u201cprove\u201d I was a dangerous false accuser. \n\nThere was a long and stressful police investigation regarding his claims that he feared his life and me saying I was assaulted. It was hell. My apartment was searched and my phones taken. I was harassed by police. They did nothing to help me. I was discredited as the real victim and my reputation affected. They got away with it. \n\nAt this time I was a Social Work student getting As and Bs, a volunteer, and planning to be a foster parent and work with kids as I had been a foster child.\n\nNow the issue I have now:\n\nOn August 31, 2018 I was driving my daughter home from orientation at high school. She was 14. I The investigation was still going on and I was having a very difficult time. My daughter was yelling at me for being ten minutes late. She was putting me down and saying \u201cTHIS is why I should be at my dads house!\u201d I finally screamed that she was acting like a complete bitch (not the best word please don\u2019t assume I have done this frequently) and she kept yelling at me how much she couldn\u2019t stand me. I cannot take this from her anymore.\n\nI was driving and for the first time ever I hit her with the back of my hand and got her in the breast area. She said my hand was in a fist and I honestly don\u2019t remember. She said I did it 3 or 4 times and I think I did it really fast when she grabbed my hand but I swear to god it\u2019s fuzzy and I don\u2019t specifically remember if I did or if it was more one-armed wrestling with her hand. There was no mark but a slight discoloration that wasn\u2019t red but looked a little tan, you can barely tell it\u2019s there. I wasn\u2019t trying to hurt her and I have never before so much as spanked her. My lawyer said it\u2019s a weak case and that with the lack of a real mark it\u2019s legally discipline. This doesn\u2019t change that the mere charge has ruined my life and made it even easier for all of the real perpetrators to get off. \n\nShe called 911 on me. The dispatcher asked her if I ever did this before and she paused, and then said the cops have been called but nothing has been done. This is a lie. \n\nThe cops were there one week earlier because her dad called them when she called him crying that she didn\u2019t want to take out the trash. The cops lectured her for about 20 minutes and then lectured him and left. \n\nWhen the cop got there for her 911 call she listened to my daughter and charged me with child abuse. Her father immediately motioned with court to have me on supervised visits and I was too distraught to go so I didn\u2019t. I haven\u2019t had her with me since that day.\n\nNow this is important!!! In January 2017 I confronted my mother on her participation in the sexual abuse with my father. My father was convicted and imprisoned for this. My mother relocated us and lied to everyone. I told her I was doing a radio show for adult survivors of child abuse and I would not keep her secret anymore. I had been advocating publicly for abuse survivors for several years. This is what I became known for. \n\nShe shot herself. My entire family blamed me and did some very horrible things following her death, and I now have no family whatsoever. They said I should have let it go and moved in. I declared I would not let her death be for nothing and I would continue to speak out. I had many supporters. Now she has died for nothing.\n\nMy brother announced he was going to protect the family name. He got a restraining order against me based on a text I sent him months earlier saying I would prove him to be a psychopath and expose his horrendous abuse against me. The court commissioner said I was trying to be intimidating and granted the order. He then told everyone I was a mentally ill false accuser and that he feared me. He has terrorized me since we were kids and I have been powerless to him our entire lives. I will leave out the grotesque details.\n\nNow I am charged with felony child abuse for hitting my daughter in the boob. I have lost everything. I am no longer in school. I will never be a foster parent even if the charge gets dismissed. I will never be a social worker. My speaking out is ruined. I can no longer advocate. I will never again be believed as the victim of abuse, and I have been abused in some way by almost everyone I\u2019ve ever had a relationship with. I have been trafficked, raped, physically beaten, stalked, framed, extorted, and generally experienced injustice nonstop. I have not had friends because I am socially weird and people never want to be friends with me. I have no family. I will never get a decent job or professional license. Anyone who may date me will reconsider when they look me up. \n\nI was found incompetent to stand trial once already and put in the state mental hospital for months. They are now trying it again.\n\nI don\u2019t leave my apartment. I sit everyday and wait for time to pass. I have given up on life. I can\u2019t handle my reality. My life is over, and I want to give up because it seems to be the most logical solution. \n\nI dont know what to do. What should I do? What logical reason is there to continue living?",

If you're unfamiliar with it, it's a type of autism that affects your senses (noise especially) and makes being around proper very awkward essentially.\n\nA couple years ago, I turned to drugs to kinda ease the pain.

I'm man enough to say that now, I am addicted and cant see myself getting off of them\n\nI wouldnt say I'm super ugly, but I'm definitely not what people would class as good looking. A lot of my \"friends\" are girls and they never see me as any more than a friend (not just my friends but every girl I meet). I've been with girls at parties etc but never had a girlfriend.\n\nI'm not close with my family either.

This has left me as an adult with awful anxiety around other people and I have had spells of Agoraphobia. Despite this I\u2019m a functioning parent and wife and if I don\u2019t need to leave the house I am a half decent person. \n\nI stopped working ten years ago when I had my first child and we have lived comfortably on my husbands salary in that time. I even did a degree part time during this time, with no real pressure to socialise or be around people I was at my most relaxed in years. That\u2019s come to an end now as my kids are older. I applied for a graduate job in January 2019 and by some miracle I got it. It\u2019s taken a whole year of blood sweat and tears and a demanding recruitment process. I\u2019ve had many, many panic attacks in this time, in fact I would say the build up to getting this job has been hell on Earth. \n\nI\u2019m due to start on Monday morning and here I am on Friday wondering how I\u2019m going to kill myself over the weekend. I cannot start this job, my entire body aches with adrenaline and fear. I can\u2019t walk into that room full of people and act like a normal person when I\u2019m not one. I used to have some resilience and I could hide myself, but I can\u2019t now. I simply panic. I cry. I leave. \n\nThe alternative is to let my family down, again, by cancelling something last minute. Something we know will help give us all a \u201cbetter life\u201d ie financial stability. \n\nI feel I\u2019m actually at the end of my rope now and can\u2019t take anymore of these crippling thoughts.",

Thank you very much if you read and/or respond.\n\nI've been making serious strides lately, so much so I was actually able to enjoy new years, and even felt optimistic about 2020 - I've been eating better, exercising. I've been really trying to reach out to friends, spend time with family, take care of myself, and so on. I actually felt like -- caring about life, I felt like I was just starting to remember what life was like before I was suicidal, and depressed. I felt like I was on track to start living again, and I feel like it's fucking been ripped away, and I've been stomped in the throat with the weight of the hope I had.\n\nI don't know if this is the right place but I NEED to fucking vent, it's scary how quickly these feelings have resurfaced. It's mortifying. Don't know what to do with myself or how to cope. . . I can't abstain from worrying.\n\nI imagine tensions rising and escalating into war, I see a draft coming, visualize myself being handed a gun and killing myself as soon as it's in my hands. All because the fucking \\*\\*impeached\\*\\* president of the U.S. decided to be trigger happy not even a half-week into the new year!! FUCK!!! I hate the world we live in, the inequality, the suffering and gross injustice, and when I try to enjoy my slice of life I am guilt ridden, why does this pussy who doesn't wanna be drafted get to have so much that others don't? I'm not even that well off generally speaking but there are hard working people out there who work so much fucking harder on a weekly basis than I have in my entire life; they deserve what I have and more. I hate that I have an excuse to kill myself and that I almost welcome it, and infuriates me to think it would be because of circumstances outside my control. Fuck you, fuck me, let me die. If you want me to kill it'll be myself.\n\nIf I go the conscientious objector route I fear that I will be crystallized as a coward in the eyes of everyone who knows me, and I will lose a great deal of respect - I would expect significant social ramifications. So, I could see that driving me to suicide as well.\n\nI'm a fucking loser, honestly, not employed or enrolled in scbool, don't even have a license. I'm not fat but now I want to be. Bone spurs? Nah, I've got dormant and fervent suicidal urges.\n\nI was going to exercise this morning until I heard the news last night, and then I stayed up late stress eating junk food instead. I've been trying to stop doing drugs but decided to break into my stash last night as well(only weed but I can see myself slipping into the worse vices again because of these immensely negative, uncontrollable feelings).\n\nIt's like, I was nearly there. I feel like I got a taste of happiness, contentness, whatever; \\*\\*I had a distinct lack of depression\\*\\* , lately.\n\nNow,  I want to sabotage my own life(which will make me super depressed) that I've been working really hard to fix so I won't get drafted(which would either make me super depressed or guaranteed to commit suicide.)\n\nThis is what the world is like, isn't it? Is it? Am I inhuman to desire a simple life where there is not the need to meddle in other's affair's, undisturbed? That's selfish as fuck, isn't it. \"I wish to experience no conflict, to be utterly neutral and at peace,\" is a selfish notion, I reckon.\n\nWhat the fuck, man.\n\nI was going to write about an ideal life, one I'd wish to be reincarnated in. Maybe as a self sustaining individual, living alone, with a small family or small community. . . but the pessimism is back, and again I wish nothing awaits. Because I feel that even in an ideal life as such, the worst, most repulsive and vile tendrils of humanity will find you, and wring you for all your worth whilst sapping all that brings you meaning.\n\nSometimes I wish I was ignorant to the news.",

My soul felt a yearning that drew the heaviest tears from my eyes I\u2019ve ever felt. I wanted to escape into the dark, in hopes I could find light somewhere again.\n\nI look back on my life and see nothing but lost innocence and happiness\u2014fully belly laughter that I wish with all my heart could fill my chest again. But it\u2019s like there is a hole draining the joy from my lungs, even when I should be at peace.\n\nI drove away in a stupor. Off to the store, then too afraid to walk in, I turned around and found myself in the only safe place I thought I had for months. \n\nI sat in my mom\u2019s car in the pools parking lot and watched as the time past. I sat there for hours and soon my phone died, and the lights at the pool were all that was left.\n\nI wanted to pull out, come around the side and drive straight into the gate. I wanted to drown in the water I felt safe in for so long. I wanted to die driving on the day I failed my driver\u2019s test, a little more irony to end my sad ironic life.\n\nIn some other timeline, I feel as though I did it\u2014 One where my spontaneity was just a hair stronger\u2014 because I don\u2019t feel the same anymore. \n\nSomething shattered.\n\nI felt the tears as they pulsed out of my eyes, but I didn\u2019t move. I didn\u2019t sob. The rock of weight stayed in the pit of my stomach, the tears were only the signs of my cracking. \n\nI got home and didn\u2019t speak. I laid in bed for the 2nd to last time before I would lose it, and I took enough cold medicine to knock me out cold. \n\nThere are signs everywhere that tell me to have hope\u2014to keep going\u2014but nothing in my life or body agrees.\n\nNot the stench from not being able to shower\u2014all my clothes packed in a bag, I can\u2019t bathe until I\u2019m moved out. \n\nNot the grease in my hair\u2014there\u2019s no one here to touch it, so what does it mater?\n\nNot the sickness in my head and stomach that nothing, not even the medicine has helped. \n\nNot the people around me, who only care when it\u2019s convenient, or to make themselves feel good. \n\n3:33 is supposed to mean hope. Stick to it and move forward. You are being guided, and all will be okay. But what if I\u2019ve spent years believing that? \n\nBelieving in God, and Jesus, now in God, the universe, and my own powers in intuition, what does it mater? If life always feels like this, there is no reason to continue. \n\nI don\u2019t remember the last time I felt okay.\n\n I don\u2019t remember the last time I felt fully safe. \n\nAnd if I were to guess, the last time I did, it was with someone who turned out to be lying to me. A cheater who destroyed my happiness. A person who couldn\u2019t care less about me, as long as it meant he didn\u2019t have to be alone. \n\nI no longer have a home.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\nI no longer have a home physically, emotionally, or spiritually. I can\u2019t even find a home within myself.\n\nI just want to be better.\n\nAnd I\u2019m starting to forget whether or not better is worth living through this.\n\nI\u2019m only 18, but all I hear from adults is that it only gets worse. \n\nWhy would I keep going.",

        "original": "I was never the happy kid. I have painfully vivid memories of being raped when I was a young kid. Other memories of having my head slammed against the wall or the floor, I even have a distinct memory of having a concussion one time from being slammed so hard against the ground that my head ended up bouncing and hitting the metal support on my bed. To this day, I'm scared of men, as a man myself.\n\nI....my first attempt to kill myself was around the time I was 10. I failed because I was an inexperienced kid. \n\nThe second time I tried to kill myself, was around the time I was 11. I was caught, I had a complete mental breakdown. My mom had me stay in the local mental hospital for a few days to try to get me some help. I opened up to the nice lady in there, but it didn't help. All it did was rationalize a fear of hospitals and the feeling that I was just some broken tool ready to be thrown away. But....that's also when I gave up on trying things in general. I stopped trying in school beyond the minimum effort required to pass, I stopped really associating with the few friends I did have in school.\n\nEverything was painfully mediocre for a few years until around the time I was 17. My parents had finally let me have some liberties after complaining for years that I never hung out with friends like they ever let me in the first place. Helped one of my school friends become one of my best friends once we were able to hang out outside of school and talk about the demons we have that we wouldn't dare share on school grounds, made us feel a sense of solidarity with one another. But then I also met this girl, she was the ex of one of our other friends, who himself kept trying to push us together. But as she put it, she didn't like black people like that, which crushed my heart a bit. So I sort of gave up on pursuing her at all and focused on being a friend instead, because I could always use more of those. Then she somehow ended up falling for me anyways and had one of our friends tell me. I went and asked her out after a birthday party, where it was just the two of us standing outside in the moonlight together. Sounds happy right? I thought so as well, until a few months passed and I found her cheating on me with another dude. I blamed myself for the entire thing, I didn't deserve to be loved. That ended up being attempt number three, but by this point I had a best friend that I could rely on to pull me back from myself.\n\nLife went so blissfully uneventful until around the time I was 19. I'd grown entirely discontent with the monotony of my life and hated every second of it. I planned to kill myself on Halloween of all days, banking on the hope that most people would just assume that I'm a decoration of some sort and not really care until it was too late. But instead, I ended up hitting it off with this really great girl and she distracted me from my demons. That otherwise would have been attempt number four.\n\nNow here I am, two years later. 2019 was such a clusterfuck of emotions and turmoil for me that I can't help but wonder how I survived at all. Some of my really close family started to die on me, my godmother who I loved more than most people died really young from cancer and that ruined me more than I thought it would. One of my role models ended up taking his life after a noticeable struggle with his mental health for the better part of a year. My physical health has started to take a dive off the deep end. I've got Crohn's, so some days it's a struggle to be able to get out of bed because of the pain. Sometimes it's too much of a struggle to even eat at all because I know that my stomach will throw an entire fit. Combine that with a constant stream of migraines and headaches and I ended up spending nearly every day in excruciating pain. People told me to get help all the time and I wanted to. But I couldn't afford insurance after aging out of my mom's, I was working a minimum wage job that would only ever schedule me part time and my premiums were always around $800 a month. I got denied for reductions and assistance, which forced me to choose eating and having a place to sleep over being able to fix my body at all. But then...I ended up getting a rape accusation levied against me. Mind you, from the person who claims it, I would have been 10 at the time that allegedly went place...and as someone who has always hated physical contact and was full of trauma, no one believed it aside from my crazy aunt. But, it made me remember all the memories of what had happened to me, memories that for so long I tried to lock away. It broke me all over again, made me more hateful and distrustful than I already was. Ended up affecting my performance at work because I was oftentimes depressive instead of my usual, fake cheery self. I physically didn't have the energy to keep up the act anymore. So some of the people in the company conspired to get me fired, which it worked. Then here I was...21, jobless, insuranceless, painfilled. The girl I hit it off with on Halloween? Decided right after I got fired that she didn't want to deal with my depression anymore and dumped me. Shattered my whole world, for she served as my light and hope for 2 years....made me feel a sense of happiness and belonging where I otherwise felt dead and unwanted. I reached out to the suicide prevention hotline on three separate occasions, they could make me feel better in the moment but not in the long run. By this point, my best friend and I have grown apart a lot. He found another group of friends that he vibes with more because they're more for recreational drug use while I stay sober because I have no idea how any of them might affect my already fractured psyche. \n\nDecember 31st, 2019. That was attempt number 5. I spent days in darkness and tears, wishing for a release from both the physical pain and mental anguish. I left the house so that I could run away somewhere and kill myself, but my cousin had caught wind of my plan and was waiting outside to stop me. I was forced to talk to my parents about what has been bothering me, where I as a 21 year old black man, broke down in a pile of tears on the floor and explained to them that I want to die and that even if it didn't happen that day, it would end up happening at some point in 2020.\n\nHere I am, 3 days later...and that sentiment has only gotten stronger for me. I don't know exactly when it will be, but I know that I won't make it through this year. My only hope is that I'll finally be free from a lifetime of pain. If there was another option that wasn't suicide, then I would welcome it, but at this point I feel as if I've exhausted every other option to no gain.\n\nThank you for hearing me out guys.",

My boyfriend and i got back together afterward. he put the pieces together and went off on them. two weeks of silence went by. they blocked me and ofc didnt care to apologize or say anything. I wasn't even blaming them at first. I just thought it must have been a mistake. Like I knew I had said from the beginning what my boundaries were with the guy. I told him I didn\u2019t want it. but i just thought maybe communication was fucked up bc we were drunk or something. idrk. my bf is the one who started saying rape and they freaked out at me and started playing the victims. They kept changing the story.

My last two girlfriends have been absolutely the coolest two girls I\u2019ve ever met. The first one we broke up mutually as I wanted to move for my work and and she wanted to move oppositely for school. (She\u2019s doing amazing and I\u2019m super proud of her.)

One of the absolute greatest humans ever and I just broke up with her. Almost literally just because.

Every thing was ordinary in my life until i got 6 years old then life started to go down. This was due to a serious incident i was a part of, had some serious injuries which came with depresion and start of self hatred and self harm. Few months go by i sort of recovered and the only problem that i had was depresion. Over next 5years tried to get rid of depression, went to dozens of different therapists sadly it didnt help and life got even worse for me.\n\nIn 2012 my father got diagnosed with kidney cancer.  2more years passed me and my father were fighting our problems i found a friend that helped me a lot and finaly found enough courage to ask out a girl i liked. 2015 on Christmas my father got hospitalized and his diagnosis was even worse then before because now it also affected his lungs and he was unable to work and provide to the family anymore. So i started to work to help my mother to provide for the family and by that time my depression got even worse because i barely sleep didn't have time for myself.\n2016 December my only friend i mentioned before commits suicide, few months pass and its now 2017 my father dies due to his condition, by this point i was in a bad position and my gf left me i was shattered to pieces thought to end my life but i lacked courage back then another 2 years passed and i have developed an alchohol addiction tried to kill myself multiple times  and this is how iam in such a terrible spot in life",

I know i can count on them, but talking to them or spending time with them don't help. I feel loneliness, social isolation, sadness, anxiety, all the time. I've been suicidal before, but my mother managed to fuck things up with my psychologist appointments (free social program) she doesn't think such things exist, and she tried to find my medication all the time to throw away. she's a very evil woman sometimes, i think she's an bipolar, but anyway.  \ni work as a dog groomer but i had to leave my job in september to take care of my dog, he got extremely ill and i spent all my savings to take him to the vet. he's 14, but i just couldn't fail him. i barely have money to buy food or pay my bills now, and my mother most of the time isn't even home.\n\nshe's been out since dec 21, which was the last time i spoke with anyone in person. i was alone in christmas and new year, just taking care of my dog and stuff.

I just don't know what to do. I can't go find another job, i'm worried that my only friend will soon pass away, i can't make new friends, i don't want to leave my house, i don't have any money, and i'll probably go bankrupt pretty soon since i've been using my credit card to buy food for my pets. \n\nHas anyone ever been in that kind of situation?

So if I think of suicide, I already know how to do it.\n\nMy doctor and psychologist know how I feel and it isn\u2019t at the point where I need to be hospitalized. For me, the only thing hospitalization can provide is keeping me safe, and thus, for when I\u2019m in imminent danger. Beyond that, it actually causes harm to my life and puts a big burden on me financially and in my school and work life with providing no therapeutic benefit and making me feel worse. \n\nThings that should make me happy, like thinking of meeting my niece and nephew for the first time, just make me feel really sad and I don\u2019t know why. Even writing this makes me tear up.\n\nI\u2019ve felt this way for a while, and it\u2019s only getting worse. Everything going on in my life are things that the natural and healthy response would be to feel hurt and pain. But it happens more frequently than it does for most, who may never experience some of this. It isn\u2019t passing. Those problems have lasted a long time.\n\nI have ptsd from people who I thought were my friends spreading rumors about me. I stopped drinking and lost my best friend who I had had feelings for. I took time off from hanging out with this group because they made me feel uncomfortable afterwards so I decided to focus on myself and let wounds heal. People assumed I had been drinking because of my feelings for which wasn\u2019t true. Soon, they took things that I had told them in confidence about insecurities about love and sexuality, stemming from surviving a rape attempt and experiencing trauma as a kid, and started telling people I was predatory and essentially an incel. When I really understood how extensive the rumors had become and how damaging they had been to my life, that was when I first I guess \u201cbroke\u201d but it got worse as they gaslit me about it as I tried to get them to stop and fix things somewhat. Of course, they weren\u2019t my friends.\n\nI had panic attacks many times a day, was crying in public, and essentially lost control of my bowels because there would be little warning and I\u2019d have diarrhea. My therapist, hearing that I felt like the world was pushing me to the edge and out of it, like I was being forced to live a life so painful the only option was suicide, he began encouraging me to embrace it \u2014 even when I pushed back and said I wanted help to get out of this mess and feel better. He wouldn\u2019t. Started telling me to embrace it, and so on.\n\nI did have one friend who stuck through it with me and she didn\u2019t have to because I hadn\u2019t known her that long. Someone who you kind of immediately click with and become best friends with. Eventually, I did develop feelings for her but she doesn\u2019t know.\n\nAnyways I don\u2019t think we\u2019re friends anymore \u2014 not because of that but because she was doing something really upsetting and inappropriate in our friendship and I told her it was hurting. I\u2019ve extended an olive branch twice but she hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. It feels like last year is happening again.\n\nThose old people who I thought were friends are acting volatile and last I checked were coming close to starting to spread rumors about me again online. No one believed me last year because they respect those people. Already I have experienced negative repercussions from them again in December.\n\nI also saw that former therapist again after being assured they would ensure I would never encounter him again.\n\nI never recovered since this started last year but did make gains. I go to therapy \u2014 a good therapist \u2014 I see a doctor and am compliant with my medication. I don\u2019t drink or so drugs. I exercise. I\u2019m doing everything right but it doesn\u2019t matter and having been in therapy for almost ten years and making big changes, what I learned after last year and since then is that it isn\u2019t me anymore. There\u2019s nothing wrong with me anymore that is causing people to treat me this way. What my friend was doing is totally out of character for her, and I see her treating her other friends better (though I\u2019ve muted her on social media for now), and even those other friends who weren\u2019t friends don\u2019t do this to others. And of course it isn\u2019t my fault that my therapist did that to me (he also sexually harassed me).\n\nPlease trust me when I say that these things are not things I brought on, and that I know it isn\u2019t some big character flaw I have. I wish it was so I could fix it. I can\u2019t stop all these things from happening again and they aren\u2019t stopping or won\u2019t. I\u2019ve also tried for the whole year to make more friends and new friends and it\u2019s like everyone thinks I am a good likeable person but doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me\n\nI feel trapped and I can\u2019t do this much longer. Even if I weren\u2019t to go through with suicide, it shouldn\u2019t get so bad I end up in the hospital. None of this has to happen but people always put their needs and values about my well being or want to compromise, even when it requires so little from them. Or assuming the worse of me.

        "original": "I'm in High school right now and can't see why I should move on. (I'm on a throwaway) and I've suffered with depression almost my entire life but have tried to hide it from everyone. For the most part I've just been told to \"man up\" or to stop being \"dramatic\". It hurts when the people closest to you can't even take you seriously. I was reported in junior high school because of suicidal signs but did my best to play it off because I did not want trouble from my family or attention towards the \"disease\" that I may be diagnosed with. The same year my family was having serious problems which I won't go into detail here and I did my best to let things not get to me. After this horrible year and a summer filled with angry parents and new problems, I decided that I was inferior to everyone at my school and interacted only with close friends. Even in classes that required participation I felt extremely self conscious sharing my thoughts in and the teachers eventually figured out and exempted me from participation. I didn't interact with anyone else at my school and life was honestly stale. I had conversations and thoughts and jokes in my own head and shared them with usually only myself. I just felt like I was missing something that so many other people seemed to have and I know a lot of suicidal people felt that way. But what was that thing I was missing? I was tall, slim, blue-eyed, brown-haired guy with a good sense of humor, good hygiene, and a love for people. I loved everyone in my school. Even people that made me mad I still was glad they were alive. I decided to blame my insecurities on the fact that my family had little money. All the people in the area I grew up in had complete lives because they didn't have to worry about affording a little Caesars pizza once a week. Or they didn't have to worry about where they'd be getting money from for school events or sports. And to a certain degree, I still agree that many of my peers in the area were happier because of the opportunities money gave them. I'm not saying that my family was broke, but city life is expensive for sure. Both my parents were working around the clock and neither of them have ever had any money-robbing addictions like gambling, drinking, smoking, chewing etc. so I couldn't understand where the money was going. At some point, my sadness turned to anger. I suddenly started hating rich people in my community. Hating people who I deemed spoiled. Hating people who had things I could only dream of who got it just from being someone's kid. It made me feel like I was less than someone because I wasn't someone's kid. At the time I was only depressed. No serious intentions of suicide. However, my house was sold to a different landlord one day over a summer and the next thing I know my family decides to move. Far away :/. I lose all my friends which I had spent 5 years with ( I had gone to other schools previously) and lose everything which seems comfortable to me. I move out into the country into a small town with nothing to do. No friends, no cellular reception, and a faint smell of horse poop floating around the town once a week. I decided that life in this new town would be different. That this would be a new chapter for me, and at first, it was. I spent a few weeks with my grandparents who lived in the town while my parents worked things out back in the old house. I rode my bike around the small town and honestly for once smiled at how life might be turning around. Before school started I told myself I had to be social for the weeks prior to school and the beginning weeks of school. Talk to anyone and everyone because first impressions matter :). School starts and I love it. I meet new people, learn new things, make new friends, oh yeah, and for the first time ever have the confidence to talk to girls. I talk to a lot of girls and at first they were my only friends (I'm straight BTW so this was cool) but eventually expanded and found really good friends who talk and act and think how I do. I became not only friends with the popular kids, but I became a popular kid. Girls liked me, other popular kids thought I was cool, and everything seemed so fun. Like I was in control of my own life for once. Eventually homecoming came around the corner and I decided to take advantage of my new popularity and asked out a cute girl. (I'm surprised that I had the balls to do that LOL) I felt in control. Things got bad fast though. Like many high school crushes, you only know what you know about someone from what you've heard in class. I thought she was pretty and she acted cute in a way. So we texted back and forth and called and snapped and sent each other funny stuff on Instagram and what for a while. We talked in class and after school all night sometimes. I hung out with her at football games and at bake sales and all sorts of things. We started talking a little more seriously and one night I looked her in the eyes and asked her if she could be my girlfriend. (Again where did I have the balls to do this??) Of course she agreed to date the cute new boy. It was great at first. We talked even more, we sent each other cute couple quotes on Instagram, we talked about life and school and things we wanted to do and places we wanted to go. She seemed like the one. Of course I was blinded by love, but at the time she felt perfect. She could cook and dance and sing, I was good at technical stuff and making her laugh, you know. I gave her hoodies and we sat by each other whenever we could. It was great, but a few things got in the way. Neither of us liked the others friends very much. She admitted this first and I agreed that she had a few friends which really got on my nerve. But nothing really changed from this. We loved each other. Then we started disagreeing, and arguing, and eventually I realized that the only reason I liked her was because she was beautiful, and even at a young age I knew that that would end up being toxic. I really wanted to break up with her but I didn't. No balls. I was afraid that she would hurt herself or do something stupid if I did that because she threatened it several times. One night at a football game, I planned to meet her. Prior to dating her, I developed a nicotine addiction as many highschoolers do and of course she didn't like that. So this particular night, I was at the game and a few buddies met me and started offering me stuff which I am proud to say I denied. I wanted this to be a good night and I was super happy that I had won against an addiction (my descendants have suffered from many addictions throughout their time so my genes were hard wired to always say yes) and was super excited to see her. The problem was, she had a lot of friends who were guys, that made me very very jealous. When one of the guys told me he was jealous of me and started getting handsy with her I immediately got super pissed. I look at her in the eyes and try to get her to understand the situation. She didn't get it. After a few minutes, she realizes something's wrong. She went in for a hug but I pushed her away. She then told me something about how she was going to go walk around since I \"didn't want her\" and I said \"fine\". I watched her walk away. I knew in the back of my mind that she would come back. She would look back, smile, and come running back to me. Instead, she just kept walking. I thought \"I'm not falling for it.\" As she walks away and disappears from my view. So I waited. 5 Minutes go by. Then 10. Then 15. I start talking to the \"handsy guy\" because although I hated him inside I knew that he wasn't meaning harm towards me and only wanted the best for me. He gave me some decent advice (about the best advice a high school guy can give anyways) and eventually helped me to work up the courage to go find her and tell her how I felt. I eventually found her, at a table surrounded by some of her girlfriends. I got her to come talk to me alone and told her how I felt. \"I can't have other guys being with you like that. Tonight could have been great but it was ruined. If you're going to be okay with other guys doing stuff regarding you, I might as well leave.\" or something along those lines. She looks at me in the eyes and says \"okay fine. leave.\" I look her in the eyes for a few seconds and then turn away. \"Fine. I'll leave. And I won't come back.\" I storm out the gate and start walking. It was very cold that night. So cold that the broken tears dripping down my face cut into my skin. It was very dark. It was very late. I walked and walked. And as I walked, I thought many things to myself. \"She's too good for me anyways.\" \"There are so many better guys\" \"I'm not worth it\" \"I can't compete\" \"Nobody loves me.\" As I thought these things, I knew where I wanted to be. I disregarded the cold and went straight for the bridge above the highway. I never thought that I would get to this point. I looked over the drop and thought to myself how easy it would be to cast myself over and leave all my troubles behind. Every pain that I ever felt emotionally would finally leave me in peace. I unfortunately just stood there thinking too long because my dad drove down the road and honked the horn. I quickly got away from the obviously suspicious spot and crossed the street and hopped into the car. As always, I play it off and say something like \"Oh, I was just going on a walk and my phone died.\" I get home and immediately go on my phone and start texting her about how I felt and how I wish I had jumped. She just told me some bs about how \"cutting makes the pain go away\" and how she had cut herself because she thought we were going to break up. (See what I mean now.) I hated this but I decided I'd give it a shot. If it would take my pain away then I was willing to try it. I snuck downstairs and grabbed a knife and started going away at my skin. I went until it got red and nearly started bleeding when I realized I was just making it worse and how stupid it was to do something like this. Anyways, we got back on track eventually and she invited me to her birthday party at her house. I am not rich, nor will I probably ever be rich if I keep living, but I saved up some money and bought her this beautiful 10 carrot gold heart necklace for her birthday. (Doesn't sound like a lot but for a highschooler it meant a lot.) I went to her house with her annoying friends and animals that I was allergic to and we play games and eat food and have fun. Eventually we open gifts and she opens mine. I see her heart melt. She was so thankful for me and the present I got for her. I thought we would last forever. Again things took a bad turn. She started becoming double-minded about things I won't go into detail on and eventually just dumped ME. I was very thankful at the time because she was really getting on my nerves at this point but I didn't want her to hurt herself again. It was a good break from something so utterly toxic. Then I started missing her and tried to win her back but nothing worked and eventually after a few weeks I got over her. Fast forward to current times, my parents are constantly yelling at me, arguing, and controlling me. They won't let me see friends I want to see or do things that I want to do. Every time that I win an argument it's just because I'm \"disrespectful\" or something silly. It hurts me to think that I'm alone in every way possible about how I feel. I feel like I have nobody to go to. Nobody to take me seriously. That's why I wanted to share this with strangers online. I don't want anyone I know to be burdened or think less of me. I know that I'm young but I already want to die very badly. I am relieved when I think at night about myself being dead. I get a comfort from it. The last few days I've been considering it more and more with my parents being controlling and angry. There is nothing to do in this small town except walk around and get into drugs. I need help but I don't want help. I want to die. I don't want to be a burden. I want to die. My problem with killing myself is not of things here. I have nothing to lose. My problem is where I would go after death. Like what happens. I have grown up in a strong christian family who has taught that suicide victims go directly to hell, don't pass go or get $200 etc. I believe less and less that a God cares anyways because of how my life seems to be moving. I need someone to explain to me what happens after death and if I will be eternally punished for not wanting to live. Thanks for reading this to anyone who is. There are a lot of other reasons I feel this way but I didn't want to make this any longer than it already is. Please take me seriously. It's all I want.",

Couple months ago they tripled my dose (effexor), but it's not really helping. I am finding myself less and less useful and pretty much all i do is to listen music and cry on my way to home each day. Talking hours with my mother and then back to crying. I'm a 34 years old baby. \n\nI've been lonely for a while now. I've been a hard working person. Good job. Good pay. Good wife. I never took granted for the things I have... I worked hard for them. I've accomplished so many things, with the support of my loved ones... Then I let myself go a bit and things started to fall apart. My 10 years of life partner, best friend, lover, my everything decided to finish our marriage while being in different continents, over phone. Shortly after that I failed saving the most intelligent person whom I've deemed as my little brother. I tried everything in my power to get him back on his feet. He preferred to end his life by OD. A month ago, i learned that my mother likely to have cancer, although it is not confirmed yet. \n\nMeanwhile, my closest friends did not want to get involved, and I sympathize with them. They did so out of respect. That said, i started to lose touch. As for our aquantences, whoever my wife reached out they have just shown me their worse faces. My wife has shown nothing but a narcissistic behavior since her decision. Lies in a point where I raped her, raised my hand to her while in reality I was incapable of harming any living being yet alone hurting my dearest... I can't wrap my head around how could she can say something like this to court while saying to me how precious our time together a year ago. I am a low key aspie. I have social anxiety, and in our social circle I'm sitting silent in my corner and lately I can't think anything but to end my life, and a final expression by my note and the act of suicide while opening all our private talks, notes, messages in public. Not that it will change anything, as fundamentally I believe universe will stay indifferent. I want to do it because I can't find any other way to express myself. I find myself ugly, worthless, undignified. abused. I am so disconnected. I'm not a spiritual person, but lately I haven't experienced not even a single good thing in last 8 months and I can't help but think the reason all this happening is just for me to finally let myself go, for good.",

        "original": "The last couple months have been rough... It feels like everything in my life is falling apart and I\u2019m just watching it happen, alone and paralyzed. I quit my job in an abrupt and dramatic fashion. I just barely scraped by in my classes at community college and I\u2019m fairly certain one of my instructors passed me out of pity. My best friend stopped talking to me, but she was also my ex so that shouldn\u2019t have hurt me as much as it did. My living situation became unstable. I relapsed on Christmas and again a couple days after. During a blackout I broke my big toe, inadvertently cut and sprained my wrist, and blacked one of my eyes. I could list so many reasons why my life is not my favorite thing right now but I\u2019ll leave the rest to the imagination for the moment.  All that really matters is that I can\u2019t stop thinking about not existing. I\u2019ve always thought that I was too much of a coward to kill myself but now, it\u2019s rare that a day passes without me imagining passing with it.  \n\nYesterday, I was laying in bed, listening to the muffled sounds of my roommate fucking my ex through my apartment\u2019s paper thin walls and staring at my swollen foot propped up in front of me and I just kept thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t want to exist\u201d over and over. Normally, I would have gone for a walk to get out of the apartment, and my head, but it would have been a painful walk with my foot in the state it was. Drinking myself into a hospital bed or better, was also an appealing proposition but, I wasn\u2019t sure I could manage the walk to the bar, so I gave up on that prospect as well. Again, I thought about not existing. Thought about one bridge that spans the river in particular. But I couldn\u2019t get there. It was a pathetic feeling to say the least. I cried, motionless for what felt like hours.  \n\nAfter some time passed like that, I stopped crying and an unexpected thought popped into my head, \u201cI haven\u2019t played my guitar in... well, in a while.\u201d So I decided that that is what I was going to do, play some music. I couldn\u2019t get to a bridge and I couldn\u2019t get to a bar but music might be able to clear some of these thoughts and my guitar was right there in the closet. So that\u2019s what I did, I played nearly nonstop, early into the next morning. I even recorded a few songs on my phone and dusted off my old SoundCloud profile. \n\nI guess the reason I\u2019m posting this is, I\u2019ve seen a lot of people on here (I lurk a lot but very rarely post myself) say that they are willing to listen if people need someone to talk to.  Well, I wanted to share the few songs I recorded with someone but I don\u2019t have anyone to share them with so I was wondering if anyone was interested in listening to them or if I\u2019m even allowed to ask that here. \n\nI can post the link, if that\u2019s an okay thing to do and if anyone thinks they could hazard the listen. (It\u2019s just a handful of covers, mostly Bright Eyes.)\n\nAnyway, thanks",

I hate being single and I am terrified of being alone. I have friends but I'm so bad at keeping up with people and I can't drive so I can't go anywhere to hang out. I'm always too exhausted from work to do anything anyway, all I do now is sleep and work. I'm so ugly and fat and I feel ashamed whenever I eat and I just wish I could be skinny but I never have the energy to work out and restricting calories isn't working because I keep binge eating on junk food that only makes me feel good for 5 seconds and then I want to throw it all back up. If my partner breaks up with me nobody else will want me because of how hideous and overweight I am. I vowed to never attempt suicide after my last hospitalization but I attempted last year and didn't tell anybody, nobody knows. And I would be so temped to kill myself if it didn't mean leaving my partner behind and hurting him because I can't manage myself.

I have cerebral palsy and I use a wheelchair and I need a personal assistant to help with things like getting dressed, showering, going to the bathroom. At the moment, my parents fill in because we can't get one from the government. It's really isolating because it means that outside of college, I can't really do much except stay in the house and write or go somewhere with my parents in tow.  I'd love to go abroad and do all the things that guys my age do. I'm really into languages so I'd like to go to Germany and practice my German, or teach  English in Japan.   But obviously, I can't drag my parents everywhere. \n\nA few weeks ago, we got a visit from someone in the government for an  assessment and they said that personal assistant hours were rarely funded and they usually did home care- someone coming to your house and just helping you with the basics but no actually going out into the community like a personal assistant would and supporting you in a job, or in the community.  We were told that PA hours were off the table because the health service has no money. \n\nSo this has kinda sent me into a downward spiral.

I feel like my brain is just stuck on a track having the same 5 thoughts over and over again. \"You are worthless. Do your job.  Why can't you do anything? Fucking worthless. End it.\" I used to be extremely social, but I've ruined every friendship ive had from being non communicative because I think everyone hates me. No friends. Bad self esteem. I dont know why I feel this way. I had some bad things happen as a kid, but who doesn't? And I put myself in a great position to be happy and i'm squandering it. Literally just all day at my job not doing a thing. If I get 1 going done a day I call it a success but it's only a matter of time until i'm fired. I just have no motivation all the time and the last week or so ive been getting dangerously close to ending it. I dont know what to do.",

It started at the start of the year when i got laughed at for being too skinny and weak (im a boy). So I started training but i would still get called sensitive, and twiggy was my nickname. I would also add the my BMI was around 18 so I was skinny but not unhealthy like i didnt look like a skeleton or anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen it pretty much stopped being that and me realising I had no actual friends, n I didn't like going out the house to see friends, but when I didn't I felt lonely. And every now n then I did go out but I didnt enjoy it. I have never talked to any of my friends about my feelings, even though they are sound n they probs would respect me i just don't wanna come off like a pussy.\n\nI would constantly feel like there was lit no point. I didnt like myself, my friends were having just as good a time as before, but without me, I felt like I didnt matter. I cut for the first time n they were like tiny ones with a knife which i do still have faint scars like 6 months later but u have to look. I also took a load of pills, and called childline the next day. They got worried about me, n called the police who called MY PARENTS. The worst thing I wanted to happen to me. I stopped cutting around June n felt like I was getting better (I think i only did like 4 cuts so far like it wasnt like my arm was littered. Then around july I had another wave of depression where my best girl mate who I talked about this shit w her said she cant be friends cos its confusing but baso she wasnt blaming me n i thought she wasnt being a dick but in heindsight she was. Anyways I started cutting more serious on my thigh like every other night until one night, after being on holiday in scotland for a week without cutting, I got home and accidentally did either a really deep cut or I hit a vein n there was blood everywhere. It wasnt like full on squirting on the walls but it was like pouring down my leg. Baso it scared the crap out of me n I havnt cut since. I am finally beginning to feel a bit better, I still have no actual friends to talk to about stuff which is why im doing this post but I come to accept I can't kill myself as I could never explain it to my parents.

        "original": "I\u2019ve always had depressive phases. Ever since I was 9 I\u2019ve had 3 months where I\u2019m super depressed, and 3 months of numbness. I tried to kill myself for the first time at 11, and I continued trying every so often until I was 13. I gave up. It was useless. I continually tried to hang myself, but it was useless. Rope snapped, light fixtures fell down, people found me. It\u2019s been so painful.\n\nThe past 2 years were arguably the best in my life. I had started to gain what I thought were good friends, I had people supporting me, i got my current girlfriend. Everything goes ok for a bit, then I failed the requirements to get into my A-Levels last summer. I was so distraught. I did hours upon hours of hard, effective revision every day, and the highest GCSE grades I got was a 5.\n\nRecently I lost my virginity, and I was happy, but I couldn\u2019t finish. Turns out there\u2019s something wrong with me, like anxiety related, which prevents me from finishing at all. That made me want to kill myself again, because what\u2019s the point of me staying here if I can\u2019t even procreate, my literal only life purpose.\n\nI told my best friend we had sex, and he was happy for me, but then he told my girlfriend I told him, before I got the chance to tell her. So she flipped. And oh my god was that an argument. I thought I had lost her, and by the end of it she said if she didn\u2019t want to lose me completely, then she would\u2019ve broken it off. \n\nI\u2019m not able to talk to anybody around me about anything when I need to rant or let off steam, and recently my girlfriends seemed off with me. I\u2019ve recently been able to finish during sex now, and I was so happy. On the 30th of December 2019, she told all her friends I lasted less than 5 minutes last time. Bear in mind I fucked her for hours the first, second, and third time, because I never finished. And she didn\u2019t mention I went for round 2 after those 5 minutes.\n\n31st of December 2019, New Year\u2019s Eve party with a whole load of people. Roast session. Most comments were on my hair, then I roasted my \u201cbest friend\u201d, and his response was telling everyone else at the party that I last less than 5 minutes. Not fun.\n\nI can\u2019t confide in him. Nor his girlfriend. Nor my friend, who\u2019s also my girlfriends friend. And other than those people, I have my girlfriend, who I can no longer confide in safely.\n\nI have nobody to trust, nobody to hang out with, nobody who likes me. I\u2019m the scum of the earth, a compulsive liar, I pretend to be someone I\u2019m not, I smoke excessively, and I spend more time with my girlfriend than my friends and family combined. I\u2019m going to kill my self, but I know I\u2019ll be too scared to try again. If I were never born everything would\u2019ve been better, but because I was, I\u2019m going to have to kill my self to solve my problems. And I\u2019m too scared to do that, but I have no other choice. I wish people could keep their mouths shut. I wish people could consider other people. I wish I could trust. I wish it would just end already.\n\nI can\u2019t cry anymore. I\u2019m not able to. Physically, whenever I start to cry then my body yawns and I stop crying. I just wish I could cry to let it out, but I can\u2019t.\n\nThis is the beginning of my first depressive phase this year, I can tell because I no longer feel numb, just upset. I\u2019m scared of what\u2019s going to happen to me. I\u2019m scared to keep on living.",

Not abused, but I never felt like I could Express myself at home. I felt invisible, and still do. I know my mom cares and the rest of my family too, but if I said something I'm afraid they think I'm a liar. So at a young age I became the best actor I ever known. School wasn't easy, no friends. Last year I got my first \"real\" friend, or what felt like it. But I dont want to drag her into my problems so I distance myself, and the same goes for everyone I know. I had to endorse years of bullying, from pre kinder to who knows . I still feel socially excluded. \nFor the record, I have Autism and Hashimoto disease, which went undiagnosed for a time. Not having friends, being bullied and having issues that weren't take care of made me lose faith I'm everyone. I dont think this is my body or life anymore, I view my memories is third person. I can't trust anyone, everyone is out there to get me. I feel it. I never had stable friendships, I had trouble with feelings to the point I'm emotionally blind, unable to tell if I'm doing wrong. And then feel anxious for the fear of making a mistake, letting my ward down, and get hurt again. Every time I trusted someone they would let my down. I heard voices, saw people that others couldn't. I could feel them take over, they could move and talk in this body. I also have constant nightmares,  usually wasn't so bad, but lately is has gotten worse, like mutilations,  animal cruelty and murder, and I get to presence that in front of my eyes, it sucks. This is not my body. I want a life, a real one. My life may not look bad from the outside, but sometimes it just hits me, I feel numb almost all the time and Bam, I feel my chest hurt, and silent tears. I feel horrible and can't tell why. I'm really sceptical about therapy actually helping, I can't trust my therapist so what can they do? Sometimes beliefs I have can control my life, I'm scared. Sometimes, according to the psychologist I went to, when I was 11-12, told me I had maniac episodes. They thought I was bipolar, but the psychiatrist said I have Aspergers.

        "original": "This probably going to be a long post. \n\nI literally have no one but my boyfriend in my life. I am close to no one else. My parents are shitty - my dad doesn't keep in contact with me and my mum only messages me when she wants money or to use me, either to bitch about my sister or to talk about her new boyfriend (yea, my parents recently got divorced. One day, my mum decided that my dad was controlling and manipulative, so she filed for divorce. She lied that he used to beat her. Apparently my mum was cheating on my dad with 3 guys aswell...i dunno. My dad is no angel either. He does have some controlling behaviour, and anger issues). My parents are questionable people. They once called the police to hack my tablet at home (they told them I had gone missing and was doing drugs???) and they found messages between me and a friend (who I'll mention later on) talking about suicide. So they go searching for me and find me (I was with some friends, and my parents knew about it), and take me home. My parents grounded me for a while. \n\nI do have siblings - a half sister who doesn't keep in contact, a younger sister who I occasionally talk to but we don't have the kind of relationship where I could vent my problems etc, and a little brother who is too young to understand what I'm feeling. I do adore my younger brother, though. I've been very close to him until I moved away for uni. \n\nI used to have a cool group of friends at sixth form, I could be open with them about my issues, and I enjoyed hanging out with them. When we went off to different unis, none of them but one kept in touch. And the only one who kept in touch ended up backstabbing me. She really hurt me. I still remained friends with her for a while, but she was a toxic person and several people told me it'd be best to cut her off. So I did.\n\nI did have one really close friend back in a small town I used to live in. She too struggled with depression, and we were really open with each other about it. Mid GCSEs, my parents decide to get rid of the house and make us move elsewhere, dragging me away from the one good friend I had. When we moved, we stayed in a BnB, while looking for a house. My good friend and her mother even visited, because she missed me so much. My family were only there for a week, until we were kicked out because my father couldn't pay the bill. So we were homeless. My friend said her mother wanted to just take me and my siblings back to our old town, but of course that'd be classed as kidnapping. We were given emergency housing. We didn't have furniture for a few days, it was all in some storage place. We had no heating or hot water. I had to sleep on the floor and use my coat as a blanket. It was a horrible time. When we got our furniture, we had to wait a month to get wifi. My friend and I wrote physical letters to keep in touch. I am still in touch with this friend but we have grown apart over the years. She has her own problems and has a baby on the way - I can't make her worried over me. \n\nI haven't been able to make any close friends at uni. I suppose I have some people you could call a friend, but we're not properly close in any way. They know nothing personal about me, and I still have big issues with initiating and keeping convos with them (I have social anxiety). I have tried other ways to make friends. I even made a post in a reddit here, but I got a lot of dms and I got too overwhelmed and ended up ghosting everyone. Besides, it felt forced, and not natural. \n\nMy upbringing wasn't the worst, but it certainly wasn't good either. My parents' families hated each other so we never spent any time with them - my grandparents on both sides much preferred our cousins. My parents had a lot of financial issues - my dad was even declared bankrupt. We always struggled for food, and I never got to do cool things other kids did. My parents never bothered to spend much time with me. For example, when I started school I was very behind in reading compared to everyone else, because my parents wouldn't even read to me. I managed to find a passion for reading as a kid, and caught up in a few years, even surpassing a lot of the others. I got bullied all the way through school, aswell. Mostly for having glasses, being quiet, having small boobs, not having expensive clothing and for doing well in school. \n\nI didn't have a romantic relationship until I was 17. Before that, I had only been \"intimate\" with one man. And it was something I didn't want. It was the first time I had ever got drunk, and my friend left me with someone I didn't know...next thing I knew, he was touching my genitals. Anyway, I seemed to have hit puberty later than other females. For a while I struggled with my sexual and gender identity. I felt less feminine than others, because of my small boobs and different interests. I was very conflicted and it took a few years to figure out. When I eventually came out as bisexual (I didn't plan to, but my sister found my diary and told my mum, and she told my dad even though she promised not to), my dad was rather upset with me. He is a bit homophobic. My mum's family also slated me for it. \n\nSo, my first relationship was not good. My ex was 10 years older than me (yes, it sounds so bad now, but I was naive and just wanted love ok). It was an online relationship and we met in a game, where we had been in the same guild for over a year. He did raise major red flags in the beginning, as he asked me for nudes not even 2 days into dming me. I refused of course, and he wasn't very happy, but he got over it. We were together for 6 months, until he finally broke up for me because of my anxiety. It was a toxic relationship. He often made me \"make it up\" to him for any argument we had, by threatening to break up with me if I didn't send him nudes. He didn't want to tell anyone about us, but he wanted me to make sure all the people in our guild knew I was off-limits. He'd often compare me to his ex, talking about how attractive she was, etc. He belittled me and didn't take my emotions seriously, even laughing at me when we argued. He did all he could to stop me from talking to friends and other people, but he hated spending time with me. He lied often. He cheated on me. It took a while to get over the relationship. I didn't think I could love again, and then unintentionally I found my current boyfriend.\n\nI've had depression and anxiety since about 13 years old (that was when I was first diagnosed as a result of my sister discovering I was self harming, so my parents took me to the doctors). I've been in and out of therapy and counselling, trying different types. One therapist was meant to see me twice a week, but she only saw me like once a month as she always had other emergencies. I couldn't open up to her so she discharged me from the service. I have only properly attempted suicide back in May 2015, where I took an overdose. I certainly did not take enough to do any major damage. I have planned to take my own life many times after that, I even wrote out a bulletproof plan to hang myself. I never went through with it of course. \n\nI'm currently in my second year at uni. I have almost no contact with any of my family. I have no close friends. I only have my boyfriend. I struggled a lot with severe depression, loneliness and anxiety during the first year of uni. Towards the end of the year I was not going to any lectures. It was a surprise how I got decent grades.\n\nAt the beginning of second year, I had a depression session and cut myself extremely deep. I should have went to the hospital really, but I am living with someone who wants to be a doctor. I saw all the blood and the fat on my arm, the deepness of the cut, and panicked. I messaged her telling her I needed some aid. She fixed me right up, but after that, she'd sometimes message me saying \"you're not slicing yourself again, are you?\" which wasn't nice to hear.\n\nThe start of year 2 has been bad. I had no income for a while (my parents decided to dawdle with my loan application so I had no money, as I don't rely on them for any financial support). I couldn't pay rent. I ate little so I could save as much money as possible. I got a part time job just to make ends meet, even though I'm not mentally in a place to work right now. I missed an exam. I've been in and out of the uni wellbeing service, and trying different meds and dosages. Nothing is fucking working. Nothing is getting better. \n\nSo yeah, I have my boyfriend. He's the only thing stopping me from doing something bad. I want to hurt myself so bad, but he'd be distraught if he found out, and I couldn't do that to him. Usually I tell him how I'm feeling, but he is currently asleep and I am alone with these thoughts. Thinking about a future with him keeps me going. But at the same time, I feel like a burden to him. I have all these issues that he doesn't understand. I've hurt him emotionally several times because of my depression (no, not by being abusive or anything. Just when he has found out that I cut myself or something, it upsets him). We do have a stable, healthy, happy relationship otherwise. But I don't know how much longer I can fight the demons in my head. I've been trying to get better for years, but nothing has improved. I just seem to be getting worse. I don't know how and if I should tell my boyfriend that I really do not want to exist anymore. I don't know what to do. And if I were to keep living, what's to stop my boyfriend from leaving me in a few months or years time? Then I'd have just suffered for nothing.\n\nPlease help me.",

I'm gonna give some background context to help make things clearer. \n\nI am ex-army, one track for a bachelors in electronic engineering and was in training to become a officer in the army. However during the first quarter of this year, I ran into complications and ended up trying to end my life on 2 separate occasions. Including self harm, I was hospitalised 3 times in a month. I ended up seeking help. \n\nI quit the army, I quit university and moved back home. I got a good job and a amazing girlfriend. Everything that I worked for 4 year went down the drain. I got professional help and kept clean. I use to abuse alcohol as an escape.\n\nI was nearly a year clean. My problem now; I fucked my self. I originally started talking to a girl who I will call S. S was a amazing person, whoever she kept cancelling dates on me. We had a few but after a while we stopped. We barley talked anymore. I gave up on her even tho it hurt. \nI started talking to a girl I will call C. C is my current girlfriend. She's chill and amazing. But the issue at hand is that S started talking to me again.\n\nI explain to C what happened to me and S. The issue with S is she has severe heart problems that if not sorted will result in her death at a young age. Pretty much, i felt guilty about splitting away from S to get with C. Where S could die anyday, I treated S like my gf whilst I was with C. C was alright with this as she wants S to be happy. But I feel shitty. \n\nWhat do I do? If I Leave C for S, S will feel shit and theres no guarantee things will go great. But if I stop things with S, who has no friends and a complicated family issue, C will feel bad and if S were to pass I would feel very very shit. \n\nI've come up with an agreement where C and I will be together but she also has someone she can be with. Whilst this happens, me and S will act like a couple behind closed doors. I will slowly detach myself from S after her ops. But today C met with her other partner and slept with him and yet I feel so shit about it. I've not even seen S in her underwear in the year I've known her. Yet my girlfriend has slept with a guy the first night they met. Do I have the right to be jealous/feel shitty?\n\nMy questions are;\n- what should I do about C and S?\n- do I have the right to be shitty/jealous?\n- am i a bad person?\n\nPs i was a year sober until tonight. \n\nThanks",

I had planned on making a big detailed post with all aspects of my life but as many of the stuff I think of doing I just never got to do it.\n\nWell let's see. I'm a 24 years old white male who hates how I look. I am also gay (as far as my chaotic uncertainty let's me assume) and my sexuality is part of the mess that brings me here. As much as I watch and read about the lgbtq+ community and consciously acknowledge and learn, deep inside there's disgusting self-hatred unacceptance. That might be tied to the rejection of my parents when I came out to them. As a result of that situation we just live as that never happened.\n\nI am \"so smart and have such a bright future ahead of me\" but since before high school I've had a grim view of the future as studying until I get a job, working until I can't work anymore and then hope to survive with what I get for the rest of my life for the work I've done. That let to me being completely closed to academics in a way that I just did it for my parents and because I didn't want to go through a school year all over again. I've graduated college in 2018 in a major I had no interest in just for the sake of graduating college (don't worry, student loans aren't a thing here) and have been doing nothing for a whole year by now.\n\nI am a big fan of games and music, in general. I made some friends through middle school that I still have and even made different friends meet each other and become friends. Now I see them working/looking for jobs, dating and completely interested in something I dislike and just like that I'm feeling completely lonely. About music, I became interested in singing mid teen years and had around 5 years of classes. My lack of control over my own body meant I actually damaged my vocal chords and somehow my chest by not doing the techniques properly.\n\nSpeaking of my body, my knees have been bad for years now and doctors didn't say much. I tried working out to make me feel better about myself and it resulted in my knees constantly hurting, my elbows (that didn't use to hurt) hurting months after stopping to work out and my back hurting. I also have some sort of tendinitis on my hands that I never brought up to anyone. Added to that, I took a benign tumor out of the right side of my jaw and I still can't open my mouth as wide as I feel like (which apparently is normal even over a year after the surgery). These and some minor other stuff bring me back to the reality that I'll never be comfortable either physically or mentally with my body.\n\nBehavior wise, I am extremely irritable but don't let it out at anyone who doesn't live with me, but I never physically attack anyone. I hate last minute plans most of the time and I hate people invading my space, even more so touching me. My stomach often spasms if someone touches it. I love being in the dark in my house and I love being away from people almost 100% of the time. I also hate how hard it is to understand and deal with people. Feelings are easily hurt before I even realize and it mostly feels like walking in a minefield which I frequently forget it is like that. I hate dealing with many people, specifically if I am not \"interested\" in them in particular. Malls, theaters and stuff don't bother me since those people have no intention on interacting between groups of people. I recently started feeling empty at random moments of random days. It's like there's an actual void inside my chest and it feels very suffocating (which is contradictory). I take pills daily as a recommendation from my psychiatrist. I've forced myself to seek a therapist around 5 times in my life with years of build up from each attempt. At the 3rd time I started having sessions for around 8 months. I was then asked to stop going back by my therapist who said I am manipulative, compared myself to my friends after saying I shouldn't compare myself to them, frequently told me how tiresome it was to have sessions with me and said I disrespected her in every way possible (while I was completely unaware of every single moment I allegedly did). Since then I had 2 more attempts that I dropped and now have no therapist for almost a year now.\n\nToo much, I know. Thing is, I can't see a future for myself. It's impossible to relate to any idea of me succeeding in any way in the future. I can't see myself happy, I can't see myself content with the job I have, I can't see myself in a loving relationship (heck I haven't even kissed anyone in my life). I absolutely despise my appearance even though it's most likely at least average. I actively sabotage my health in tiny ways such as not seeking doctors about things I feel, not sleeping well enough, not eating healthy. In my mind those are ways for me to guarantee some sort of condition will show up in the future so I can never possibly live comfortably in the future and thus reach a point where I can finally die, since I've never had the courage to do it.\n\nAgain, sorry. Too much. No idea how much of it has any relation to how I feel and how many loose ends I left in anything I said.",

For starters: I'm bi-racial, bilingual, and bisexual kid. It plays a big role in my life, and they're also the key part of all my problems. \n\nMe being bi-racial has caused an entire side of my family to treat me differently, I was bullied for it from 1st grade - today even, and I'm treated differently in public. Since I'm the first not 100% white person on my mom's side of the family, my whole life I've felt like an outsider, and I feel like they treat me differently from my younger half-brother, that's like pasty white. Not to mention my half brother had openly called me mnay names like dirty, the adopted one, secret Mexican, lion (because my hair looks \"like a lions mane\") and so much worse. The worst part is he isn't the one that believes that, I hope not. I bet it's his racist father that used to love nothing more but to say the same things too me when he and my mom were together.\n\nIt also the center for some of the bullying from my schools, since I was one of three female people of color in my grade until middle School. They used to tease me about my father not being home anymore, your he abandoned me, even one of the teachers told me on my last day how I'd grow up to be a hooker with all my daddy issues. \n\nMe being bilingual had caused more problems outside of people I know personally, except of course with my half brother. But when I'm talking with my friends in Spanish that ONLY speak Spanishwhile say, walking to school I'll come by some lady telling me to go back to my pakistan/Mexico/Kenya home (all things I've been told in the last maybe 18 months) The worst part is that I'm not Pakistani, Mexican, or Kenyan (not that there would be a problem if I was)\n\nBeing apart of the lgbtq+ community is a huge no no for my family. My mom and uncles are super homophobic, and I'm scared too come out to them. I'm closeted entirely from everyone, even my friends, because I'm scared to tell anyone. \n\nI can't take it anymore, I feel like everyone in my life is against me.

        "title": "Thoughts on bridge jump",
        "original": "I've been contemplating this bridge over a highway next to my house for a few days now. This has been a long time coming.\n\nIt's probably only 20-25 feet up. It goes over a highway below. I'm not going to jump into oncoming traffic on the highway, I don't want anyone to get hurt because of me, especially if this doesn't kill me.\n\nBut now I'm not sure how to go about this. It's sort of like I want somewhat of a chance at survival, but I'm scared that if I survive I will end up paralyzed or with brain damage. \n\nHow shall I go about this? \n\nMaybe I should explain myself a little bit. My reasoning for my decision sounds dumb, though. I don't get what the point of anything is. I'm one semester away from graduating high school. After that, I'm probably lined up to go to college the next year. I want so desperately to move away from my house then, but my lack of all social or job skills means I could never do that. I'm not confident. I didn't even pick up on that my ex liked me for several months because I'm so used to being unlikable garbage.\n\nI'm going to go to a college that my family can't pay for. I can't pay for. Maybe I'd get a part time job. My days would look like: get up early, drive there (i cant fucking drive yet, either), go through college day, drive back, work job, sleep, then repeat. I'm plenty aware that many peoples lives are probably like that. I'm just a piece of useless shit who can't handle a real routine. I wouldn't have even be able to get  past getting out of bed.\n\nI'd probably still live at my parent's home during college. I doubt I'd have the money or the confidence to live independently. And that's so painful for me. Not only do I have to live with being *that* loser who still lives at home, but my parents are that type that will NOT LET me go out and do what I want. I couldn't visit my ex for the entire year we dated. It was a real strain on our relationship, as they had previously sworn never to date online again due to a previous partner. Didn't matter to them, because they're not the person my parents wanted for me. They broke up with me a little while back because I can't even convey to them how important they are to me. They feel I haven't grown at all with them in the past year we'd dated. I wasn't being any more affectionate. No more loving. \"We just exist\", they said in their own words.\n\nAnd what's the payoff for these four years of work and living under my parents' rules, anyway. I get my degree. And then I get a real job with it, if I'm lucky. Maybe live on my own, finally. I really don't see things getting to this point, but I'm just going to humour myself a moment. Now what?\n\nI don't have any dreams. I hate the thought of having children. I'm probably going to spend the rest of my time working a job I don't even like. If I'm even slightly like I am now, I'll never find any friends, and certainly no one to date. I know this because I was homeschooled for my first 10 grades of education. A few people from a club wanted me to be friends with them. They're my only friends, now. Once I entered a real public school for these last two grades, I haven't made friends with a soul. I probably don't even speak during most schooldays.\n\nI'm never going to survive what's coming for me. It only seems to go downhill. If I can barely handle speaking a few words to a single person in a classroom, how am I going to succeed at anything. \n\nI think maybe the worst part is just about no one is going to see this coming. I have NOTHING to be unhappy about. I have no mental illnesses. No problems. Everything is just fine for me, but I'm not strong enough to do anything with it. All I want to do is give up, and only because I'm going o go through what everyone else in life has to experience. It's entirely my problem.\n\nBut about the 20, 25 feet fall.

At least she cares about my health. \n\nWhich is contradicting.\n\nDuring my checkup, the doctor listed drugs and asked if I've ever did any of it. I said no, which was true. But then she went on about if I've ever felt really really sad to the point where I would hurt myself. I paused, said no, but a part of me almost broke down. She didn't see my reaction, which was great otherwise I would've really broken down if she continued to ask me. But maybe if she had continued to ask about it, I would have gotten help. \n\nI can't describe my situation in simple terms and not a long-ass statement. The relationship that I have with my mother is probably the most intense relationship I have. My friends say that she's an amazing person, and that they wish that they had a relationship like that with their moms. I play along with that perfect mother-daughter closeness idea, only because I wish it was more of the truth. \n\nShe tells me all these good things a mom should and give amazing advice. But then it switches and she screams that I'm worthless, ungrateful, lazy, a fucking bitch, that she going to bash my head in, etc. At this point I'm truly starting to believe her. I'm the only child she slaps, pulls my hair, takes my privileges away, etc. She thinks I'm not capable of going to a state college or university and talks trash about community college and how \"I'm fit to go there\" (and maybe I will since I think might be a good choice, but she talks about it like I'll get no where. Very offensive to the people out there working their asses off to transfer and bettering themselves for their own lives.) \n\nI can't reason with her at all. I need my things like laptop, and my drawing equipment to finish a project in order to graduate from high school. If I don't graduate, I know it's going to be mostly my fault. This whole time I've been spacing out, getting my equipment taken away for a week, waking up late, and contemplating suicide. \n\nNever have I gone to therapy, talk to counselors, or any adults since it's very difficult for me to break the boundary between my home life and the life I have outside. It's very awkward for me, and if you've met me before you would have never guessed that I'm suicidal, since I hide it really well. My dad sides with my mom, My younger sisters just stay quite and think I'm the problem. He's said some things that were quite brutal as well in the past and we don't have a close relationship. (He's my stepdad but has been with me all my life.)\n\nThe only living being that knows is my boyfriend, which I'm refraining to talk to since I know it breaks his heart to hear what I'm going through. I don't want to drag him down with me, he's the most sweetest person I've ever met. I'm hurting him. (Talking to him through online since my parents refrain me from seeing him, says that I don't deserve a boyfriend.)\n\nI'm tired of putting people who are close to me in a constant state of anger and distress. It's hard for me to work on anything especially when I constantly think about how I don't deserve to live and I'm doing this all for nothing. I'm always thinking about a detailed process of ending my own life. I don't know what I can do now, but I know if I can't afford to get myself help I'll just end it.",

I had to drop out of school right before diplomas due to lack of transportation to school and the strict rules at the shelter. At the same time, my girlfriend of three years left me.\n\nI was an IB student then, performing well despite my home situation. I tried getting work and two months later, got a job at A&W, but got fucked two ways when my landlord started charging me $750 a month for an unfurnished room and my job only gave me PT instead of FT like they promised.\n\nSo I quit by walking out especially after my friend died of a Xanax overdose and my boss tried calling me in on a day we agreed I have off to mourn. The place didn't even follow proper food safety protocol, and would reprimand me for doing so if it slowed things down even a little.\n\nI moved back in with my mother once she got a restraining order against my father, who then went to AA. My mother removed it afterwards and things seemed like they might finally be normal after I started attending a high school completion program.\n\nExcept they didn't. My father got drunk and threatened death to me if I didn't follow everything he said. So I had to stop attending school again to prioritize my personal safety.\n\nI ended up staying with my grandfather for a few months, but he was a paranoid wreck. He didn't allow me to leave the apartment because he didn't want his landlord finding out despite the fact he was allowed to have people over. So I spent months locked away in this apartment with nothing to eat but chips and pepsi he bought as I waited for an employment assistance program to start.\n\nExcept I had to leave the city first. I snapped the day before my birthday when I was being criticized by everyone in my family for looking at rentals. They flat out denied taking the $6000 and then admitted it saying it wasn't mine anyway because my great grandfather gave it to me rather than it being something I worked for.\n\nI arrived in the new city with nothing but the clothes on my back and a $5 bill. After a month of being around fights, drunks, criminals, and the smell of shit and piss I got out with some roommates only to find out they were domestically abusive drunks, and I had to go back.\n\nSo here I am now. I got out after staying another 4 months in the shelter. I went back to my hometown to grab old belongings, but now my bank is being a pain in the ass withholding money time and time again when I need to pay my rent. Come tomorrow I could be evicted because some dumbfucks won't clear some deposits for me, and it's only been my first month.\n\nI'm kind. I'm fucking generous. I'm fucking smart, mature, and responsible but yet I keep getting fucked over because of others. Why me? Why is that people who do dumb shit get rewarded while I'm sitting here struggling to support myself as someone who has realistic future ambitions? Why can't I have so much as my own roof over my head while everybody else who's as just as capable as I am in high school is in their second year of university enjoying life carefree?\n\nIf I get so much as an eviction notice I'm pouring myself a glass of bleach. Or maybe I might drink it straight from the fucking jug, because apparently class means nothing anymore. I'm done, I've had enough. I'm not going back to playing card games with pedophiles, getting assaulted by drunks, or having my fucking clothing stolen while getting treated for lice.\n\nJust leave me on the floor writhing when you find me.

It was my \"dream job\", but now I can barely make myself do any work because I'm so fucking sad. I've lost any desires in life at this point. I'm broke, without friends, and every part of my body aches to end this struggle that I've been battling for so long.\n\nI didn't have a childhood, I didn't have a single friend to rely on in the past or now, I've always been isolated despite my desire to be around people. I was diagnosed with a really severe social anxiety disorder so it was always impossible to get me out of my room. I tried to kill myself when I was 13 and again when I was 15. I had a boyfriend for a while but I had to end it because he became manipulative and abusive. My grandma is currently dying of a brain tumour, my parents hate each other and scream at each other every time they're around one another, and I've started to cut myself again now, which is something I told myself I'd never do again YEARS ago.\n\nThe thing is, I take care of myself well physically. I exercise 5 times a week, I eat healthy, and I go out into the real world whenever I have the energy. I also try to connect with people and make new friends now that my anxiety is   more under control. A few months ago I met a boy that made me genuinely happy, which was a feeling I didn't realise I had completely forgotten. I was head over heels and improving my life greatly until he cut everything off with me only a few days ago. I feel like this is just the straw that's going to break the camels back. I had stopped cutting again, I had stopped drinking when I was sad, I had stopped looking at myself in such a negative light, but now I'm back to square one and worse than ever.\n\nI was longing for a connection with someone that I clicked with on every level, and hey I got it. Too bad I'll never get to keep anything good. I feel like my life is a cruel joke and I want it to end lmao. The only thing stopping me is the pain I'd cause my mum.",

        "original": "I have a friend who's very dear to me. In the past two years:\n\n* they were sexually abused;\n* their partner (not their abuser) engaged, then reneged, then broke up with them;\n* they were fired from their job after complaining to management in re: their abuser being a regular at their place of work;\n* they experienced the onset of narcolepsy/idiopathic hypersomnia/a related sleep disorder that made it difficult or impossible to wake up for work on time, which caused them to have to walk out of another job;\n* when they tried to have a sleep study done to try to do something about the above, they were told they would have to taper off their Effexor, which they had been on for almost a decade - which they did, and then the next professional they saw said that that should never be done and was possibly malpractice;\n* their car was repossessed;\n* and more I'm sure I'm forgetting or don't want to mention.\n\nSo they're completely, deeply exhausted. They messaged me today to say \"I don't necessarily have a plan to kill myself, but I expect I will sometime soon.\" They have a supply of (currently unprescribed) Xanax they could take, but do not, because it makes them drowsy, and more worryingly because if they take it regularly they will not have enough to get drunk and OD on.\n\nThey are LGBTQ+ and not on speaking terms with their parents. They have money in the short term, conservatively about $4000, but no source of income. We don't live in a place with halfway decent public transit, so every time they need to go somewhere outside of walking distance they have to arrange a ride.\n\nThey are currently unmedicated. To my mind, this is priority one. They have documentation (old Rxs, including from the period of tapering) that corroborates the narrative of \"I was told to get off my meds when I shouldn't have been.\" I don't know, but hope, that presenting this to a doctor (calling them myself if I have to) will expedite the process of getting them back on meds.\n\nThey've been to a number of therapists, but either can't afford them or can't establish a working relationship with them. Right now they're not seeing anyone. This is a lower priority, but we're going to pursue it concurrently with getting meds.\n\nThey have an apartment they can pay the rent on for another 6 months or so. My partner and I have offered to let them live with us, rent-free, no obligations they don't want, for as long as they need it, after we break our current lease in May. This would not be a crippling financial burden for us. They say that if they're still around by then, that's Plan A. But things seem to be getting worse, and I don't know how much longer I can sit around and suggest things they might need.\n\nThis is one of the strongest, smartest people I know. There are very few people I want to be around for the rest of my life and this is one of them. And it feels like they have been run over by a train.\n\nOther than listening, being there for them, and providing for their immediate needs, as well as what I've outlined in this post, what can we do in the short term to help them get back on their feet, or help them hold on a little longer?",

We are both in the 10th grade.\n\nFebruary of 2019, before our relationship, I found out she was cutting. Later in February, I found out she fainted, and the next school day she came to me and told me she was scared about what happened.\n\nWe started dating in March, and everything went well until about 2 months ago( November ). At that point we would call all night, and fall asleep together. But what happened in November is that she started cutting herself again, and told me multiple times that she wanted to kill herself. I also found out she\u2019s been cutting herself since 4th grade.\n\nFrom that point ( where I knew she would eventually end it all ) I told a counselor. The school counselor later contacted her parents and she was diagnosed with severe depression.\n\nHer parents were fairly understanding *at the time* and were nice to her for a couple days. Her mom even told me how grateful she was that I told the counselor about this situation (she was unaware of the cutting for over 6 years). \n\nNow, a couple days later. Her parents started expecting her to finish her school work, as in they ONLY care about her school work and the house rules ( chores, showering times, sleeping time, homework time mandatory to follow by each children in that house ). It\u2019s like they completely forgot that she had depression. \n\nKeep in mind she has a therapist, but it doesn\u2019t seem to help.\n\nHer grades started dropping, and she just got worse and worse. I told the counselor again, but the same process happened. \n\nFinally, I told my English teacher, who then told the counselor about the situation. \n\nThis time she was recommended anti depressants by the counselors, but get this, her mom said no( I think she obviously needs them, but I guess her mom said that they would mess her up more ). \n\nInstead, she told the counselor that she would start family therapy. I thought this was a great idea, but it never happened. It\u2019s been a month.\n\nHere\u2019s where we are tonight. She told me that she wants to kill herself, and she will eventually do it. She can\u2019t focus on her school work, and feels useless no matter how much I reassure her she is not. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to let go of her. I love her a lot. \n\n\nTL;DR: I have a suicidal girlfriend(16) who wants to kill herself now, and wanted to for the past few months.

However, late at night on Saturday, my brother has text me from inside the house and asked if I am home, and not long after he told me that he'd hurt himself (deliberately) and he's worried about it.\n\nTo help you understand my brother as best you can via a few short paragraphs on Reddit, he's a very quiet dude. He's the second-eldest of 4 boys, (me being the oldest at 24), a law graduate currently working 5 days (for free in the hope they offer a contract some day soon), he doesn't go out and party much, has never had a serious girlfriend, does have a group of good mates he sees often etc etc. He's not all that unusual on the surface. But if you mix in the stresses of our family life throughout the years, as well as whatever personal battles he's fought, it was no surprise to me when he admitted to me Saturday night that he's been dealing with severe depression for the better part of 4 years. I asked a variety of questions to try and pinpoint some of the areas he felt contributed most to his depression: relationships with females was a major one, his relationship with my parents (in particular Mum) or lack there of it - I'll explain a bit more on this shortly, and the fact that he's been self-medicating with alcohol quite heavily. It was very obvious that this Saturday night he had been drinking alone in his bedroom to a dangerous level and had spiraled in a legitimate moment of weakness where he admitted it seemed easier to *go* than to bare what he was feeling any longer.\n\nI want to discuss the relationship issues he has with my parents a bit more because it's part of my question and I think the most important problem. Living with my parents can be tricky, we've experienced some extraordinary stresses in our lives (as a family) as well as the usual stresses families endure, and it's taken a significant toll on both my parents and consequently us (boys) as well. It's more common to feel anxious or stressed at home than relaxed - and that's on a good day. My brother has had a strained relationship with my parents for the better part of 4-6 years, in particular with Mum. It has meant that he feels it is better to say nothing - even *'hey, how are you'* to avoid any interaction which could lead to stress - which truthfully, can come at any time. But this silent behavior has become some part of his personality and meant for the last 4 years he's barely had much of a relationship with Mum and Dad. It's caused friction but largely been understood that that is simply their relationship now.\n\nSo back to our conversation on Saturday night - he showed me his cuts, courtesy of the scissors in his desk drawer. There were lots, on the upper arm, but nothing dangerous thankfully. I said we'd disinfect and wrap it to be safe. But I then directed conversation to his relationship with my parents, and eventually provided him with some suggestions about how to improve it. But it seemed pointless - he wasn't receptive to the ideas at all really, giving me the impression he felt it was too far gone to repair, so I didn't push any further.\n\nThe scary part for me is that he's told me in confidence - not even his close mates know. He could not have been more explicit in making me promise not to tell my parents, especially Mum, or even my partner. Of course I promised I would not - but I wanted to put in place some steps that keep us on the same page with your headspace and also slowly work toward helping him feel better. Thankfully he was receptive to that but we would need to discuss it later. It was all such a bizarre morning - we are not an affectionate family, he's never come to me about personal issues before, but I think he legitimately scared himself and wants some help. He won't be open to seeing a specialist because he cannot afford it himself and it would mean exposing himself to my folks - it's a tricky but I'm sure familiar obstacle many people have faced.\n\nI've since been terrified I might come across my brother dead in his room or somewhere else. It is a significant weight to carry, but one I'm absolutely willing to. But I'm looking ahead and I can see the sense in letting my mother know. God forbid, if he did succeed in killing himself and I knew and never told my parents, they would've felt betrayed and even more helpless. My parents would never rat me out if I did tell them, but my brother's very intuitive and it would naturally be hard for Mum and Dad not to worry more and not show that in a way my brother would notice something different. At the same time - I can appreciate my brother wanting someone reliable and discrete in his corner for the moment.\n\nHow do I handle this? Do I tell my parents and act as the messenger to say *hey, he's alright today - leave him be.* Or *hey, no this is serious, we need your help now.* Or do I not say anything and be as helpful as I can to him in the hope he gradually finds peace within himself again?\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and/or respond.",

Then I message them with statement saying I\u2019m a loser, failure, and have friends. I go on about how I never been in a serious relationship and I just hate my life. Sometimes they don\u2019t respond, other times they do and be like WTF and sometimes they say they relate. It doesn\u2019t make any sense, but I don\u2019t have any self esteem to have low self esteem. \n\nI just want to be happy. I post on social media sites I want to kill myself. I don\u2019t want to be alive. It\u2019s over. I explain what\u2019s going on and that I am not looking for attention. I tell everyone I love them and my heart bleeds for me to get better. I am going to a Dr. I am taking medicine. I don\u2019t do anything, like nothing. I don\u2019t even go out and enjoy myself because my problems will just follow. I just don\u2019t know why. I sometimes call my grandma and tell her I am feeling. She will cry on the phone and I try to explain to her I am sorry grandma , but \u201cit\u2019s what needs to be done\u201d. It sounds evil, and maybe it is. But I am just at a point where I think the combination of drugs and all the depression and stress I had built up is starting to effect me. \n\nFor about 7 years, I was taking pain pill for a car injury. I finally got off them, but that was after abusing them for 5 years. They were a part of my diet like candy and popcorn. If I didn\u2019t have a Norco to pop, I would go into these crazy mental withdrawals. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do. I would wait until I get home from wherever I was, just waiting to pop one or two. Not to mention the physical withdrawals. HOLY FUCK!  I never in my life had so much go wrong with my body at the same time. I finally got off in 2017, but everything in my life was either gone or destroyed or I had no love anymore. The only thing still with me is family on my dads side and grandma on my moms side. \n\nI think you guys understand. I hate my life. I do. I give up. I hold my kitty real close at night telling her I love her. She is literally the only reason I am still here. I care for her. She can tell, I think, when I am really done. I cry many nights with her by myside telling her no matter what happens babygurl, you will be alrite. I don\u2019t know for sure, but I would like to think so. I hurt every day. It got so bad, posted on LinkedIn one time I wanted to end my life and cops shows up at work. That shit made it worse. Didn\u2019t get penalized for work, but went into a room for 10Hrs until a Dr came to see me so I could get out and enjoy my weekend. There is nothing that FIU can do for me. What\u2019s he gonna do? I already have a psychiatrist. Unless he prescribes me some miracle medicine, it\u2019s just a waste of time. \n\nI am sure there is more to say, but I don\u2019t know what. In all honesty, I have decided I no longer want to get better. Like for real. I am posting this because I want someone else to get help and improve. I have given up on trying. I am just going through the motions until something happens and it\u2019s over. I can\u2019t handle it anymore.

I would like to explain some things first I'm 15, and I lived in Mexico for the past 5 years my parents are missionaries but I myself don't know what I believe in and it stresses me out witch is also one thing holding me back from ending it. It was quite an experience and I had really good bonds with friends I made there. During the summer of 2019 I moved back to the us. At first it was fine I was having a good time and everything. ( also I've had history with depression and cut myself but never told anyone) when school started I had an identity crisis, I don't know who I am anymore and I knew my purpose in Mexico but then I began to question my purpose and meaning. On top of that some wierd thing starts happening were whenever I have to make a hard decision or I'm under stress especially socially my skin starts to sting for about 30 seconds and the doctors can't figure it out and they still can't well they probably could but it's been a month since a blood test and they still haven't got the results yet. I tell my parents I'm sad but not the extent of it so they push it off. I don't want to hate anyone but I was really mad at the people in my classes because of the way they act and how they think life is. It's been very hard for me to make friends here and really I haven't much. Then the school it self is so degrading my self esteem has been ripped apart so much I've been searched for drugs three times and once ive had to get questioned at the principals office once cause some asshole smoked weed on the bus. And on the bus I want to make friends but its so hard for me to cause they already have there own friends. I feel like an outsider to everyone all the time i see the corruption in society and the loss of innocence in kids, I feel depressed because of the loss of innocence and I can't stop thinking about how sad it is when kids lose it. I love books and they make me feel I have some sort of purpose but it seems so many teens hate them. Later my wierd stinging thing gets worse, and now little bumps appear after an episode and again doctors are clueless. After this is became so numb to my emotions and since that happened I've gone from being numb to feeling to much in an instant. Many more things have happened and I could drone on and on about the things witch have happened but I don't think it matters. Now for the past weeks I've been having insomnia not because I'm on my phone like parents and teachers claim but instead I can't help but relive my past in Mexico or thing about how much I hate myself or I just feel hopeless. I know I can't go to therapy because if I tell the therapist everything then  he will tell my dad and I don't want him to know. My thoughts keep me up and sometimes my thoughts float to my hunting knife. Today I sat with my knife in my hands and put it to my wrist but I chickened out. I know if I did it my mom would be shattered her whole christianity and religion and all would break apart and she might even attempt suicide if I do and I couldn't do that to her. And   I don't want my dad even though I don't know if I believe it I can't bear the thought of my dad believing his son is in hell and what that will do to him. I felt I needed to write about all the things witch happened though I didn't get to it all. I honestly feel better after writing this out. Any replies would be very appreciated and I'm going to try to sleep so I can go to this idiotic school in the morning so If i don't reply don't worry I'm not gone yet. My biggest concern is I'll be right make were i started tomorrow night.",

        "original": "This is a call for help.\n\nI met her at the start of 2019, where she was a transfer who was introduced to our school. She was a very social person and easily became friends with other people, so she had no problem fitting in. Since we had similar classes, she and I got closer and started hanging out together around the middle of the year.\n\nThings seemed normal at the start, but she seemed to always stress very easily and it was clear she wasn\u2019t sleeping well. She often slept at school, and started skipping classes. At first, nobody really assumed anything because she laughed it off and seemed to be pretty happy. Some time passes, and she\u2019s getting visibly worse - crying more frequently, eyebags getting darker, less energy etc.\n\nOne day, I noticed cuts on her arm, around late October.  I immediately confronted her about it, and she opened up because we were quite close at that point, but wouldn\u2019t really tell me why she was self harming. Over the weeks, when we had exams/finals, she got much worse - she started cutting much more frequently, on her arms, legs, chest etc. Skipping classes one day, she was caught and sent to the Vice Principals office where she told him about her self harming as an excuse (mistake). After getting sent to the counsellors office, her mum was called to school to pick her up.\n\nOn the way home, her mother verbally abused her and talked her down for self harming. She was also referred to a psychiatrist (that she didn\u2019t go to) because her parents never bothered to get her to one - not treating the issue seriously enough being one reason, and the price being another (despite spending thousands a year on tutoring).\n\nWhen she was younger (around 9 or 10), she was abused by her brother who had anger management issues. He would let out his anger onto her by both physically and emotionally abusing her. Her parents never cared enough to notice, which caused her to suffer for years with this kind of treatment. Even years later, she\u2019s still afraid of her brother, and only talks with him when absolutely necessary.\n\nAfter her mother found out about her self harming, she became increasingly stressed from having to hide her cuts and box cutters, as well as have to deal with her constant forceful attempts at cornering her into telling her about her self harming. There was no place to escape to either, as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm. An incident happened just two weeks ago: her father, mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely. When she felt a little hungry, she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room, thinking she had caught her self harming. This was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock. (the lock was the barrel bolt type, and the bolt had been removed). She was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home, so she was sure she was safer. Her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this, as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn\u2019t at home.\n\nShe has expressed intentions of suicide multiple times throughout the past month, and I think that she is 100% serious and able to follow through.\n\nRight now, only one other friend and I know most of the story and her intentions, and we don\u2019t know what to do. So far, we have been trying our best through talking to her, getting her to open up more and listening to her when she needs it.\n\nWe came to reddit to ask older, more experienced people for advice:\n\n* What are the things we should be doing? and how? The adults around us are untrustworthy and she won\u2019t open up to her therapist. (and it\u2019s very unlikely that she would ever)\n* What should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe?\n* Since we already know that she\u2019s going to (most likely) commit suicide, what can we do to help prevent it?\n\nSorry this is a bit of a long read, but this is a basic summary of what my friend and I know. As far as we know, there isn\u2019t anything else to tell. Feel free to ask anything to clarify and I will do my best to answer with what I know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Edit**\n\nThank you so much for all the advice and responses. My friend and I have talked it through and, I called the suicide hotline. After explaining the situation, the person told me that the best and most I could probably do is to keep supporting and being there for her. If it really comes down to it, we are prepared to call the police.\n\nTo clarify some things:\n\nWhether we want to or not, it\u2019s not likely we can get in contact with school anytime soon given that school starts at the end of the month and there\u2019s three weeks to the end of the holidays. As far as I know, all the adults around me would rather I stay away rather than help which is why I asked for their help. All of our parents are quite strict as well, she\u2019d gotten away with sleeping over at a friends place twice after running away, then calling after to tell them where she was. And when she got home, she was yelled at for a long time.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to take her out as much as possible this holiday, and continue to make plans with her, keeping in mind all the advice you\u2019ve given us. I might post again in the future, hopefully for the recovery and healing of her mental health. Thank you so much for all the support you\u2019ve given me, and I hope this turns out well for everyone.",

        "original": "Hi\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really scared all the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a rare autoimmune disease that is difficult to diagnose, and there isn't solid proof of it other than my symptoms (which are often dismissed by doctors because I am a young woman and I have a previous dx for anxiety/OCD/depression). I'm in pain all the time. I have emetophobia but also chronic nausea. I'm scared to go places because when I do I get stuck away from my home, too sick to get back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy family is extremely dysfunctional. They tell me that I am selfish, that I am a burden. They are rich and my dad has a sports car and they live at a fancy golf club, but they keep telling me medication is too expensive and that I cost too much money. My dad retired in his early 50s and keeps telling me to make money and not be lazy because he doesn't want to have to work again. I want to be financially independent so bad but I'm too sick to work. They forced me to move to their city 2 years ago because I was spending too much money at the doctors and they wanted to keep a closer eye on me. Because of this, all my friends live on the other end of the state. The only friend I have here is my ex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy ex-boyfriend left me when I got too sick, so now he is just my \"best friend\". I am completely dependent on him for help, and I feel awful about it. I try not to be but I'm just too sick. We still have sex, and say we love each other, and talk every day, but he has difficulty with anger and empathy, so when I have panic attacks or my body stops working right from stress (I go temporarily nonverbal or get paralyzed sometimes), he can get furious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe used to be so sweet but now he yells a lot and literally beats himself while I can do nothing but cry and watch. Sometimes he grabs me too hard or throws me places (like on the bed or carpeted floor, not into walls or anything) when I can't move and it's left bruises. It's very scary because I am helpless when he does it. I don't think he's abusive because he doesn't mean to hurt me, but he forgets to be gentle when he's stressed. When he gets overwhelmed he tells me things like that I am \"too much\", \"the worst\", \"a piece of shit\", etc. I feel like it's my fault because I push him too much by reaching out for help when he tells me he can't or doesn't want to. I need to respect limits, but I get confused, because he tells me he doesn't want me to die or hurt myself ever, so I can't tell if asking for help or hurting myself is the worse thing to him. I only push if I am in real danger (feeling very suicidal, or my disease is flaring dangerously). I have told him he can leave and we can not be friends but he says no, and that he wants me in his life and loves me. I am confused.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't like these situations and I've asked him to help me make a plan so I can get help but he can not get stressed. I think that if we can work on good communication and preventative care (so situations don't have to become dire), and I can help him work on calming techniques, empathy, and anger management, then things would be better. He is a volunteer police officer and his dream is to be a real cop, so I think these skills are necessary for him anyway and I want him to get that job and be happy. He never works on these things though. Sometimes he cries because he doesn't like hurting me and feels bad, but he still never changes how he acts. He says he'll make a plan, but doesn't. If I bring it up he gets mad and says he's too stressed and not ready. This has been going on for 2 years. I think he needs to talk to other people or get therapy but he refuses. I don't know how to make things better on my own, it feels like he has all the power to change things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want very badly to be hospitalized so I can stop being a burden. I was hospitalized at 17 for anxiety/OCD and even though it was traumatic it helped (but it was a fancy place). I called all of the local psychiatric hospitals a year ago when I started self-harming worse and explained my autoimmune disease to them. They all told me that they do not have the capability to take care of my physical needs (I have extreme dietary needs). One hospital told me they could take me, but they were confused and seemed to think that I have an eating disorder rather than a physical digestive condition- so going there is absolutely out of the question, since if they treat it like an ED, I'll genuinely die. The symptoms of a deadly attack of this kind are very similar to a panic attack, so they wouldn't know until it's too late.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't even know if a hospital would be helpful, since I already know CBT, DBT, mindfulness, etc. I've already exhausted medication options. All of my issues are situational and I feel like a hospital would just traumatize me more since it would take the tiny bit of control I have away. I know what psych wards are like, and I know how the staff can treat us. I wish they could help me but it doesn't seem very viable anyway?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents don't care that a psych hospital would be dangerous and want to send me to one anyway, so they can be rid of me. It sounds callous but they are not very affectionate people. They tell me that \"I don't understand being a parent\", and that \"they love me and I am ungrateful\", but they are genuinely not empathetic at all and potentially a little narcissistic? It hurts so bad because they yell and insult me and threaten to take financial support away in one moment (ie: make me homeless and dead), then send me heart emojis in the next. My brain is so confused. I don't think love is supposed to be like this. My best friend hates them and says they are awful people. My other friends used to say that as well, so I don't think it is all in my head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday I called my friend for support because I was feeling very mentally unwell. He told me that he couldn't help since he has a cold, but he said it very angrily, and I started to panic a little because he also gets upset if I hurt myself. I told him my concerns, and that I was scared I'd hurt myself, and that I want to respect his space but I didn't know what to do. It devolved into a huge ordeal and he told me that I am a burden and a piece of shit. I got very suicidal and told him that, which made things worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel awful. I try to talk to hotlines but they make me feel worse. I am seeing a psych in a week but I have already tried most medications and my physical disease makes most of them dangerous, so I don't have much hope for that. I've tried so hard to get a therapist, but my town is overbooked and none are available.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do. I keep thinking of suicide but I don't want to die really, I just want to not be in pain and scared all the time. I am so traumatized from being yelled at and hurt while in panic attacks. I jump at noises and I can't sleep anymore from the PTSD. I feel so crazy and I just want a break. My disease is exhausting and I have to take 9+ pills every day, at specific times, and if I miss one I get sick. I have to pick up meds, and home-cook all my food. If I eat anything processed I get sick. If I don't eat, I get sick. I'm so tired and I want it to end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease help me, I'm scared. I'm concerned that I'm crazy and have a victim complex, but it really feels like everyone is hurting me. Why do people think I'm a burden?",

I tried explaining to them why I am like this but all they say I need sleep and go outside.\n\nBut how will I go outside? Thats the real thing that I hated. To socialize and people everywhere. I more likely to be alone, introvert, just like before doing hobbies, books or some series. The more I grew up the more I realize that I am truly alone.

        "original": "Hello Everyone.\nI will give you a bit of context as to who I am exactly before I get into the meat and potatoes of what I would like to talk about. As of January 6th 2020 I am 16 years old, I am a male and my first name is Angel. What I will talk about today is my life story that has led me to having some very dark thoughts. Alright so let's begin.\n\nI grew up in Rhode Island, AKA the smallest state in the United States, nothing very special there. My father skipped out on being in my life before I was even born, he wanted my mother to get an abortion but my mother refused, I hear stories about him being a very serious drug dealer who was very violent and had a history of being locked up in some serious prisons, including some prisons in Puerto Rico. He was 27 and my mother was 19 at the time of my conception and birth. Having a son at 19 and being single seems like a big burden to hold on you, I wish I wasn't born at all so my mother could actually have a career but that's besides the point. 2 weeks after my birth my mother finds a person that she grown an interest in, my soon-to-be stepfather. The first few years of their relationship seemed to be fine. She had a child that she couldn't take care of and he was this big strong figure in her life since he had money and he was physically strong and protective. I don't remember much before then but I remember them having big physical and verbal fights and the calling of names as early as five years old. As I grew older their relationship just escalated and escalated to the point to where my stepfather would abuse my mother physically and get her to the point of having lots and lots of bruises. She kept up in the relationship until I was about 13. She left him and went into an apartment and I joined her because I didn't want to be in that house with him. We moved to a very bad neighborhood that was famous for drugs and crime, into an apartment we could barely afford and with no safety net. These few years were by far the worst of my life. My mother was in a very depressed, borderline suicidal mindset and barely took care of me and was pretty much neglectful. She grew a liking to drugs and was addicted to heroin and other opiates, I remember seeing so many syringes on the floor that I needed to step over them. She relapsed so many times. I pushed all of this negativity inward and thought I was the problem. That if I just didn't exist and never was born, then my mother would most likely have gone to do better things. And I had strong thoughts of suicide and I fantasized about me getting hit by a bus or taking all of the pills in the medicine cabinet. I self harmed a lot and I liked doing it because it relieved myself for a short period of time. I hated myself so much, I thought I was the worst human being ever to exist and that I am a no good, insignificant, abnormality that just needs to disappear. I would get into fights at school, I would cross the street without looking both ways, I would wake up wanting to end it all. When I was about 15 my mother relapsed  and that was when my aunt took custody of me and took me to her apartment in Massachusetts. I have been there ever since. It's a better situation than I was a few years ago but I still find myself thinking the same thoughts. I have suicidal thoughts often, I make plans even though I probably will never follow through with them. I hate myself so much I think that if i were anyone other than myself I'd be a way better person than I am now. I don't have any talents, I just breeze through school, mind my own business, don't talk to anyone, go home, lay in my bed, rinse and repeat. I've never been diagnosed with anything because I'm afraid of doctors and therapists, I believe the only thing you pay them for Is bad news. I don't know if i even have anything. I don't believe any medication or talking will help with what I'm thinking now. And I don't believe I even deserve help to begin with. There are people that have had it way worse than me. I was once a bright young child but now I am a dead, cold husk with no redeeming qualities. I don't want to say I have anything close to a mental illness either because I have never been diagnosed so there is no proof I even have anything, therefore it would be an insult to people with real mental health problems. I digress. Thank you for listening to my poorly formed story of my life so far, I hope to get feedback and kind words if possible. It seems to me that I'm always alone so it would be a nice change of pace if I could get some positivity. Because as of now, I have no idea how to change how I'm feeling right now\n\n-Angel",

A boy (I am going to guess he was 17) forcefully put his finger in my as\\*, everybody just sat there and watched it happen. The best help I got was \"Hey!\", hell because no one helped me I never told my parents, I was scared they would yell at me...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen when I was 14 I was raped, but I havent told anyone...other than you guys, my boyfriend, and my boyfriends brother. Although like everyone on the bus...it sounded like my boyfriends brother didnt trust me, he even told my boyfriend to not trust me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen my ex-boyfriend left me back in 2017, I fell apart. I relied on the boy to keep me happy, he verbally abused me, and insulted me in every way possible. Then I relied on my friend, she was also depressed, but we helped eachother, or at least I thought...she ended up never coming back online, and to this day all I know is that she was in the hospital. I still message her, hoping she'll come back. I cant accept that I lost her, it hurts everyday to think about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy new boyfriend used to help...but like everyone else he cant deal with my panic attacks anymore, and just yells at me when I have one, or calls me selfish when I am suicidal...He gets mad at me when I start breathing rapidly, even if I try to hide it...Its always my fault...he even said its my fault I am like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis brother thinks I am stupid for feeling this way, and he doesnt believe that my boyfriends yells at me like that...he even calls me feeling suicidal. I am to scared to speak up, and say something to someone, I am honestly scared that If I do, I will get raped by my boyfriend, his brother, my brothers, or just...anyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am scared he will hit me, or call me stupid. He even says hes tired of helping me...And now I am just so tired, I am so scared of everything that I just want to sleep my life away...I dont want to wake up anymore, and waking up is one of the worst feelings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday night, my boyfriend told me that its all my fault, him being mean, me being so depressed. That I never show him when I am sad, and never tell him the truth. That everything I do is wrong, and that I will never get better. Now I am currently crying about it...and I wont stop crying about it, am I really...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've wanted to cut myself so bad recently.\n\nJust everytime I look at my arms, or myself for that matter, I get an urge to cut myself. Because everyone I know, everyone I have ever known, just seem like they get hurt being around me. I feel like a problem, and along with being so scared of everything, I want to cut myself. My old friends used to tell me stop talking to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut even my doctors told me I was stupid, and that what I did was selfish. Instead of talking to me they would fuc\\*ing preach to me as if I was in a Church.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy therapist would 'try to set up a coping method' with me, but just tell me stuff that I knew didnt help, regardless of if I told them or not.My friends didnt seem to give a shi\\* when I was suicidal either. It just seemed like they thought *Oh no...here she goes again.*Back when I used to go to school, I used to get bullied, quite a bit. But it was one day when changing in the locker room (like I always did in the morning) I was teased, for having a small body. I told the Coaches, and Teachers, but none of them seemed to do anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stopped changing the locker room, I didnt want to get teased again. Then I started to get made fun of for that, and I managed to convince my mom to take me out of school. It didnt solve the pain that being teased brought on. And I later that year tried to overdose 3 times (2 of them I ended throwing up...alot...), I also tried to cut my arms so badly that I still have the scars to this day, and they are just as visable (pretty much) as they were back then.\n\nWhen I woke up in the ICU (from the 1 overdose I didnt throw up) the look on my dads face...he looked so pissed at me...He even says he'll be really pissed at me if I took my own life. When I came home from the hospital, my dad had gotten drunk, hit my grandma, and drove his truck into our gate. He ended up going to jail. When it comes to my dad, he used to grab me by the hair way back when he used to drink alot. I would get mad and fight back, which would just make it worse. He would grab me by the arms and hold me down if I got on his nerves (I was like 10, so I could be annoying at times)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dad used to spank me, and tbh its scarred me more than its helped my behavior. Its just his voice still haunts my mind telling me just bend over and take it.\n\nI have already tried CPS, it did nothing! I mean it helped my mom and dad realize spanking wasnt a good option, but it didnt help anything else. I tried the police, a long time ago. They didnt help much either. I tried talking to friends, nothing was helping. My dad kept yanking me around when I annoyed him. It got to a point where I would run away from him if he showed any bit of getting mad. To this day, he hasnt fixed the part of me that fears him. I still run from him when he is mad, its just an instinct at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 9 (this has hurt me very badly, even now it still hurts) I was running from my dad, he was mad and I didnt want to get spanked. I got on-top of our car and while trying to get down I slipped and fell on the roof of the car. I ended up immediately breaking both my front teeth out, and one other (idk what it is called, its right next to your front tooth) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow we are in the present, when I first met my boyfriend I was going to take my life. %100 was going to the next night, but he made me not take my life. He was so caring, and it showed that he loved me. But I dont know what I did wrong...to make him yell at me when I have panic attacks. I talked to his brother, and his brother became my friend, that might have been what upset him...I dont know\n\nI live in a horrible place. The cops are horrible, therapists are horrible, doctors are horrible. Its all horrible, and its not worth my time going to any of them. Nowadays even if I wanted to call the cops I cant, and I know if I asked my mom, she would say no, even if I just asked to borrow her phone.\n\nThe only thing I have going for me is creating games. I can still make games and slightly destract myself...but my boyfriend wakes up in like 30mins (wakes up around 1 PM) and its scaring me.\n\nI dont want to talk to him, but I have to. Or he'll start guilt tripping me, or yelling at me...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont want to be scared anymore...please someone...",

I still struggled because of my dyslexia. Before my diagnosis, my parents had no clue about ADD/ADHD and constantly thought that I was being a lazy defiant kid. My dad was too strict on my grades to the point where he\u2019d yell at us for bringing home anything lower than a B. No matter how hard I was trying. He\u2019d even threaten to ground us if we didn\u2019t meet his expectations. So I was dealing with constant pressure in addition to having learning disabilities which made school a nightmare for me despite doing decent. Sometimes I\u2019ve had to lie to him about my grades to save face.\n\nAnyway, I did well in high school, and earned a  3.42 GPA (no AP/Honors), but a 20 on my ACT (after my third attempt). I\u2019ve always struggled with test taking. My first semester went well, just under a 3.00 but my second semester I ranked. It\u2019s not because I didn\u2019t have the study skills, I just wasn\u2019t prepared for university level work nor did I have the intellect to compete with all the other students there. I struggled to keep up with the lectures. I couldn\u2019t tell my parents because I knew they\u2019d yell and berate me. What did they expect? An ubermench of a son?! Did they really expect me to be the best?! Why couldn\u2019t they just accept that i wasn\u2019t cut out for college. After my third semester I was put on academic probation. Despite attending all my classes doing all the work yet I still bombed most of my exams. I wish my parents back then would have told me that other options existed outside of university. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just not smart enough. It takes me a while to understand concepts as I\u2019m a slow learner. I struggle with processing language. My IQ probably average at best. I struggle to think on the spot and it\u2019ll take me a while to come up with a solution to a problem. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell them until I was 5.5 years into my degree that they found out that my GPA was low. I changed my major from accounting to liberal studies and graduated. It\u2019s not like I would have found a job in accounting anyway as my grades were too low. \n\nSo here I am, currently 26 years old, unemployed, living with my parents and can\u2019t find a job. I\u2019m thinking about going back to school, but I\u2019m not sure which field to pursue. I\u2019m plan to start at a Community college and then transfer to a university. I haven\u2019t told my parents the plan yet because I\u2019m not sure that they would agree to support that. \n\nI honestly wish I didn\u2019t have a learning disability. Complaining about it is a waste of time so I have to live with it. I know that I\u2019m still young and got time, but I just can\u2019t help but compare myself to my friends and everyone who I knew from high school and college who currently are working and building careers. Most of them are smart and don\u2019t have learning disabilities, and can\u2019t relate to my struggles. \n\nHas anyone else screwed up my life as badly as I have?\n\nNote - it took me 15-20 minutes to type this post using my iPhone.",

I believe my friend don't get the meaning of it since we're still too young, so I don't think of it much since we never socialize either after we finish elementary school. \n\nCurrently, I am 23 years old.\n\nSo this is the first time of me opening up, \n\nI will write this down separately on three parts. School, Home before University and After\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>> SCHOOL ( start from 4 years old )\n\nat kindergarten i don't have much memory. only remember how to write date calendar.\n\non elementary school first grade we move to different city, at this first grade I believe nothing much happening ( I forgot )\n\non second grade, we move to different city again, this time it's really different, it's getting worse. my classmates, I was mocked with their accent, making angry faces at me, I am not welcomed since people there have different accent and slightly different language, \n\nthey \"hard\" bully me, even the teacher, she teach in their accent and leave me behind making me not understanding the lesson at all and the teacher did it on purpose because the teacher sometimes make jokes about me to the whole class, they laughing at me, \n\nand this one time when lunch time, most of my classmates gang up surrounding me while I'm eating my sandwich, and when i stand up, one guy say something and then all punch me from whole direction, I cried while still holding my sandwich, and lunchtime over, whole class goes to theater room because there is class schedule there. I still sitting in the class not wanting to join. couple days in, I start making excuse of feeling sick to my mom, begging to not go to school, anyway I can.\n\nI moved to newer school but still at that city, you know what. I am not welcomed , they bullied me in \"soft way\" ( we use 1 table for 2 person in the class), my bullies sit next to me and he seize most of the table, and so on, whole class treat me as an outsider, when break time came, only 1 or 2 people make friend with me, the rest are \"soft\" bullying me. I survived.\n\n3rd until 6th grade I move back to my hometown, I believe everything is just fine, just some small fights with classmates, no bullying just couple times of misunderstanding and couple fights, punching each other and apologizing to each other after.\n\n7th middle high school also kind of OK, just some classmates bully me for being childish? i guess?\n\n8th grade, all went to hell again, I create enemies (bullies) that I never knew existed, they hate me for nothing, they just hate me, they have couple bullies in other class ( like 8a, 8b, 8c) and tells them to bully me. oh man these bullies were strong, the bully known to be really-really bad around school, punch, taking my pocket money, all that. I survived.\n\n9th grade, all kind of normal, neutral i think.\n\nHigh school surprisingly OK, i made a lot of friends. I goes to vocational high school concentrating on multimedia, containing such thing as : adobe after effect. premiere, video, photo. movie shooting. all went great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>> HOME (starts at when I was 4 years old)\n\nAll starting since I was 4 years old. Since I start to have my memory ( I got tears up my eyes writing this sentence )\n\nboth of my parents always fight most of the time, my father beat me since I have memory, if there something that are not his way, he will beat me with his belt, leather belt give the worst pain. my mom didn't stop him I guess, mom never listen on what I wanted to say or do, she dictates on what should I do on day by day basis. \n\nI did have brother, that are way younger than me, about 4 year younger, but that's same story at house, we're being beaten by our father. my mom ? just watch us being beaten, and then lecture us after being beaten to not do something again. \n\nBack at when I about 6 years old, I got typhoid, I'm delivered to hospital, with all those intravenous infusions, since then I have Syringe and all that medical needles phobia. I Survived.\n\nMaybe I should've died there? I just cheated my way to live? \n\nand then about 8 years old I got Chronic Tonsillitis, Surgery needed to remove it,\n\nMaybe I should've died there? I just cheated my way to live? \n\nand just couple weeks before writing this, I got TB, but not at bad stage, only liquid building up around my right Lung, small surgery needed, and I'm currently on medication. and then again:\n\nMaybe I should've died there? I just cheated my way to live? \n\nEvery. Single. Day. Since I was about 5 years old,\n\nThinking ( I keep adding new questions ) why I have to be here? Why should I even exist ? What if I Just not born? shouldn't it be all  good for anyone? everybody happy? I cried often at night, full crying tears everywhere. why me? what did I do wrong? maybe I am THE mistake? Maybe I should've died there? I just cheated my way to live? Why do I have to handle this pain ?\n\nI have this imagination I just should be in Prison, locked up never opened.\n\nI have this imagination that in my funeral, the whole family including siblings, uncle, and all that laughing at my grave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>> After University ( year 2017 - Now )\n\nI took a business degree because my parents wanted to, the time during my study was kind of OK, I even finished it with 3.76 of 4.00 GPA but without Cum Laude sadly, because my thesis didn't Score Grade A. but deep down I am feeling really empty. i feel this degree is totally not me at all\n\nafter graduate, i did not want to get a job, previously I did couple internship here and there, my business degree became useless, I just don't want to work in this corporate job, and then I being pushed by my parents to find a job, so I did, I got a job as business developer, you see, I have a lot of anxiety talking to stranger, let alone via phone, boss blaming me for things I did not do, I cannot stand it, I am suicidal for 3 months working there, I cannot cope with it so I quit. I feel like my life are nothing. \n\nI don't want to work at this field anymore.\n\nSo I got nothing to do anymore, \n\na slight flashback, since start of high school I am good at tweaking computer, and increasing pc performance, lets say this guy has a Windows OS on his laptop, and when gaming only able to do 30 FPS something and sometime freezing, stutter mid game, but with my tweaks which i did to the OS and the game, that same laptop could get around 45 fps playing it without any stuttering or hitching or freezing mid game. and i can replicate it to basically many computers, things like registry edit, cmd u name it. but I am not interested in the coding part, i just know what tech specs this guy need and that guy need and knows how to optimize and tweak a system so that guy can postpone system upgrade for sometime to buy a new one. \n\nIf there's new experimental tweaks in the forum, i would try it, i would not care if the system crash, i need to know the tweak is good or not, if crash then i can reinstall it to do more experiment, stuff like that.\n\nI've been told by several lecturer in my university that there is a way for it, master degree in Information System, so From Business Degree undergraduate to Master degree in Information System, not relevant right. and I'm not sure I want it, and if I did, it's still not my passion, it just things that I'm good at, it doesn't make me happy.\n\nbut in order to do this, I have to work in the corporate job to pay for it, which i totally hate, I would rather die LITERALLY than working in this field, I asked my parent what if I just become sort of \"Uber Driver\" for work, my parents don't want that, they will get \"embarrassed\" by the neighbours and the big family. \n\nThis goes on already since my graduation back in 2017, i only got what, couple months of work experiences which I hate so much.\n\nLast Words, I Believe I found my passion, so there is an education tv show about horse grooming, taming, helping giving birth and ranch overview, the show runs about 30 minutes right, i watched it all and I though it only runs for 5 minutes, I TOTALLY Love it, so I go to youtube right, watch horse stuff. Time goes really fast, i just not understand, the expression is like \" It's night already?? but I only watch it for a couple minutes!\".\n\nBut I realize, in where I live, there is no place for horse, and then i searched for degree in equestrian study, all of them are in other country far away like in Ireland or Australia and so expensive for me, at least I'm happy that I found my passion, not just what I'm good at, That horse things I found and watch was the only Happiness i have in my life. \n\nI am planning to go suicide by jumping from a building next week, it's my 24th birthday next week, so yeah let's make it more dramatic, currently i'm researching for the best tall building that I can have access to, minimum 10 floor building, I don't know what to do anymore, if I talk to my parents they wouldn't listen to me at all, I believe both of my parents are narcissist from what i learn from medical websites and Reddit forum.\n\nso there it is, \n\nI could add more depth to my post but i think its ok.\n\nI don't know why I write this, nobody care..\n\nthank you for everyone who manages to read all.\n\n\n-- Update 1\n\nI cannot stand the yelling my parent said to me every single day, mom said I am a dissappoinment and keep asking while yelling why I don't have a job yet? You said yes, yes but where ? Says I'm a liar because I said yes at before but I didn't want to find it,\n\nIn my mind, well I don't know, of course I don't have a job, it's because I don't want to work in this field and you forbid me from finding other kind of job, a job is a job, but oh well..\n\n4 days to go, I found 2 possible building to jump from..\n\n\n-- Update 2\n\n3 days to go, Why do I still alive, ok now, \nI did not write yet about constant saying of my parents to me almost every single day, they will call me dumb, stupid and other things repetitively.\nMy father can't keep his mouth shut when watching TV and movie, always saying useless stuff to make the TV shows bad or making the movie sucks, He always say something not good about it, it's literally extraordinary on tv or movies, my father always try to say it \"just a usual thing\", \"nothing special\", \"what's the point\", and so on to make himself better.\nWhen knowledge tv shows came in, my father listen a bit and talk out of his ass like he know it all, \"yeah, i know this because bla bla bla\", Like wtf? I want to listen to the knowledge on TV show, not from you.\n\nMy mom nagging about my job finding every single day, I already discuss about it that I don't want job in this field, nothing changed, but the nag and yelling became more worse.\n\nI found buildings that are not tall enough, only 5 floor, 10 floor building not found yet.\n\nMy mother yell to me to find a job because she embarassed with neighbour and our relatives, she actually thinks about her own image, she didn't think about me, it's all about her image.\n\nAnd my father, I heard he nag about my job finding too, but why he not directly say it to me? He tells it to mom and mom told me, why father did that? Idk but I think to save his image towards me as a good father? Didn't he realize that he beat me and calling me dumb all the time?\n\nWhy did I born...",

        "original": "I\u2019ve had periods in my life where I\u2019ve felt suicidal before, but I\u2019ve only almost taken action once. I\u2019m a mom of two, married to an incredibly supportive man who loves me very much. My life is not too bad really.. except that we\u2019ve been living in his parents basement for the last two years. I struggle with impulsivity, especially when it comes to spending money on my kids.\n\nIn the last year or so, I can\u2019t get it out of my head that I\u2019m toxic to him and my kids. I tend to cause fights with my partner..I don\u2019t really know why, I just do. I\u2019ve made him emotional more times in the last year than he has been in his entire life before me.\n\nI can\u2019t sleep at night. I spend three or four hours with crippling anxiety, so much so that it makes me sick to my stomach. I worry about money.. my family dying.. all these things that aren\u2019t real but could happen. It\u2019s absolutely miserable. I hate waking up, I hate going to bed, and recently I\u2019ve become more apathetic in all of my relationships and activities.\n\n I experienced substantial abuse in my childhood, and it seems I have my own psychological problems because of it. Borderline or bipolar are a possibility, as I\u2019ve been tentatively diagnosed as borderline by one therapist, but truly I don\u2019t showcase all that is normally seen with this disorder. It destroyed me when I found out because my biggest fear is messing up my kids, and I feel like it\u2019s unavoidable. \n\nI\u2019ve spent the last six months thinking about suicide, but I didn\u2019t really have a plan. Three days ago my partner and I had a really good day. Better than we\u2019ve had in a long time. That night something he did made me feel insecure again, and I knew I was going to ruin the moment. I freaked out, grabbed a bunch of trazedone and went driving. I took about ten that night, and had planned to drive up the canyon and crash. My partner texted me and I felt scared and puked most of them up. Went home and was drowsy and hysterical for the rest of the night, while he stayed by my side. \n\nSince then I keep having good and bad moments. I truthfully don\u2019t see the point to keep trying, and it feels painful to consider going on. I don\u2019t deserve my family, I don\u2019t deserve the life I have. They would be less damaged with me gone. \n\nI took a bunch of clonidine yesterday, I suppose I was hoping to not feel anymore. My partner has continued talking to me which helps but I keep getting stuck in my head, which is a very bad place for me to be right now. I\u2019ve started Chantix today (we both got a script so we can quit smoking) but truthfully I\u2019m taking it because I\u2019m hopeful it will give me the guts to move forward. He wants to take me to the hospital, but I\u2019m hopeful this can be resolved without that, since that sounds worse than death honestly.\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what I\u2019m looking for, but I would really appreciate some support here. I need someone unbiased to help me find some direction. I\u2019m lost and scared and I don\u2019t want to be here anymore.",

I was always an outsider from young age on because I had a limoing leg that pained me since grade 3 or so. Being bullied mostly and having very little friends, I mostly played games and catched bugs in my free time and it made me happy. When I was 15 the bullying became extreme and the pain I had in my knee also appeared in my hip, it made the bullying even worse because I seemed like the easiest target it seems. I guess you wouldn't be surlrised if I told you that I never had a girlfriend in my life, mostly girls where like \"Eeeew, he's like a zombie\".\n\nLater on I tried to better myself and started to work out with my upper body, getting fit and more confident, it was like everything was coming in place for me, there was even a girl who had some interest in me.\n\nThen I needed to go to the hospital because I had a migrane with aura for the first time, they tested me if it wasn't something worse and didn't change that little hose they poke into your arm for two weeks. It got infected really bad and I almost died or lost my arm. I got tons of antibiotics and I managed to survive but the same pain that haunted my legs was now in my left shoulder.\n\nThe doctors sent me from one to another until I got diagnosed wih rheumatoid arthritis, a form called morbus bechterev that will maybe fuse my vertibraes together in the future.\n\nMy left arm shriveled understandably because I couldn't work out properly anymore, the girl and most of my friends slowly broke away from me as I struggled with pain and sickness.\n\nLater on I also caught a hearth muscle infection that almost killed me as well, though I survived again. Back then I was haooy about that. Though my new nick name was \"The fapper\" because of my thick right arm and thin left arm.\n\n\nNow I wake up every day and wish I had died back then, I have this memory where I almost drowned as a kid, I think back and wish I just drowned or the hearth muscle infection ended me. The pain and the fact that I am a natural loser it seems drive me almost insane, I cry every day when I am alone and started banging my head against objects. The weird part is that my shoulder hurts less and is more usable now, but whenever I think about working out I think about how futile it was, all this work and effort just to have it ruined by i fection and heredetary sickness.\n\nI know what my bullies do and they all live happy lives with their girlfriends and spouses whilst I wither and cry all the time. It feels like my life is a joke and I am just o e of those specimens that will suffer until they die, because of my sicknessI work a oretty shitty job with a boss that call's me useless despite doing my best and I caught myself agreeing with him.\n\nNothing is fun anymore, I wanted to catch beetles but the forest floor gives my legs trouble. Video games just remind me of the time I wasted with them now and whenever I try to write something for my hobby author project I hate it because I think I did bad. The only thing I do is wandering around railroad tracks and listening to music. I often think about going to a slope by the tracks when it rains and jump under a train to make it look like I slipped so my parents don't feel guilty.\n\n\n\nI don't know what to do, but I guess nobody really does in life.

She responded with \"I just don't  see any reason to make tremendous efforts to improve my health.  What  really do I have to live for?\"\n\nBackground: I have a good relationship with my mom, and she really likes it when I spend time with her.\n\nMy  mom has always been stubborn and has never been focused on her health.  The result is that she has successfully driven herself into a rut of bad  habits. She's been smoking since she was 13. She mostly eats crackers & bread. She never exercises. When she was younger, her health could  take the abuse. Not anymore.\n\nI  was home for a week for Christmas, and I really saw how she has  deteriorated and know that she's on a downward trajectory. Women in my  family live long healthy lives. My great grandma lived to 100. My  grandma to 97. My mom should have decades still, but she's now about as  physically capable as her 95F aunt. I only see two ways to break the  cycle: she moves into a retirement home or either my brother or I move  back in.\n\nThat's when I decided to  suggest a proposition to her: I move back in for a month to help her  seriously focus on her health. I gave her this proposal knowing that she  really wants me to spend more time at home (I live a long way away and  my mom doesn't like to fly). I thought she'd at least consider the  offer. Within a few hours, while I was on the way to the airport, I got this email:\n\n>Both  you and \\[your brother\\] have carved out new lives for yourselves.  I am  delighted to see you both happy.  At the same time. it seems that there  is no room for me in your new lives.  It's OK--that's what happens.  But  now, there is little reason for me to continue to want to live  I have  no partner and no children in my life.  . Several times I have thought  that you would be better off if I weren't alive.  In such an instance,  you would not have to be concerned as to how I am doing and/or feel  guilty because you're not attending to me.. Also,financially, you would  be much better off.  Thirdly, I don't want to go through the long  suffering that my mother experienced, as she became weaker and weaker.   Don't be concerned;  I am not going to commit suicide.  I just don't see  any reason to make tremendous efforts to improve my health.  What  really do I have to live for?\n\nI really don't know how to respond. I don't believe there's any immediate risk of her committing suicide. As I say, the issue I see is that she's driven herself into a rut. Furthermore, she's a psychologist, so it's a little awkward for me to say \"I think you need to see a psychologist\".",

        "original": "I try to give you a short version of it because its just to hard to write about it . I always felt like i was invisible to all the friends i have , to my family and especially to girls. But i would never thought of myself as a depressed person . But literally everytime i should be proud of me jobwise or what i achieved my happiness stays for 10 seconds and then the emptiness starts to kick in again. This is what i just recently discovered to be exact the last 5 weeks are just hell for me. My whole life flipped upside down i put my health in big jeopardy and i think this time i fucked up big time , there is honestly no way how my life can get normal again. But now the story . I came back 2017 broke and also heartbroken from a longer working holiday visa . I told to myself ok i need to start over again and save money and get my ass up , saving for a couple of years and start traveling again. And i did it, i did it so fucking good that i saved up almost 50000\u20ac in a little bit more than 2 years . 6 weaks ago i started to life my life as i wanted to be traveling like there is no tomorrow , a healthy and wealthy guy who just wanted to get the most out of his travels . I went to a south east asian country that i picked long before i started my trip , i was hyped as fuck to do what i want for the next 3 months . To see beatifull places to get to know a lot of beatifull women to life a awesome  life. Everything perfect . But then literally at the beginning of my trip in the second night i fucked up my life so hard . We went out with 3 guys including myself and went to shady places because our hostel was located in the red light district . I had sex there with a girl that i thought was a normal girl , but in the end it turned  out to be a transsexuell hooker (operated) and i had sex with her 2 times anal and 2 times the condom broke . I just found out about this the next evening ( i actually spent like 16 with this \u201egirl\u201c ) when she said she want to leave and then asked my for a lot of money , because she gave me a good and long service and that she is so fucking poor . She also told me she is studying tourism what i can tell you now is total bullshit. After the night i wanted to get me on pep ( a pill you can take to prevent yourself from getting hiv , but need to take 72 after exposure) i ran around this fuckin city for 2 days from clinic to clinic just to get told in the end that its not available in this shithole of a 3 world country yet. After that i tried to just stay calm and think about how low the percentage is that its transmitted from 2 times sex (1:160) chance . I tried to enjoy my vacation but i couldn\u2019t . I went back to my home country after 2 weeks because i got all of the symptoms of hiv . At first all my friends and family , coworker where really suprised when i came back i lied to all of them and said i had a food poisoning and couldn\u2019t handle it because i felt like dying. When i got back i felt like everybody around me got ill and started coughing , getting herpes blisters in their face, etc. so i must be contagious , it feels like everybody at work rn gets some sort of small blisters . I tried to avoid every contact to anyone . I haven\u2019t seen my friends since im back almost for 3 weeks because i try to not get in contact with them. Everybody seeing my behavior change . Everybody tells my i act so weird . Im scared that i infected my coworkers with diseases because its so fishy that after quitting my job that i worked for over 2 years i announce to got traveling for 15 months and then 2 weeks later im back . I didn\u2019t got tested yet for hiv because over the fucking holiday season there was nothing open , and you need to wait for at least 6 weeks. On the other side i think often about it if i got it , as a straight male , living on the countryside its almost impossible to find a partner everybody talks and everybody knows anyone here. I also don\u2019t want to switch jobs because i actually make good money in my company.the next thing is im also not vaccinated for hepatitis b and its 100 times more infectious than hiv . So when i got hiv im almost certain i will also get hepatitis b that means i have to chronicle live threatening disease at once . Then i cant proceed to work and everybody will ask me whats going on , and i have no answer to that yet . People will talk what has he how he got it and shit like that . So i basically fucked up my life socially , and health wise  and i cant work anymore. Just in 1 night i destroyed everything . For my current status i have red eyes since 4 weeks ( the doctor said its okay in 3 appointments , but somehow i cant get rid of it,cool) and i got a bacterial infection on my penis that i treat rn with cortison. I got some weird skin rash on my chest. And im pretty sure i also got genital herpes. The only person i told a little bit about is my father but he always just says there is no proof so wait for it . But i cant see a future for my life. The worst part is that i really see now that my old life isnt that bad and that i want to start a family, but how i said there is no chance with 2 chroncile transmittable diseases to do that. So i think about killing myself for 5 weeks straight , if the hiv test turns out positive im 90 percent sure i will do that. I don\u2019t want to go through a lot of pain or put my family in such a deep shame if everybody finds out that here son is a hiv positive/hep b positive loser who contracted it from a transgender hooker. I try now to spend a part of my money to a good reason , but the problem is because i live in a village i put a lot of money in insurances and that contract i made with one of my best friend so if i tell him i want to get all of my money he will ask why i want to quit all the contracts i have no answer to that . And then just after 1 month i came back from my \u201etraveling\u201c. He will see that something is very fishy about that. To summarize it , the world was open for me and i basically destroyed that in less than 24 hours , the worst part is that i see now how beatifull life actually is and that i could see myself starting a family and living a normal life , i actually don\u2019t want to die , i want to life more than ever and im very eager what life would have given me for the next 50 years but like i said the should have could have is over. It\u2019s depressing that i just see all of this now when its to late , i will never see my niece getting older, i will never have a relationship with someone i love, i will never have my own kids , i could see me sitting at the porch and watching my 3 children playing in the front yard and laughing with my wife in my arm but this will also not happen. I guess i will be dead in maximum 5 years i don\u2019t know if its because of mental health ( because i know this is all my own fault) or because of my body , but i know for certain i will not life a normal life again.

I'm taking a health care Aide course right now but I've been missing so many days due to my depression and anxiety. Today was the first day back from holidays and I called in crying telling them a stupid lie \"someone very close to me passed away, I won't be able to make it\" I bet you anything they thought \"Pfft..ya right\"\nI was actually crying because my boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me. I did something really stupid it's a really long story and I don't really want to get right into it but all in all it was my fault and he just couldn't handle me anymore... He tried his best to love me and I just can't wrap my head around the fact that we are REALLY over. I tell him every time suicide comes to my mind and he gets mad at me. I liked it tho because it showed me he cared. But this time I'm not going to tell him... I'm not going to tell a soul. I had a plan to kill myself January 1st 2020 but I ended up sharing that plan with my ex so it didn't happen. He actually used it against me in an argument.

I doubt it would do anything.\nI tried slicing my throat while intoxicated a couple of weeks ago my mom had to hide all the knives...but I couldn't think of doing it sober now.\nWhen I was pregnant (lost baby at 16 weeks) all I could think about was jumping off bridge since my ex was not happy.

I was supposed to go to her house for my birthday; we were gunna make stir fry and just hang out. Yesterday, I got a text from my little brother saying mom and her husband have decided they are going camping up north from Friday thru Monday. I try every year to express to her that it hurts my feelings. Especially since she can remember every single one of my older sister's ex boyfriends, all of her husbands' distant relatives, and pretty much anything that's not related to me. Last year my only wish was to get froyo together from a new shop that had opened; I offered to drive and pay for it. Mom tried to get out of going, and told me to just take my brother. The year before, I asked if they would help me bake a cake; surprise surprise I did it by myself and no one even touched it. \n\nI honestly think my mom doesn't love me because I remind her of my abusive dad. Both mom and my brother have told me that I'm just like him. It's not my fault that I like learning about everything, it's not my fault that I picked up on his slang, but I'm trying so hard to be a good person and they just ignore it. Everyone at work says I'm really kind and helpful, but mom just tells me over and over and over that I'm mean and hurtful. I live 50 miles from my family, all by myself, and I have no friends. All I wanted was to have one day where my family pretended to love me. Now I'm sitting here, thinking about how if I did kill myself, it would take weeks for anyone to check on me. Even if I failed when trying, no one would arrive home and call 911 and try to save me. I'd just die. If I did die, maybe mom would love me again, maybe she would cry over me instead of telling me how terrible of a person I am. The only reason I havent offed myself is because I have the sweetest puppy, and I know she would be stuck without food until someone found me, and I don't want to abandon her.

Being alone at work, coming home to be alone, and repeating every single day and then my mom forgetting me for the 3rd year in a row? It's painful and I dont know how to make it stop.

        "original": "Sorry if this feels all over the place, I'm just adding as I remember.\nAlso looked back and see it's a wall of text, apologies.\n\nI grew up in a somewhat dysfunction Asian family.\n\n- i grew up being bullied for my eyes as I have a lazy eyelid, leading to one eye being \"larger\" than the other, I would try to be friends with people but they would shun me and tell me to fuck off in little kid terms. Eventually after moving to a different school ( I went through multiple elementary schools due to some of the reasons below) I made some friends and it was enjoyable. My met my best mate Ryan who would about 15 years later, would kill himself. My group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when Ryan would start to drift away. He had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time. I still course myself for not reaching out as I thought he was doing ok, I started attending university this is when I learned he killed himself.\n\n- my father was an alcoholic and being Asian, beatings weren't uncommon as punishment. There was a time when my mother, sister and I stayed at a relative's place for a night or two when my father was drunk enough that he fell over, injured his head, and wasn't in the sanest of conditions.\n\n- my brother died when I was in grade 3 from some medical illness which I still have no idea what it was as I was never told and never asked as my mother suffered immensely from his death and I don't want to bring any of that back. Some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily, just writing practice I suppose. There was a day where I wrote about how my brother recently passed and how I would be attending his funeral very soon. My teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc. This soon made it to my sister who was about 5 grades above me but still in the same school building. Her teacher asked her about the funeral and I don't know what she said in response. Later at home, she told my parents about how I told my teacher about my brother dying and now the teacher(s) knew\n They berated me, telling game how such personal details should be kept between family and not be told to others. Perhaps this is where I started to feel betrayed by my own family and learned not to tell my family anything as I would just get shit on for sharing.\n\n- my mother and father divorced while I was pretty young and while my father doesn't mention my mother when I see him, if something goes wrong such as my mother misplacing a document, she would blame either me or my sister for \"letting him into the house\". She would assume things such as him stealing documents that she misplaced. There are memories of when I was young, I would wait for my mother to come home from the hospital from visiting my brother and I would come downstairs to see her\n She would hold me and cry to me about my sick brother.\n\n- my mother soon started dating again and I remember that she was dating 2 guys at once I think. Some lawyer guy and some other guy she met at work. She asked me which one I liked better and not to tell the Guy A about the existence of Guy B. I didn't know what was really going on as I was still in early grade school at this point but it was only in the past couple years I realised that my mom was essentially seeing two guys at once.\n\n- my sister is doing great, she has a good job and married last year, has good friends, great husband and such. I'm genuinely happy for her she was the first in my family to graduate university and prosper.\n\n- My parents work in a factory and immigrated over from China so this was huge. I'm similarly trying to graduate and my family set me up for success. My father gave me money for university fees but I spent about 40% on dumb crap like amazon items or games as I was about 18 at the time, and it's not like I grew up learning how to manage my finances, I was and still am young and stupid. I started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money. I told my parents who I was living with that I needed a break. If I had told them the truth they would have looked at me like a pathetic human being which I am but..... I wouldn't have been able to take it. They accepted my lie and so I found a job and worked. \n\nEventually I went back to university and resumed my course work but they expect me to graduate at the end of this semester which isn't possible with the course work I'm still missing but with the lies I've told them, it makes sense why they would think I would graduate. My situation is entirely my fault and I don't know what to fucking do. \n\nTo top it all off, I play far too many video games as it's my escape. Recently, my grandma died on my father's side, and when my sister called to tell me, I was still playing video games as an escape. She could hear me playing and told me to \"get your shit together, grandma just died and you don't give a shit\". I do, I just can't express emotion anymore, not to my family after all that's happened. She told my mother and she similarly thinks I'm a human bag of garbage at this point. And I honestly don't blame them. My sister told me once that I am the source of problems in the family and she's not wrong. I agree with her, and it makes me feel all the more shitty because of the truth behind it.\n\nSome of my cousins are similarly in university and they're doing great. A bunch of my friends have graduated and are living their best lives and I'm happy for them. I just see how I'm stuck in my position because of my own actions and I feel absolutely miserable. \n\nThere's more I can write out but it's already a large wall of text.\n\nMy university has counselling services I can use but it's fucking worthless when you trying to make an appointment and there's a waitlist..........\n\nI can't even get a job relevant to my degree during university as I don't have co-op. All job listings I've seen for internships list having a GPA of 3.0 minimum and I hovering around a 69% average which is about a GPA of 1.33. I can't get a job without experience and I can't get experience without a job, and my decreasing GPA certainly doesn't help as I can't even stick my foot in the door.\n\nI just don't want to be alive anymore. I just want it all to stop. If I kill myself my family will likely be sad for a bit, but being a source of problems they would also likely be better off in the long run if I'm not around.",

This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve had these thoughts, I wrote a suicide note freshman year of high school and self harmed all through high school. I guess I\u2019ve felt like I never have belonged, I feel as if I experienced too much too young and was exposed to things that have skewed my worldview into one I don\u2019t want to be a part of. I have friends and family who love me, and I don\u2019t want to hurt them, but it\u2019s killing me to stay alive and pretend like I am fine. I am really unhappy about where I am in life. I tried making the best out of the college I chose to go to, however I strongly dislike it and never feel at home. You can say it was a \u201chard first semester\u201d but to me it\u2019s different than that. I can\u2019t transfer because I don\u2019t have the money, and worrying about paying for more loans and making new friends wouldn\u2019t help me. \n\nI recently got out of a 3 year on and off relationship with a guy 3 years older than me. I fucked up and made some bad choices and lied about them because I was angry and hurt and let our past cloud my judgement. I took him for granted and hurt him horribly. I miss him so much and it hurts so badly to not be able to reach out to the one person who ever knew this side of me. Im so scared that I won\u2019t find anyone else that I love at the capacity I hold for him, and vice versa. I don\u2019t know how to unpack the fact that I was the monster capable of creating so much pain. I just want him to know I love him. \n\nMy family has really been through it all, and therefore we have an incredibly toxic and abusive home setting. I am trying to keep my younger brother away from drugs while my parents continue to ignore that it is happening, and I\u2019ve reached the brink of my ability to take care of him. I can\u2019t really talk to my parents because they just ignore it and send me to therapy. \n\nI just feel overwhelmingly lost, I don\u2019t want to live the basic life path that i\u2019m currently destined to be on.

It hurts and I guess I\u2019m just looking for some advice or help or i don\u2019t really know. I don\u2019t want to die, necessarily, but I\u2019m tired of this life and this world and the routines and the hate and the violence that plague it. The only reason I haven\u2019t by now is I don\u2019t want to hurt the people in my life, like my parents and siblings. Does it ever get better? How\u2019d you get there? \n\nSorry if this was a mess, I\u2019m kind of in the middle of an anxiety attack and needed to reach out to anyone. \n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m having suicidal thoughts and a way to carry it out, I need some advice.",

I expressed my feelings and told her there was some compatibility issues and she was so loving and supportive we took a break but then we started things up again and I don't know what happened I just couldn't do it. I just stopped talking to her. hate myself for it every day. But I know she deserves better and I hope shes happy. Then my parents got divorced. They argued a lot so I guess it wasn't a shocker. I like to think Im taking it fine but it certainly didn't help. Didn't help either that my dad met a girl pretty soon after and she ended up moving in with us along with her daughter, another roomate and two dogs and they have a very different life style than I'm used to so it hasn't been very fun. Although they are genuinely decent people. I don't know why that matters or even if anyone has read this far it's probably just a bunch of ranting and spelling mistakes. But that's pretty much it I guess. I don't enjoy practically anything, I'm generally just a peice of shit to people, my grades are fucking shit because I hate school and don't see the point in it especially since I don't enjoy it. I shut everyone out if they try to help me or just talk and I don't know why, I ruined the best thing that will probably ever happen to me and I don't know, I just can't seem to win.

        "original": "I've had a hard life and it seems like it's been a struggle to get even here (37). Divorced 3 years ago from someone I had 2 children with. She uses them on me every chance she can to remind me (from another state) that she and them (3yrs old & 8) to remind me that I'm not considered family and they don't need me. I pay my child support but none of that matters. She makes sure it's a constant feeling of my redundancy. I try to stay connected via skype (they're in a different state 17 hours away).\n\n Met someone 3 years ago who I shared so much in common with. She helped me quit drinking and I helped her quit taking so many damn pills. I was a raging alcoholic but managed to mostly overcome that and become a licensed cosmetologist. Over those 3 years, something crazy happened and I don't know when - shit got physical. I remember the first day she hit me - her massive key chain right before she ripped some headphones from my head and snapped them in half. She's diagnosed Bi-Polar and her mood changes from moment to moment. I believe I have an undiagnosed similar diagnosis, I've tried anti-depressants and all they did was make me feel so much less that the cure was worse than the disease.\n\nSince that first day, it's been a mixed ride. I originally met her when I was traveling with the intention of ending my own life after seeing family I hadn't seen in a long time. I wanted to go see some places I had never seen and was determined to figure out if I could make life worth living. I've always been sad and thought maybe changing my environment would make things different for me. I am financially secure, we have a good life. House, dog, so many things that others don't. \n\nI used to be involved with traffickers that moved pretty serious weight. It never seemed an odd way to live because that's what life had been for me for some time, even before I got married. I cut off all ties and left California to a Midwestern state. I eventually moved to the state and city she was from and got better slowly.\n\nI have a very strong policy of never going through my partner's phone and respect privacy but shortly before Xmas I found some messages between her and her ex, talking about meeting up. I thought, no way. There's no way that the one person I really trusted would do something like that to me. I've never had a situation like this. Her justification is that since they never really met up (allegedly), she did nothing wrong. I disagree. The night I found out I went and got incredibly drunk with a firearm on me intending to get up the courage to just do it that night. Incredibly, a friend from an entirely different state was at the same busy sketchy ass bar. We got to talking and she eventually got it out of me, my intentions. She took my piece and I told my fiance about the situation. She was rightfully scared and stood by her story that they never met, despite the intentions shown in the messages. It broke my heart and I feel like I put too much trust in someone because people are unintentionally predictable when it comes to their motives, ultimately. \n\nShe claims that I came home from that bar that night and said some horrible shit to her simply to hurt her. Things got physical when she grabbed me and wouldn't let me go. We've had police at our house and apartment multiple times. I realize that I've turned into a monster and would never want to be the person that I've become. I never stopped thinking about suicide. I think about it every day and had attempted it twice at a young age. I've had and seen so much trauma that I've gotten therapists that are surprised that I'm as put together as I am, despite this trauma. I was molested as a youngster. I never really got over that. I once considered putting this man in the south dirt as when I reported the abuse as a 30 year old, I was told that the statute of limitations and the fact there was never penetration (I was 6 or 7) that it was only lewd conduct, not molestation. I had a plan and the resources to kill this man that hurt me so terribly. I ended up realizing hate like that was like a poison that only affected me, not him. Clipping him would only make me as bad or worse than he was. \n\nI do my best not to remember the way I grew up, how little we had, how much violence and shit I was exposed to. I have problems with anger, with depression, with trust, I used to cope with alcohol but now all I do is shut down. I've tried so hard to change but my fiance's work has pulled her to the side and has demanded that she go to the Women's Shelter Center and report me and leave me. I don't like physical contact when I'm in a heated argument, I simply don't like being touched so I push whoever is on me away. I don't ball my fists or seek to hurt anyone but I'm a big guy and that makes it too easy to push someone too hard. \n\nThe point is this - I got out of the drug business, I quit drinking, I graduated a cosmetology school with a degree, 2200 hours in 16 months while working at the same time, and shit has never gotten better. I am tired of feeling this way. I will wait for her to go to work tomorrow morning, I'll fix the front end of my truck that I damaged last week, I'll try and skype with my kids and see if they want to talk for a moment, then I'll take my pistol and shoot myself in the chest so the funeral will be open casket at least. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I've tried everything I know to be a better person but I always end up hurt or hurting someone else. I don't want to live like this anymore. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this was a long read and it's probably too long to read and care anyway. I used to post here to help other people who felt the way I did, I certainly know how it feels. Wanna tell you guys and the rest of the world that I think it's selfish of them to want to keep me around when I hurt so much all the time. It never stops and the thoughts never leave my mind, I hope you fuckers aren't too sad; you all know I love you. My kids - I know your mother will know how to take care of you better than I ever could. I hope one day you understand that I wasn't always a terrible person, or at least not all the time. \n\nThanks for hearing my disjointed thoughts and what I think is my best plan of action tomorrow. Let's fix this stupid truck, let my dog know how much I love her, and take it easy for awhile.",

        "original": "I have almost killed myself two times now (btw I\u2019m 15 and a male if that helps anybody understand this). Noose tied around my neck other end tied around the ceiling fan, the whole nine yards. Everytime I tempt it I feel like I know I\u2019m gonna do it, but I stop myself everytime. The first time was the 3rd of this month, for a little context my whole family and just generally a lot of people I have cared about have been destroyed by alcoholism, and on that day I found out my girlfriend (not really since we\u2019re not labeling it but for convenience sake I\u2019m just putting it there) was drinking at a sleepover she was at with a bunch of friends. Just earlier that day we had hung out, cuddled on my couch and she nearly fell asleep on my chest while listening to one of my favorite bands after we just binged one of our favorite shows, this was amazing maybe the happiest I\u2019ve ever felt. Just a few hours I get the text saying that she had been drinking and my heart immediately sunk. I started having a panic attack, hit my funny bone nerve on the corner of a table while pacing frantically around my kitchen table with my hands combing through my hair. I just started bawling. She\u2019s one of the last things in my life I care about and I felt like this curse that\u2019s followed me through every year of my life was gonna take her too. So I took a match and burned myself (my preferred method of self harm) and I didn\u2019t exactly calm down but i was distracted. I kept texting her through the night, as I fucking love her and wanted to make sure she was ok and that she didn\u2019t do anything dumb while tipsy. We were texting and I asked what she drank and it was fucking WHISKEY. Like come on you couldn\u2019t have been a normal teenage girl and drank a fucking white claw or something less potent. I was texting my best friends the whole time about my panicking and what was going on. I needed to be high or something to calm down but couldn\u2019t. I pretty much started having a massive existential crisis about how my life has spiraled to this point. I\u2019m probably underselling honestly I don\u2019t think the severity of the echoes of pain rattling throughout my brain really come off in writing, but they were really fucking horrible. I just couldn\u2019t take it. So I took off my belt, tied it around my neck, stood upon my piano bench, tied the other end around the fan and was prepared to hang myself. The knot on the fan wouldn\u2019t really hold and kept sliding which is honestly probably the reason I didn\u2019t go through with it, I guess i just kinda took it as a sign. I laid on the floor my neck still slightly in pain, and cried. Somehow, I just kept going the next day only told my two best friends what had happened around 24 hours later to the dot as it kept fucking with my head. I didn\u2019t tell my girlfriend as I didn\u2019t want to worry her and honestly would you stay with someone you thought could be a danger to themselves, obviously not. I didn\u2019t do anything for the rest of winter break, i self harmed like one more time but I just felt off the rest of break. Today was my first day of being back to school, and I just felt like I was living a lie. The world around me doesn\u2019t know that I almost fucking killed myself a few days before, and obviously I\u2019m not get on a soapbox and scream my message to the masses so that I don\u2019t feel alone, it just feels weird how my life could be so unimportant to 99% of the people around me. I got to see my girlfriend, hang out with her after school, hold her hand and laugh, feel good ya know? But I got home and i was alone again, my whole family\u2019s puking their brains out with some virus except me, so I\u2019m just sitting on the couch contemplating my insufferable thoughts that I dwell on over and over again, from \u201cshe doesn\u2019t like me she hates me how could she like me I don\u2019t deserve that\u201d to \u201cmy life is fucking useless why did the cosmos put this meaningful yet damaged consciousness into this malfunctioning meat suit we call a body\u201d. I tried again right after we texted our \u201cgoodnight <3\u201d texts. I knew I was alone again, accompanied by my cat sitting  silently on top of my math homework laid out on the couch, my sister in the room above me peacefully asleep, a crackling vinyl of Colter Wall as a possible final lullaby, I took my belt and the stool again and got prepared. This time was different though, I knew I wasn\u2019t going to actually go through with it, I bent down a couple of times choking myself slightly just to feel the sensation of pain, but in the end I just sat back on the couch and finished my seventh rewatch of Master of None. My life is amazingly insignificant and spectacularly boring because of its normality. I think I don\u2019t want to live because I don\u2019t know what it means to live. This was way too fucking long but, I guess I\u2019ll see y\u2019all tomorrow won\u2019t I.",

Sometimes I wrap a belt around my neck just to see how it would feel and lately it doesn\u2019t seem so scary.\n\nI know very very deep down I don\u2019t really want to die but at this point I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that could help me. I\u2019ve been on a ton of different meds and have had different types of therapies but nothing has worked despite me being very disciplined with my care plan. I\u2019ve inquired with specialists about TMS and ECT but my psychiatrist doesn\u2019t think they\u2019d work for me. She wants me to try EMDR because my depression likely stems from a sexual assault, but the research on EMDR that I\u2019ve read makes it seem like it\u2019s not more effective than meds or getting zapped a little. Besides it will be a while before she could do EMDR with me and I don\u2019t really have a lot of time left to fuck around with another thing that probably won\u2019t work. \n\nAnyways I don\u2019t think my mental health care providers understand the depth to which I\u2019m suicidal. I want to tell them the truth because I really just want to stop being in so much pain and would like to find relief outside of death. But I can\u2019t be hospitalized. Despite recently getting a college degree I can\u2019t hold down a job. I just started a part time minimum wage barista job and I can\u2019t even afford my meds, treatments, or rent on my salary and if I lose my job due to hospitalization I\u2019ll definitely kill myself. I guess I really don\u2019t know what to do, but I don\u2019t see a lot of hope for me.\n\nTLDR: Exactly at what point will a therapist or doctor push to voluntarily commit or involuntarily hospitalize me if I express my suicidal urges/thoughts?",

Which may not sound that bad but the lips develop into these gross thick orange scabs sitting on your lips.

I am soon to travel to London for some uni interviews and I am so scared of what they will think when they see me with thick orange pieces hanging from my mouth.

She was defiantly out of it but then I heard them go on for what seems like forever she was having so much fun I could hear her giggling, moaning, telling him shes on the pill. I hung up after about 10 minutes, I sat around for a while until I got a friend request from one of the people out with her.

Honestly speaking, you may or may not read this since it is nothing but some random emo shit from a cheesy 16 year old like me.\n\nWhen i was smaller, I used to read about a lot of stuff about famous scientists, inventors, discoveries, etc. So naturally, I wanted to become like them, one of them. Till when i was 10 years old, i believed that i could do it, funnily. Obviously, i was that wannabe genius, that guy in class who brags about stuff he just found out, and which he didn't really  understand. Cool stuff about time, space, and galaxies. Oh yeah, i had a huge inclination towards the cosmos. I wanted to unravel every mystery there lay in the universe, the mystery of the universe itself, what lies beyond what we see; you get the picture. \n\nIt is because of that I started doing things that would make me smarter, because i felt, and still feel, that it's an absolute necessity for my \"dreams\". I learnt to play chess, sudoku and other games that i could exercise my mind on. I was not born gifted. I did not have an exceptional IQ and i still believe i don't ( yeah, i've taken online exams but i don't trust them). When i reached the age of 12, i realized my \"dreams\" are really just dreams. I looked at my family, my dad, my uncles, everyone. Most people aim to be different, and i'm the same. But in the end, everyone just ends up getting a stupid meaningless job, becomes a mere salaryman and provides for kids who would grow up to hate them. I understood, little by little, that only the gifted are allowed to pursue such ambitions like mine. That's when i gave up. My brother, who is briliant in terms of intelligence and creativity, often scolded me because i could not do stuff properly. I fumbled, was callous. He called me (and still does, occasionally) a retarded idiot, a fool, an absolute good-for-nothing. As days went by, i realized that i was actually an idiot. I can't do simple stuff like finding something. I developed an inferiority complex and convinced myself that i am inferior to most people. \n\nWhenever I had to go out somewhere, for example, a wedding ceremony, any social gathering, or had some kind of a test, I got very nervous and felt like throwing up. And i did. But now, it's worse. I feel like throwing up literally whenever i have even the most trivial of tests and sometimes even in the absence of any. Maybe i don't need to step foot outside my house, but i still vomit. It is becoming harder for me to go about my daily life with this. My friends say i need a therapist but i have a very strict and orthodox family. They deny i have any sort of need to go see a therapist. Sometimes when my mom and dad go out for work, i just switch off my lights and go to sleep, because i feel sleepy most of the time. I don't want to get up, but i have to, for fear of my parents coming back and finding out i haven't been studying. I have to study for the entire day with minor gaps, and i am not allowed to go out with friends. \n\nThat's it, i guess. Sorry i wasted your time, but it's not like i forced you anyway :) In the end we'd all just grow up to become random people in a randomized world, where nothing stays. I didn't want to be like that. I wanted to be different, to show the world i am not the fucking piece of useless shit i seem to be. But hey, i suppose i am that useless piece of shit. \n\nAstrophysics lmao, i cant even solve 10th grade math properly.",

I truly do feel remorse for the things I\u2019ve done but no one will ever believe it because I\u2019m just a boy who cried wolf time and time again.\n\nI have no one to relate to and I\u2019ve given up on making that connection.

It\u2019s just a matter of time at this point.\n\nThe anti-intellectualism and hatred for our neighbor in this world has driven me to such a nihilistic view that I know I\u2019d be less happy if I live past 30.

She convinced her therapist that she isn't suicidal however, she still is. I talked to my school counselor three times already and nothing has seemed to improve. He recommended to her parents that she take antidepressants, and even my girlfriend agrees that could be one of the only things to help her however, her parents declined due to family history in depression. They thought it would make it worse. Her mom offered the idea of family counseling, but it was later put off. She is also afraid of her dad. There was an instance where she fell asleep with her laptop on and her dad walked in the room and started yelling at her and slammed the laptop on the bedframe. The next day he acted like everything was normal. All aspects of her life are controlled by her mother specifically, which makes her feel like she has no control over anything she does. I believe she wants to be free of their control. She is also very stressed about school and her parents keep pushing her to do school work. She gets very stressed about her school work and gets overwhelmed with homework. Over the last couple of months, she has gotten very suicidal and I witnessed her cutting her wrists. She eventually stopped cutting, but a couple of weeks ago, she tried drowning herself in a bucket. It's gotten even worse recently. \n\nI'm very worried about her and want to help her.

        "original": "I have BPD. As of 9 months ago, it's been really bad. In my childhood I experienced a lot trauma, watching my mom get beat, getting beat and sexually molested myself. I think I got my BPD very early in my childhood, but I never sought help. I've always had suicidal thoughts, ever since I was in elementary school, I would take my mom's pills and try to OD on them. Except it wasn't enough to kill me, I would just be drowsy all day. My mom thought I would get like this because I ate too much chocolate. So I started using her pills as an escape to numb the pain. And then skip around to my 20s, I never really attempted until I met my ex fiance... I started overdosing but it wasn't because I actually wanted to die, it was because I wanted to punish the person who upset me and to numb the pain. Skip ahead 5 years later, I end up leaving my ex fiance (who was an amazing person, super kind and committed to me). I left him to be with another man, my crush since my undergraduate studies. He confessed his love for me a couple years before I left my ex-fiance so I kept in touch with him, behind my ex-fiance's back. After I left my ex-fiance to be with this guy, let's call him Jay. Me and Jay fell sooo deeply in love. It was amazing, he was so affirming and the sex was amazing. I felt so good. Except then a month after my breakup from my ex-fiance I end up really grieving him. I realized I lost a man who really cared about me. I reached out to my ex-fiance to get him back but he was so angry at me. He refused to (I can't blame him). And so I end up overdosing this past April 2019, I took a whole bunch of my sister's anxiety meds, including atavan. My sister finds me in her house completely out of it and I'm rush to the hospital. I ended up serotonin syndrome. I end up staying in the hospital for a month. I come out of the hospital convinced that I had to live with Jay over in Vancouver or else I would continue overdosing. But this is when it got really bad. I move a province over to be with Jay in Vancouver. I start to feel really depressed and tearful. I started grieving my ex-fiance sooo much. As a result I took Jay for-granted. I always compared him to my ex-fiance with whom now looking back I had a very unhealthy dynamic with. That unhealthy dynamic moved to be present in my relationship with Jay. I was demanding all his time, isolating him from his friends and I constantly threatened suicide. I would push him. And I would yell and scream when things wouldn't go my way. I am extremely ashamed of how I acted in that relationship. Looking back, I just get the goosebumps thinking about how I behaved. I remember feeling like my suicidal thoughts became real ever since I moved to Vancouver. I start to feel like I seriously had to die. So my suicide attempts got more serious. I found myself on the dark web looking for fentanyl. But I never trusted anyone on those sites. In November I found myself driving to hastings looking for heroin. I buy heroin and try overdosing on evening. But it wasn't enough to kill me. Jay finds me in the living room smoking it and walks me to the hospital immediately. I get admitted into the psych ward for a couple of days and then I'm released, thinking that I had changed and that I was going to be better. Fast forward to December 3rd and the suicidal thoughts are more intense than ever. I end up going back to hastings and finding a dealer who sold me some really strong heroin. I planned to inject this time. I ended up booking a hotel for the night so I could just OD there, I was worried Jay would come home and take me to the hospital and try to revive me. So I end up injecting that evening. I wake-up completely out of it the next day, and I just remember see Jay sitting right there beside me, crying. At that point I didn't realize what had happened.  It turns out I got heroin-induced myelopathy. My nerves, spinal cord and muscles were affected. So now I'm in the hospital and I can't walk at all. I just can't feel my feet and my muscles are very weak in my leg area. On december 27th, Jay comes home from Edmonton and he breaks up with me. He confessed our relationship dynamic to his family, and he decided it was best that we break up. He made it clear he never wanted to be romantically involved with me. That really broke my heart. And still today, I try to convince him I've changed, and this isn't some vicious cycle of abuse. I am still hopeful he will come back into my life romantically, even though he's been very clear he never wants to be involved with me romantically. I am in denial. I am hopeful I will walk again. And that I can be a functional human being. I just miss Jay so much. I just remember the good times and wish we could go back to those moments. I know I should be focusing on my rehab but it's so hard to be without him in my life anymore. Anyways, that's how BPD and depression fucked up my life. I am great at pushing people away...

        "original": "I (16M) apologize for the really long post, but I hope someone is willing to read it. \n\nAs a kids, I always had good grades in school and always tried my best to be nice to people but I grew up in a very dysfunctional home and got abused, neglected and sexually harassed as a kid. \nOverime, my family becomes a bit more functional around the time I enter middle school but it was still definitely very dysfunctional. I started to repress most of the pain I experienced as a child and once again focus on school. I tried my best to do the right things and started to develop a lot of passions for things such as math and engineering. During the start of freshman year of high school is when everything fell apart, as a relative kept trying to force me to open up about myself about how I feel and about  everything that happened. I repeatedly told them I genuinely don't want to, as it's very uncomfortable for me. They make me feel very guilty for saying this and say that I'm a horrible person for refusing to talk this, despite it being something that they had no right knowing. I'm already stressed enough as it is because my life is still very painful. They keep guilting me until over time, I start to feel guilty and tell them a lot of things, causing me to relapse and I no longer feel comfortable talking to anyone. I've become severely emotionally numb as  a result and lose a genuinely large amount of sanity and start believing things that people keep telling me are insane. I've also lost my sense of humor, personality, my ability to understand people and interact with them, the capability to trust anyone, all passions and motivations, my ability to function, and a lot more. I got bullied a lot and my grades went down because of the state I was in. I completely stopped going outside with exception to school and I no longer have  any real friends, only people that hang out with me out of pity because they can tell I'm a sad person despite me telling them anything that happened. Don't get me wrong, I know they're trying but I feel like a burden on them which is evident considering that I never get invited anywhere. Ive also become a worse person with no morals or conscious. Teachers also unironically don't notice my presence. One even thought I skipped class even though I was right in front of him. I feel like no one is proud of me and completely alone. I have undoubtabley completely wasted the last 3-4 years and I doubt a good college will accept me. In fact, I may not graduate on time. The worst part is when entered high school, my first thought was how I wanted my teachers to be proud of me, to be more mature but still have friends and be disciplined, and to get a math and engineering degree, to learn a form of martial arts and better myself and a lot more. Instead, I've gotten no where near close to any of those goals and have become so emotionally numb that I don't care about those goals or anything anymore. I've genuinely given up and at this rate, I don't want friends anymore, I just want to be alone. I don't know what to do anymore, and as I've already stated, I don't trust anyone, including myself.\n\nEdit: Spelling error and included age and gender.",

I really just want to be dead but I absolutely dont have the balls to do it. \n\nit really sucks being bipolar. I hate it. i hate that i know that i wont ever feel normal. no one really believes I'm bipolar because I avoid people when I'm feeling bad or make jokes so no one can ever tell. I wish I could be manic all the time bc being depressed sucks. I'm on prozac and lamictal and they stopped working. I'm sad that I found something that worked after playing test Guinea pig for months, then it stops working. I have no money bc I told myself that I was going to go to japan bc that was on my bucket list and then kill myself afterwards. of course, I wasnt ballsy enough so that just left me broke. and when I was gone, my gf at the time packed all of her stuff and moved without telling me so when I got back home, I was lonely as hell and had to adjust to the US again at the same time. I'm so bad at spending money and I have a ton of credit card debt so that's fun.\n\n\n\ncollege sucks bc I lost my scholarships bc my mental health went in the toilet and I failed classes so now I gotta pay more money that I dont have. I failed my business Japanese class bc I was too depressed to do literally anything and that makes me feel like I'm a disappointment bc I dont work as hard as my classmates and the teacher probably thinks I'm an idiot. I want to go back to school tho bc im really lonely because I cut off a lot of my friends not from school and the ones I didnt cut off are always busy. I miss being around groups of people because I would get so much attention for being manic bc I'm funny and energetic. \n\nfor some reason I quit a job I loved randomly (a dog rescue, what's better than being paid for hanging out with dogs) then went back to my old fast food job because i missed working at a fast pace. i guess i like stress. \n\nthe icing on the cake is it really sucks being gay in the south because the dating pool is complete garbage and everytime i meet a girl, she ends up hurting me really badly. first you've heard of \"men ain't shit\" but get ready for \"women ain't shit either\" i hate that im clingy and I hate that I care too much and I cant find the right person who thinks I'm right for them. I used to be really toxic and would threaten suicide to my past relationships and I feel guilty about it even though ive learned how to control myself and not do that. im so bad at being single bc I crave attention. i just need an emotional support human bc I suck at being alone with my own thoughts. I dont want to talk about my feelings, I want to stay busy so I cant think. I got promoted to single last night because she got bored with me. \n\nhell, I dont even know how to act normally in almost any situation bc my parents put me through so much trauma with their alcoholism when I was a kid. i was always terrified of my dad bc both him and my mom were very angry drunks. my dad killed himself a week before I turned 18 and I have so many feelings towards that. I'm tired of emotional abuse from my mom, I moved back into my moms house, not the smartest move. I always feel guilty because of her and i'm tired of feeling alone in the world and I'm tired of not being able to talk to anyone.

I really thought I'd be dead by 16 when I was younger, then I made it to 16 and thought I was gonna be dead before high school ended. then I thought I was gonna be dead before 21. now I'm 22 and I just dont know anymore. I just want to be done with this life. \n\nI just dont understand why I feel so crazy when I live a life that people would be happy with having.\n\nI cant even summarize this because this was just me typing bc my brains going 100 mph in a 40 mph zone.  this post is probably the most messy thing to exist oops.\n\nno ones gonna read this but I had to get it off my chest if anyones still here at this point you deserve like a trophy or something.",

I do have people who would be devastated if I died, so I would never off myself.. but man.. only existing for other people is truly exhausting.\n\nI reached out, I'm \"getting help\". \nIt has been, and is a long road of telling my life story and troubles to strangers, over and over again.. \n\nBeing an adult, 28 years old.. there's bills to pay, appearances to keep up and etc.. but man if you struggle to even eat, take medicine as scheduled.  It becomes hell.. or as I would describe it, live in limbo.. Answering the phone, opening the mailbox, small tasks.. when did it all become too scary to do? \nThe \"it gets better\", \"you'll pull through it\" etc. and all the self insight I possess falls on deaf ears.\nWhen someone asks \"how are you?\", I feel the brave face I put on disintegrate, and a need to flee appear.\n\nMy dreams are my refuge, but also a prison.. it passes time, and my dreams are always lucid, I ignore the world outside, even though I know it isnt healthy for me. \n\nSo many people with advice to get better, but too drained of energy to follow any, and a voice in the back of my head whispering \"why bother?\". If you dont remember what happy feels like, its hard to look forward to it. \n\nI would love to work with children, try to prevent as many children as I can to go through what I have gone through. \nI got into my dream study, but due to depression i had to drop out. I found out at 26 that I have ADHD, which provided me with some answers to some of my struggles.. \n *Cue traumatic childhood story*\nMentally and physically abusive mother, who always told me I would never amount to anything, and my achievements were never enough.. sick and absent father, though today he is one the few closest people I have. I was called dumb and lazy even by my teachers, even though I wasnt a troublemaker, I was just troubled, with unnoticed mental illness.. unnoticed and invisible was the norm for me.

But of course, her life, as well those of the other people who care about me, cant go on pause just because mine did. \n\nLoneliness is crippling, and company is draining..\nI solely get out of bed if my cat won't let me sleep and needs care. If someone is worried about me I resurface just long enough for them to know I'm still alive. \n\nOne time a therapist asked me when the last time I was happy was.. in my struggle to remember.. I realized I couldn't even recall or explain the feeling .. \"happy\"..\n\nMy goal is a long term goal.. I think it will be a lifelong war with my brain.\nI want to get to a place where I want to get better.. where I can put to words what \"better\" even means to me. \n\nI am at my lowest, though in my experience it can always get worse, and it usually does. \n\nLetting this out, letting myself admit that I dont want to live, let me cry, im sad, and these days, any feeling other than numb is welcome.\n\n\nHold onto feelings, write down things that made you smile, blowing just a little extra air out of your nose.. hell, even sadness is a respite from numbness.",

I have 3 little girls and an incredible wife. I am doing nothing but destroying them with my anger and self hatred. My life was meth, homelessness, physical and mental abuse. Because of that I have grown so bitter and angry at the world. I can\u2019t remember the last time someone looked at me as a human. My wife even called me a narcissistic asshole the other day... 2 of my kids are the product of my wife\u2019s ex husband who thought it was ok to rape her. Her family shows more hate to me then him. She is constantly being told she should leave me by her family, coworkers, my job, my family, and even her friend. I truly love her and for that reason is why I\u2019m going to literally blow my head off. I thought that since I live in the mountains I could hike for a week until I find a nice pretty spot then pull the trigger. Then I will get to see my mom again. My youngest daughter who is mine by blood is young enough to forget me so soon is the best option. Do you guys think a sawed off shotgun will work? I just truly don\u2019t want to suffer if possible.

She was a fantastic old lady who always looked after herself last. What i would give to have her back.\n\n2019 was the year i graduated highschool i was a b to c average student with a very short attention span and only a want to learn what i found interesting, because of my lack of knowing i dropped a math class that i would later need to go into computer science and now have to do academic upgrading just to get the credit and i need a tutor on top of it for my small understanding of math. Because of my little knowledge of what i needed to do to get to where i wanted this proved to be a cesspool of stress and anger. With no school i feel lost. \n\nLater in the summer i found a job for the first time in my life and worked hard at what i did sadly to company standards this wasnt enough. Soon i would find myself getting no hours when i should've had many and later fired from that job with someone who did the job better or faster.\n\nSoon after my recent firing my sister who was near and dear to my heart passed away from a broken neck at about 4:30am while she was packing her things up to go to her boyfriends when she suddenly tripped on her deformed ankle from all of the fostbitten Canadian nights she had from abusing drugs and multiple suicide attempts. After my father awoke he found my sister's corpse laying on the ground with my dogs whining for her to get up. When i heard the news i didnt know how to feel for about 2 weeks but it was there in the back of my mind haunting and lurking over me well over the time to cry and during the whole trip i was supposed to be on. When i got back home i had a shower to clean up when half way through shaving i bust into tears with my face bleeding from the razor, soon after my voice was gone from all the sobbing.\n\nWhen i was young my father and mother separated each getting a child so no one had to pay child support. This turned my mother money hungey after my older sister left my fathers to live on her own. I was no longer her child but yet more of a money found each month. My father makes much less money than my mother.\n\nToday i got a ticket for for speeding after trying to pass some one on the highway and an extra penalty for not being able to find my license which is a temporary one till my new one comes but in my forgetfulness it totally slipped my mind that i didnt have a full one yet. Every one i talk to says its not a big deal but to me it is since i dont have a job to pay it. \n\nThere are more stories but im thinking that i might need to ask for help because they are too much...",

But today, after school, I plan to binge and eat from many restaurants, as much as possible, with or without my friends. And then after that, I will continue on, and jump from a bridge, this time, with no fear of pain or hesitation. I don't want to be that much of a cruel person, so I would like to leave this message, and that in any hopes that one of my family members or friends find it, it will hopefully give them closure because I don't want to die with them blaming themselves over me; at least, assuming they care enough or love me enough to do that.\n\nFirst, I start of with my friends. To all the people I have befriended in general, thank you for all the good memories and experiences I have spent with all of you. Because of that, I was able to experience shit I never knew I'd ever have the opportunity of experiencing; to be honest, I never really expected that I'd live that long. But even just for a moment, you made this life of mine bearable, and I will forever be thankful that I knew you.\n\nTo Kaisa, Danielle, Bernadine, Lindsey and Shaun, I've personally written out a letter for each of you individually, it is bookmarked on my laptop and I hope that my parents will send it to you at some point. If not, know that I care about you all very much, and that I have done this out of my own will, and nobody could've prevented this, except for me. I know that all of you are experiencing troubles of your own so please, for the sake of me at least, get help, as my last wish was that none of you will ever become or turn out like me.\n\nFinally, to my family members. I know that its my fault po, hindi po ako tanga. Alam ko naman po that I'm not an ideal daughter, and that I have made so many mistakes against all of you. But at least now, I want to say what I have been wanting you to understand, and know that I haven't killed myself because I hate you, namatay ako dahil ayoko na po sa sarili ko. I don't eat sometimes with you guys because I feel out of place; pakiramdam ko po minsan na hindi dapat ako nandoon, that I'm not part of your family. Plus, it's hard to eat with someone who dislikes you. Also, I feel ashamed for being 'sick' like this, and eating makes me feel like I'm mooching off of you guys, people who have done a bunch of things for me, but I haven't given anything back except for this stupid thing that I have. I don't clean my bedroom because I am lazy, but also because I feel hopeless, that there's no point of doing anything if I'm a useless person who can't do anything right; pakiramdam ko na palpak ako lagi. I don't take baths or get out of bed because of the same reason above, and along with that, I skip eating because I often feel the need to punish myself for being a bad person. Yes, I know that I am a bad person. I may hold many grudges against all of you, but I know that most of what happened is on me. I don't sleep because I am afraid. I always have good dreams, most of the time. Then I have to wake up, and realize that I'm stuck as myself, and that I am a complete opposite of what I want myself to be.\n\nMama, I have been in pain for a long time now. And if I killed myself, it is not because of you or Daddy Lau, it's because of me. I want both of you to know that my suicidal tendencies were not because of you, I didn't hate you or resented you. Yes, I was mad at times, and yes I held a grudge towards Daddy Lau, but I never hated any of you. I hated myself po, that I could never get better, that I could never be a good daughter, or a good person. I didn't like myself because I always felt like a terrible person, friendless, and I never got to be good enough to my standards; what my younger self always imagined me to be. Smart, on the honour roll, kind, and responsible; all of those things I wanted to be, I was not, and I never could get rid of the hurt and disappointment that came along with it. I have always wanted to make the both of you proud. But I couldn't do that. I stopped going to school because I felt worthless and stupid when I was there, that I would never be able to be intelligent, or capable, or responsible. That I would never live up to what I expected of me. That's why I stopped caring about school, because I fear that if I tried hard, I would fail regardless, and I was afraid of being disappointed again. It was never out of laziness, I was afraid of facing what I feared, and seeing everyone live around me go to school regularly, and though they're not succeeding, still continue on with their life.\n\nDaddy Lau, I know we misunderstood each other a lot. I don't hate you, I'm just mad at you, because I felt that you always acted like you knew and understood everything about me. Sometimes, you make such quick judgements, and say negative things about me, and it only makes me hate myself more. But that's not on you, I know it was out of anger and people say things they don't mean when they're angry. I won't lie; how you viewed me really affected the way I looked at myself, but I know that you are struggling too, sana po makahanap ka ng tulong para hindi mo na kailangan i-shoulder lahat ng galit and stress sa sarili nyo po.  Daddy, I'm sorry for being a bad daughter. I've always wanted to tell you that, but I was too prideful to say sorry for the hurt I caused  you. I never hated you po. I always knew you wanted the best for me, and that you don't want me to live like you're living now. Pero daddy, I'm so exhausted na. If I acted angry, or lazy or anything you perceived as bad that you thought was because of rebellion, I promise you po that it wasn't that. I really don't like myself, and I always thought that I wasn't good enough to live. That's why I killed myself. It was never because of you or mama, so please don't think that. Please know that I cared a lot about you, kahit galit po ako sayo.\n\nMama pipa, I dislike you a lot. You always centered everything around yourself, and only your value and opinions were the good ones. But I respect you. We may not have been on best terms, and you may have caused a lot of the emotional baggage I carry, but I know that you're going through your own things, and I know that you did try your best to be kind towards me; although I've always felt like you faked that. To be honest, I resented you the most because you barely showed kindness towards me when I was younger, and all that I could remember were all the unkind words you've said, and how you punish the 10 year old me, and made me feel miserable for not being a servant towards you. No I'm not sorry for saying my opinion towards you, but I am sorry that I hurt your feelings. Know that your actions and words done without consideration hurts others, and blatantly controlling and being angry about somebody else's way of life will only make you more frustrated and in a bad mood. All I'm saying is that, the more you continue on like that (I'm not sure if you know how everybody else views you, but I'm saying that many resent you), the more you will remain alone and disliked for the rest of your life. I now hold no grudges towards you, I don't blame this death because of you, but because I respect you and I care for the people around, please be kinder to my siblings and parents, I really hope that they will not hold the same anger I once held towards you.\n\nPip, I'm sorry ate had to leave this way, and that I handing over the task of being the eldest towards you. Alam ko that ate wasn't the kindest towards you, and if I said anything mean, know that I was just angry, and I was a bad person for taking it out on you. Because ate would never want you to end up like me, I don't want you to hold that anger inside you, especially against Daddy Lau. And know to ignore mama pipa, because what she says to you out of anger is not true, and know that I think it's okay to defend yourself if your feelings have been hurt by her. Take care of ayen and poypoy, they will need their kuya now more than ever, because ate was not good enough for them. Wag kang magasar ng masyado, and know that if you're being way too mean to ayen and poypoy, I'm gonna appear as a ghost and haunt you. I want you, ayen and poypoy to have my debit card, I know its not much, but I want to give you guys something, like an advance birthday gift. Also, please give 50 bucks to danielle, because I owe her that money, for all the things shes bought for me.\n\nThat's all. If you are reading this now, I am probably dead. Thank for people who will encourage me not to, but I am sorry, I am no longer able to do this anymore. Thank you. I really did try my best to live.\n\nI am so grateful to have been loved\n\nMama, if you read this, please sign me up as a donor, thank you",

I\u2019ve been suffering from chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome since 13 yo. Firstly I had painful urination for 2 years and then when I was 15 I went to the urologist who diagnosed me with chronic prostatitis. My parents didn\u2019t believe him because in our country there is an advertisements on TV, radio etc about that prostatitis happens after 50 years old. Currently I have constant pain in perineum I can\u2019t normally urinate and also I don\u2019t have properly developed penis. I think it\u2019s associated with my disease. In my whole life I had only one girl she was a virgin and she supported me but recently she left me. Our relationship lasted 7 years. Now I\u2019m alone. I visited plenty of doctors from urologist to psychotherapist etc. Nothing helps me. I tried almost all medicines which you can imagine. I tried to use therawand but my main trigger point is prostate. Last 4 month I\u2019m crying every day I feel depression and constant anxiety. I am desperately looking for a way to commit suicide last 2 month. In our county it\u2019s difficult to get gun. It\u2019ll take maybe 4 months to get all documents to buy a gun.

I don't care if it's a breach of privacy, I'm doing this because I don't want to lose someone.\n\nI have a boyfriend. He's 19 years old, turning 20 in a few months. He's from a country not far away from mine. He's been living in an emotionally-abusive family for many years now; his mom broke up with his dad, she basically despises my boyfriend as a being and doesn't give a **** about what he says or feels. He's been living surrounded by lies from pretty much everyone.\nHe was planning on comitting suicide on his 18th birthday, but before he turned 18, we met online. We started liking each other very fast and we felt close in like under a week. He said that because of my kindness and companionship, he decided not to end his life. But then things went really downhill.\nIn Q2 of 2019, his landlords claimed that my boyfriend's mom hasn't been paying rent and they threatend his family that if they don't pay the rent, they will be thrown out. This really hurt my boyfriend. That was the first major breakdown he had that concerned and worried the hell out of me. He wanted to jump off a really tall bridge which has 0% survival rate for suicidal people. I had to stay up for many hours just to try to calm him down. At some point I got overwhelmed, couldn't do it for any longer and just went to the bathroom and cried for a few minutes. When I came back to my phone, my heart felt defeated, but I somehow managed to convince him to stay for the night.\nThe next day he and his family got kicked out and had their stuff locked away. Fortunately, all of the family members could stay at their friends' house for some time. They found a job; cleaning hotel rooms. It was a decent use of time, so my boyfriend and his mom decided to work there for some time.\nI don't fully remember what was happening during the transition, but his family stayed at his mom's boyfriend's house. They got most of their stuff back.\nMy boyfriend is currently living there. But the biggest struggle he is facing right now is finding a job. He's been sending CVs to God knows how many jobs. Every job offer that let him either fired him within a week or the conditions were so terrible he just couldn't work there for more than a day.\nThe reason I am writing this post is happening as we speak.\nMy boyfriend stated, that he doesn't care neither about jobs nor his family. He stated that on this Friday, he will leave the house, cut off all the possible contact and just disappear. He didn't tell me where he will go, didn't tell me what he will do. He just told me he is going to disappear.\n\nThis is the most stress I've been feeling in years. We've been together for nearly 2 years now, the longest out of the dozen of relationships I've had, and it seems we're gonna get seperated because life decided to bring the worst possible fate on him. I haven't even heard his voice or seen his face. And I bet he doesn't want me to. Why attach himself to me even more right before he kills himself.\n\nI have like a day to help him.

Supposed to be in the best years of my life, but I just feel like a useless loser. \n\nI guess I have two people who I consider to be my friends. Whenever I tell them \u201cI love you\u201d, they only ever reply by thanking me. Nobody besides my mother ever tells me they love me. I\u2019ve known them since I was a child; well over a decade. These past two years, they\u2019ve stopped asking to attend NYE parties. I just feel so... sad bringing in the new year alone, sat on my couch crying at midnight as I see them together on social media, having a good time. The problem is me though, I know it is because I made a new friend about 4 years ago and I completely drove her away. I\u2019m the common denominator; people don\u2019t just dislike me for no reason. I wish I could apologise to her.\n\nI\u2019m disabled and I get out the house maximum once a week. I don\u2019t know why I bother though, because I have to use a walking aid and I get so many stares/nasty comments. I was in college, but they told me to take a year away from education because I wasn\u2019t making it to class or turning in assignments due to my disability. So I just sit in my house, all day every day in huge amounts of pain, emotionally and physically. Mental and physical illness is a lot to deal with.\n\nI just don\u2019t want to go on. I serve literally no purpose. I have achieved nothing. When I was in school, this one girl bullied me - this time, I admit that I was not the cause. It was completely unprovoked. She told me to start self harming because I was so fat, ugly and disliked - I did. It hasn\u2019t stopped since then, and that was when I was 13. The thing is though, I sometimes see people on social media etc talking about how their high school bully ended up doing badly later in life - karma, if you will. I wouldn\u2019t want my school bully to do badly; I think a 13 year old who bullies someone to that degree and says such disturbing things is most likely going through something unpleasant themselves, and deserves compassion. With that being said, the girl who caused me to begin self harming is thriving. She is beautiful, wealthy, surrounded by people who love her and successful academically and in her career. It\u2019s almost like the universe rewards people who are cruel to me. I think I understand. There\u2019s a lot to be cruel about.\n\nI just can\u2019t do it. There\u2019s so much more I could write about. I was sxually assaulted as a kid. R*ped as an adult by a \u2018boyfriend\u2019. I think about these things daily and don\u2019t know how to make it stop. I\u2019ve received so much therapy and antidepressants; they don\u2019t help. I do have a mother that loves me very much, and I\u2019m eternally grateful to her. I don\u2019t want to kill myself because it would break her heart, and I love her so much - but I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nSorry for the rant. Nobody has to reply to this, I just wanted to get it all out. Sorry. Btw, I know that a lot of people have it worse than me... makes me feel sick to see myself whining like this. Sorry.",

My aunts youngest daughter is her princess. She treats her with kindness and love. Her older daughter she loves just as much and if not more. She often goes out to lunch with her, buys her things  and brags about her. I try so hard to fit in, I try to make it possible for her to see me as her daughter, I know she never will. I\u2019ve lived here for 10 years almost and I feel singled out everyday. I\u2019m in high-school taking college classes, I\u2019ve never disobeyed her. I never get in trouble. Today I come home from work, I walk in the door and the first thing she does is look me up and down, turn on her flashlight on her phone and say, \u201cYou wore that to work? Those shoes don\u2019t even match.\u201d And she goes on with my uncle saying she doesn\u2019t want her kids to end up like faggots or whatever she said. So I sit there defenseless, feeling like shit. \n\nI have an eating disorder, and have had one since I can remember. I\u2019m constantly skipping meals, and fasting, and weighing myself. The lowest I\u2019ve gotten is 98lbs. She picks on me about my clothes being too big, and makes me feel worse. \n\nMy aunt is also an alcoholic, like my dad was. She hides her vodka under the oven. Sometimes she even takes valium and drinks vodka. One night it got so bad she walked around the house naked, and thought I was a boy. She cut her leg and there was blood dripping all over the house. She does this a lot. When she\u2019s not drinking and abusing her medicine she is shit talking my dad, calling him worthless, an alcoholic and acts like he\u2019s so terrible. (My dad knows he\u2019s an alcoholic and doesn\u2019t take it out on other people like she does) She constantly comes home from work screaming at us. \n\nI have barely any friends, or none that I can talk to. My aunt makes fun of me for that too. I\u2019ve never heard her say anything positive to me since I got out in their custody.\n\nHer daughter is terrible. The other night she stole my dads car and drove to a party, she\u2019s 14. Her daughter treats me so bad, and makes me feel like I don\u2019t belong here. She\u2019s always getting away with everything, and never gets punished.\n\nMy dad is going to die soon I think, he recently got in a car wreck and broke a ton of bones. He was in recovery and began drinking again. He lost a lot of weight.Whenever I facetime him he just makes me cry and weighs all of his problems on me. He always talks about how much he misses my mom when she passed away over 10 years ago. He cries when I call him and he\u2019s always drunk and makes me feel so terrible. He weighs all of his problems on my shoulders. He always says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your daddy won\u2019t hang  himself. They took my guns a away a long time ago.\u201d Why would you say that to me???? \n\nI can\u2019t talk to anybody, they don\u2019t listen to me and my aunt doesn\u2019t think I need a therapist.

He finished and he eventually moved there without me. We \u201cbroke up\u201d in December but were still talking to each other everyday. I made plans to visit him in March. I drove 6 hours to see him, thinking we were going to get back together and I was going to move there. He said he didn\u2019t think it was a good idea for us to get back together. I cried the entire six hours back. Come to find out he had been seeing someone and didn\u2019t tell me. I found out on stupid Facebook where she tagged him as \u201cin a relationship \u201c and listed their anniversary as a couple weeks before I visited. Then she moves in with him 3 months after they started dating (we were together for five years and never lived together\u2014 he lived with family rent free while I worked to pay me rent).

        "original": "I\u2019m too young to have to deal with shit like this. I\u2019m 16 years old, a sophomore in high school. I have a suicidal past that has never left me. I never got help for any of it. Not even my parents know about any of it. My past would take forever to write, I\u2019d have to write a book about it. Right now, I\u2019m dealing with 5 main things.\n\n#1: My girlfriend and I were forced to split up because her parents found out that I was sending her nudes and things like that. It was a long story, they threatened me to court, threatened many things. My girl and I loved each other. She\u2019d tell me she wanted to live with me forever, have a family and die together. I wanted the same but now, it seems impossible. We were secretly dating each other, seeing each other during school. I couldn\u2019t see her any other time, even text her. She promised me many things for \u201cour\u201d future but recently, we officially broke up. The worst feeling is when someone you love starts ghosting you, not even acknowledging that I exist.\n\n#2: I took shrooms recently for the first time. I had a really bad trip. To put it shortly, I experienced ego death (where I lose my identity and put to dream). The whole trip in detail is on another post on my profile called \u201cEGO DEATH EXPERIENCE FROM SHROOMS\u201d (should go check it out, it\u2019s crazy). This shit made me feel worthless and depressed again. The thoughts of suicide come in from time to time but I know that I couldn\u2019t try it again, it will hurt too many people.\n\n#3. Getting kicked off the swim team. I\u2019ve been swimming since I was 6. I got kicked off because I wasn\u2019t showing commitment at all. I started using drugs recently to cope with what I\u2019ve been going through and it\u2019s been making me a lazy twat and feel worthless.\n\n#4. Relationships with my parents and friends keep getting lost for no reason. I have arguments all the time with my parents. It makes me feel worthless and alone all the time. And now that I\u2019m really alone, I feel stuck.\n\n#5. Everyone knows how it is. School fucking sucks. Getting ready for junior year and for my future in education\u2026 it\u2019s stressful as fuck. I\u2019m Asian and everyone expects me to \u201cbe Asian\u201d (like hella smart). But I\u2019m not what anyone expects from me. I\u2019m just a druggie losing friends and family and everyone I care about. I\u2019m just a worthless being that no one really gives a fuck about.\n\nI always feel like I fuck up everything. Like I can\u2019t hold on to anything special. I\u2019ve lost a lot over the years. Like for example yesterday, I almost lost my 800$ platinum necklace my grandma gave me before she died. I lost my girl. I lost so many things. I guess she\u2019s right, I can\u2019t hold on to anything nice. And I regret doing and not doing so many things. So in the past, I thought the only way out of regret was to commit suicide. But now I understand how selfish that action is.\n\nThere are a lot of other little things that are really hard to explain briefly. I don\u2019t know what to do, I know I need help but I feel as if nothing can help me. \n\nFeedback is highly appreciated and feel free to talk to me. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",

I decided to read an article about what to do in this case, but there were stories of people who suddenly decided to buy tickets to Bali or go to a country cottage. \n\nThe incessant sounds of fireworks in the street bothered me more and more. Every minute I realized that I couldn't stay in the room anymore and I needed to do something. I remembered that I had the last 100 rubles ($2) and I decided to buy a bottle of beer with chips and go to the Neva (river in St. Petersburg). Every day I began to think about suicide more often. \n\nI was standing by a wide river, the whole city was lit up with lights, in the distance you could see a big salute, I was almost alone, apparently few people wanted to walk on new year's eve in such a cold and wind. A large petard was blown up nearby, and a shock wave passed through my body. I stood there wondering what I should do with my life. I lost my job, my girlfriend left me, I have no money left, I'm tired of fighting with my OCD, my thoughts have long been no joy. I haven't started a new relationship for a long time, because how can I make someone happy if I can't even make myself happy? When people ask me, \" How are you?\"then I don't know what to say, because nothing good has happened to me for a long time. I just want to write and mix music, but I have to think about how to survive, I can't do it anymore. I've been trying to get a job for months, I can't do anything except mix and create synth music.  \n\nLast night, I unexpectedly received a message from a friend, with whom we did not communicate for almost a year, she said that she was very ill and did not know what to do (she has a serious depression, much more serious than mine I think). I went to talk to her, and she told me that she also planned to commit suicide on new year's eve, but for some reason could not do it. I feel like I'm counting on days.

I've got a wife who loves me, a job I can tolerate going to each week for the next few years of my life, and nothing at all leading me to rock bottom. But I'm tired, I wanted more from life. I feel like I can't accomplish the things that would really bring me joy. There's always something else in my way. I keep fighting to overcome the problems but I can't. And no one can help me but myself. I know I'm depressed, I've been having issues with anger and anxiety because of it, I see a therapist to try and get a reasonable handle on my problems. I personally think I have very defined plans and goals; the first steps to reaching them shouldn't be that hard. There are just so many other responsibilities that keep coming my way, it's like I can't even start. Every time I dumb things down to be more reasonable it's like life takes another shit on my plate. Before things can even get easier something else comes and makes it harder. Like when I got my new job; I make an extra $6 an hour now and I still have nothing left at the end of the week. Get my new job and start saving and the wife's old car finally goes so car payments here we come. What's next? Get a raise so here comes the mortgage I didn't want? Someone gets cancer and medical bills? And this is just one example. I've felt trapped in my own house from all the shit falling apart or my wife's own anxiety, depression, and physical ailments making it hard to keep up with housework so I try to pick up the slack. I'd ignore it if I could but it's hindering the projects I would undertake that I believe would make me happy. Sometimes it feels like life keeps shitting on me just to force me back to antidepressants which I'm so deeply afraid of because of their power over me. I become manic, reckless, to the point I'm irrational and could and have nearly destroyed my life. Besides my fear of them, I just feel like if I could better my situation just a little on my own, I wouldn't need medication. I firmly believe it's my situation, not my mentality, that is making me miserable. I fight everyday to change it. I've been fighting even harder the last year. I try, I really do. But I have nothing to show for it in the end. Besides a fear of death, hope is all I have keeping me alive, but I can feel my hope dying a little bit more every day. But I can't tell anyone because I know where that goes, I've been there and I lost myself because of it. Medication changed me and I don't want to be anyone other than myself, depressed or not. I feel so alone lately, so isolated. I don't really want to die, I want to live. But I don't feel like I'm living and getting old and gray with having never even begun to reach for my dreams seems a fate worse than death. I just needed to get that off my chest. I won't kill myself today, I currently have no plan to, but I also won't promise I won't make one someday. I'm trying my best to keep my hopes and dreams alive, but the day my hope dies, I will die with it, and no power in heaven or hell will stop me. Either way it goes, I will get what I want.",

        "original": "28 male. Ive been depressed since i was 11. Always struggled with sleep ever since I could remember. For whatever reason I could never fall asleep until a few hours before i had to be awake. As an adult we worry about tomorrow. We worry about things that need to get done. We fantasize about things we want to happen. But as a 4 year old ? Idk.. i had lots of strange nightmares/dreams, out of body experiences as a kid. I had a fairly happy childhood, loving parents. I grew up on a horse farm. My grandfather was great when i was young. As soon as i was old enough to help with farm duties I quickly learned he was a different man. He would yell and degrade me if i was too slow to do a task or didn\u2019t know what tool was what. As i got older he would yell at me saying i was worthless. What\u2019s gonna happen when he dies to this farm? You\u2019re gonna run it into the ground. How stupid can you be? My parents were never around to hear this. I would tell my parents but they would just say \u201c he says the same to me\u201d I never wanted to be a farmer when i was a teen. I wanted to play with my friends n just find myself. But I would be forced to help on the farm against my will. If i was out on a Friday till 2 am with friends My mom would run in my room at 5 am panicking \u201c grandpa needs you!! Grandpa needs you! Get up u have to help him right now!\u201d I wouldn\u2019t even be able to eat breakfast. Id go down the barn only to learn i had to hold a flashlight. But that\u2019s the trick. If i ever left after my \u201c flashlight duty\u201d i would be degraded by my grandfather saying I don\u2019t care about this farm. So id be stuck helping him from 5 am till 9 pm some days.. maybe most times id be till 6 or 7.. then id hang with my \u201c neighborhood friends \u201c who always made fun of me. I was the shy awkward kid in the group so i was easiest to make fun of. I get friends do that. But i was seriously always the butt of the joke even by some of their parents. I always smelled like horse shit n they thought i never showered. Even if i put new clothes on I would smell like the barn. Now as an adult I have ptsd from him n my mom always freaking out. I jump from any slight noise. Not to mention my sister is a screamer . She would get into scream fest with her bf. My house was always chaotic until i was 18. When I hung with my friends I couldn\u2019t believe how peaceful things were. Sure bros n sis would fight parents would argue but it was never at an extreme level. To put my experience in perspective think of carmella n tony soprano fight in whitecaps.. that was the level of intensity i grew up with. \n\nEventually my parents split when i was 17 Maybe younger. This affected me greatly. School was the worst experience ever. I was that weird kid who someone was able to fit in with any group yet i never had a best friend. Only ppl i hung out with were my neighbors nd were very different. Only friends because we\u2019re neighbors. They\u2019re more from a wealthy family too. They had so many things handed to them. I had to wash my own clothes when i was 10. They didn\u2019t start till they were in their 20s. So they couldn\u2019t relate to my home experiences. Happy parents happy home. Im glad they don\u2019t relate tho. I hope no one does. Its an awful feeling. \n\nAnyway im trying to give you a bigger scope of why I struggle with depression and anxiety. I don\u2019t wanna give my whole life story here but ill try n bullet point some things to shorten it up. \n\n: always struggled in school. Was in classes with assistant teacher for students who learned at a slower pace. \n: parents never encouraged me to get my license so i took the bus to school till graduation. Made me feel weird being on a bus with all 9th n 10th graders. \n\n:living with my mom alone... she had a bf down the street. She was never home.. i had no car no money n no job so I would eat crackers every night. I weighed 100 pounds. I was extremely skinny. \n\n: couldn\u2019t get girlfriends in school \n: after school I finally got my license, had to move in with my father got work had money n finally started meeting ppl. \n: when okcupid n tinder was new I somehow got lucky in the beginning. Id meet ppl here n there. Hook up. \n: fell really hard for my coworker. She was everything i wanted in a relationship but she had a bf. There was moments where it looked like it would end but it never happened. \n: she was hard to get over. It took years. \n: I eventually started hooking up casually for a whole decade. I mean i wanted something serious. Everyone i met up with I went in seeing if it could go somewhere else but they weren\u2019t right for me. I gave ppl chances I really didn\u2019t like just to see if my feelings would change but it never did. \nThere was one girl on my snapchat that caught my attention. She intimidated me. I took my time with her so I wouldn\u2019t meet up n hook up. After 5 years we finally met. I met her friend Same night. We hit it off. Hung out the next two weeks. We cuddled the last night.  Then suddenly her friend tried hooking up with me. I was drunk n stupid. I teased the idea but I kept thinking about the girl I really wanted. Instead of telling her this I said I cant meet up tonight. Next day she\u2019s being weird. I confront her about the texts n said shes used to guys playing games idc if u want to hook up with my friend u can do so. \nI told her i was sry n didn\u2019t want to hook up with her. But the following week she ignored me. Eventually she told me she needed space. Sounds like it affected her a lil bit.. but months later I found out she knew her friend wanted to fuck me. She asked n said go for it. So this whole time her friend liked me as I liked the other girl. Apparently she already had other guys she wasn\u2019t sure about the whole time. Idk why this couldn\u2019t have been addressed from the beginning. After months i begged for clarity so I could move on and all she would say is \u201c idk im confused  I don\u2019t really have time for a bf atm\u201d she was working two jobs every day plus had problems with her roommate.. now that\u2019s all cleared she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with anybody. Nd i ruined my chances because one night she deleted me n refused to tell me or talk to me for a month. Making her friend talk for us both. One night she finally agreed to hangout but instead of chilling we went to bars.. when we arrived at her house she ran upstairs n went to bed. I was pissed so i rushed out. I was waiting 3 months to kno wth was goin on n 1 month since she removed me.. i needed answers I thought i was getting them that night. To have her run upstairs n not have the decency to say \u201c sry i feel like shit we\u2019ll talk tomorrow \u201c it would have made me upset but at least respected. So i stormed out. Next day she yelled at me about it how i blew things out of proportion. Telling me whatever feelings were developing were gone. But she understood my pov in the end. I just don\u2019t kno why she was so juvenile about the whole thing. Ik I smothered her a lil bit but that\u2019s because she was being incredibly vague n unclear with everything. All she had to say from the beginning was \u201c hey look theres a lot going on in my life right now idk if I want a relationship with anyone but my friend has a crush on you. Maybe see where that goes. Im sry\u201d nd boom that would have savd me months of not worrying about my worth. Did i do something wrong. Crying every night. Not sleeping. She really fucked me up. Idk what it is about this girl but i saw myself n her having a future. Yet she had to play these dumb games with me. Im giving her the benefit of the doubt she is 23 nd her best guy friend eventually told me she can be veryyy immature n not know how to handle situations but he\u2019s trying to help her. \n\n: even common friendships i feel like its pulling teeth to have ppl be your friend. No one wants to do anything. I just don\u2019t relate with anyone, i fear. \n: im into music and film. I go to open mics, film events nd i find myself not relating with anyone. \nI try to squeeze my way into conversations if I actually have something to say to the topic. Sometimes it works other times ppl ignore me like im a ghost. \n\nI seriously feel so alone in this world. \nIm tired of always being the one chasing friends to do things. I always get \u201c cant im busy\u201d \u201c maybe tomorrow \u201c n then i see them hanging with friends... I\u2019ll confront them n they\u2019ll just be like \u201c oh we just went to get a quick drink.. oh we just needed something at the mall.\u201d Im that weird friend who enjoys going on errands with friends. But no one wants me. \n\n: im sick of needing to shower every day, clip nails, dry off, wash clothes dishes. Brush teeth. All these mundane things. Im so sick of doing it. Shaving. Cutting hair. I dread going to bed every night. Takes alll night to sleep n when i do I wake up after 3 hours need to piss n then im wide awake for 5 hours. Then I cant get out of bed. Doesn\u2019t help my bedroom has no window. \n \nIm afraid of death but when i cant sleep n I wake up at 4 pm it makes me feel like strangling myself to death to stop this pain. I just want my life to take a break. But im also afraid ill lose out on more time if i go away somewhere away from work nd my goals of being a filmmaker. Im almost nearing 30. It scares me. Ik its not old but i feel I should have things in order by now. I don\u2019t wanna be 46 n have a kid. I don\u2019t wanna be a 60 year old dad when they\u2019re in their 20s. Im just so scared. \n\nThis life is flashing by and i feel like im aging too. I look 17 but feel 50. Having your dysfunctional family degrade u at a young age i feel like i matured before everyone in my school n peers. Maybe that\u2019s y I struggled in school. I never got to just be a kid. So now that im an adult with my own money car n freedom i try to live everyday as its the last. I never partied when i was 15- 25. My neighbors never invited me when they were out partying. \nSo I have this spontaneous mindset i guess. Heres an idea lets do it. But no one cares to. \n\nI just feel so fucked up. I honestly didn\u2019t think id make it past high school or 27 and now im 28. I hate that suicide has been with me for a majority of my life. It scares me .. if I can\u2019t shake it now nd so many 40 year olds kill themselves.. why will i be different?",

        "original": "I have been lurking this subreddit for quite some time, but haven't mustered up the courage to post here. For those of you who read this to the end, as I am sure this will be a long one, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. \n\nI'm in my late 20's, single dad, good career etc. Had a normal life growing up, middle class, family was always together, things that I am grateful for. I have struggled with depression since I was a young teen (13/14). Back then, depression was easier for me to cope with. I would face it with a \"this too shall pass\" mentality, as it would come and go. Back then I also had not went through any life-altering events that may make one feel more obligated to take their own life. \n\nWhen I was just turning 21 my father was diagnosed with cancer. Coming from a religious family everyone surrounding me always tried to maintain a positive attitude. However, over the next three years the highs and lows of his battle with cancer had really burned memories into my mind that I will always carry with me. Seeing your father dwindle down to almost nothing is not easy, as I am sure some of you reading this can relate to. Upon his passing, I felt immense guilt. I was rebellious through my teenage years so we didn't have the greatest relationship during that time. As I had gotten out of high school and started to mature our relationship got much better, but I always felt guilt for the years that I was an asshole. I coped with this by the means of drugs and alcohol, which had led me down a dark path for a few years that I managed to pull myself from. \n\nFast forward a little bit, I'm getting myself back on track when I meet the woman of my dreams who would later become the mother of our child. I hate to say love at first sight, but I can still remember where we met, what we were wearing, and where we went. Her father too had passed when she was younger so right off the bat we had something we could support one another with. Every second for about 3 years we had spent together. When she had gotten pregnant we decided to make some life changes, I doubled my salary by taking a job hours away from our friends and family so that she could stay home with our child just as she had wanted. \n\nWhen we had moved is when things went very south, very fast. We had both come to the realization that we weren't happy being so far away from our means of support, so I had began looking for a job back home that would suffice. Things continued to go south, when our child was born things got immensely better for some time, then everything went south again. I don't know if we were just sick of one another or what, but it got so bad that she decided to move home. I had accepted this with the hopes that she would move home for some time, I would move home within that year, and we could fix our relationship and be a family again.\n\nI had then found that she had moved right in with a man that she had met online, for months I didn't feel depressed because she was gone, I was fueled with anger. But once this anger diminished, it hit me like a freight train. I lost my family, and I wanted more than anything to have my family back. After a year of almost no communication, we had gotten in touch again. She was out on her own, and I had agreed to help furnish her new home for her and our child. During this time, we spent hours on the phone talking, crying with one another, reminiscing, considering the idea of very slowly working on things. For that brief moment I saw the light at the end of the tunnel and I was filled with hope. Going home every weekend to spend time with her and our child, as a family, made my heart feel full. \n\nNow I am back here, in the gutter. Once she had gotten what she wanted from me (money, agreeance on custody things) I was nothing to her. I have considered suicide since I was in my early 20's, it seems as if each time my depression worsens, as I get older the thoughts become more severe. I have planned it and ran the scenario in my head several hundred times of how I would do it. I have always used my child to battle these thoughts, telling myself that I need to stick around to provide some sort of stability to this kids life. But it becomes harder and harder to do so. \n\nThis has affected me in such a way that I am on the verge of losing my job, my place, essentially throwing my life down the gutter. It's to the point where my family is now aware that I am depressed, but they have no idea the severity of it. It's easy to say \"you have a child, you must live for them\", yes that is true, but what do you do when your own mind tells you that you have failed your child? \n\nI seem to be stuck in a rut that I cannot get out of, it's much easier to express these things to some strangers on reddit than it is to talk face-to-face with a friend out of fear of judgement. Or to talk to a therapist, out of fear that they'll have you put in a home. \n\nThese thoughts affect my day to day life to the point where I don't sleep, I don't eat, and my performance at work has decreased drastically to the point where I have been reprimanded for it. It's been this way for months, and I don't see the light at the end of that tunnel.",

I\u2019m non binary, I keep telling people that.\nbut in fact I feel more feminine than anything else. Not the transsexual kind or the gay kind. No offence meant to whoever is that kind of person.\nBecause of hiding myself. Who I\u2019d truly want to be. I already felt bad. The one and only thing I keep on living with was music and trying to be in a relationship again with someone. A goal which led to this point in life where, it is as fucked up. As it stands.\nMy dad suicided last year in summer. I had 0 tears because I was proud to be his son. I miss him, but I wouldn\u2019t cry for someone who lived his life in misery and at least tried to be understood. I holded it all back at his funeral.the first thing I had to do was start up hope for my family. That\u2019s what I did, they have it easy now. The little things helped a lot for my stepmom. I sended music to my sister, so she could replenish her life and energy. Music I wrote about my dad. She appreciated it a lot. I even went as far to give her extra money, since it\u2019s expensive for my stepmom alone to care for a child who\u2019s already going to middle school.she doesn\u2019t know that I gave her anything. I just did that anon. It would only create guilt and that isn\u2019t my message. Life was picking itself up again and I felt great. I had this crazy crush on a girl in school ( I go to a re up center school for adults who never finished school) I was confident and our tastes and hobbies were the same and we talked about school and life a lot. Then one day I asked her out to my home because she didn\u2019t know something about a subject in school ( I helped her a lot since she is a foreigner and she understood more English than my native language) a lot of people in my country hate foreigners, but I tend to not care. They\u2019re just normal people imo. So we headed out to my home I introduced her to my brothers mom, grandparents etc. She really liked this, and We just basically became couples. Like I don\u2019t need to go in exact details but, I was so confident in myself back then that we spent the whole week together. I miss that moment so much now.. one time she would cry because she thought about her past so oftenly she used to be in an abusive relationship, and her mom approved it. Which made me sick to my stomach about it. At the end of the month I got broke because, i always getting her everything when she didn\u2019t even ask anything. She was a cheapskate. But I just loved to spoil her. Her smile was the reason I lived, and turned my school into a living full filling life. Then one day she said she wanted to break up. She didn\u2019t feel the same way anymore. At first I was angry, sad etc. But then, I messaged that I understood because frankly I thought maybe I was too overwhelming with her.. I was mistaken. She could\u2019ve said she loved someone else. We could\u2019ve talked and it would of been better for both of us. But she never took that responsibility.. after we broke up she already was dating someone else who had been dating with her for 3-6 weeks. I\u2019m in such despair. I don\u2019t talk with family or friends. I tried to but I got blocked for being so negative. Only through texting.. I sleep for 4 hours the rest of the day I\u2019m on caffeine. When somebody looks at me I keep on looking till they become creeped out. I laugh when nothing is presented. I keep on thinking of just ending it all. Part of me wants to be in a psych ward. But I just don\u2019t have a reason for living anymore. I try to sing but I don\u2019t have the courage to do it anymore. I showed her everything from myself, I never said anything that would of been a lie. I just feel so bad about myself.. I thought about cutting yesterday I talked to a teacher about it, she said I needed professional help but honestly I just don\u2019t want to be hurt anymore. And pain reliefs my stress more. I actually have already a heart problem, and caffeine helps me. Go tired sooner. It makes my mind go into a comatose state. Which is what helps I guess. I\u2019m just leaving this here , I\u2019ll try to be fine but who knows if I\u2019m going to be dead or not in the few last hours. Maybe I\u2019ll or not idk....",

        "original": "Many people asked me for the reason why I will commit suicide. It is a pretty long story with way to much information, would be worth making a book out of it. Haha. Anyways.. I decided to only post a part of the whole text so that you'll get the general idea of what is happening right now. This small part might seem a bit dumb to commit suicide for... I'll see maybe I'll post the whole version of it. Anyways here it is.\n\n\n(...) Fast forward to me now 21 years old. Got a girlfriend and we are now in a committed relationship, she knows about my parents and she knows that I was suicidal... but what she doesn't know is that I am still suicidal. Last year I ran from my parents place to live at her place, got some therapy, had to stop taking therapy because my parents couldn't pay for it (and I don't work because I'm a full time studen), my parents made me feel like trash telling me that my depression is \"fake drama\", my parents manipulated me to go back to them (which lasted 2 months) and I got my driver's license. After I got the license I left them again and went to my girlfriend for good.\n\nNow, brace yourselves. I got money from the government so that I can live alone. 12'000$ in total, 7500$ came into my banc account after summer vacation. My parents manipulated me into giving them 5000$ (don't ask my how they did it or why I did, I literally can't explain)... they claimed that the money was their money because they work hard and that this money comes from their paid taxes blablabla. They also defended their points by saying that with that money I had to pay my driver's license expenses (they promised me that they would pay, who would've thought that they'd take money that the government gave me to kinda survive), my \"fake drama\" and pay some of the expenses at home (gas, water, electricity and even food that I wasn't even eating). \n\nNow it's been nearly 3 months I've moved into an appartement with my girlfriend. One day we had a talk, she started crying and told me that she couldn't go on paying for everything, that she couldn't go on taking care of me \"like I'm your mom!\" (This one seriously hit me). I just sat there next to her, not even looking at her, and thinking \"Why do things always end up like that? Why am I such a burden to her?\"\n\nI have been looking for a job since August 2019. Still haven't found one, I made some money here and there but it is not enough. So, my girlfriend said \"If by the 1st of February you still haven't signed any contract, you will go back to your parents. I cannot go on like this. (Because she has to pay her credit card and her income is, well let's say not enough for 2 people).\" (Oh yeah btw, in this case she will also break up with me.)\n\nFor me the conclusion is easy, this time there is no roundabout. If I can't find a job it's over for me too. I don't want to continue living being a burden for people and especially my girlfriend. I CANNOT go back living with my parents, this would be the greatest psychological damage ever done to me. They'd manipulate and force me to go to church with then and I would for sure NEVER see my girlfriend again. I can't, I can't, I can't go back to my parents this would be mental suicide. I'm in a position in which no one can help me without causing any damage to anyone be it emotionally, physically or financially.\n\nSo, after struggling and struggling and struggling for months to find a job, I almost lost hope. \n\nOn December 24th I had this thought of committing suicide again. I had a lot of time to think through it... waged all my possibilities.... and after realizing that there might be the end in front of me, I just began to feel extremely relieved. I have been waiting to die and cease to exist since I was 9 years old, I guess at least that wish will come through.\n\nTldr: I'll commit suicide because I might get kicked out and I can't return to my parents place.",

We lost our baby at 12 weeks. A miscarriage is really awful for a women. You are told your baby is dead and then you have to wait until the body does the rest. It's painful both physically and emotionally to lose a child that for 3 months was living in your mind's eye. She fell apart, so I had to stay strong.\n\nMy wife wanted to try again and within a year we had a baby girl. However, she struggled through the pregnancy with dark thoughts, and then when she arrived my wife broke down with post-natal depression. She was paralyzed by fear and contemplated suicide. So I called on her family for help and she was also helped by the NHS through councilling and other things.\n\nMy wife is the main breadwinner. She is an A&E doctor. I don't earn badly. However, we never have any money remaining every month. So when she was on maternity I couldn't not work, as we were on a much-reduced household income, but I had to look after our new baby, so I did both. I work from home so I did both simultaneously until my wife was well enough to cope. It was really hard for her, so I had to stay strong, but she improved.\n\nWhen she went back to work it was hard. Her job is very physically and emotionally demanding. With things at her work often hitting home. So she has to carry it. Most of the time she is looking at her phone when she is at home and she doesn't want to talk because she wants to clear her head. She works long unpredictable hours but also manages to go out with friends regularly. So she is moving forward, but still has her ups and downs. However, it's now got the point where she feels cold towards me. She uses her phone and spending as a crutch. It's been five months since she has been back at work.\n\nToday I feel like I want to kill myself. I feel trapped as I can't leave the house as I work at home in the day and have to be in for the kids on the evenings. I have no money at all, it never seems enough it's always spent on something, and I don't spend anything on myself. I have nobody to talk to and barely see other people. I feel like I am making my wife's life worse because I am just another thing she has to manage. I feel exhausted. I feel like I am in a state of cold panic. I am alone. I need to be strong, but I haven't got anything left. I think I going to crumble and make everything worse. I feel so guilty for writing this. Today I feel like I am falling, I feel hurt and I am thinking about killing myself. The only thing stopping me is my kids, but if I stop fighting for a moment I may do it.",

Unlikely to have camera or connectivity issues if not described)\n\nYay! Now I have a cheap high-performance waterproof phone (Warranty expired in a year ago). Any water or blood splash will not damage this phone a lot, so I can stream the footage of drowning or stabbing myself online or record a small part of the footage with \u201cfinal message\u201d and upload it on social media.

I\u2019m mot gonna care about the fences and security cameras on that bridge because I don\u2019t think they are functional at all. \n\nBy the way, if I fail to film myself committing suicide within a few months, I will still be able to kill myself but would not be able to film myself(All Korean men are forced to work for military services for at least 1.7 years after being over 19 years old, and I am one of them.

I got a great job that I love and is a good pay for me back in August 2019 and was hired on for full time a month later (September 2019). I was in a decade long relationship that had a bit more rocky days than not lately, but I love her from the depths of my heart (I am younger btw, 23M) and though I am young, understand that we grew up together. We met in public school and learned and loved everything about each other. Near the end we wanted different things (plus I was being a monster dick bc of how our relationship at this point had turned into hostility and distrust towards one another; for different things, mind you). I went over the top with my anger (never violent, just being a general asshole) in September 2019 and that was the last straw for her. Over 10 years down the drain, and I can't get over it, dwelling on the future I always dreamed with her but now will never have... \n\nMy good job kept me busy and I was fine for a while, but my job is also a bit stressful (community service work often is) but never too much to handle. With the shift work (days, evenings and night rotations) and learning my now ex had fooled around with one of my old friends in November from my cousin, I slipped back into a sad fog. It showed at work after a while. \n\nThen, I got the news that my grandfather (who I was very close with as a child, but hadn't seen in over a year since him and my dad had a falling out) had passed away on December 18th, a week before Christmas.. of course my family and I were devastated, and after this I couldn't help but feel more distracted.. the loss of my relationship, then my grandfather keep reminding me of my loss in the past.\n\nI have recurring dreams of my three friends (one who was my childhood best friend for over 10 years) who died in a house fire when I was just 15, back in April 2012. I still regret hanging up the phone on him that night bc he was drunk and I was too tired.. one of the other friends was my cousins' fiancee and that weighed on my family heavily as well for a long time, still does ..\n\nThree years later, just after Christmas 2015, my mother's ex, who were not married but was basically my stepfather since I was 5-6yrs old (taught me how to ride a bike, took us on vacations, etc.), was reported to have commited suicide by hanging himself.. he used a belt by a doorknob with his then girlfriend sleeping in the other room, found him the next morning.. it was not even half a year after him and my mom broke up, but my mother was seeing someone else at the time and I guess my \"stepfather\" couldn't live without the three of us (my mom, myself and younger brother). \n\nAll of this had come flooding back and it could not escape my mind no matter how much I tried.. I miss my girlfriend, I miss my best friend, my \"stepfather\", my grandfather and I feel guilty for all of it; as though I had left everything in a terrible way.. Today, I got my probationary release letter, letting me know I would not be kept at my job as I was not seen as the best fit... I feel in my darkest of times, I had not been supported but rather just let go.. my friends haven't spoken to me since my relationship has ended, I have nobody except my actual father, (who I worry about after he has had 2 strokes before the age of 50) and my younger brother, who can only be there so much for us. \n\nToday, I have been holding my belt, wondering how my mom's ex did it, and if maybe that's all that will help at this point... I know that seems really silly, and I highly doubt I'd commit.. but everything seems so heavy right now and each day I feel like I'm going to get closer..

My wife called it a \u201ccop out\u201d in order to avoid \u201clarger problems\u201d in our marriage(all of those supposed problems are due to my depression and anxiety). My cousin got mad at me for even saying that I was depressed, let alone suicidal. The only one who listens to me without putting me down or getting mad at me is my cat(pathetic, I know), and we have to put her down tonight or tomorrow because she is very sick. I stay up until 3AM every night even though I have to be up for work, just so I can spend tome alone and postpone being in the world with others. I\u2019m barely eating, I\u2019m barely even thinking anymore. Everything makes me cry now. I can\u2019t handle this world anymore. Everyone in my life who would have been supportive in this time have all died tragic deaths. Its time to follow suit. I\u2019m sorry to everyone else who this is happening to In life, and I wish I could tough it out with you guys. \nBest,\nJ",

        "original": "Dear Reddit people, I am writing this to you without any shame or concern. I wanted to write before but decided not to do because I was anxious about my English level and hope I can be able to express the things as they really are. \n\nI am having hard times since the secondary school with my own thoughts and identity. After doing some thinking, my conclusion was that all those depressive vibes were related to moving a lot because of my father's profession. Because I wasn't able to really connect with someone, and my parents were having arguments all the time. My dad used to hit me but it was a thing that most of the people had to deal with when they were growing up in a third world country like that. Some of my friends had been treated even worse. And I am aware that getting hit by your dad is nothing compared to all the brutalism in the world.\n\nDuring my high school years, I studied for the university entrance exam but didn't have any plans or wishes for the future. I sometimes did, but it didn't last long. Because to me, I was never smart, attractive or social enough. Being 23 y/o and still writing stuff like this supports the 'not being smart' part I guess.\n\nThen I started university, things didn't get any better. In fact, they got even worse. I was procrastinating all the time, and never happy with myself. Always felt never good enough for anything. My first romantic relationship started with the other person saying that he only wanted to get physical and I accepted that to be with him. However, I always expected more and that caused many problems and the result was multiple breakups & getting back togethers.\n\nAfter a year, he said he was in love with me but even though I said the same, I didn't really believe/trust him. Because in the beginning of the relationship, he used to want to break up due to sexual problems we were having(premature ejaculation, not being able to have vaginal orgasm). Those were serious problems for him when we first started having sex. But I believed that the solution  was taking time and being willing to discover our needs. Because we were each other's first sexual partners. And the funny thing was, I was not aware of myself as a sexual being and never touched myself or felt horny before him. I just didn't have that instinct. That was also what he thought: I was lacking some basic instincts.\n\nWith the realization of lacking some basic instincts, I was sure something was really wrong with me. I went to psychiatrist, had 10 mins talk, got prescribed prozac, didn't take it. The doctor said I need to take it to function as before, because I was studying engineering and she thought I was 'smart' and 'functioning' enough as my real self. I don't support that idea, getting above average grades alone is not a sign of intelligence or proper functioning. \n\nI continued living as before, had many more breakups & getting back togethers with the same person, and graduated. He is now working in the same country and I am doing an internship abroad. I still have the same problems with myself, our sexual problems are kind of solved, but there are some other problems.\n\nI think the biggest struggle I am having now is the basic understanding of things. For example, when the people I am really close to(my partner and my mother) think I did something inconsiderate or hurtful to them, I usually do not agree with them. I either think they are being too sensitive or too demanding. But I always end up being the selfish, careless, and horrible one in their eyes. I have been told those so many times and it came to a point that I can't understand what is the reality anymore. I have never thought of myself as that much of a disgusting person. Maybe that is the problem or there are some problems on their sides as well. I really don't know what to do, what to say, what to think anymore. Thinking on myself doesn't help at all because I think I am so dumb to make the right connections to understand what is really going on in my life. Maybe I should read more or experience more. I really don't value myself or my thoughts and stuck in my own little head. \n\nI may sound spoiled for making those kind of things as my biggest problems in life. I am sorry if I made any of you irritated with my immature thoughts or broken English skills. \n\nThank you for reading or not reading",

We haven't been intimate in months.

I can\u2019t find a job in my shitty city because well of my social anxiety but also because of discrimination. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t help me at all, everything is so easy for him and he doesn\u2019t have to say anything and people are all over him. No one will trusts me if I say all the fucked up shit he did and said. He\u2019s manipulative, selfish, shallow and really really close minded. I\u2019m tired, 10 years now I have suicidal thoughts, I really really wanna end this fuckery. This world is a joke and we\u2019re all clowns. I\u2019m tired of this masquerade. It\u2019s always the looks, the looks, the looks, the looks, the looks, the looks and the fucking looks. Life is amazing but there are too many fucked evil spirited people here, it is scary and I have no one to protect me. For some, I\u2019m a toxic fuck, for others I\u2019m a crazy bitch, for some I\u2019m a bad person with a bad vibe, for others I\u2019m a ugly basic bitch, for others I\u2019m an oversensitive immature baby,  or an attention seeker, a victim whatever they want to think it\u2019s never ever good. Just because of the mistakes I did ( mistakes that I didn\u2019t have full control over) it\u2019s like I can\u2019t be forgiven. I really wanna change city but I have nothing and no one, and I know if I break with my boyfriend, my ex friends and my ** barf** sister will jump on him, not because they are interested but because he is MY love interest and for some reason they seem bitter of me having love interests. I can\u2019t count how many times I had a love interest and my \u201c friends\u201d were quick to stalk his Facebook profile or add him on Facebook... I don\u2019t know for you guys but I don\u2019t fuck with this type of behavior... why would add my boyfriend? Anyway... and he\u2019s quite a shitty person but hey, does it matter? Because no one will trusts me anyway, because they all charmed by him, they all fall for his looks. I tried to seek therapists but I\u2019m scared it won\u2019t work. I\u2019m literally scared of living and that is why I wanna end my life. The place I am in have no empathy, sympathy for minorities and I\u2019m tired, oh lord so tired of having to be strong for myself. I\u2019ve been strong enough. I can\u2019t even distract myself with love or sex because most guys will probably not respect me and only use me for sex and even if it\u2019s not for sex ( not likely but who knows), it\u2019s like I can\u2019t connect or relate to people, and people just avoids me, I guess \u2018cause I\u2019m boriiiiiiing or I have nothing for them. \nThe only way for me to get men\u2019s attention is with sex and I\u2019m tired, exhausted, in pain. I\u2019m not even a sexual person and I don\u2019t like being seen as walking pussy like that. I\u2019m a human, and I want connections. Long lasting meaningful friendships, with men, women, trans, cis, wtv! I don\u2019t care! Sex is not a necessity for me and I don\u2019t understand the hype with sex. But hey we live in a world where sex is literally view the same as money. Friendships, platonic love > sex. \n\nIt\u2019s not my life that I wanna end, because I know how amazingly beautiful life can be and I don\u2019t mind challenges it\u2019s just that my situation have been so shitty for the past, what 10 years... that I wanna end it. And I\u2019m scared that the future will be worst so I don\u2019t take any chances and I wanna die now. It\u2019s complex, life is beautiful but I still wanna end my life. \n\n\n\nSometimes, when I\u2019m about to end my life, I always look at my phone and see if there\u2019s a sign/notif/ a txt/ a call from someone telling me hey bitch dont give up... but nothing. You know, what really breaks my heart is when I think about how happy I would be if I had a kid or just little cute puppy, but I can\u2019t, who would want to have a kid with me? And be a good father? And stay loyal? It seems like men cannot respect me. Maybe because I\u2019m fugly? Maybe because Im black? I\u2019m a scorpio? Im 5\u20195? I dont fucking know. \n\nIf I continue to live, I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll be a bad bad bad person and I don\u2019t want that. My sadness is all over me giving me bad vibes. I don\u2019t need anymore bad vibes. \n\nIf I die, I\u2019ll either be a Jane Doe, either some people will profit from my death ( #bf #family #fakefriends), either they\u2019ll be happy about it... idk which is worse. \n\nMy life have always been pure shit, and I don\u2019t think my future will get any better.

But lately Im afraid I might actually do it, because I can't take it anymore. What's wrong with my life you might ask? Well, everything. Since the beggining.\n\nIm 20 years old, and (thankfully) I was born in Spain and im still living here. Im not gonna specify my parent's origin country but I will say that it's of a very distinct and primitive culture and it's not politically stable, to say the least. \n\nMy father is an old man (+**70 years**) currently, but when he came to Spain he was way younger. He married a spanish woman and had a daughter with her, and didn't take long to show his true side: a retrograde abuser. The woman, as independent as she was, couldn't stand the **horrible abuse (physical, verbal and so on)** that my father was inflicting on her, so she divorced and kept her daughter.   \nMy father went back to his country and spent a few years there (until he was 50 years old) and married a woman 20 years younger than him, lying about his age (he looks quite younger than he is, even now). Then, he brought that woman with him to Spain, and got a normal job.\n\nFrom that woman, I was born twenty years ago. Of course, my father being an abuser, made life a **living hell** for my mother, and made her quite dependent on him.  She never learned Spanish and never worked, stayed always as a housewife, depending on my father and not able to defy him, as he kept abusing her... and me. We both feared and still fear him. I still get goosebumps when I hear him say my name. We got hit and mistreated for the stupidest things, me and my younger brother & sister, born later of course. He hit me for everything, since I was a little kid. I got hit even for crying, which wouldn't be logical but somehow made me stop crying. I grew up hating violence because of him, I always knew something was not right.\n\nI'd dare say we also got neglected, as my ADHD and my high capacities didn't get detected by a specialist until a few years ago on high school, things that made me a bit different from other kids and which my father neglected. He's always been like that, and I don't know if it's his culture or his backwards mentality or his age. He also was very stingy, even when he had money.\n\nOur family was not a normal one, and I couldn't realize why when I was younger. I always looked at my friends and their familys and envied them. I spent many years feeling **envy** from other people, and I'd dare say I still feel it on a daily basis, and it's killing me from inside. A great number of complexes, self-esteem issues, insecurities and other traits that affect me daily came from this life. My father also has like a Diogenes Syndrome (I suspect) because he has always stacked up stuff that he never checked again, since he was young, and never let us throw anything away often getting quite violent when we wanted to throw something he brought, being it papers or boxes or anything.  And that made this house even worse, because that's another topic: my house.\n\nThis house is **disgusting**. But not just disgusting; also broken. Dirt and humidities on the walls, broken doors (only two doors work in the entire house), greasy stuff, mold on ceiling and walls, dust, holes... It's a nightmare. Do you know that TV show that showed houses in poor condition and then reformed them? Well, even the worst house there would look like a mansion compared to mine, I assure you.\n\nAnd its not just a shitty house, it's also small. We're 5 persons, my younger brother sleeps with my mother because he has no room and my father sleeps on the couch. I share a room with my young sister, and yeah at least we got a room, but privacy is nonexistent and that affects both me and my sister. All this particularly affected her some years ago in high school, she started self-harming and the school sent Social Services to check the house, on which they stated that his house was **bad for health and growth of kids and family,** but my father managed to make my sister tell them that she was happy anyways and they left.\n\nI can't bring friends here, I always feel bad when I go to friends houses and see their families. It has always been this way for me.\n\nNow, the economics part: my father is retired (retirements here are on 65 years) and he gets monthly his retirement pension. He worked many years, so his pension is around 1000\u20ac, which would be great for one person but not just enough for an entire family. But it's not just that: 12 ago a friend of his wanted to start a company and couldn't take a loan because he owned no properties, and asked my father to help, promising that he can pay it. My stupid father **mortgaged our shitty house**, forced my mother to sign, and gave his friend the loan. The friend obviously fled away, and legally the debt is on ous... so we've been paying since then 500\u20ac every month, half of his pension. **We live 5 persons with 500\u20ac monthly**. Now you get how hard and depressing it is?  \nI can't go out with my friends like everyone else. Sometimes they pay for me and I feel ashamed. Everyone else has a good situation except me and it hurts me that even when Im outside I get remembered of our economic state.\n\nI've been told that the only way to overcome this is to get a job. And it might be true, I might get a part time job and save money... **except because my father would make me give him a part of my salary**, threatening me with kicking me out. I've already had two part time jobs (IT and Service Desk), jobs that I left for many combined reasons: my father wanting me to give him money, my depression making it very hard to work properly, etc...\n\nWhat do I do, get a full time job, assuming the unlikely situation where they will not make me a shitty **temporary contract** (because nobody gets a lifetime contract on Spain easily, and a lifetime contract would be the only safest way to get out from here and live my life)? Well, I don't want to spend all day in an office, not at least with **20 years**. Maybe in five more years, when everyone my age is also working at an office. But not now, when my friends and people my age are studying, sharing rooms with friends, having fun, living their youth...\n\nI just want to have a normal family, a room, a normal house. Be like everyone else my age. Go to college (and have the strength to do it), have enough money for my expenses, go for groceries like everyone else and not have to rely on discount coupons to eat, live a normal life like everyone else on this country.... but I can't because of this curse.  \nI don't know if the curse it's my father, his age, his mentality, his culture, or it's just that he's an asshole and he doesn't know how to run a family.\n\n**But he knows perfectly how to ruin lives.**\n\nI can't deal with this anymore. I barely have the strength to wake up from my dirty bed, and barely have the strength to smile and act like there's nothing happening and Im perfectly normal.\n\nI don't know what to do, nobody can help me, every time I tell my story people always go like \"I wish I could do something to help you\" and they go back to their perfect lifes. I have no family to go. My existence is a mistake and I should have never been born.\n\nI also doubt that I would be happy if magically tomorrow a genie appeared and offered me to fix everything or if I won the lottery. I feel like this has affected my ability to be happy as well.\n\nIf you made it through here, thank you. I might edit this later with more details, but right now I have to stop writing, because I can't think while crying.",

Now, while i already have the diagnoses of Adhd, OCD, Depression, And Anxiety, i figured out with the help of a professional that i have DID, Dissociative identity disorder.   \nNow...If im being honest, DID is one of the best things about my life. That sounds stupid but....My parents neglected me...My mom is extremely overdramatic and would yell slurs at me...but when shes not mean shes extremely nice, but, my dad has never been there for me. He was an alcoholic who tried to abort me. Hes gotten better this year, but its still not great. I lock myself in my room all day. I\u2019m homeschooled by myself, since my brother goes to a regular school. I was pulled out do to extreme bullying to the point where i was Locked in a bathroom and fainted. Though, thats a good thing, since he hits me constantly.   \ni dont know what i have going for me. I have friends, but theyre online.

That sounds sick but theyre like brothers and sisters, and i love them dearly  \nWhat pushed me over the edge was that my therapist, told my father that theres a strong possibility i have did. He has been giving me these \u2018talks\u201d, that are actual hell. He tells me that i probably dont have it, and that if i do, i need to tell my mom. This isnt good, because i didnt even want to tell my dad, i was forced into it. My mom has said that people with DID are monsters or crazy. Im scared theyre going to get us to integrate (move us all into one), which i will adamantly refuse to do, which will cause for guilt tripping and abuse.   \nI have no options left. I woke up this morning after being told this yesterday. i dont feel afraid. There are pills on my shelf, i could do it easily.

        "original": "I need to vent. I guess it's all that's left for me to do.  I'm almost 23 and I feel like adult life has completely destroyed me.\n\n2019 was by far the worst year in my life. It was the last year of university and last spring I had to write my bachelor thesis and got my first job. Of course you are supposed to be happy about this but I wasn't. It was too much for me. It was such an enormous amount of stress and I feel like it broke me apart and I never quite recovered. I used to cry almost every day, my body was shaking. I was so fucking scared. Working 40+ hours a week for the first time in my life was already too much to handle. I couldn't force myself to write my thesis and I just kept procrastinating it and feeling even worse.\n\nThen I told myself that I'll either write it or I'll kill myself. I had done about 10% of all the work when four days had been left till the dieadline but I managed to finish my thesis on time. It was a very carelessly written piece of work. It was shit and I felt ashamed to submit it but I knew I had no other choice - either write a trashy thesis or completely fail my degree and my life. My thesis defense was horrible. I was extremelly nervous because I knew I hadn't done a good job. I don't even know how they allowed me to actually submit it. I felt like a complete failure. They told me they were disappointed in my work because I used to be a good student. Anyway, I passed it and finished my degree. I came home and cried a lot, but at least it was over and I got my bachelor diploma. I felt slightly better for a short period of time.\n\nBut my job was still there. I just realized I am stuck in this unbearable system for the rest of my life. I'll have to wake up every morning, forcing myself to leave the bed to go to a job I hate, pretend to be productive and happy just so that I don't starve to death. I'll have no free time, no time to properly rest and I'll do the same thing over and over again like a robot. Exhaustion is a constant state. There is nothing but working, sleeping and wasting time on the internet because I have no strength to do anything else. Weekends are just enough to slightly recover just to get completely destroyed physically and mentally the next Monday. If this is the way life is supposed to be lived I'd rather not live. If I am supposed to be a slave till I am 70, I'd rather be dead.\n\nI guess it wouldn't be that much of a pain if I had a social life. Well sadly, I don't have one. I have never seen a person who is more isolated than I am. I am an alien and always have been. When I went to kindergarten people thought I wasn't able to speak. I was always a shy clumsy kid in the middle of screaming extroverts running all over the place and it hasn't quite changed. Except that I'm not a kid anymore and I can't run into my mom's arms so that she can protect me. I am left completely alone and vulnerable in the danger zone. I never had any friends, I was always silent and alone. I didn't feel bad about it until I grew up and realized that I had nothing. \n\nI have Asperger's but it hasn't been diagnosed. Everybody could've seen it but nobody cared. Nobody helped me and now it's too late because I'm already damaged. I never learned how to communicate. I'm a stranger to everyone. People scare me and I try to protect myself by avoiding social situations and isolating myself. They don't undestand me and I don't undestand them. I don't want to pretend to be someone I am not, I don't want to act like I'm happy because I'm not. People want small talk, dishonesty and masks. I don't need that. I just want to be safe and to be me which I only get when I'm alone at home, in my comfort zone.\n\nI just feel so lonely and it's my own fault. But when I go outside and when I see people, I don't want to be with them. I don't need a group of friends, I don't need fancy parties and active life. I don't even know if I need love or sex with a boyfriend (I'm gay). These things seem so unrealistic to me now. I just need one person. I just need someone whom I can miss, someone to whom I could talk to for hours and hours and who would understand me just as I am. I just want someone to love me as a weirdo friend. It has never happened. Nobody has ever undestood me. Maybe I haven't undestood anyone either. I see those people in the movies, I read about them in the books, I hear them in the songs and I relte to them but I haven't met one in my life. I only have my mom but I know she's not eternal. When she dies I will have nothing. I will have no other choice but to kill myself.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, life has punished me so hard in the last few months. My parents divorced. My only grandma whom I loved committed a suicide in November. We were so alike in so many ways. Just as me, she was very shy, reserved and overthinking all her life. I feel like I'm destined to have the same fate as her. She sufferend 78 years in this world, I might not even reach half of that. Her death hurt me really bad. All these events that happened to me have broken my soul. I don't even know how to recover and where to find strength. The longer it takes to recover and stand up the harder life punches me again. I would kill myself right now, the only reason I'm not doing it is because I don't want to break my mom's heart.\n\nI just want to be calm. I want to wake up one morning and feel no fear, no stress, no sadness and no self-hate. But I have lost hope and I've lost faith in a better tommorrow. These days I only have two moods - either a complete lazy apathy or a devastating sadness which I feel right now. Nothing even happened but I'm just crying my heart out. How is it even possible to enjoy life when you not rich, attractive, confident and outgoing? \n\nI just want to be understood. I want to experience love. Not a sexual love, but a sensual love. I want someone no to just hear but to listen to me, to hug me and tell me I'll be alright. At least for one moment, for one day to know how it feels being not alone.

Nobody wants to just help me accept what I am and I am constantly striving to be attractive, I go to the gym constantly (6 days a week) and I take as good care of myself as I can. I have a good haircut, wear good clothes, try to be confident like is said a million times. The truth is it doesn\u2019t work for everyone. All was just a waste of time for me. I didn\u2019t even get any mental benefits from the gym, I don\u2019t feel that endorphin release and I don\u2019t feel the slightest bit more confident in myself even after I get told my arms are muscular or I look like I lost weight. I look in the mirror and I see the same ugly body I\u2019ve had to live with my whole life. I detest the way I look and I can\u2019t do anything about it it feels like. I don\u2019t see these changes others comment on at all and I don\u2019t get it. Even if they were there it wouldn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m still unattractive, despite what is told to me about my looks (my parents and some friends have insisted on me being good looking) it\u2019s all bullshit. Short guys can\u2019t be attractive, I\u2019ve seen what\u2019s said about us. I know how people feel about us even if they aren\u2019t mean about it. I know how good looking guys get treated too, they get overtly sexual messages out of nowhere and the best I\u2019ve ever gotten is just a girl saying hi or hey randomly and even that doesn\u2019t happen super often. \n\nI\u2019ve tried all of the bullshit coping mechanisms taught to me by therapists. They don\u2019t work because I see the big picture, I know how life actually works. Good looking guys can sleep around, get it out of their system and have some fun before they decide to settle down. I don\u2019t get that chance. All I will be able to realistically get is an ltr with someone I\u2019m not really attracted to (and it will probably be the same the other way) and that is it. I will never be fulfilled or satisfied in life. I get one shot at life and it\u2019ll suck. It\u2019s shallow as hell but I don\u2019t care. My brain won\u2019t let me stop thinking about it and it never will, it\u2019s only going to get worse when I get older and working in a fucking office until I\u2019m 90 and miserable sounds like a terrible time. \n\nEveryone always says that you shouldn\u2019t kill your self because of how it will affect the people around you and love you. Well what about me? What about my pain I deal with every single day that I can\u2019t make go away no matter what I do? Best case scenario is just me going through life unhappy and just coping. Who the fuck wants that for themselves.  If they truly knew what it was like for me they\u2019d understand. They\u2019d get why I want to do it and when this pain is over they should be relieved. But no, nobody even tries to understand and just judges me. I wish I had never been born.",

Not really looking for support or encouragement just wanted to express myself...\nLast Thursday I lost my daughter at 18 weeks pregnant. I did everything in my power to save her. To safely bring her into this world this upcoming May but life has never been kind to me. This was my fifth miscarriage. Doctors didn\u2019t want to help me save her they were just worried about my \u201clife\u201d. She was the last part of my husband I had left. She was wanted and very much loved. She was my third and last chance of wanting to stay on this miserable plane of existence. My husband was murdered 82 days ago. Shot and dumped like trash in a known dumping area in his hometown. He was missing four days with no help from the police when we found his body less than 3 blocks away from his mother\u2019s house. Because police and the media only care when women, children and the elderly go missing. Eight months earlier we lost our son when I was 17 weeks pregnant. Almost same exact way I lost our daughter, negligence by a doctor who refused to perform a cerclage before my cervix was incapable of holding a baby on its own. After they told me my daughter had no heartbeat last Thursday afternoon I just stopped talking to everyone. I delivered her Friday morning. They involuntarily admitted me to their fancy mental health center Saturday morning. Because a long with the muteness and asshole psychiatrist put in my chart the I was going to kill myself if I lost her which I never said at all and my mother attested to this because she was by my side the entire time and when they had sent both psychiatrist in I had already stopped speaking. Nevertheless I was released Tuesday morning because I \u201cplayed nice\u201d. \nAll three losses of my story are very my deeper and detailed than this but it\u2019s all rather too quite long and heartbreaking to type. \n\nEver since I can remember I had this feeling inside that I was not meant to be here. Every night when I was a child and I learned how to pray I would ask God to take me in my sleep or take me in a chariot like he took Elijah and then I would say the \u201cNow I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep.  \ud83d\ude44 if I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.\u201d\nAs you can imagine at this age I didn\u2019t know why I felt this way I just did and then I saw the green mile for the first time and Michael Clark Duncan\u2019s character finally explained what I was feeling. What everyday of my life before and after I heard those words has felt like for me. \n\u201cBecause I want it over and done. I do. I'm tired, boss. Tired of bein' on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. Tired of not ever having me a buddy to be with, or tell me where we's coming from or going to, or why. Mostly I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world everyday. There's too much of it. It's like pieces of glass in my head all the time. Can you understand?\u201d\n\nI felt this way before I was molested by my God-brother around that same age. Continued to feel it everyday. End of my freshman year of high school my friend died by trying to hop over a moving train and slipped. Classmates bullied me a few days after his funeral and I tried to commit suicide for the very first time. \nAt 18 I was having consensual sex that turned into a vile rape. \nStill feeling the pressure from the glass but I carried on. For my very loving family, friends and people I knew who cared about me. \nThen I met my second husband. My best friend, my apocalypse companion. When we first met and I was planning on leaving this world for good; he was the reason I decided to stay. \nOur marriage wasn\u2019t sunshine and rainbows. We loved each other passionately and unconditionally but we had our sometimes unbearable flaws. We we\u2019re living for each other. We both felt the same about life and didn\u2019t want to continue to press on if one of us was to leave this earth without the other. Which made 2019 extremely difficult because my husband new he was going to die. He didn\u2019t know how or when but he knew that he would be taken unwillingly. And I believed him. It got to a point where he welcomed it. He tried his best to prepare me. So getting and staying pregnant was a high priority for me after the loss of our son because I wanted a piece of him, of us to live on. And it happened. I was pregnant. We we\u2019re in shock. Happy and terrified but we wanted her. He wanted her. He knew she was going to be a she; she looked just like him. \nHe tried his best to stay for us. Then someone stole him from us when I was 8 weeks pregnant.\nHis homicide is still an open investigation.\n\nThese past 3 months were the worst pain I ever been through my entire life. I tried to keep her safe. Some days I didn\u2019t want to wake up. Weekly OB and sessions with my therapist. \nI FUCKING DID MY BEST.\nBut my best has never been good enough. \n\nSo now. I\u2019ve accepted that there\u2019s nothing left for me here. There\u2019s nothing more that I want or need to do or fulfill. I don\u2019t want to heal and find MORE purpose. I don\u2019t want to love again. I don\u2019t want to try for the sixth time to be someone else\u2019s mother. I don\u2019t want anything anymore. It\u2019s not depression or anxiety at this point anymore. It\u2019s a choice that I\u2019m sane enough to make. It should be my right that I shouldn\u2019t be ashamed to have. None of us have the choice of whether we want to be born. Where when and who we want to be born to. We should have the right to say I\u2019m ready to be at peace. A lot of people think it\u2019s selfish and cowardly. But it\u2019s the most selfless thing a person can do for themselves is to let go and accept. We\u2019re all going to die anyway. I think people forget that. That we\u2019re all going to die. And I rather take my own life than someone or something taking it.\nThis isn\u2019t something that I just woke up or irrationally decided to do either. This has been my escape plan.\nHeaven, hell, limbo, reincarnation, or nothing at all is better than being here with you all. Nothing here will \u201cget better\u201d. Humans have been ruining this planet and each other since when whatever you have decided to  believe in started.\nAnd I\u2019m done. And I\u2019m ok with that. And you should be too. Not that it actually matters.\n\nDisclaimer: Don\u2019t let my let my choice be your choice. Find your own peace. \nI also don\u2019t plan on leaving right away. I still have priorities and responsibilities I don\u2019t want to leave on my loved ones. And a part of me really wants to know who killed my husband. But when it\u2019s my time to leave I hope you all wish me peace \u262e\ufe0f",

I decided to go out and drink excessively while driving. I ended up driving on the wrong side of the street into the oncoming lane crashing head-on with another vehicle.  I am currently disabled broke my wrists, ribs, hip, left leg,  left arm, and collapsed my lung. I 100% regret what happened ended up hurting 2 other people in the process. Thank god that I was the one injured the most. I am currently at home recovering if I really am healing no idea. Everything is so bleak to me. I had a promising job making good money and I threw it all the way. I can't live with myself playing the wreck in my head every second of the day. People will say it will get better but I just don't see it happening. I've been dealing with depression for the better 6 years of my life. I constantly just think about how much better things would be if I'm not around. Constantly disappointing the people I know close to me whether it be friends or family. I do not understand why it's so hard to be happy. Believe it or not, the only place I was happy when I was working. I miss my old life and just want to be ok. No word on if I will go to court or not for it. I've just been drowning myself in music and drinking my feelings away. I shouldn't be drinking but its the only time I can feel numb from the pain. I just wish I had a reason to stick around but I don't see any. Literally going crazy at this point debating if I wanna give life another shot. It all is just too much for me to handle.

She should have turned 6 years old but instead died hours after her birth (obviously much more devastating for my cousin who had the baby, but we are super close and it affected our whole family). Then at work, I was yelled at for being 15 minutes early (not late. 15 minutes early) on Wednesday. Yesterday, I was told I could not leave my station to go talk to the restaurants hostess by the chef who had yelled at me the day before for being early, even though no customers were present and we were having an entirely appropriate work conversation. Today I was given a written warning about \u201cmultiple acts of inappropriate touching\u201d despite the fact that the most intimate I\u2019ve gotten with any coworker was a tap on the shoulder or arm while saying \u201cbehind\u201d which is common courtesy in kitchens. I\u2019m also a slightly overweight clumsy person so I prefer to give people the extra awareness of where I am but I have never done anything close to being inappropriate. I\u2019m in my early twenties and besides being a chubby woman, I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m the least threatening person in my kitchen. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why my chef has taken this week to flip out at me but I also overheard him threatening to write up another coworker of mine. Although I actually really don\u2019t like this coworker, I also really believe the chef was being really unfair. I really believe that my written warning is bogus because one waitress who I\u2019m friends with is the only one who I really hug and that\u2019s because she initiates most of the hugs. Everyone else that I\u2019m friendly with, I try not to touch except for the taps on their shoulders because I know not everyone is into hugs or being touched. \n\nI feel so deeply hurt by this warning and my depression is hiking really high. My anxiety is spiraling and I feel this incredible ache in my chest. It\u2019s like a bottomless well of humiliation and pain and frustration wrapped up into one week. \n\nAny words of encouragement would be appreciated. Have you guys ever gotten written up? Does it mess with your mental health and self esteem like it is mine?

A turbulent life and a dysfunctional, abusive family hadn\u2019t helped matters. Each year since then, I make an attempt to take my life at least once. And every year I fail miserably. This will be the 23rd year that I have to exist against my will. I do everything in my power to stay alive in spite of my suicide attempts. I focus on work, I write, draw comics,  exercise, pills, therapy, read and obey thousands of self help books. No matter what I do I continue to suffer. It feels like I have a disease or a cancer that I\u2019m forced to live with. I\u2019m not sure that I can continue much longer.\n\nBut then I had a thought. Just like many others, I do not believe that anyone really gives a rats ass about what\u2019s going on in my head-nor would they care if I were dead. Honestly, I assume that people do feel a sense of dread when someone they know has passed.\n\nPeople say that others do care and that they wish that their friends had reached out to them in a time of need. So I did just that and contacted some of my closest friends. I experimented with the idea The attempt seemed to have just made things worse. \n\n\nNot that it matters, but the idea of people talking about me when I\u2019m dead:\n\n\u201cShe had everything to live for.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she just tell me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat did she have to be sad about\u201d\n\nOr just overall acting as if they didn\u2019t see it coming. People tend to make the death of others about themselves and it can be frustrating.  But again, it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s obvious that I just needed to vent.

All I have been wishing for every night is death's eternal embrace and mourning the coming of dawn.\n\nThroughout my childhood I have been plagued by unfortunate events. None of which have drove me to this point single handedly, but collectively deal quite a punch. I used to go out and adventure/explore nature and the great out doord, but then I got caught under a tornado with 30+ other children convinced they were going to die in a small wooden cabin. I remember their screams and me shaking with fear saying what I thought were my last prayers as a wall of water bent proud trees to the ground. Obviously I survived, but it started chipping away at me. \n\nThen I was white water rafting and I fell out which is scary in its own right, but my shoe got stuck. The current was too strong for me to reach my foot and it pulled me under in a swirling chaos. Luckily, someone grabbed what little of my hand peaked out of the water and managed to pull me to safety.\n\nNot too long after in almost perfect procession a friend killed himself, another friend died of disease, and a mentor drowned. Soon after a neighbors house blow up because of a gas leak and I was one of the first on the scene. Seeing melting faces and adults going into shock is something I still cannot explain to this day. The terror in their eyes still makes me want to cry.\n\nThen, my close friend killed himself after a series of mysterious dreams I had about him dying (which is another can of worms outside the realm of this subreddit). \n\nI turned agoraphobic for a brief period of time and constantly suffered from crippling depression and anxiety. Not wanting to live the rest of my life like that I forced myself onwards, ever onwards.\n\nI got lucky and soon had my own apartment, an amazing gf and started my own business which almost instantly turned a profit. After a long drawn out battle with anxiety I finally felt happy. Something I had forgotten how to feel.\n\nBut it wasn't meant to last. Shortly after I moved to further my education. The new environment and having no friends really hurt and my business suffered. My gf decided she didn't want to do distance and I could no longer afford my apartment. Needless to say my business almost completely went under. \n\nAnd here I am writting a terribly long post looking to vent and to help get myself to continue moving onward, ever onward. \n\nThank you for your time.",

        "original": "This is very long, and I apologize for that. If you care to read this (and especially respond), you have my utmost gratitude. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a 23-year-old male, recently graduated from college last May. I got a degree in graphic design only because I had dreams of making video games when I was younger. Turns out, I don't like doing graphic design stuff all that much. I can do text-based stuff fine, but I feel like I still absolutely suck at illustration. There are only a handful of jobs in that industry in my area, mostly small, family-owned businesses that can't afford to hire anybody. Those that can want people with more work experience. I'll come back to this topic in a bit.\n\nI've always lived at home. I drove to college everyday. My dad died from cancer shortly after I started college, and his father, my grandfather, shortly thereafter. This eventually made me so depressed that I did attempt to hang myself at one point, but the belt I used snapped. And no, I don't feel so suicidal now, just depressed enough now that the idea occasionally enters my mind, but nothing beyond that.\n\nI live with my mom, and see my other close family members and friends often enough. Since I was a baby, I've had vitiligo. I have light skin anyway, but the patches are widespread & noticeable. I also have a patch of white hair from it too that stands out. Sometimes people think its cool, other times there are the obvious stares, snickers, or pointing. Some people must think I chose to dye my hair or something. I actually can't really dye it to look normal with regular hair dye, since it would aggravate the disorder further. There is a kind that works that I used in high school some, but it had to be done everyday and was a hassle. I felt like I was censoring myself for other people. Even then, I'm fairly self-conscious about it.\n\nI've always been nerdy, I suppose. Pokemon hooked me as a kid, and I'm a gamer & anime fanatic. Call me a weeaboo if you want, I don't really care. (As I've gotten older, I've also come to appreciate languages, history, geography, and martial arts.) Naturally, during middle & high school, I was reluctant to talk to many other kids because some of them made fun of me for my interests. I was the goody-two-shoes quiet kid that liked weird & \"kiddy stuff\". I tend to talk about my interests a lot, to be fair, and get very upset if I can't pursue my life goals immediately.\n\nMy distress is never obvious. It's almost always hidden away. I used to be incredibly optimistic towards the end of high school. A \"fall down seven times, get up eight\" attitude, no matter what the odds were. I was gonna kick the world's ass, but instead, it's thoroughly kicked mine.\n\nDue to stuff like being shy about my interests and my vitiligo, as well as being somewhat short (5'6\") compared to my other male peers, I developed social anxiety. Every time I meet new people, I feel like I have to start over conquering my social anxiety. I didn't like college as much as I could have because of this, and now things are even worse. I've also never had a girlfriend, date, kiss, sex, let alone held a girl's hand romantically. I don't blame my height so much, but I do get self-conscious about it. I also don't foolishly blame women. I place the blame squarely and solely at my own two feet.\n\nI blame myself for having this crippling anxiety when talking to women I'm attracted to. I've managed to get the courage a few times to talk to romantic interests, but I'm so awkward it never goes anywhere, especially since I rarely get to know them (most of the time, anyway).\n\nDue to my lack of experience, my anxiety with women only progressively gets worse because I'm embarrassed to be 23, when middle school kids have more relationship experience than I've ever had. I feel like I would need to be with a woman who shares some of my interests, given how obsessive I can be.\n\nI've therefore left romance up to fate and focused on my studies. I'm not some stereotypical millennial/Gen Z guy that insular older folks like to imagine who would rather play video games all day than work. That's not the problem, I do want to work, and I don't play games all day. Half the time, I stay up until 2:00 AM looking at local job listings. Plus, my current vehicle is unreliable & is being worked on, so I'm more or less stranded at home until it's fixed anyway. I'm ashamed of my unemployment, but not so willing to accept anything either. I don't want just any job, because working a dead-end, anxiety-inducing job that I hate would undoubtedly make me more depressed than I am already, and I would be teetering on the edge of self-destruction.\n\nI also don't exactly wanna work in the field I studied in either. I find it to be a very subjective and stressful field, full of deadlines looming over my head. I don't exactly want to move. That said, if anything, I'd love to teach English in Japan, but it's a long & arduous process to apply, and can be expensive to start up. It's quite nerve-wracking and lonely, but it may be just the jump-start to my adult life that I need. The most accredited program for that only takes applicants in the fall months too. I don't wanna go so far from my mother & friends though. I have a dear, old friend who is in more of a rut than me, honestly, that I would hate to leave without my direct aid, but we would undoubtedly talk via video chatting regularly anyway, as we do now. My mother gets upset whenever I've mentioned the mere idea of going all the way to Japan, but it's my life at the end of the day. I'd also genuinely like to be a voice actor someday.\n\nI wish I was younger. A teenager in high school. Seeing all my friends everyday. My dad & grandfather still alive. Not having to worry about searching for some crappy \"job in the meantime\". My goals lie far beyond that, but feel so out of reach. I just keep living for tiny things like a new video game coming out later on in the year or grander stuff like the possibility of traveling the world. I'm also almost a black belt in karate, so there's another goal. I've recently started learning Japanese in earnest. And yet, despite all these goals, I feel so scared, terrified even, of the future. I hate uncertainty, and I hate change for the most part. \n\nAt this point, I feel like I'm just surviving, but not truly living. I want happiness, with a sense of peace like I haven't felt since I was 18. I don't want to feel like I've peaked anymore. I want to be able to say my life is better than even back then, and will only get better despite any hardships. I don't feel like I'm an adult. I feel like a teenager whose life has moved on without him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to be happy, and to spread that happiness with others. I want to look forward to the future, always.",

I was recently diagnosed with PTSD and Anxiety( which wasn't surprising). I have been in and out of the hospital since july of 2019 due to neurological issues and as a result I had missed work from july to October and went without income. I got behind on alot of Bill's namely car payment. I finally was able to go back to work the 3rd week of october. I was starting to get caught back up and I had a fraud charge on my bank account. So I switched accounts but I forgot to re set up auto pay on my new account for my car payment so it got behind again and I got a call today saying if I diddnt pay today they were repossessing the car thankfully it was payday so I was able to prevent it and pay what I needed but that cleaned out my entire paycheck so now I cant make anything else. My wife has had a very bad week (shes a teacher and is being run over by parents. And her admin team are not supportive) but today she said was good well I got home from work and told her that I was flat broke again and the light just kinda drained from her eyes.

He beat the everliving shit out of me, constantly verbally abused me, etc.\n\n***4th grade***: My uncle, who I had been seeing every other weekend in lieu of my dad (he was in jail) died, this fucked me up seeing as how he was as close to a father figure as I had seen. My grades plummeted, I lashed out, and I failed the 4th grade.\n\n**age 12**: My mom started dating a man named Patrick, who was a good man, but was a bit of an alcoholic.\n\n**age 13**: I start struggling in school again, the constant arguments between my mom and Patrick keep me up at night.\n\n**age 15**: My mom is diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, I completely shut down and fail the 9th grade. When re-attempting the 9th grade I leave school to take care of my mom. She passed away in early 2016.\n\n**age 18**: Hurricane Michael hits my town, wiping everything out. I went 3 months without power and water, everything I held dear to me, including pictures of my mom were destroyed.\n\n**Now**: I'm broke, sleeping in a garage, and pleading for money from friends and family. I know i'm pathetic but I don't feel bad about it, i feel nothing, it's just a fact to me. I've tried hanging myself during a stay in a psych ward, in those few seconds of asphyxiation I found peace, I felt my grip on consciousness loosen as my vision began to darken before the nurses unwrapped the phone cord from my throat.\n\nThat got me thinking though, I don't deserve a peaceful way out, i've been going through hell my whole life, why should my death be any different?

Still had sexual relations with her for a couple weeks after and we still hung out every day. Randomly, 2 weeks after she told me that she fucked someone else (I was her first) and then completely cut me off on everything and told me she never wanted to see or talk to me again. Of course this was damaging being that we had been together for just over a year and I felt a much stronger connection to her than anyone in my entire life. Not to mention that this was the end of high school and I had not many other friends (my only 3 other friends went to a different school a couple towns over). Fast forward 4 months and I\u2019m on the brink of taking my own life for the first time, my plan was to jump off a parking garage in a nearby town in the very early morning (because I didn\u2019t want anyone to be able to help me and my family goes to sleep very late). For some reason the night I decided I was gonna go through with it, my alarm did not go off. 3 days later, the morning of my high school graduation, my older sisters fianc\u00e9 shot himself in the head and I was there when the doctors told his parents and my sister that he wouldn\u2019t survive. Seeing the kind of trauma this had on my sister made me think that if I had actually gone through with my plans a few nights before, she would still have her amazing fianc\u00e9. Over the summer I had an internship with my uncle and became very close to his new puppy as I would be tasked with taking him for walks and such. By the end of the summer his puppy had also passed away do to a digestive tract issue that was causing him a lot of pain and cost too much for the family to afford. At the end of summer I went off to college, and was a member of my colleges football team. I did not do well my first semester, due to my increasing amount of depression and I could not handle such a large change. Besides my grades, at school I\u2019ve actually made a lot of friends, I get invited to all the parties on weekends and should be happy with the way my social life is going, but I don\u2019t feel much of a strong connection to anyone I\u2019ve met there, like they were just in one of my dreams. Near the end of my first semester my cat of 13 years passed away from cancer, she used to sleep in my bed every night with me as I\u2019d cry myself to sleep. It\u2019s to the point now where I literally don\u2019t care about the outcome of anything anymore, I don\u2019t feel an emotional attachment to anything, I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning and have lost most of my appetite. \n\nI know I messed things up with my ex, and I run into her every now and again. Although I know I have the capacity and knowledge to be a much better man for her now, I can\u2019t even look at her do to the fear of her shooting me down or insulting me. The kind of love that we had, I know that she must still have some feelings for me, even if they are deep down but I\u2019m scared to try to make contact with her again. I have been contemplating getting back in touch with her over the past few days but I\u2019m not sure if I should, for her sake and for mine. We broke up on a rough note, but a rough note that could have very easily been worked past.\n\nAnd I mean I\u2019ve been in a haze in that it\u2019s now to the point that most things don\u2019t seem real anymore and my emotions feel distant and dull.",

All in the month of December. For some background info on me, I\u2019m a junior in college as an engineering student, live at home (in a dysfunctional and tumultuous family), gay, a traffic victim, and fighting my brain for the past 7 years. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder coupled with major anxiety disorder (which is getting increasingly worse), ADHD, and depression. I\u2019v4e been on strattera, lexapro, wellbutrin, trazadone, zoloft, and clonidine. I\u2019m currently on Prozac, lamotrigine, Buspar, and myrtazipine. I regularly see a therpist (but we don\u2019t do CBT or DBT it\u2019s mostly just for me to talk stuff out). I was in a 6 week outpatient program that my parents didn\u2019t even know I was in until I was already 2 weeks in when they found my binder. I have my fair share of nonslip fuzzy socks (I had to sneak out of my house and self admit myself so my parents wouldn\u2019t know). My dad and I have been at it for years, but I only tighten and curl up and never fight back; he was physically and emotionally abusive to me and my mom for the first 14 years of my life. Being an Indian dad, I was held to overbearingly high standards as a kid, and to this day, and anything from perfect was completely unacceptable (like being gay, which he doesn\u2019t know about). I lost motivation around 8th grade to do well in school. I was still an AP kid in high school and held officer positions in many clubs and student council, but never really did my homework or at least on time, I just relied on my test grades. Thankfully, I had the best support group among my friends, who literally saved my life many times, and we\u2019ve all grown incredibly close to each other. Long story short I only got accepted to the university in my hometown and have been going there since. The lack of motivation continued, but now coupled with frequent suicidal and maladaptive episodes. I lost my satisfactory academic progress standing this past summer and was given 3 semesters to make it up. I medically withdrew fall 2018 for my mental health. In the fall 2019 semester, firstly I did not put my full effort into it (even moreso than past semesters), and failed 2 of my engineering classes. I had already repeated 3 engineering classes before and you can\u2019t repeat more than 4 courses in the engineering college without being expelled from your major. So I was. My petition got denied and you can\u2019t do two hardship withdrawals for the same reason. As for the car, I totaled it in December following an anxiety attack when I was driving home and drove up a hill into a fence. Regrettably, I am physically ok. My parents bought it for me brand new in March 2017. I got into a major accident in June 2017. My insurance is around $650 a month now.\n\nTLDR I just want to throw away my life to drugs and give up and be euthanized. I have no motivation to do anything in life anymore because I know I can\u2019t get anywhere from here. I'm only getting worse despite all my treatment.  My parents know that I got expelled from my major but haven\u2019t actually talked to me about it. I\u2019ve been nothing but a problematic kid and don\u2019t deserve anything else from my parents. Any feedback and coaching is greatly greatly appreciated :)\n\nThank you for listening",

My personality is shit and the only reason I  have \"friends\" is because I willingly make myself the butt of the joke but I guaranteed you if I were to say \"guys I'm sad\" they'd stay a 10 mile radius away from me. \nI don't even want to hear that shit about \"your family will be sad if you died\" \nMy mom's already dead so I don't need to deal with that guilt not that I care considering she wasn't the best mom. \nI resent my dad to all hell. He's a religious asshole who never once tried to accept me for who I am. Instead of being a good parent and attempting to raise my self esteem if I had a problem he told me it was my fault I didn't \"pray\" hard enough. All my hard work and accomplishments were undercut because \"that god he blessed you to succeed\" as though I didn't even attempt to put in the hard work or make any sacrifices that lead to my success. Not once has he ever told me \"good job\". I can literally put blood, sweat, and tears into my work and graduate with straight A's and he'd tell me \"there's always room for improvement\" because being perfect just isn't enough and taking pride in your own accomplishments without thanking \"God\" is sinful.\n I'm not religious because of him. I refuse to believe in a god  that's cursed me with a disease, hates me for being queer, gave my mom a terminal illnes, and placed this much financial burden on my family. I can get down on my knees and pray but it's not gonna help these fucking bills get paid. \nMy sisters a fucking cunt who does nothing but talk shit about me with my dad so honestly she can fuck off too. \nMy brother is the only saving grace but if I were to tell him I'm depressed he'd tell me to \"suck it up\" cause it's my own fault for being depressed and it's his policy \"not to pity\" people even though I've literally been diagnosed with manic depression and anxiety. I'm pretty sure if I died he'd be like whatever cause ya know, feeling sad would be pitting someone with an actual mental illness. \nI've attempted suicide 3 times and told my doctors about it but I've never been prescribed anything so I  guess I'll keep coping by slicing up with wrist and popping oxys with vodka.\nIf God does exsist then I guess I'm gonna go to hell but I honestly can't keep doing this anymore. I can't keep going to school and pretending I'm this goofy ass happy go lucky token chocolate chip in a pool of rich vanilla ass white kids. \nI'm just gonna bide my time and when It finally warms up I'm gonna out on a hike up into the mountains and finally off myself.",

        "original": "**Backstory:**\n\nHi, I'm 15, and I hate my life right now. Some people might think that my reasons are unimportant or that there are worse things that can happen to you in life, but I just want to get it out there. From the start, I was born in Ukraine and lived there for about 4 years, we then moved to Belgium because my dad could make more money there. By the way, my parents had a shitty life in Ukraine (this is important for later). Honestly moving there wasn't so bad, in fact it was the best thing that happened to me. I learned to speak Dutch, made allot of friends, we spent *allot* of time together, life  was great. Things started when I entered middle school, my big friend group fell apart, and my best friend went to a different school, so I was feeling depressed for a little while. We still talked to each other on Discord and things were, *okay.* School hit me like a train, I had to make friends all over again, which was hard to do since people in my class were assholes, also I started failing school, I mean I was an overachiever my whole life and yet here I was with shitty grades, disappointing my parents. The sad part is that all of this happened during Christmas, this was the moment when I started to hate Christmas, not only did I not receive any presents, (I'm not even talking about my birthday), but I got into big fight between me and my parents. It was a really annoying year. Second year felt like it didn't even exist because pretty much nothing happened and I just didn't care, the only thing that I remember is the big Christmas fight that was even worse than last years. Now when third year started (third year = freshman year in Belgium), I thought this was going to be the best year ever, I had great classmates and even some older friends were in my class, things were going great, until they weren't. Introducing...   \n\n\n**The torture triangle**:  \n\n\nI make my parents depressed because I have bad grades and because of me being depressed, my dad starts getting stressed which leads to medical problems and that makes my mom depressed, fun fact about my mom: When I was 6, I was sick, ALL OF THE TIME, so that made her paranoid for me becoming sick which turned her into a cleaning torture machine, sometimes I feel like she doesn't even care for me and who I am, my interests, school, all she cares about is if I'm alive and well and that's literally it. Also she doesn't even have a job because she was too lazy and scared to learn Dutch for 10 years, which made my dad so mad that he wanted divorce. She puts hygiene above literally everything and does unnecessary actions which make everything she does 100 times harder or longer than they should be. Also every trip to anywhere goes to shit because we are always late because of her, there wasn't a single time when we had a trip without yelling or anger and us being right on time. Every day there is a fight about the dumbest of things, which makes me depressed and not want to be a part of this family anymore, so I just run of to my room and sit on my computer all day long with my friends, usually, because now I can't anymore thanks to my dad.\n\nBecause of my bad grades my dad claims that me being on my computer all day is the source of my bad grades and he's right, but It's also my only source of happiness. So he allows me to spend about 1 hour a day (including my phone) which is just a bombshell for me, I can't make videos anymore, I can't laugh anymore, I can't spend time with my friends anymore,I can't play anymore, I feel lonely. And instead, I have to read 3 books which consist of 500 pages each, IN Ukrainian (a language in which I never read) which is 1500 pages, great. When I read, all I can think about is: my friends are enjoying life together without me and they don't have to worry about the shit that I worry about. Why do I think so much about my friends? I have no siblings, there is nobody I can share my feelings with, because my parents don't care about my feelings, all they want is for me to do work. My friends are the only people in life who I can speak with freely. Not having siblings means I have no motivation for school, because I wouldn't have rivalry to motivate me to be better than them, meaning that all my parents have is me and I'm their only chance, which is a huge burden for me. \n\nI can't be myself because I have to fulfill my parents' wishes, also I have to listen to how awful their life was back in the day, which makes my problems seem meaningless, which makes me guilty for existing and thinking my problems are problems. The thing is, I can't possibly know how my parents' life was because I could never possibly experience what they have experienced. I have my own problems and my own scale, my parents couldn't possibly understand the things that I'm dealing with. Over time I also realized that I'm more poor than other kids, so I feel very separated from them. Also over the last couple of weeks my friends have been avoiding me at school because I can't socialize online anymore, and it just makes me feel empty and even more lonely. My only motivation in life right now is my friends cheering me up and me spending time on my computer/phone. Please end me..  \n\n\nTLDR; My depression and my bad grades torture my parents, which makes them fight to the brink of divorce, my mom tortures us with her hygiene, my dad tortures me by making me do everything I don't want to do and take away all happiness that I have.

I can't say I've felt any better since starting them & at times have felt a lot worse. Has anybody else experienced this on mirtazapine?

Therapy (CBT through my wellbeing) said they can't help me & tried to pass me onto the local mental health team. They rejected the referral & told me to go back to my docs....my dad struggled with depression & eventually tried to take his life a few years ago. Got to watch him spend 2 weeks slowly fading away in a hospital bed. Tried killing myself 3 times in my life (at 14, 19 & 22, now 29). Now I've two concrete plans for killing myself one day.

Mental health team aren't interested because I'm not planning to kill myself today or tomorrow or even next week, but I do plan to one day take my own life (I'm owned by 2 cats & I've resolved to not kill myself whilst they're alive as they rely on me to survive).

My aunts husband is a piece of shit that blames my mother for his alcoholism and told her he sided with him throughout the whole time. There were some instances that made me almost puke in my mouth a bit. He is a no one to me(talking about that husband now), he did some things for us sometimes but it's nothing, legit fuck all compared to other families and their relations.\n\nThe thing that sucks most about this childhood of mine is that I resolved to playing games from a young age(11-12) to engulf my sadness and this is one of the reasons I am so stupid today. I never had a father figure and I don't know shit about anything, cars, computers, any work around the house, I am so fucking incapable of some fundamental things due to my poor upbringing and that hurts me so much that I can't relate with my friends when they talk about such things. I hated middle school, but maybe I was bitter due to my situation...high school was hell first 2 years due to a sadistic teacher(wanna stay anonymous so not gonna say what subject) that ruined many generations and a few other horrible teachers.\n\nIn third year I stressed so much that I had to go to the doctor due to my chest hurting. Luckily, all is fine.\n\nComing closer to the present, 2019 was the worst year in my life. In January I was emotionally manipulated, lied to and degraded by the first person I ever loved, and that was 2-3 days from the 7th year anniversary of my fathers death, this destroyed me emotionally. Then in May I met a girl at prom which I still objectively think was the best for me. We went to 2 dates and after the 2nd we never saw each other because I was a pussy, I didn't make a move and then at the end of it asked for the kiss(I got it though). Although I am not sure this was the reason, cause she left for another city to study so she said she didn't wanna give me false hope, which is okay, but she could have said that at the beginning and not a month after we have known each other. Anyway, to my surprise I got over it somewhat quickly. Then in september I met a girl in a club that was just such a bitch, at first I gave her my number and we chatted a bit and when I asked her out she said she forgot how I look like and even if she did she doesn't want any action now, and then we agreed somehow to meet, but that she will call me in a few weeks, she didn't. Later due to my stubbornness and anger found out she had a bf the entire time. Then in October met a girl while outside with friends drinking, we had a decent first date but after that she ignored me 2 times when we were out. So I decided to block her on all social media, fuck her. I had a few other encounters but they were so irrelevant that they are not worth mentioning. I am happier now because at the end of December 2019 I met a girl from instagram and now we are basically boyfriend and girlfriend.\n\nThe problem now is that a part of my family is moving to a bigger house and we will probably live with my uncle for a while and this is a huuuuge deal for me, I have been in this house for almost 20 years and leaving it now(even though I had bad memories with it) will have an impact on me, although going to college will be easier and this is a change needed cause we were 2 families in 1 house and we don't really like each other that much. I know this is petty and uncalled for from me, but I HATE the fact that I have such a small shitty family and that I couldn't have the privilege that many other peers of mine had. I feel so left out and sad when I hear other family related stories so I think you can get my frustration.\n\nI am in university now, I am doing okay, but this one subject I can't pass due to my laziness and insomnia and not having that subject in highschool, it's extremely hard for me and I feel so fucking stupid. I wanna change for the better but my position doesn't allow me, in regard of home and mental state. Sometimes I get so bored that I fall into depression, feel like a burden too. Somedays I feel like I can just end my life to end my suffering and unfair life from start to \"finish\".\n\nWhat can I do if I have the vibe that I am never going to make it no matter how hard I try?",

The magnitude is difficult to describe but I\u2019m sure people here may find it familiar: crushing, relentless, physically exhausting hopelessness. I\u2019ve battled it since my earliest memories. Helping out is the classic gauntlet of co-occurring stuff\u2014anxiety, apathy, episodes of paranoia/delusion, massive addiction problems, body image issues. \n\nI\u2019ve worked with therapists and taken meds to varying degrees for most of my life in conjunction with periods of fitness, 12 Step programs, geographical solutions, so forth. After another psych ward stay in October I was assigned my current shrink who specializes in trauma and child abuse. \n\nThe somewhat outward nature of my craziness leads to considerable collateral damage. To mitigate this I\u2019ve isolated myself completely apart from work and bumping into my roommate. This keeps embarrassing incidents to a minimum but is lonely for sure. \n\nI\u2019m at a major crossroads. On one hand, I\u2019m literally going insane. I don\u2019t know whether there is deeper psychosis at work or if my depression is simply so extreme that my brain has started eating itself (I wouldn\u2019t dismiss either possibility). My paranoid phases are getting longer and worse and I\u2019m having violent impulses towards others and myself both at work and at home. I\u2019ve always kept my exterior together and managed at least a basic personal maintenance routine but lately I\u2019m losing my grip on it. My ability to keep a job is slipping through my fingers. I\u2019m out of energy to keep trying treatments and I\u2019ve done considerable damage to my social life and family with no results whatsoever. My self-talk has shifted from abusive to nightmarish. \n\nOn the other hand I don\u2019t want to die. It scares the shit out of me. Big questions about the afterlife, the toll it will take on my family, etc are all horrifying. Also the probable event of surviving an earnest attempt is almost always its own kind of hell. In the event of success, if I make my body disappear my family will be scared and confused, but if I allow someone to find me that could be even worse. I have three younger siblings who are all in the throes of their teenage years and they won\u2019t understand why I abandoned them. \n\nThe kicker: my mom is certifiably insane and I see my own trajectory mirroring hers closely. While I\u2019m running just half of her software she\u2019s running the whole thing, and the wreckage surrounding her is spectacular. Three kids to two fathers and none of them will go near her, no friends, unemployed for twenty years and counting. She lives alone in misery, consumed by conspiracy and delusion. In a perversely funny way I think only getting half of her programming is what cursed me; in her case, the insanity being less episodic and more of a constant wherein any self-awareness or grounding in reality has dissolved entirely, living like that is somehow tolerable. I would rather die than realize that future for myself. \n\nSo I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m tired of hurting, tired of hurting others, feeling driven to madness by the weight of this depression that just won\u2019t give me a break no matter what I try.

        "original": "I had a lot of friends in 2016 and stuff, and it just slowly got worse as years went by and now I have only one friend left that I can talk to, who is my boyfriend. I stopped taking meds like one and a half year ago and i hoped things would get better, but they\u2019re not. I planned to off myself soon, which was really calming to think about but also really sad because of knowing that I would die alone. My boyfriend (then best friend) promised that he would be with me, etc. We started dating, and eventually plans about the future started to pop up. We\u2019re doing long distance which is really hard but seeing him is the best feeling ever and I really want to move in with him and have a life with him in the future. I would have definitely killed myself this year if it wasn\u2019t for him. He promised me he would be there for me no matter what and he loved me more than anything else in the world. Then, this summer the \u201cI\u2019ll be there for you always\u201d turned into a \u201cI can\u2019t always be there for you\u201d. He told me that before I spend a lot of time with him this summer, he saw me as a 10 and now I\u2019m a 7.5. I have no one else to talk to and he has told me that he needs space and that i am clingy. Today, I was excited about a topic and I tried to tell him about it and suddenly, he told me \u201cgod you make your stories too long!!!\u201d And that he had to go for a few mins. He has no idea how sad this makes me. I thought I found the perfect person, and he is perfect in every way, he is my favorite person and I look up to him so much. But it\u2019s really hard because I decided to not kill myself when I planned a future with him but I don\u2019t know if I can change much. I have severe depression, sometimes I make a mess and can\u2019t tidy up, and I\u2019m really sad that i value less in his eyes because of that. (He has told me that one of the reasons im not the perfect girl uwu or whatever the fuck is because im too messy). I cannot help these things and I know I\u2019m bad at it, but I am really trying my best. I guess you could say that I have some type of eating disorder, and for him I\u2019ve been trying to improve and actually eat. However I feel like throwing up when I do, because at this point my body rejects food I guess. So when I can\u2019t blow him semi-regularly, I don\u2019t think its my fault either. I\u2019m really trying hard to make myself healthier and better so you can be happy, and it doesn\u2019t help getting shamed because I\u2019m not constantly blowing him. I don\u2019t know what else to write to be honest, but this has made me feel better since I have no one else to talk to. Thanks if you read this ?",

Since I am also a female, I never admitted to either of my parents that I had this relationship.  Throughout this period of my life, my anxiety hit an all time high and I lived with constant paranoia/fear. My mom would constantly search my phone, question me, etc. 6 months into this relationship, my ex's sister made the incredibly stupid decision to report me to the school counselor for parental abuse. Of course, like any kid, I lied through my teeth. The counselor promised nothing would happen.  She lied. My family got reported to CPS, and I've been treated like crap ever since. I'll fast forward through most of the trauma but I got broken up with in August.  It would be an understatement to say it was messy. I got aggressive in a parking lot because I got tired of my ex constantly watch me get abused by my parents and siblings while doing nothing. I got physical, shoving her around.  She dumped me. I would like to note I finally got into therapy and I no longer have anger issues. My ex continued to harass me for months. My favorite highlights: performing a song in front of a crowd to humiliate me, claiming I was very physically abusive, and my personal favorite is when she sent me a four page Google doc telling me I was a worthless piece of shit on the day before Christmas. Oh, and my mom claims my ex gf texted her about me being an \"awful person\". So my life is basically screwed. My mom is a homophobic and verbally destructive bitch. My dad is present, but not involved and very aggressive when he is.  My sister is constantly criticizing my every move and was bff with my ex once we broke up. After years, I finally got therapy, and it worked for a little bit. But now I'm done fighting. I'm all by myself. What options does a 17 year old have? I can't be independent,  although I do have a job and money saved. I either leave by dying or running with nowhere to go. I'm tired, and my strength is completely gone.

I understand. I was adopted and came into the family late so I always knew I wasn\u2019t as important. \n\nI would come by during the summer and help her in the yard between shifts at work. I would say \u201clet\u2019s get together, hang out\u201d and we would plan something\u2014 only for it to fall through, the day of coming and going and her getting angry at me despite me having it in text that we said XYZ date and time and she maintains it was another date. It\u2019s happened so often and yet I kept asking, pleading to spend time with her, and the most recent time, I asked her at a Christmas party. She set a tentative date and now it\u2019s been finalized... but there\u2019s no bed for me there. Not even the couch, I\u2019d be on the floor. \n\nI can\u2019t help but feel slighted again. I\u2019ve been trying for three years and this is the closest I\u2019ve gotten to being able to see her outside of family obligations. I\u2019m not a stupid man, I know no one wants to be around me. My own fucking parents hate me. So I told my grandmother I couldn\u2019t make it, and I couldn\u2019t make it to the February plans she had started making \u2014 because February is my birth month and it was planned to be a birthday thing but if I\u2019m not going to the first one, it\u2019s selfish to go only to the birthday one. And she obviously doesn\u2019t actually want me there or she\u2019d try harder to find a work around, a place to sleep. Just another way to subtly say \u201cSocial mores demand I finally give in and pretend to make an effort, but don\u2019t actually take me up on it.\u201d\n\nSo I get it! No one wants me around. Not my old classmates, not my cousins, not my parents, and not my grandmother. \n\nBut me telling her that just set off a two hour screaming match with my parents. By which I mean I just got through being yelled at for two hours for snubbing my dad\u2019s mother and being selfish. And as I was trying so hard not to cry my dad\u2019s barking about how I\u2019m nearly 23 years old and I\u2019m sobbing in my seat, and mom\u2019s saying things like \u201cYou are so short sighted, it amazes me\u201d and \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have invited you if she didn\u2019t want you there. She\u2019s not fake\u201d except she has to eventually pretend to or else she looks like the selfish one. \n\nBut I am not blind. I am always, ALWAYS, the one reaching out. Grasping at the pant legs of anyone who passes by and shows even a little bit of friendliness. But people are polite, and nothing more, and they tolerate me because it\u2019s easier to be polite or evasive than tell me to stop trying. I get it. \n\nSo I parrot what they want me to say, that I was selfish and I\u2019ll apologize and text her tomorrow, mom asks \u201cAre you just telling us what we want to hear?\u201d\n\nYes of fucking course I am. How do you think I\u2019ve survived living with you this long? \n\nI\u2019m just so damn tired of being tolerated by people I hope will treat me differently than my parents. I\u2019m tired of my mom yelling at me, telling me to speak UP or else she\u2019ll \u201cget angry\u201d when I\u2019m crying so hard I can barely breathe. And her version of getting angry involves manhandling and it isn\u2019t a lot but it scares me, okay? I\u2019m a coward and I\u2019m afraid every time she grabs my arm to drag me closer or grips my jaw and brings our faces inches apart as she forces me to look her in the eyes and see absolute hatred and I don\u2019t want to get slapped, she\u2019s never slapped, only pushed me into the doorway, but it feels like it\u2019ll come any minute when she gets angry. \n\nI\u2019m so tired of being tolerated or hated and I\u2019m so tired of being scared and worse I\u2019m tired of having to kiss them goodnight after they\u2019ve yelled at me, of having to tell them that they\u2019re right, I am selfish and short sighted when I just want the pain to stop. Of having to agree with them and reassure them that they\u2019re right when they say wanting boundaries is selfish, that I\u2019m cruel and uncaring about everyone else when I\u2019ve wanted to disappear and not burden anyone any longer since I was TEN FUCKIN YEARS OLD. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair it\u2019s not fair. I should have been able to move out, I should be graduated from college by now, I should have a job where I can afford to leave home. \n\nI want to scream and sob loudly and punch something but they are on the other side of the wall and me expressing my feelings is snowflake syndrome and wanting to not get called a stupid bitch is coddling me. I have attempted suicide before, cut all over my arms and legs, been hospitalized twice, and have had two sessions of therapy\u2014 and they got angry over the second one because they tried to make it so I couldn\u2019t (\u201cwe aren\u2019t paying and we aren\u2019t driving you\u201d) and I found a solution (I paid and I got a ride). \n\nI don\u2019t see a way forward. All I see before me is more of the same. More of this. And I can\u2019t do it. I fucking can\u2019t. I\u2019ll never improve, it\u2019ll always be this way, and no one even wants me here while I am stuck here.",

        "original": "So I guess you guys get a lot of posts like this but I swear I wish I could die. I haven't thought about doing it recently. In order for you to understand let me elaborate. I don't have a father figure and was born into poverty in Canada. My youth was ok as I went to a nearby school and a lot of my friends were from similar circumstances. It wasn't until I got into this middle school for kids with good grades. I was severely bullied by others who had more money than I. It all seemed to be getting better when I met the girl of my dreams EJ in Grade 9. By the end of the year I was bullied into making a video for a tech class. The role I was forced into playing was that of a pedo/creep. I didn't want to and they forced me to do it even after seeing me cry. The succumbed me and I did it. Eventually that video was circulating throughout the school and the girl I liked EJ and her friend BK saw it. BK was a nasty B\\*\\*\\*\\* no other way to put it. Looking back on how my life turned out my life wouldn't be in shambles if I had never met this b\\*\\*\\*\\*. As I was from a poor family, I didn't have normal outfits to wear so i tended to wear two or three sets of clothes throughout the week. I was ridiculed for that by my peers. Anyways, I was super smart and I guess that's why BK felt threatened by it. Grade 10 starts and I find myself a social outcast. No body liked me and all my peers were spreading rumors about me as well as the video. When I found out about these rumors that I didn't belong and that I was a creep it broke me down.  The one thing fueling me was the love for this girl that I could be with. I was dumb enough to believe in true love and thought that she was my soul mate. So I took this law class in Grade 10 with BK and she slowly tortured me emotionally by stating that I was immature and a creep for remembering birthdays and that EJ was afraid of me. She would have these loud coughing outbursts in class and one day I secretly told her that they made me uncomfortable as I liked learning in the auditory method. She disregarded this and I thought she didn't really care that it bothered me. What devastated me the most was that EJ was afraid of me. I sort of fell in love with her eyes and couldn't stop myself from looking at them during class. When I realized that I could have made her uncomfortable that gave me physical pain and it made me suffer more than I should have as I did not realize that EJ was in fact a bully just like BK (who would have known!). But that law class became harder and she continued to cough hardly and it turned into a form of mental torture as she seemed to have discovered my kryptonite. She was vying for the law class award (for the highest mark in the class) and saw me as competition. I ended up winning that award but was emotionally and mentally broken. I wanted to die back then even more than I wanted to now. I did not realize the emotional game that BK, EJ and their friends  were playing on me. All my friends at school were not my friends in reality and they would often circulate the video and poke fun of me behind my back.  When I got the school involved it only appears to get worse as I then realized there were more rumors about me. It put me in a dark place. I didn't even know where I was sometimes and found myself getting lost and forgetting things. By the time grade 11 hit BK knew that the sound of coughing bothered me and utilized it as a weapon to torture me especially during my exams. She also knew that I wanted to become a doctor or engineer as she overheard me saying it to one of the grade 12 students in my integrated french class.  I told myself throughout the exams that it was only her coughing that bothered me. I couldn't as well have told the teachers that her coughing was bothering me so I wanted to eliminate the threat and decided to take my math exam in a quiet place as was the option. When the day of the exam came i entered to find EJ coughing loudly in my exam room taking the exam with me. I knew that it was a ploy by the girls to take me out of the academic picture. I couldn't concentrate. Because my heart was broken every cough she coughed felt like a knife plunging into my chest. I ended up getting a 54 in the course and my hopes of getting into a lot of schools with an early acceptance was dashed with it.  I knew I couldn't last much longer and I decided to switch highschools, like only these bitches could hurt me. So I left with a vengeance. If you're thinking what a weird dude... let me explain this to you, every time BK and EJ coughed it was a mental throwoff, my mind would shut off and instead of focusing on the task at hand, I would be thinking please make it stop make it stop. They could see the discomfort and pain that it was causing me and did it to ensure my grades would plummet and they did. When I moved to the new school, I had the unfortunate chance of meeting BK when the University tours were going on at my schools. The next day this girl at my new highschool whispered, Hi think of me as BK and started coughing loudly. It worked, their diabolical plan had me tearing up and full on sobbing in biology. At this point it did not matter that who coughed male or female every time it happened a knife would plunge into my heart. I had a manic episode shortly after and failed biology with a 34. I was hospitalized twice in three months. I was diagnosed with psychosis and was given so many pills and injections that I didn't know where I was and what day it was. I ended up having to retake the entire semester and the principal threatened me with a repeat of grade 12.  I ended up taking online courses and did really well in them enough to get a late admission to the University of Waterloo. By the time those girls found out about me attending university they proceeded to block me on all social media. The damage had been done though as every time someone coughed in 1st year lectures I could not focus on the lectures just the sound and the pain it was giving me. It was like Pavlov's dog. I felt like a tortured animal and wasn't as academically adept for the pace of university. It took me 6 years to complete my 3 year program between hospitalizations. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Over word of mouth I found out that BK got accepted to a pharmacy program and was on her way to fulfil my dream to become successful. With my crappy degree (3 year Science) Med School or any other higher up form of education was out of the question. Because of my lengthy stay and horrible grades due to my conditions and constant torture, I received the wonderful gift of 45000$ of debt while all of my peers who humiliated me have a masters or on their way to fulfilling their dreams. I studied hard but every exam when someone coughed it would put me into a spiral. I tried hard to overcome my phobia but its still there. Theres a lot more to the story and if you want to know I will continue the story in a part 2.  Right now I want to die. It's 12 am and I have to go to my  minimum wage job while the loans take 450 dollars from me each month. I wish it would all just end. Please don't make fun of me or ridicule me in any way.

My kids deserve better. I\u2019m useless. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I just want to give them away and kill myself. I can\u2019t find the strength to go on anymore. I don\u2019t have any support system. I got 40.00 to my name. I owe over 1500.00 in bills. My son turned 20 on the 8th and he hasn\u2019t talked to me in 5 years. I lost custody of my children because I believed my ex husband wasn\u2019t going to the court date. He fucking kidnapped my kids!!!! And when I found him he took me to court. After convinced me we are going to work it out. My dumb ass didn\u2019t go and they gave him full custody. I still feel guilty and stupid for believing him. Now I\u2019m here sitting on my bed. Writing a comment about me wanting to die. I was trying to redirect my thoughts. What would the kids go through if I did it? Where will they go? Who will take care of them? Will they get molested and raped like I was when I was their age? Then I think, I\u2019ll be dead. I won\u2019t have to worry about that. Then I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.

I had purpose, a message, a testimony !! I want to start a documentary/motivation speaking type business. Sounds weird but with everything I went through, it\u2019s a miracle I\u2019m here right now. It was at my very lowest moment my Aha moment came to me. I know some people will doubt it, but I hope I can be able to give someone else hope. I was ready to give up finally.

        "original": "I've been lurking here every now and then after I lost my first vent friend last year. She stopped messaging me because of her divorce and all the life issues she's dealing with. I don't blame her really but she always understood what and how I was thinking, and never gave shitty replies like \"you just gotta do what you gotta do\" or \"it'll get better\" or basic shit like that.\n\nGrowing up my relationship with my parents got gradually worse. I stopped going to school because I hated it and I wanted to be at home and be homeschooled. However, they didn't agree with that and didn't \"believe in it\" (whatever that means) and wanted me to go to school like \"every other kid\".\n\nI was never really bullied, but I'm mostly shy and introverted and I didn't connect with a lot of the people in school. I hated the environment, I hated waking up early for pointless shit that wasn't going to benefit me and that I would end up forgetting anyway, and I wasn't doing what I wanted to do.\n\nEarly on I was never thinking about college. I knew that school > college > normie job was something that definitely wasn't in the cards for me. What I really wanted to do was work on trying to play video games professionally, and try out cosplay, YouTube, streaming, that sort of stuff. These are my hobbies and multiplayer games and other online activities are my outlet. In that element I feel so much happier and feel like I can better connect and relate to others. In fact I'm more extroverted and sometimes I feel like the \"alpha\" of my friend groups in that environment.\n\nI eventually left school to homeschool but things did not improve after that. I was all on my own. My parents were trying to nag me to get a job but, not only did I have no interest in doing so, I wasn't even legally able to get a job because I was still underage.\n\nDuring that time I was just using my shitty laptop and shitty internet to play a few particular multiplayer games. I also lost access to my Xbox when my dad took it away for no good reason and then gave it back but then the ethernet port blew out so I virtually lost contact with all my good Halo friends.\n\nAdditionally, during that time he dropped the bombshell that he married some other woman and her family. He sent me a letter while he was deployed basically saying, \"Hi son. I'm not going to support your video games anymore. You're gonna have to get a job but I married another woman and her family and I hope you support that.\" I started crying and tore up the letter and I swore I would never accept that other family or see them. I still have not to this day and still feel as strongly as I did then.\n\nFast forward 9 years later now, I have one pet who's like my daughter and she's really the only reason why I haven't killed myself yet. I really want to but I don't want to do that to her. I don't trust her with my mom.\n\nAll I really do now is surf through twitch in a few of my favorite games and react and share memes through a notebook an online friend actually gifted me. There was another crappy laptop I used that my mom had that was able to play one of the games I played on prior laptop but it ended up failing last year.\n\nI've been going through major withdrawal because I can't play my favorite games and I feel so broken, empty and unmotivated because I feel like I've missed out on so much and because my parents robbed me of my childhood all for a stupid piece of paper that I never ended up getting anyway.\n\nI have no regrets of the choices I've willingly made, but I regret having the parents I do and I wish I was never born.",

        "original": "So Monday my the new semester at college starts. Before we started winter break, I switched my major from architecture to exploratory with a computer focus. This is just my second semester,  but I decided I did *not* want to continue with architecture. I initially chose it because I didn\u2019t really feel like I had an option 2 to go into, and I didn\u2019t want to go in doing *nothing.*\n\nNow back to today, and I just now told my mom about how I switched. I had talked to her about it before and she got all upset and pissy about it, and so that\u2019s why back in November I changed my major without talking to her about it. I know her well enough to expect what she\u2019d do if I mentioned it to her and I wanted to hear none of it. Today after I told her, she told me that she knew all along that I switched and wanted \u201cto see how long you\u2019d keep lying about it.\u201d What the fuck? I told her before this I hesitated because I was afraid of how she\u2019d react.\n\nNext she told me I was lazy, didn\u2019t try, was completely capable of completing that major, etc. Well, I *did* try, but after the first few week, it kept feeling more and more like I didn\u2019t want to continue. That impacted my work quality and I was very considerably underperforming compared to those in my studio class. I almost dropped out of it in October, but decided to at least finish out the semester.\n\nMy mom was then telling me about how she\u2019s not paying for me to go even though I \u201cdon\u2019t care enough and want to take the easy way out.\u201d Before I started college I had told her about why I chose architecture, and I verbally stated my concerns about it. Even back then I was worried it might not work out for me and that I wouldn\u2019t know what to do, yet she still paid for my first year.\n\nNext is the ironic part. She\u2019s on the verge of not paying for anymore of my college, despite her before telling me I couldn\u2019t drop out, that \u201cunder no circumstances can you not go to college.\u201d It is way too expensive for me to pay by myself, even with loans, grants, or scholarships (not that I\u2019m eligible to very many, and none that are too significant). Besides, if I don\u2019t know what to hell I want to do, why waste my own money on college? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how she feels, but she\u2019s the one who decided to pay for it in the first place, which I honesty didn\u2019t think she was going to before I enrolled. However, she acts like she\u2019s working her ass off to pay for it. If that\u2019s the case why is she looking to buy an $80,000 SUV when she just bought a $45,000 just a little over 2 years ago? Why did she just spend $3000 on ONE RING at the jewelry store? All that money would easily pay for all of my schooling, and then some. Not to mention my stepdad is looking at a new Ram truck when he bought one for $60,000 8 MONTHS AGO. I don\u2019t think my stepdad is paying for any of my school, but my mom is and she has the money, but apparently cars and rings are more important to her than her one and only son and his future. I don\u2019t know, maybe this seems a bit greedy, me saying this.\n\nBut honestly I don\u2019t see myself having much of a future. Nothing interests me enough to pursue as a career. Hobby, yes, but nothing I can imagine myself doing from 9-5 or anything like that. If my mom stops paying for my college, I won\u2019t have a chance at anything that you\u2019d need a degree for. I know you can get jobs without college, but it\u2019s harder to get better jobs from my understanding. I can\u2019t just go and live on my own either, because I\u2019m 100% reliant on my mom. I\u2019m convinced she raised me like this so she could dictate my life, and that\u2019s practically what she\u2019s done.\n\nMaybe she\u2019s right. Maybe I am lazy because I don\u2019t want to fucking do anything anymore. I\u2019ve never done anything with my life, how can I see myself doing anything more in the future? Why *does* she still pay for my schooling when I\u2019m like this? I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. If she actually does go ahead and stop paying for my college, I will not have that opportunity again. All I am is just a drain on her and society. Even though I\u2019m sure my family loves me, I don\u2019t feel much of it. To me it feels like I\u2019m just \u201cthere\u201d and that\u2019s it.\n\nWhy do I keep letting this go on? I\u2019m not about to kill myself but if it gets to the stage where I really run out of options (i.e. if she does stop her college payments), I would strongly consider it. I have almost no friends, no life, and a small family where basically all except 3 people are distant. It honestly doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s anything that anyone can do to help me. Talk to a therapist? Been there, done that. I had a depressive episode a couple years ago and I went to a therapist and the only reason it stopped was because I naturally came out of that depression. I saw the therapy as a nuisance and waste of my time. Talking doesn\u2019t do shit, action does. And there\u2019s no actions anyone can take to help me.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on why I was born in the first place. My dad left when I was 2, and he knew before then that he probably wasn\u2019t going to stay in my life. He dumped me on my mom and she went bankrupt because she couldn\u2019t handle a child and house just working at Walmart. Of course now she runs her own business and makes six figures, so she\u2019s turned her life around. I doubt I could do the same, though.\n\nWhat the fuck am I supposed to do?",

I don\u2019t know why I did it... I really don\u2019t understand why I did this when I knew what would happen. I cheated on my girlfriend with one of my best friends boyfriend (I\u2019m a woman). I hurt so many people I love... I knew it would ruin everything good in my life.. I just want to figure out how and why I could do something so terrible. I never thought I was capable of this... I didn\u2019t plan it, I didn\u2019t want to... It was on New Year\u2019s Eve at my friends house... we were all drinking and did molly. I went to the bathroom and my friends boyfriend came in and started kissing me while I was peeing. I didn\u2019t get mad I just laughed him off... I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t get so fucking mad at him at that moment.  But then I got up and went to wash my hands and he pulled me over to him and started trying to take my clothes off. At first I kept saying no and trying to get away from him and yelled his girlfriends name over and over but then I gave up and just let him... and we fucked and it was so fucked up. I thought I could talk him out of it instead of pushing him off... I just went with it. I did nothing even though I knew his girlfriend would eventually come in and I knew I\u2019d lose her and my girlfriend and my other best friend who was there. I quit my job because I worked with her and she was my ride home. I haven\u2019t been able to get a new job yet. I\u2019m really struggling. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to pay rent. I don\u2019t know how I can survive being without my girlfriend... I love her so much. I love her more than anyone I\u2019ve ever been with. \n\n\nSome context though...  makes this worse is my parents kicked me out of my house for having a girlfriend like 6 years ago. They didn\u2019t talk to me for a year. It really fucked me up mentally. I lost all of my confidence. I stopped dating girls until I met my current gf... I love her so much. But I didn\u2019t want to be with her. I thought I didn\u2019t love her. I told my friends I wanted to fuck a man. I broke up with her. We were broken up for 2 weeks and I missed her so badly every single day. I went on a date with a dude... it was horrible he was so boring and I just hated every minute of it. I kept thinking about how sweet she is and perfect. And I never fucked anyone during our break. I got back with her and I told her I\u2019m in love with her and I meant it I meant it. I am in love with her. I told her I know that I will never break up with her again because now I know I\u2019m in love. But then this happened and my friends told her I broke up with her because I wanted to fuck a man... which is true I did say that. I said a lot of things besides just that though. I had a lot of reasons. I\u2019m so confused why I sabotaged everything good in my life. I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t know how to figure out why I did this. I\u2019m so sad.

        "original": "I stepped back off the bridge last night. I'd drove half way down the M1 (busy motorway) jumped out my car, for like a solid 30 minutes I stood just leaning on the edge running things over in my mind. I wasn't on the edge for long maybe a minute or two at most, to me it felt like 10 maybe longer. \n\nThe only reason I couldn't do it was because of the thought of my parents and girlfriend. I know all 3 would be massively heart broken. Yet I feel like I'm just a burden on everyone I know. I recently got a warning at work for a reason which I told them about 3 times on the last 5 months. So I'm worried I'm gonna loose my job. Which basically ruins my life. No job no cash meaning I won't be able to drive to see my girlfriend, who at the moment is one of the only times I'm happy. I know she knows I'm down as well, just being careful not to ask the wrong questions which I love her for yet I'm worried she'll leave me because of this. I just never feel good enough for her. She's amazing in every way and idk I just can't get it out of my mind that she deserves someone better.\n\nMy friends have all kinds split off and gone their own ways now they have been at uni for a while. So my social life kinda went into free fall in the last few months and that's is honestly killing me. The few friends I talk to often are online so I can't even do anything irl with them.\n\nWith my family I dont even know where to start. I'm barely getting by each month so I'm honestly just another mouth to feed. I know they both love me yet I'm not sure I even feel the same. Up until the last few years I barely considered them my parents. My mums always been busy with work. Normally working like 70 hours weeks with the paperwork she had and my dad worked nights so for most my life I considered my aunt and uncle more my parents than my actual parents. Yet after my aunt died of cancer I just didn't really know what to do. Which has honestly left me with a horrible relationship with them. I barely feel a connection to them yet have so much to thank them for, without them slaving away I would have had a much harder start to life which makes me feel even worse as now I feel like I have thrown that start away. They push me to do more and I want to yet I'm way too scared to take that step. \n\nWith work I mean everyone hates that or at least a good 90% of us do in my eyes. I work in retail and god knows it's a horrid industry constant cuts and more pressure to do more in the same time. A few weeks back I got a written warning about an issue that I had pointed out to my manager 3 times. He even acknowledged that when writing the warning up. Before I moved to where I was working now I was excited I thought I could go for management, noe I'm shit scared I'm gonna loose my job.\nGot absolute cunts telling me I look sad at work, unfortunately that's my face i have a bad case of resting bitch face even when I'm enjoying some show I'm watching. \nI struggle to fit in because honestly my social skills are lacking, probably my own fault but I just lack that skill to banter back and forth on instinct. I can do small talk but struggle most the times.\nThe sectors I want to work in are either about 1 in 3000 get in or you have to go to uni and then stand a 1 in 100 chance with the other. I never wanted to go to uni but it's all I can do. I hate the learning environment and learning doing something not writing it down. I absolutely detest how uni focused most jobs can be despite only small amounts of education for some of them being required. This isnt me spewing shit as well I've spoke to 3 people who have been on the course I would have go do all say that they learn very little besides a few case studies and the basics. With professors mainly focusing on how to write the information you do learn into essays .\n\nI never expected at the age of 20 life would be this shit. I had these thoughts but for the last few years I've been ok but this last few months have just killed me. On my way home I stopped in a country road lay by for 3 hours and just cried my eyes out screaming and everything else. Part of me wishes I had jumped or been hit on the way home. What's the point in just carrying on when it's this shit. Sure it might get better eventually but right now I don't even look forward to the future.",

All my happiness came from little islands of calmness that I created my self through writing and interacting with imaginary friends, because I had none in real life.\n\n\nEvery friendship I had ended after about six months, because no one wanted to stay with me and, when they got to know my reputation and had deal with my complete lack of social skills, they just left me.\n\n\nAlways.\n\n\nSo I could never believe that that friend I was with was going to stick with me. I was just expecting them to leave. It would still hurt, don't get me wrong, but it would be no surprise.\n\n\nI was raised an atheist, but in my despair I thought that my only friend would be homie Jesus. It's complicated. I made friends at church and I wanted to believe that now God would allow me not to feel alone anymore. But they started talking shit about the LGBT community ( I am bi) and I just couldn't take it. I came out on the day of my first Holly communion. The priest didn't allow me to receive the sacrament. He still told me that he loved me, but that I didn't deserve Jesus and I was a siner that was going to go to hell. I got it anyway, because I didn't believe him ( my mouth didn't bleed and my flesh didn't burn) and because my grandmother told him it was all a lie.\n\n\nDuring that time I knew I wouldn't make it without my antidepressants. It saddens me that I can't take reality as it is, but I just couldn't.\n\n\nI am now on holiday in France. It's beautiful here. The landscapes, the castels, the food. It all seems to come from a dream.\n\n\nSo I tried to stop taking my meds.\n\n\nI didn't have a headache as it's usual when I lower or block the dosage, so I though I was fine.\nI went to a girls only event at a bar and met wonderful people. We talked about all matters, played games, but then, out of the blue, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY YAY.\n\n\nI felt so bad for eating, because I thought about the children half way across the world that have nothing to eat. I threw up all I had eaten, but I still came back to the event.\n\n\nI said some wrong things to one of the girls ( I got the connotation of a word wrong, as you can see, English is not my first language ). She made nothing out of it, but I felt terrible. So much so I had to leave and come back to the hotel.\n\n\nI can't believe I am still sick. That I still need medication to survive normal situations, to be able to socialize normally and that I still haven't managed to get better from all this shit.\n\n\nI am tired of trying.\n\n\nI have been going to therapy for 6 months now and saw little progress.

After finally getting scitizenship and entering the country getting a house and being safe i had to deal with a alone standing abusive mother and school i was a very violent child i was kicked off of 7 schools in total eventually ending up with multiple diagnosises autism, adhd, ptsd and now depression and i self diagnose hppd. Now after being kicked off of multiple schools i had to be sent to a special school i there finally got some help finally was getting social finally was getting better i even made friends and i even stopped fighting eventually i had to enter highschool there it was different i felt so alone i was so different i went to a normal highschool not a special education one\n\nAfter being extremely bored and lonely my fantasies of suicide grew once again one day on a whim i decided to contact my old middle school friend me and him hung out understood each other became best friends along the way we got more social and we made more friends. One day we decided to partake in smoking cannabis at the time i was 14 i didnt think much of it and i did it every now and then but i then decided to experiment and explore different drugs i started off with opiates and i eventually got addicted ti them and then i decided to kick them and move on to the next drug. \n\ni then got addicted to amphetamine and i at the time was extremely suicidal and depressed i was having nightmares every day id stay up days to just avoid them one day i decided to stay up for 9 days straight on amphetamine which was horrible might i add but beter than the nightmares also might i add one time i snorted so much amphetamines i fell into a psychosis and that was also horrible.....\n\n At the time i also decided to talk with fellow druggos online and one day i met this girl she lives in the US and she is the love of my life she is the reason i decided to not end it all and get off amphetamines i then decided to move on to psychedelics but like every drug i touch i abused it to a point where it was extremely unhealthy i was doing lsd every 2 weeks in high doses before that i did shrooms every couple weeks but normal doses and just shrooms n weed not 8 different psychedelics in all high to moderate doses i also abused entactogens like mdma n mda which made my depression worse cuz the serotonin got fucked ahaha\n\n anyway one day i decided to do 6 tabs of lsd which turned out to not be lsd i got into a extremely horrible and magical psychosis and since then i feel like i have been beaten down more than ever the only thing holding me up is my sweet girlfriend and shes not even in the same country with me she will be soon tough im just saying this cuz i wanted to share also i might do a part 2 of this idk",

She makes me feel like I'm the problem. And she loves getting attention from people. To pity her. Because \"Bohoo my husband died and I have 2 problem children. One who's in a mental hospital and one who dropped out of college\". It's like that's my sister too. That was my dad too. I'm fucking tired of it. She's so controlling, when she found out I had an eating disorder she took sick PLEASURE of being skinnier than me. When I finally got healthy she acted like she didn't know where her weight went. She shamed me for not eating, when I recovered. When I did eat. She made this false narrative to people that I didn't eat. When I did. Just to make me feel bad. I wanted to go to college out of state and I went instate just because she guilted the hell out of me. She tells me we can't afford it because of my sister. But then goes out and blows thousands of dollars on stupid shit for us. Clothes, shoes. Completely fucking stupid. I have no choice in my life. I only dropped out of college because she knew I wouldn't of stayed on Earth if I stayed. My neighbor's death hit me  hard and I HAD TO LEAVE SCHOOL. She refuses to see our therapist because he knows how she treats me. He knows I feel chained, shackled. I'm a fucking puppet. Ever  since my dad died it became this huge pity party for her. She THRIVES off guilting people. She LOVES the attention. And she LOVES the attention her two \"failed\" children give her. I don't know what I am going to do with my life. I don't know what I want to do or if I'm going to school. Or if I'll study something else. She wants to wallow in her own pity. For attention. She tells fucking strangers off the street that her husbands dead as if they fucking asked. I am so trapped. I feel so stuck. I went to a school she wanted me to. I chose a major she approved of. Now that I am temporarily out of school, I chose a job that she wanted me to get. She puts me just close enough to where I know I need her. I crave her approval because I'll never be good enough for her. Everything I've done that she wanted me too makes me more unhappy. Aside from school too... \nShe controls my choices, my weight, my future. I am trapped.\n\nAnd she refuses to accept she does that. Confrontation doesn't work. \n\nAnd when I try to expose her to someone who would recognize her behavior as toxic, she acts like she only wants me to be happy.\nWhen I say \"I want to do this\" she says \"you can't do this\". \n\nBut when we are in public it's \"I want to do this.\" And her response is \"of course whatever makes you happiest\" \n\nI'll never be able to build a life for myself. \n\nShe refuses to believe she doesn't take care of herself for attention.

I have a few friends but spending time with them seems like a chore. Wherever I go, I find it very difficult to fit in. I feel like I'm not 'entertaining' enough for other people to take any interest in me. I'm not cool, I'm not successful in my studies, I've not achieved anything in my life. I want so hard for people to like me but I just don't have what it takes. I'm not confident or smart or funny. Most of the time I use sarcasm to cover my anxiety because I just can't handle social situations. People tell me that I'm pretty but that's all I am to them. Just a pretty girl. Guys don't like me for who I am, they just like me for what I look like and I feel like I will never be able to open up to anybody because they don't see me as worthy of more. \n\n I study architecture and I like my course but I no longer have passion for it. I don't have the energy or motivation to create anything. Every day I wake up and I'm more and more behind with my coursework. I don't even try to catch up  because I don't see myself succeeding or doing well enough. I can't handle getting an average or low grade in the end because this is the one thing I chose to do based on the things I used to love and I'm not even good at it. \n\nIt's breaking my heart to think that I will never be good enough. Not for anyone or anything. I attempted suicide at 18 because the guy I used to like in school bullied me physically and verbally ever day for a year and I was powerless. I couldn't make him stop and even his friends who watched it all happen didn't bother doing anything because they didn't want to get on his bad side. I've never been able to stand up for myself. I feel ashamed for being so weak, unable to do anything. I let people walk over because I rather compromise on how I feel than upset someone else. \n\nRecently, I've been feeling like I simply don't fit. Part of me doesn't want to die because I'll never get a second life. I don't believe in God. I believe that us humans, simply made it up as a backbone to our lives. We need some kind of security, we need to feel like no matter what happens there will be someone to help us out through it all and no matter how bad things get there's purpose in it all and that purpose is given by God. But I don't have that kind of security. I believe that once we die, there's no place for our soul to go. We simply stop existing and we're just part of natural selection. The world doesn't stop when we die, it simply sifts out the better from the worse. And I just want to get myself out of all this. I don't want to be a part of anything I just want to stop existing without any consequences. Fall asleep and never have to worry about anything ever again...",

        "original": "**The Long Story:**\n\nI attempted suicide several times last month, only one of them requiring hospitalization, but only because the method I used damaged my liver. (#FuckTylenolForever)\n\nSee, I had lost someone I thought I could at least call a friend. We had hooked up once. After that, he stopped talking to me. I wear waist beads as a part of my culture. (When I was admitted and the nurses were doing a physical examination, they saw my waist beads and they called me old-fashioned in a joking/doting way. Like \"ah, the baby has waist beads!!\") I had been wearing waist beads when we hooked up and I taught him how to say it in Yoruba. They fell off after a while (a normal thing that happens) and I didn't get a new pair since I had started T and I had thought long and hard about wearing them again since I'm not female. (I mean, I wasn't female when I started wearing them, but I wasn't on T then.) But I missed wearing beads and just playing with them under my shirt and how useful they are when I'm drying off.\n\nSo I took a picture of my new set of yomba and showed it to him. He said he had a girlfriend and that he has to block me. So I blocked him first. It wasn\u2019t even sexual. I just wanted to show someone my beads.\n\nSo I started thinking about how he started acting Hollywood after we hooked up. How everyone I\u2019ve ever had a thing with \u2013 sexual or romantic \u2013 have just started acting Hollywood with me and disposed of me like I\u2019m the garbage piled up in their room. My past two ex-girlfriends were the worst, perhaps. One broke up with me as soon as she went home (she didn\u2019t live in my stomping ground and we met at Pride and immediately hit it off). The other actually hurt me. She lied to me several times throughout our relationship, broke up with me just to get with the person \u201cI didn\u2019t have to worry about because I\u2019m all yours\u201d (what a crock of shit), and only asked me to marry her because she didn\u2019t want to be alone. Not because she genuinely loved me. Just so *she* wasn\u2019t 30 and alone. I agreed because I\u2019m still in love with her. She haunts my dreams at night like my first real love does. I hate her, but I wish she was mine.\n\nI've been trying to find a glucose guardian to bring in some extra money \u2013 for myself and for my mom. We're pretty poor and we can use all the money we can get. I'm Afro-Latinx. The men I've sought out/who sought me out immediately decided that they weren't interested because I was a Lupita Nyong'o as opposed to a Sophia Vegara. So I decided to try women. There aren't many sugar mamas, but I found one that I was interested in. The moment she saw my grotesque face, she blocked me. Her blocking me sent me into a spiral that just reminded me that I'm disposable to everyone and that no one would ever want someone as ugly and dark as me.\n\nAnother thing that spurred these feelings was that I have a \"friend\" that I had a crush on. She only talks to me when she wants papers done. She does no prior work on them, leaving me to do them from scratch and conduct the research myself. I've asked for financial compensation several times and even tried to help her get a new job so she can afford to compensate me. She has neither got a new job nor has she compensated me for the many papers I've written for her. She *literally. actually.* only talks to me when she needs a paper done or she wants to talk about her mental state. And I feel like shit every time because she never responds when I try to tell her how I'm doing mentally.\n\nAll I'm good for is being used and abused. And I'm sick of it. If my life is just going to be filled with people who do nothing but use and abuse me (my own family included because all of them have abused me in some fashion, too), I don't want to live.\n\nSo that's why I'm calling this 45. I just need $45 so I can get what I need and end this miserable existence. I might be able to do it at the end of the month, *inshallah*. But first, I have to figure out how I'm going to make sure the lights don't go off because we couldn't pay the electric bill.\n\n= = = = = = = = = =\n\n**The Short Story:**\n\nI tried to kill myself last month and we're back at the beginning, sinking, spinning. The attempts I've made to bring extra money into the house to keep us above water have failed time and time again. Men and women think I'm hideous and being dark-skinned doesn't help. All I'm good for is being used and abused. It's like being drained by several vampires at once. So I'm going to kill myself as soon as I pay the electric bill for the month and get $45.",

But my depression is at the worst it's ever been. I've stopped taking care of myself, I'm withdrawing, constantly praying for death, and the worst part is I'm a burden on everyone. I know everyone says that when they're having moments of suicide ideation but this time it's true--my boyfriend broke up with me last night because he felt constantly worrying about me was hindering his personal growth, and there has been a rift between my dad and I for the last few months because I can't talk about anything but how distressed I am. \n\nI've inherited my dad's depression, and he is also suicidal. I know talking about these things will upset him, but I am in pain all the time and I don't know who to talk to anymore because him and my boyfriend were the last two people I felt like I had in my support system. I had a tumultuous experience with the suicide hotline last night where I was volleyed around and basically all 3 people I spoke to begged me to go to a mental health screener to receive counseling. I wasn't sure what to do; I want to get better and I know I need professional help but I didn't want to potentially be held against my will and miss work/lose my job, or be slapped with a medical bill I couldn't pay.\n\nI talked to my dad for advice and he was just fed up. He confirmed I would lose my job and wouldn't be able to afford the apartment I'm moving into this week. He told me if I wanted to do something like this I should've done it earlier. He told me moving is a mistake and that I'm going to end up isolating myself in a new city. He told me I emotionally beat him up and have no regard for what he's going through, and then he told me he can't help me. \n\nHe's right. He's going through so much. I shouldn't put him through all of this, but it just sits in my chest and I have no one to talk to. I'm trying to book a therapist and the suicide hotline keeps calling me to follow up, but I just want someone I love to talk to. I feel like a failure, like it's too late for me to fix anything because I have irreparably damaged every relationship I value. \n\nMy dad told me he was a failure, and that he just wants to blow his brains out. He told me all night, \"It doesn't matter anymore.\" I'm not stupid, I know what he means when he says that, because any of us here knows the context behind a sentence like that.

When I was merely a toddler my dad would beat me for several reasons; such as not reading early enough, not talking early enough, out of rage,because he was drunk, because I was crying, because my mom fell out of love with him and more. Funny enough just recently i figured out that this was even abuse. I guess I've always had a gloomy aura around me because I never really had friends. I actually have a very vivid memory of complaining to the teacher that nobody wanted to play with me in prekindergarten. She told some kids to let me play house with them. They forced me to be the dog and I wasn't allowed to talk to them. My last happy memory was in 3rd grade when my dad managed to get the scooter that I wanted for so long for very cheaply and i found it somewhere in the garage. Since then it almost seems that the harder I try the more I get punished for my effort. It's like god doesn't want me to be happy. I wake up so tired everyday. I have a few friends now who care about me but they would be so stressed and scared if I was honest about how I feel. I riddle our conversations with \"(:\" but I manage to be socially inept online aswell. In 5th grade I took the advice \"fake it till you make it\" very literally and I forced a smile on my face every morning and tryed my hardest to be as obnoxiously happy as possible. My dad tried to leave me but funny enough my own failure brought him back. I accidentally spent some money with his card info and he drove hours upon hours to beat me as hard as he could. I spent the rest of my day under the bed begging god for death. I can't even remember events after this. Recently my dad got drunk and started attacking me and my mom. Screaming things like \"I'm gonna snap your neck bitch\" and \"I'm gonna fucking kill you\". My mom called the police and my dad got arrested under \"terroristic threat\" and I don't want to go to school anymore. Life just seems to never want to give me a break. For the past 10 months I've had a girlfriend who is the only person I felt actually cared about me and her mother found out about us and instantly destroyed all her electronics,moved away and said our relationship was \"inappropriate\" because we aren't the same race. I don't know what to do any more and I've hit a dead end. So maybe in the ocean of other equally depressing stories maybe mine helps someone somehow. Maybe that's the only reason that I'm here.",

I seem to have everything figured out. \n\nI think the main cause of my problems is my family. My parents provide for me physically, but have destroyed me emotionally. I used to be really good at something (won\u2019t specify) to the point of doing it at international levels by the age of 10, but my mom would push me so hard that I began to detest it. I would be forced to train for many hours every day, with her breathing down my neck and screaming at me for making a mistake. If I lost a competition, she would be mad for a week. She threatened to disown me when I asked her if I could stop doing it.\n\nMy dad fights with my mom a lot, but they are always united when against me. I find myself crying in my bed almost daily now, and they will take turns dramatically entering my room to tell me how weak I am for crying, how lazy I am for not getting any work done, and how unworthy I am of any money they spend on me. I am always met with gruff tones and frowns when I talk to them for no explicable reason.\n\nI don\u2019t know. This might not seem like much to those of you with more traumatic incidents, but this slow burn with no access to emotional support has left me without any more will to live. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to die yet.

I don\u2019t get any enjoyment out of life anymore. \n\nI plan on injuring myself this week, not necessarily to kill myself, but as one final cry for help. Hopefully I can get admitted into a hospital. If nothing happens, which it probably won\u2019t, I have a second method planned with a much higher success chance. \n\nHonestly, it would only take one person to convince me otherwise. One fucking person. One friend who cares enough to check on me. One family member who doesn\u2019t shame me for asking for help. But I have no one. I am completely, utterly, alone. \n\nTo anyone reading this, please check on your friends.

        "original": "There's going to be a whole lot of venting here, just to warn you. What you're going to read is stuff that's been building up for years, and I'm getting to the point where I just want to give up. Sorry in advance. I'm going to start from the beginning.\n\nMy problems only really started to begin when I was 14, which was around the time I left school, but there are other things that happened before this point that made life even more difficult. Btw, I'm 19.  \n\nMy real father was a piece of sh\\*t. He was never there for me and did so many horrible things to my mum that I didn't even know about at the time. Put drugs in her food, snorted cocaine off my Nintendo Wii, physically hurt her and more. She stayed with him for me, because she wanted me to have a dad. When I was 6 she fell pregnant with my sister.\n\nAt 11 she finally left him after he'd cheated for the 3rd or 4th time. She met someone new online and he seemed alright. He's parents were moving to another country and so we decided to go as well - and by the way, this was after about 2 or 3 months of knowing him.\n\nI'm going well off point by now but whatever. About 2 months after the move, my mum was pregnant again (and I only recently found out that it wasn't planned).\n\nNot too much important I guess until I left school. I did a few stupid things while I was in school, but in my opinion, nothing major. I tried vaping once and didn't like it, skipped a few lessons.\n\nWhere we are now, English isn't the native language, so school was kinda difficult. I'd made a few friends who knew English and I didn't actually learn much of the language spoken here. This is because I'm actually a really stupid person, alongside the fact that my friends would make fun of me when I did say anything (because I sounded stupid) and that they said I wouldn't need it anyway. I barely speak to any of them now.\n\nThe reason why I left school is because there's aren't many good public ones here and my step-dad suggested that there's no point in wasting my time. So, when I finished middle school or whatever it's called, I left. I think I was 14, maybe 15 actually.\n\nMy step-dad (just going to call him dad) used to be a graphic designer, and I'd wanted t follow in his footsteps. At this point they were starting their own writing business and I was left learning from tutorials online.\n\nI'd say I'm okay at Photoshop, but I only had about 2 months of learning before my dad got annoyed that I wasn't progressing enough. This may have been one of the hardest times for me now that I think about it. I tried to learn coding for a month before my dad got annoyed that I wasn't making much progress.\n\nLooking back this annoys me, because I don't really think I was given a lot of time to learn anything. Idk, let me know if I'm just stupid.\n\nI love trading card games (mainly Yugioh), and I'd been making my own one on paper for years. My dad decided that I should make it for real, using my designer skills. Now, I had to draw characters for the cards basically, which wasn't easy for someone who'd never actually tried illustrating before.\n\nI had an hour to make each design, and I think two months or so before my dad wanted everything finished. We put them on Game Crafter, who basically print them out and sell them. I actually really don't like Game Crafter, just saying. Believe it or not, my game didn't go far, although I did get, like, 3 sales. \n\nMy dad put me down a lot about this, saying how I'm stupid and blah blah blah. How I had ages to learn graphic design and yet all my designs are still bad (although I like to think that graphic design and illustration are two different things).\n\nNot long after I started writing for my dad's business. Just spare cheap articles at first, now I'm writing things for a few clients. I'd say I do about half his work for him. I remember that in 2018, during the summer, I was earning over 400 Euros a month.\n\nMy dad hadn't actually done any work in this time, so I was the only one bringing in any money - and I didn't actually get any of it. I'm only really annoyed because he constantly tells me that I'm useless, a waste of space and generally puts me down. My work also covered Christmas that year, too.\n\nThis year my dad started paying me - 20 Euros a week. This lasted a month before it become 10 and now nothing again.\n\nThis makes my life more difficult in a way, because I want to be able to move out some day, and I really just can't see that happening. I can't get a job because I don't know the language and I don't have any money whatsoever. The money I did earn I spent on Warhammer and buying things like toilet roll for the house, because of course I don't do anything.\n\nUh Warhammer. I don't like it much, but my dad loves it. Basically, you paint these little models. I'm bad at it, he's like professional level. I didn't really have much choice but to buy models tbh.\n\nI would have preferred to have perhaps bought Yugioh cards (something I do enjoy), but I'm not allowed to. This is because everything I like is for babies, or stupid or something along those lines.\n\nMy dad likes to put me down in anyway he can, basically. There are so many different things he's said to me over the years that have really hurt. I could go on and on and on, but I'll leave it here I guess.\n\nThese days I just can't be bothered anymore. The idea of actually doing something in my life sounds so impossible and honestly, I don't even see the point of living. Even if I had everything I could ever want, I'll still die one day and it will all be over. I believe that there's nothing after death, and this isn't really helping me to keep going lol.\n\nSorry to anyone who reads this, I just wanted to get some stuff out. There's so much more that I didn't mention, and this is some of the lesser things. I'm curious though, to anyone who's read this, am I in the wrong? Or do you have any suggestions on what I could do to perhaps feel better or change things? Again, sorry and thanks for reading.",

I couldn't even tell you how much exactly TBH.\n\nIt sounds cliche and trivial to say it, but I grew up in an abusive home, endured an abundance of bullying at school, had few friends and no social skills growing up, was taught no real survival or adulting skills by my abusive mother. I was finally kicked out of school my junior year, with the credits of a freshman, because of terrible performance. Of course, it's been almost two decades since all that happened, and it feels like a cop-out to bring it up \u2014 but I know that it still affects me, and I hate that. I moved away from my mother's house and in with my grandparents just before I turned 18. I was nothing remotely resembling a functional adult in any capacity \u2014 mentally, emotionally, or in the department of life skills. I was volatile, and I had the emotional maturity of an elementary-age child. I was really a piece of crap. My grandparents gave me food and a roof over my head, they put up with my juvenile behavior, and they bailed me out financially a lot, but they couldn't help me deal with my issues.\n\nDespite that, I was at least aware of my own deficiencies to some degree, and I pressed myself for self-improvement. I didn't really have much in the way of actual resources, but I did have people around me pushing me to do better, to do things \"right\". I was 24 before I got my driver's license and a job, albeit a low end retail job. Met someone, had a real relationship, and got married too. We bought a car, rented a house, then a bigger better house, and then we had a baby \u2014 the first of two. There weren't a lot of opportunities where I lived, and I was a bit limited in what I could actually do \u2014 but I didn't afford myself any excuses. I stuck with my retail job even though I was struggling, because that's what I was taught \u2014 you stick to it and keep pushing and work hard.\n\nThe first of a series of unfortunate events happened when our landlord sold our house out from under us. We were given the opportunity to buy it, but we were not in the position to do so. Money was tight at the time, and almost any other rental option within our budget was going to be a major downsize. We ended up moving back in with my grandparents for a year, taking over their basement so that we could save up and get something better.\n\nThings had also been growing cold between me and my wife. We sought counseling at one point, but that didn't end well. We were both very religious at the time, and I decided to come clean with her that I occasionally looked at pornography and wanted to stop. That went poorly \u2014 it was a huge blow up, both between me and her and me and the church. We stayed together, but she would hold it against me forever after \u2014 and I suppose she wasn't entirely wrong to, since I eventually ended up falling back into it.\n\nWe tried finding more help. Things eventually started to get better. We were finally able to buy a house and we had another kid. I was miserable at my job, it left me exhausted and non-functional after work, and it was starting to become clear that it was a dead end \u2014 but I kept pushing at it because I didn't have any better options and I was the sole income of the household. The house we bought ended up having a lot of problems that the inspector missed \u2014 the floors and the plumbing begin falling apart, and we didn't have the resources to do anything about it. I have zero skills when it comes to tools, and I couldn't repair anything myself. Our first year or so in this house was miserable, and my wife ended up leaving me just after our second kid's first birthday. She took the kids and went several states away to live with her family. She's been good about co-parenting and letting me talk to them almost whenever I want \u2014 but between work, money, and other complications, I simply haven't been able to go see them hardly ever. It has now been over two years since I have seen them in person. I'm nothing but a face on a screen to them.\n\nAfter my wife left, the counselor and pastor at the church she was involved with met with me. It was the most degrading experience of my entire life, and that's a high bar to clear. I almost ended my life after that. Parts of it replay in my head frequently to this day. I was blamed, debased, and deconstructed. They told me things were going to get much more difficult for me before they got better, and they have been completely correct. Everytime I think of that, it's like being stabbed in the chest. It was about that time that I gave up on religion completely.\n\nThe next year-and-a-half were difficult, and I mostly just went through the motions. I did meet someone almost two years later \u2014 it was the first and only real healthy relationship I've had in my life. She was also the first person I came out to as trans, and it couldn't have gone better. That whole relationship was an incredibly healing experience at the time, and I let myself get hopeful. We broke up over a political disagreement of all the stupid things. That was about the time that I last saw my kids too.\n\nI was apparently too weak to deal with that, because that's when I started getting drunk. I didn't go overboard \u2014 I deliberately limited how much I would consume and how often. It had no real effect on my functionality at the time. On the contrary, I discovered that my drunk self was more functional and a downright better person, which is certainly not how it usually works. When I drank, I could focus, I could think clearly without all of the mental clutter and worry. I was even more aware of my surroundings, and it was easier to get myself to do what I needed to do.\n\nIt was a few months later after a winter storm that I crashed my vehicle. Completely totaled it on the ice. Before anyone brings it up \u2014 I was completely sober when it happened and I hadn't been drinking anytime recently. It was pure misjudgement and bad luck. I was without a vehicle for most of the next year because of a serious glitch with the insurance which required me to jump through a lot of hoops. That was the winter that my plumbing had a had its worst rupture \u2014 the pipe underground leading to my house from the community well broke during a deep freeze, and there were several more breaks in the internal plumbing under my house. I could not afford to repair it. It was also about that time that the vision in my right eye started to really go downhill, likely from glaucoma. My grandparents died that year, within about a month of each other. I had to get help going up to the funeral as it was in another state \u2014 then almost got stranded there at the mercy of the same mother who abused me growing up. I had to bring my dog and some belongings with me because I had no safe place to go with them \u2014 she tried to keep them and send me home without them. I did finally get the insurance squared away and got a vehicle before the end of the year. I realized how unsustainable my situation was, and I began to think long-term as to how I would break out of it. I planned and began working towards it.\n\nBut this last year got even worse. I had a cancer scare early in the year \u2014 fortunately, the biopsy came back clean. I also had the beginning of the chest pains \u2014 what I thought was a bad hangover at first, which was odd since I never really get hangovers, except the symptoms didn't go away for a month. I got better for a while \u2014 I cut my drinking down to almost nothing and made a point of eating better and exercising more. But a few months later then things came back with a vengeance. It left me barely able to work or function. Near the end of this last year, my employer, who I had been with for over a decade, eliminated my position. I could either take a pay cut and go to another position, or take a sizable severance package. I took the package, reasoning that it was probably my only chance at this point to get out of that situation and maybe use the money to have a new start. I felt like I was dying through most work days and I couldn't stay there. But of course, as I said earlier, that has completely not gone as planned.\n\nI have no social life outside of the internet. When I got married, that social life started to wane. When my wife and I moved to where we are now, that social life died. When we divorced and I dropped religion, pretty much all of my family and friends vanished. Except my abusive mother, who calls me frequently to this day. And I have absolutely nothing in common with most of the locals. I have since made a lot of good online friends, but I have only met one in person. They came out and helped me financially when I was going under late last year year \u2014 they just threw money at me, about $1000, more than I expected. But it hasn't stopped me from getting where I'm at, and I feel like I have completely squandered their generosity. Another one helped me pay my phone bill this month, and I feel like I want to crawl in a hole and die. I feel like a manipulative leech, a never-ending black hole of need. I cannot ask for or even accept the amount of money I would need to get out of this situation \u2014 and it won't change the fundamentally damaged and broken parts of me which would simply throw me right back where I'm at now.\n\nIt's very hard to talk to my friends about the issues I'm facing in any depth. I haven't hidden them exactly, except for the atrocious state of my house, but there's no real conversation to be had. They either offer me money or advice. I hate taking the money, and the advice is useless. Meditation doesn't work. I have self-helped ad nauseum, and it's only led me to where I'm at. Most of them are the \"pull yourself up by your own bootstraps\" types, and I'm out of boot straps. And pretty much anything beyond that is well wishes \u2014 they care, they love me, they value me, but I'm still where I'm at. Nothing changes. I'm completely alone here. That's not their fault, and I'm not meaning this to blame them at all. They are very good people, I know that they are genuine, and it wouldn't be reasonable for me to ask for more, nor could they reasonably give it. But it is what it is.\n\nI'm tired. I'm tired of endlessly trying and just getting sucked down deeper. I'm tired of pointless difficulty. I'm tired of things looking up, getting a ray of hope and a light at the end of the tunnel, just to have this sick gaslighting universe snuff it out before I can get to it. What even is the point of it?\n\nMaybe this is my fault \u2014 maybe the bootstrappers are right and I've chosen this. Or maybe the essentialists are right, and I'm just inherently defective. Or maybe the constructionists are right, none of this is my fault, and it's all a matter of circumstance and bad luck. Or maybe it's simply beyond understanding and analysis. Truthfully, it doesn't matter at this point. The answers to those questions don't change where I'm at. I can see the writing on the wall, and I can see that this is the end. Not that it's completely impossible to get out of this \u2014 but it would be absurdly improbable to the point of being miraculous. I don't have any significant resources I can call upon, I can't afford help, and the only help that might be available will cost me even more personal autonomy and suffering. Frankly, I consider that worse than death.\n\nI've just been buying time at this point, trying to stretch it out to do a few things I sort of enjoy and maybe write at least one of the books that I wanted to write. But I can't even make any progress on that because of how non-functional I am. I'm going to die \u2014 or worse \u2014 and I'm going to leave nothing behind of value to anyone. Just yesterday morning I got texts from my ex about how critical her own financial situation is because I haven't been paying child support since my money ran out. She's having trouble feeding the kids. I feel like a trash heap. I've given them nothing. I haven't been there for them. All I've been is a meager income, and now that's gone. Between the depression and how much my ex sets off my anxiety, I've been calling them less and less, and I absolutely hate it. I'm an absentee deadbeat parent, and my kids are suffering for it.\n\nI'm tired. I want this life to end. I don't want to die, but I don't see any way around it. I'm dead weight. The only thing I contribute are some inspiring social media posts that maybe 20 people read, which then get buried in the aether of the interwebz. The only reason I'm still here is because I have a mental block against self-harm and I'm afraid to do it. But I feel that starting to finally slip away. I don't know what else to do. I can't live this life anymore. I don't want to live it. I'm not really benefiting anyone by living it. Things do not get better, except as a prelude to them getting much worse. There's no point to this.\n\nIf you read all this, thank you. I'm sorry for the gargantuan post. I just wanted to get this out there. I've never really told anyone all of this in this much detail, and I wanted to get it out there somewhere and for someone to read it. Thank you.\n\n*Edit*: I just woke up and my electricity has been shut off. I can't say I didn't see this coming, but I expected a shut off notice letter or something. Maybe I didn't see it. Oh well.\n\n*Edit 2, Update*: I have been doing considerably better the past 24 hours. I've had a few significant strokes of luck \u2014 like $125 I didn't know I had popping up. I got the taxes paid on my vehicle, so at least I will likely have some rudimentary shelter if things get worse and I lose the house. Also filled up my gas tank, so I should be able to keep my phone charged without too much worry. I cooked a meal outdoors on my camp stove, since my electricity is off. And I used the same camp stove to heat up some water for a shower. And somehow, I managed to summon up the energy to go do laundry today \u2014 I left the clothes in my vehicle so they wouldn't end up smelling like my house. I feel exhausted, and I've set the tightness in my chest off a little bit, but I otherwise feel better than I did 24 hours ago. I want this life to end, but I don't want to die, and it has always made it hard for me to bring myself to do it no matter how many times I want to. I don't know whether the progress I made today will matter in the long run or not, but it was at least nice to take some ground after everything going to crap at once. It could all completely go down the toilet before the sun rises again, but today went way better than I would have dared hope.",

        "original": "When I was in high school I loved basketball and was pretty good at it. Enough to make varsity as a freshman and to go on to play college basketball. I loved basketball and wanted to be a coach and a teacher. Well I moved 10 hours away from my hometown to the college and this was probably a bad choice. My freshman year in college I fall in love with Jamal and everything\u2019s perfect. Fast forward to the summer and he\u2019s secretly living in my apartment with me. This is when he starts abusing me, mostly mentally at this point but he is manipulative and would steal my car and go hangout with other girls. School starts again and I move into my first house with my two best friends and of course Jamal... we start fighting and my roommates hear it. He actually gets physical with me and chokes me out while holding me up against a wall. My roommate sees the marks on my neck and locks me in her room with me and begs me to call the cops but I refuse because at this point I\u2019m pregnant but I don\u2019t tell anyone except Jamal. Jamal and I eventually have to move out and get an apartment that I pay for because I forgot to tell you he dropped out our freshman year and never got a job. I\u2019m pregnant so I decide I have to quit the basketball team the only thing keeping me from Jamal 24/7... so I quit and I lost my two best friends. A month after I quit basketball I miscarry and it just kills me at this point. So I stay with Jamal another two years until the end of my junior year and finally move back home away from him. I spent three years being manipulated, abused and lied too. I felt so beaten down I took a year off college to just get back to myself. Well I haven\u2019t been able to and I have just been a shell of my former self. Basketball was my favorite thing in the world and he managed to take that and my friends didn\u2019t want to be around me with him around. I just lost everything for a boy I was totally in love with.\n\nMy mom also had a similar situation in which she got pregnant and married the guy but he turned out to be a POS and cheated and lied and all of this stuff. Well my brother is 3 when she finally gets him completely out of the picture and meets my dad who later adopts my brother.\n\nSo fast forward to last night and someone lost the remote to my fire stick my parents are trying to watch. I tell my mom there\u2019s an app on her phone she can get that will work it. She gets upset because she downloaded a knockoff and not the real app and it won\u2019t work. She starts screaming about how if I didn\u2019t sit at home all day watching TV the remote wouldn\u2019t be missing. We are a cut deep with our words kind of family (which is why I probably didn\u2019t think anything was wrong with Jamal). My mom and I start arguing more intently. I call her a bitch. She tell me she wants me to move out and stay away from her because Jamal ruined me and I can\u2019t be fixed and that why nobody likes you and always leaves. Now mind you I have no friends only family who invites me places as a second thought most of the time so what my mom said was probably true. They don\u2019t like me around anymore. So I\u2019ve made the decision to keep to myself and save money I\u2019ve made from my contractual job. I just want to be happy again like I was in high school but I think I need therapy but my parents won\u2019t pay for it and don\u2019t want me fixed they just want me gone. So I can\u2019t wait until I save up enough to move out and actually find someone to help me put my pieces back together. I figured of all people my mom would understand falling for the wrong guy but all it did was ruin me and my life and so that\u2019s my fault and I don\u2019t get any help. \n\nThis was more of just a rant than anything. I did sit in my parents bedroom holding a gun wondering if this is the kind of gone I should be but I decided that no it\u2019s not. I\u2019m going to start my own life without my parents and when I fix myself by myself and have grandkids they are never going to meet them. Why would I want my kids around someone who would just let their kids suffer in pain and depression? And then hate on them more because they have depression?",

(and much much more) and i realized she wasn't joking neither was she lieing..... and it all kinda made sense shy she often acted like she did and why she was so in need on acceptance from me/other people.. however since this world is FUCKED UP!!!! in the past every time she though she was making friends they ended up always abusing her either mentally or physically.. its hard to explain but the things she have lived through ruins a person in an unimaginably way. she thinks its all her fault and therefore blames herself for all the things that happened to her... so to begin with it was impossible to make her realize she had a genuine friend in me. that wanted nothing but to have her realize she isn't as bad as she thinks.. but every time i finally feel like i have made some progress in some shape or form. something bad happens..

        "original": " \n\nThis is possibly the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever written. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m going to do. Hell, I don\u2019t really know what my options are at this point. Shit just looks so hopeless to me right now\u2026 I\u2019m sorry if this is long and if I\u2019m rambling. I\u2019m having trouble getting my thoughts right. And I can\u2019t stop shaking. I don\u2019t think I know what I\u2019m gonna do anymore. \n\nLet me start by saying that I\u2019m not accustomed to asking for help. Part of the reason I may be in this situation to begin with, I guess. In my defense, I just don\u2019t want to burden folks if I can figure it out. Everyone is struggling in this day and age. I try to avoid adding to it for the most part. I also suffer from depression and anxiety. I don\u2019t even think I know how to start this. I\u2019m just going to let it out and comes what may\u2026 so be it.\n\nI\u2019m in a horrible situation right now. In three months, my partner and I are going to be homeless unless we can figure out a lot of things. I currently work tutoring math to high school students. That\u2019s a very simplistic description of what I do, but for the purposes of remaining anonymous, I guess that works. She just made tenure at the school she works at. A bit more than a year ago, we moved into a new home that her mother purchased. I don\u2019t know how much pressure her mother put on her to move in, but against my better judgement, we moved into the home. Don\u2019t get me wrong, our situation wasn\u2019t the greatest at that time. We were scrunched into a one bedroom apartment that was falling apart due to the landlord wanting to get rid of us. I was effectively squatting there since I wasn\u2019t technically on the lease and kept a very low profile for the most part. We didn\u2019t want to change the lease because she was grandfathered into a price that we were already struggling to meet but was very low for the city we live in. Things had just begun to stabilize for us financially when we made this move.\n\nOver the course of the last few years, I\u2019d tried to get back into the field of IT after a few years of being out of it. I\u2019d been homeless and suffering from some pretty bad diagnosed-but-untreated depression for a bit. I was getting my life in order when I met my partner and fell in love with her. Hard. I ended up leaving the state I was rebuilding in to be with her. Things were rough at first. Part of that was my demeanor. I have an abrasive personality. I came from a hard life and my mentality reflected that. I\u2019ve worked hard to become a better person, and while I am not there yet I am also nowhere near the person I used to be. I\u2019m a lot less prickly nowadays. My employment history was spotty also. Nothing really constant after I left the military (which I left early due to the manifestation of said depression) for a long time. I bounced around for about a decade after the military. I went to school a lot, worked a bit, and tried to find myself some. I ended up going to a for profit school in California for a few years. While I\u2019m glad for the people I met at that school who bring joy to my life all these years later, the financial aspect of going to that school has made everything that has happened since a lot more difficult. I left before finishing a degree. I had gotten an offer on a job that I thought I could grow with. So, I pulled out of school to go to a different state to do this job. Over the course of the next two months, we ended up in the Great Recession. And that job I was traveling across the country to do disappeared. So, after 6 months, I was back in California. A year after that, I had a child. Not much to get into about that relationship. I probably wasn\u2019t ready for one and neither was she. Trouble finding a job didn\u2019t help matters, since we both were frustrated by that. I was either overqualified or lacked experience. Anyway, we didn\u2019t stay together. On the day my child was born, I was homeless. I remained that way for about 2 years between California and Illinois.. I did odd jobs and squatted places. I donated plasma and such to get some money on top of any jobs I can get. I didn\u2019t enjoy it. I was pulling myself out of the gutter slowly. I didn\u2019t have much help. My mom was the only one I was able to get any help from. When I turned to her, she gave me a place to stay and some stability. I started trying to go back to school to finish a math degree. Ran into roadblocks there due to being in default (which I still am). \n\nThen I met my partner. Over the course of time since I moved to California six years ago, I\u2019ve worked most of that time. Initially, I had a rough go due to physical and mental issues that made it harder to get some of the jobs that are quick and easy to get normally. I was around 320 pounds (240 now), couldn\u2019t stand for long periods of time, had bad knees, sleep problems\u2026 I can go on. I couldn\u2019t get jobs in IT for the most part either. I took a year to get a CCNA (studying at night) to try to see if certs would help improve my lot. No dice. I\u2019ve had a tough time finding jobs in general and I haven\u2019t been able to figure out why it\u2019s so hard for anyone to give me a shot. I got a chance to work as a tutor a few years ago. I took that job that was a part time, 15 hours a week, minimum wage job and turned it into something that allows me to be financially solid anywhere that\u2019s not the Bay Area. For 8 months of the year anyway. The other 4, we struggle a bit. Point is, I work hard and I work well when someone gives me a freaking chance! \n\nSo... I\u2019ve been trying to find something to help supplement that income until I can get something more stable while also trying to find other jobs that may help improve our situation.That\u2019s where we were when this option to move came up. I was against it for the most part. From the first day I met her, my partner\u2019s mother (PM from now on) has not liked me. I told my partner the moment we got home after the first time I met her that PM had an issue with me. She scoffed, but over time, I became more certain of her dislike of me. With that in mind, I didn't want to have much to do with her. I  understood that considering how close my partner was to her mother that there was a limit to how far as I could distance myself from her but I did want limitations due to her dislike of me. Needless to say we ended up moving into this house that her mom bought. \n\n2 months after moving in, she confirmed that she did not like me. She also said at that time that she would kick her daughter out to get rid of me and that she thinks that I am harming her daughter by being with her. She thinks I'm holding her daughter back. Trying to be at least somewhat optimistic, I thought that maybe it\u2019s just a matter of her not seeing anything regarding me in a positive light. Time could possibly change her mind. So over the past year we have been working extremely hard getting our financial situation in order. Looking for second jobs and/or better jobs. In the spring of last year, her mom moved the family of my SO\u2019s cousin (PC) in with us in that house. Her husband (CH) was one of my close friends. Along with them came enough people that we went from two to ten people in the house. This place became a home. Or so I thought. I\u2019d even figured that maybe PM would eventually see that I wasn\u2019t some ogre or some bad guy\u2026\n\nThis past weekend, CH had a confrontation with the guys she hired to tidy up the yard. This leads to PM blowing up at my partner and mentioning all of these things that she had an issue with over the course of the last few months. I hear about this and I\u2019m initially relieved to be honest, because nothing about her issues were things that can be laid at my feet. Since that day when she threatened to kick her daughter out just to spite me, I\u2019ve kept a low profile. I stay out of her way. I don\u2019t interact with her. I figured that was what she wanted. She seems like an awesome person when she wants to be, but I guess some folks just rub the wrong way.\n\nI just try to do what needs to be done around the house and stay out of the way. I help when I can, but I\u2019ve been really careful about overstepping. I didn\u2019t want PM to think I was trying on pants not meant for me, so to speak.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to teach myself Python in the hopes that it may be able to help me land a better job to alleviate some of our financial struggles. Moving into that house meant that we ended up paying twice as much just for rent. We also are both trying to climb out of student debt holes. I\u2019m trying to get out of default since that seems to be the biggest issue holding me from finishing my degree (I\u2019ve only attained an AS). So we need to improve our financial situation. Well, I need to. So I\u2019d learned how to code in school and found I had a knack for it. It was also enjoyable. So I thought I\u2019d try to work on improving my skills in my downtime and hopefully finding something that pays decent here by summer. Trouble is, I\u2019ve been moving slower than I\u2019d like with the language, and at the rate I\u2019m going, I\u2019m looking at more than a year until I\u2019m ready to code confidently in this language. \n\nI\u2019d also been trying to get my veteran disability stuff squared away. I was told that I was processed out wrong and because of that I\u2019m having difficulty getting a claim. So I\u2019m working on that as well. The guy I was working with died unexpectedly, so I\u2019m trying to find more help there.\n\nOn top of trying to find a better job/career, square away my finances and straighten out this VA claim, I am also dealing with medical issues. I have clinical depression. I\u2019d been hospitalized in the past for suicide. I have severe anxiety. I also live with chronic pain 24 hours a day. It was painful enough to be mixed up with a kidney stone initially. It\u2019s gradually gotten worse. At this point, I can\u2019t even sit or lay down without squirming often. I\u2019ve learned to function with this pain over the last 3 years, but that\u2019s the extent of that. So I spend a bit of time with doctors trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with me. \n\nI\u2019d just gotten to the point where I thought that I could manage all of that while still trying to be an active participant of a house that felt hostile to me. So I was relieved when I was told that PM\u2019s issues had nothing to do with me. They were all about the managing of the house affairs, of which I have nothing to do with. I told my partner that we should talk about how to address PMs concerns, and we set a date for this week to talk about that. I figured that if we can make sure to start dealing with things in the way that she wants them done, she won\u2019t go off the deep end.\n\nThis morning, she calls me and my partner into the front room and tells us that she wants us out in three months. Her reason is because she feels that I\u2019m the reason my partner isn\u2019t getting things done and that while she can\u2019t force a break up, she doesn\u2019t have to see it in her house.\n\nI think I\u2019m still in shock about this. I mean\u2026 what the hell can I do? We\u2019ve been struggling to live here. We don\u2019t have any money saved. My partner is now tenured as of less than a month ago. She worked hard for that. I have no clue what we can do. I was aiming for a more stable job that pays a bit better before even contemplating moving. That\u2019s not possible currently, since I have 3 months. \n\nI think I\u2019m having some sort of breakdown while I\u2019m typing. I keep shaking. Taking myself out of commission is an option I keep coming back to. Part of the reason I think I\u2019m typing this. My thought is that this makes things less messy. Like, if I\u2019m gone, then maybe PM would back off on this. I told her that she can break up with me and then stay in that house. She told me no. She said that she doesn\u2019t want to live there anymore in light of everything. I think if I were gone she\u2019d need them more than ever, so she\u2019d have to stay.\n\nIs there anything than can be done in our current circumstances? Is this really as hopeless as it looks to me? I didn\u2019t want my cursed existence to cause my partner the level of hardship that she\u2019s now going through. I don\u2019t think I know what I\u2019m asking. I think I need some help.\n\nI mean... I'm trying to be a better person. I try to improve every single day, yet it feels to no avail now. No matter what I do, more shit happens. Like, what is it about me that makes it so folks wanna take a dump all over me? Has my life not been hard enough? I've been homeless, broke, shot at, attacked, drowned, stomped on by 30 dudes... I can go on. I just want to work hard at a job I enjoy and can make some progress in, go home, chill with my friends and love my family for a couple of hours before I do it again. That's all I want in life. Is that so freaking hard to ask for?\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to write this for about 6 hours. I can\u2019t stop shaking.\n\nI think my mind just can't comprehend how to solve this. I keep blinking and shaking. Type a word or two and then shake. I don't know what this is. Some folks may thrive in this. I don\u2019t. I like an orderly existence. I need structure and stability. This\u2026 this  isn\u2019t that.\n\nI just keep wishing I can end all this shit. All this pain, all this anxiety, frustration, fear... I'm fucking TIRED! I'm just over 35 feeling like I'm just under 75. I feel like I keep pushing, keep trying to be a better person and it means nothing. Doesn't help when it seems obvious to me that self removal would solve a lot of folks problems around here.",

        "original": "throwaway account.\n\nI (15m) have suffered from anxiety and depression for years. It's been a few years since I've seriously contemplated suicide, but I just can't take it. Every day, I hear voices telling me how worthless I am, that nobody likes me and I should just die. I know they're wrong, but I don't. I don't know how to explain it. I know how much I have going for me, but none of it matters.\n\nI'm a dancer. I run cross country. I have friends. I've been in student government for two years. I'm learning Mandarin. I have two cats (19 and 7 years old). I have perfect grades (my lowest score on midterms this year was a 90.8). I had plans for a future. I've won my middle school's short story contest every year from 5th to 8th grade. I have strong relationships with several teachers. But none of that matters.\n\nI have an extremely toxic relationship with my father, who teaches at my school. He is a narcissistic, manipulative little slime who has destroyed my and my mother's mental health over the years. Since I was a toddler, he has destroyed my self esteem and left me without the slightest idea that standing up for myself is something I can do. He stays at work late, schedules trips and things without informing us (we're talking multi-day, interstate excursions), and refused to acknowledge my existence for three months when I didn't want to participate in an activity he ran. He refuses to believe that my depression is an issue, and recently pulled me out of therapy because *he* wasn't getting *his* money's worth. He screams at me to \"be normal\" on a weekly basis. I am super introverted. Doing theatre, dance, and student government and everything else has taken all my effort. I try to live up to his expectations, but I can't. He involves himself in my social life way too heavily. On the first day of high school, I made friends with a new boy. My father told me he doesn't like that kid (after one day of teaching him) and said I should hold myself to higher standards. I complimented my best friend on a scarf she was wearing, and my father spent the ride home yelling about how he thought I sounded sarcastic and 'I'm lucky she knows me well enough to not be offended. Though I'm not sure why she likes *you* so much.\" (this girl is the daughter of one of my father's colleagues, mind you.) He is held in high regard by many students, and seeing him shower them with praise and affection makes me sick. If only they knew...\n\nThis evening at dance I sat in a corner instead of working on choreography with my best friends (all 14f). I felt terrible, and I know they did too. But the voice of my father is there, telling me that I'm weird and worthless and nobody would want to spend time with me. I spent that time thinking about the best way to off myself. Hoarding antidepressants for a week or two and downing them, blood loss, drowning/hypothermia (aboveground pool, 30 to -10 degree New York winter) and other things crossed my mind. I think of my cats, especially the 19 year old who has served my mother and I with dignity and love all his life. But this world doesn't want me. My friends told me they hope I feel better tomorrow. But those words felt hollow and meaningless. \"They don't believe that,\" says my father's voice as I walk through the snow towards his classroom, alone and about to listen to his screaming for fifty minutes. I don't know if I can make it through the week. We're moving, my sister is afflicted with a mysterious illness, my father is his usual self, my mother is stressed, and I can't find the will to continue. I'm trying to think of how to say goodbye to my friends, my cats, my sister. I don't want to die, but I do want to die. If I die, I don't have to deal with this. My father can have his students and my sister (who he treats with more love than my mother and I combined), and I can rest.",
