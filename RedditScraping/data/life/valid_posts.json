            "content": "I found a tumblr post with a shit ton of AMAZING tips and tricks so I've cleaned them up and I'll put them below, I've also added on some of my own. Please add anything you know!\n\nSome shit about life:\n\neven if you get along great with your family you will get along even better with them after moving out \n\ngeneric is almost always just as good as name brand. But there are some things you never buy generic, including: peanut butter, ketchup, liquid NyQuil, Chips-Ahoy chewy chocolate chip cookies\n\njust imagine the person on the other end of the phone hates talking on the phone as much as you do. Even a receptionist. I worked as one and I hate talking on the phone\n\neveryone else is too busy panicking about everyone else noticing every tiny thing that could possibly be wrong about them to notice any tiny thing that could possibly be wrong about you\n\nyou will screw up. a lot. you live and you learn. and when you start to think too hard about that embarrassing thing that \nhappened and how you wish you could change it, just tell yourself that what\u2019s done is done. There\u2019s no changing it, so just forget it and move on. It\u2019s the only way to stay sane.\n\nif you are the only one in the aisle at the grocery store, and you need to get from one end to the other without even looking at anything in that aisle, then you should totally cart-surf down the aisle. Growing old is mandatory. Growing up is optional. Hold on to the little things. They make all the difference.\n\n--Money--\n\n15% tip. \n\nat least once in your life you will go to Wal-mart to buy something under $20 like an ironing board or something and your debit card will get rejected. No one will judge. \nEveryone at some point in their lives has had $2.98 in their bank account. \n\nthrift stores.\nThey're amazing. Trust me, just take one day to go through one and see if you can't find some awesome stuff wether for clothes or around the home \n\nthe best way to get money for food is to tell your grandparents about how you basically live on microwaved mac and cheese. Their horror may result in twenty bucks and orders to go out and get yourself \u201ca real dinner\u201d.\n\nReward yourself from time to time when you do things that you needed to get done. It\u2019s a good way to remind yourself to do them. Going out to pay a bill? Get Starbucks or something you don\u2019t get often. Rewards don\u2019t have to be huge, they can be small things like that.\n\nKeep a calendar on your pc of bill due dates. If your bills are set up at inconvenient times, like all of the services started on the first or something, then call up the company and find out if you can get your billing date switched to something more manageable. A lot of places do try to work with you.\n\nYou can often do your taxes online at places like TurboTax.\n\nThere is no shame in calling a company and asking for an extension on a bill. Let them know what you can pay, pay that amount, and they arrange when the rest of the payment is required. This can stop you from having services shut off man. It shows responsibility on your part.\n\n\n--Cleaning--\n\n\u201cThe Works\u201d is an excellent cheap toilet cleaner.\n\nMAGIC. FUCKING. ERASERS. THEY WORK ON EVERYTHING JUST DON\u2019T SCRUB HARD. I took the ring out of our bathtub with one. Also generic ones work just as well.\n\nKeep some bleach around but if you use it for cleaning? Dillute it. There\u2019s rarely ever a case where you need to pout straight bleach on anything. A cap full or two in a bucket of water works just fine.\n\nDO NOT MIX CLEANERS. Chemical reactions are can be very dangerous. Here\u2019s a good list. (Note that vinegar and baking soda can actually be a good combo for removing smells from things but it\u2019s not very good at actually -cleaning-.)\n\nsoak ink stains in milk to help get them out or at least lighten them.\n\nsoak blood stains in water as soon as possible, with a bit of detergent or stain remover. scrub at them. use cold water, heat binds proteins to fabric. tbh, there\u2019s no real need to change the washer from cold-cold setting unless the thing you\u2019re washing says to wash in warm water. \n\nacetone, found in most nail polish removers, dissolves super glue. \n\nWash or rinse your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. It prevents gross caked on junk.\n \ndo the dishes before the sink grows its own ecosystem\n\nyou can\u2019t put Dawn dishsoap in the dishwasher. \n\nif you do accidentally lapse and put dawn in your dishwasher, run it empty and put hair conditioner where the detergent goes. that\u2019ll clean it out (tip given by dorm custodian when roommate did the thing). \n\n--Medication--\n\nIf you drink? Don\u2019t take meds at the same time it\u2019s just not good.\n\nMake sure you check the dosages on your pill bottles. No one wants to accidentally overdose on cough syrup or ibuprofen.\n\nIf you have a uterus make sure you have a heating pad and ibuprofen on hand for the pain. Hot baths also generally help and Ginger Tea is excellent for any nausea.\n\nBuy a first aid kit. It\u2019s worth it in the long run.\n\nRead up on sex ed because I had to explain what a yeast infection was recently. And really a few YouTube videos will have you knowledgeable about both sexes \n\nPetroleum jelly (aka Vaseline) is good for chapped lips and you can get a decent sized tube or tub of it (generic brand version) for cheaper/same price as Chapstick.\n\nKEEP TRIPLE ANTIBIOTIC OINTMENT IN YOUR HOUSE FOR CUTS AND SCRAPES AND SORES. \n\n~~Medications~~\nOver the counter medications (stuff you can buy right off the shelf no prescription needed) have a name brand and a generic name. ALWAYS buy generic if it\u2019s available it is literally the same thing and way cheaper usually.\n\nSome names to remember when you\u2019re looking for meds!\n\nAcetaminophen = Tylenol\n\nUsed to treat pain and reduce fever. Do not take with Ibuprofen.\n\nIbuprofen = Advil, Midol, Motrin\nUsed for pain and fever, is an anti-inflammtory. Is good for period cramps because it is an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug).\n\nNaproxen = Aleve, Naprosyn\nTreats fever, pain, arthritis pain, gout, period cramps, tendinitis, headache, backache, and toothache. Is also an NSAID.\n\nAcetaminophen + Asprin + Caffeine = Excedrin\nUsually marketed as \u201cMigraine Relief\u201d as a generic.\n\nAsprin = Bayer\nUse for pain, fever, arthritis, and inflammation. Makes you bleed easily so should not be used for periods. Might reduce risk of heart attacks.\\\n\nTriple Antibiotic Ointment = Neosporin\nUsed on cuts, sores, and scrapes to reduce risk of infection and promote healing.\n\nAlso a general mutli-vitamin isn\u2019t a bad idea and if you don\u2019t get a lot of fruits or milk/sunshine in your diet you might want to get vitamins C and D specifically for daily use.\n\nStart upping vitamin C for flu season\n\nKnow how to change a tire. You\u2019re going to need to do it at some point in time and you can\u2019t always rely on someone else to do it for you. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to go to your local food bank. They are there for a reason. \n\nDon\u2019t be ashamed to ask for help period. Life is hard, everyone needs help occasionally.\n\n--Cooking--\n\nif you live off ramen, add stuff to it! add veggies you like, don\u2019t use the whole flavor packet to cut down on sodium and msg or don\u2019t use it at all and add your own spices. \n\nRice, pasta, flour, sugar, cheese, eggs, milk, a pack of chicken, a pack of frozen veggies and a well stocked spice cabinet go a long way food-wise. Splurge and get the biggest container of rice you can. You don\u2019t have to go back and buy it again anytime soon and it makes a TON of meals in the meantime.\n\nRice can be cooked on the stove. You don\u2019t need a fancy rice cooker.\n\nif you\u2019re making something with potatoes in it (beans, stew) potatoes are done when you can easily stab a fork through them. \n\nyou can microwave a hotdog as long as you put it in a bowl of water or in a bun wrapped with paper towel. \n\nalso, when reheating rice leftovers, add a small amount of water, like maybe a spoonfull, so it doesn\u2019t get hard and crunchy. \n\nbuy a few packs of chicken. wholesale club stores like sam\u2019s, costco, or bj\u2019s tend to carry multipacks for a good price. they\u2019re incredibly useful for when you forget to defrost meat. \n\nMarinade that shit, there's a lot of easy easy marinades you can put in a freezer bag with the meat.\n\nbuy meat on sale and put it in the freezer. buy vegetables on sale, and put them in the freezer. frozen veggies are often as flavorful and good as fresh ones, keep longer, and often come in microwaveable bags or with microwave directions. \n\nBuy a roll of parchment paper from the cooking shit aisle. A big roll will last you for-fucking-ever. Pretty much any time you\u2019re using a baking pan you can line it with that stuff and save yourself A: food sticking to the pan and B: it\u2019s a quick rinse and it\u2019s clean.\n\nSame goes for tin foil, you can cook a lot of things in tinfoil, such as potatoes, veggies and meat.\n\nSyrian wrap is also a big must-have for food prep, storage and a bunch of other uses around the house.",

I'm 30 yrs old, not totally bent on \"settling down\" but I'm tired of paying a butt load of money for rent a month when I could theoretically pay less per mortgage if I bought. My other downfall is lack of down payment, but I hear that banks are willing to slash that for first time buyers. \n\nI should probably mention I don't have much debt - about 5k in credit cards that I'm paying down very aggressively. Not sure about fianc\u00e9es student loans amounts but I know she is paying them off. \n\nJust looking for some insight from a broad range of experiences :) thank you very much!

A year before we got married we moved out of his parents house and into one of my parents properties and rented it from them. I so wish we had just waited and spent time saving up, but too late now lol\n\nWe recently moved back into his parents house about 3 months ago so that we can save up for our own place and finally truly get on our feet. But it's been a challenge and I'm looking forward to being able to get our own place and start our own family. \n\nMoral of the story is I'm seeking advice on the proper steps to take to get this in motion. \nA little background:\n\nMy husband works in radio. Unfortunately, there are no rock solid hours. It's safe to assume that bare minimum he gets around $600 a month after taxes. Which Im fully aware is ridiculously low. \n\nI personally am on disability. I bring in $790 a month. Hopefully I'm going to be babysitting in starting in a few weeks, that will bring in an extra $400 a month. \n\nSo total, that's $1790 a month. \n\nWe have $500 in savings now. My credit score is low due to medical bills. And he has no established credit. \n\nSometime before we move out, we will have to purchase a second car which of course will increase our car insurance. Currently though we are doing just fine with only one car. \n\n*Should we build credit? I know we need to save like crazy obviously but what is a comfortable end goal before we start seriously looking to buy a house? Are there special loans for new home buyers? Are there any special costs that we may not know about? (Ex. My friend just got hit with property taxes she wasn't expecting at all) \n\n*Is it even reasonable to be planning on buying a house with our low income? If so what do you think a price range we could afford would be? I truly don't see how people afford anything. \n\nTLDR: planning to buy a house in the future. No clue how to adult.

I'm not a teen anymore, but I can't help but feel like I haven't become an actual adult yet. \n\nAlso, I don't work whenever I'm at college, I've never had an internship, and my parents pay for my college tuition. I don't drink or use drugs, but I've noticed that my siblings have gotten farther in doing adult things than I have. My sister graduated from college, and she lives in another state, with a place of her own. My brother is my twin, but he has a girlfriend that he's dated for months now, he has more experience with driving than I do, and he gets out of the house more than I do whenever I'm at home. I can't help but think that I have to catch up to my siblings and become an adult right now. \n\nSo, has anyone else dealt with stuff like this?

I'm 3 credit hours ahead of the game.\n\nThe six-year break I took has really given me perspective, and I feel like I've wasted a substantial part of my life, if only in regards to getting my degree. I got a pretty rude awakening when I moved out at 18, and have been kicking myself for not staying home and going to school right away ever since.

I want to do this as quickly as possible,  since my goal is to start a family before I'm 30. \n\nThis leads into my current situation.

            "content": "Let me start by saying that I LOVE to be an adult. When I finally graduated college a few months ago & started working full time I knew the first thing I wanted to do was get my own apartment. So I did it! It was the perfect one bedroom apartment for my little old self. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is where I feel like I was taken advantage of. The landlord knew I was looking for my first apartment & he advised me to apply quickly if I was interested because the property wouldn't last. I obliged and signed the lease a week later. Since then it has been disaster after disaster, with little to know assistance or remedy from my landlord. The constant storm has thus caused my anxiety to resurface. From broken toilets, to wild lizards, to flying bugs appearing throughout the entire apartment, to broken toilets again, to lack of air ventilation - preventing moisture from escaping the bathroom, I have hated the past few months of my life. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis leaves me with very few options. I can try to go through the legal system & break my lease...however my research says that will be very difficult to do...or I can pay the necessary fees to exit my lease & move on to a somewhat more comfortable & less anxiety-filled living. I have a friend who is purchasing a home & offering to rent me the space...but I can't until I find a way out of this situation. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was so proud of my adult choices and steps. I used all of my savings to prepare to move into this place...from purchasing new furniture, to trying to remedy the pest issues that my landlord refuses to control, etc. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do when my adulting goes wrong. I did the most un-adult thing & started a crowd fund page (my mom's suggestion). I'm embarrassed to admit that I've done it because 1) I feel like a failure and 2) I hate when people ask for money so why would I do it and 3) I'm supposed to be adulting. I just need help, whether it be via comforting words or jokes...or even if you tell me off. At this point I'll take anything. You can read a TINY bit of my story [here](https://www.gofundme.com/hs79zf-help-get-me-out-of-here). There's honestly too much to try to put it all into words.",

My longest fantasy finally came true.\nI got a divorce about a year ago and have been by myself ever since.  Every night I sit and watch TV then take matters into my own hands.  Thinking about every fantasy I have ever had.  My hand never talks back and never denies me the pleasure I seek.\n    At the store one night, I saw an old friend of mine doing a little shopping.  James was the friend that I worked with for about three years at my last job.  We began to talk and share stories of old times.  During our conversation, I found out he had been staying at a local hotel.  That he was getting a divorce from his wife of eight years.\n    I offered to let him stay with me until he got back on his feet.  James is about six foot tall and has an athletic build.  He took me up on my offer and took over my spare bedroom.  A few nights later he wanted to use my laptop to check his e-mails.\n    I do a lot of writing on my laptop things like stories and even my fantasies.  I had forgotten that I had left one of my fantasies open when he got on the laptop.  A couple nights later we were drinking a couple beers and talking. \n    James brought up the fantasy that he had read a couple nights earlier.  It was the one that I had jacked off about many times.  In my fantasy, I was on my knees giving a friend a blowjob and then later he took my virgin ass.\n     I know that I turn red in the face as he was talking about it.  I could not deny it though.  I explained that I have never acted on it but it was a fantasy of mine.  We left it that way and I went to bed.\n   An hour later I heard a knock on my bedroom door.  \n   \"Hey bro you asleep?\"\n   \"No what's up?\"\n    \"I was thinking about your fantasy want to make a reality?\"\n     \"No, man it was just a fantasy.\"\nJames placed a hand on my leg and began to rub.  He nudged me over onto my stomach and began to give me a back rub. \n    After a few minutes, I found myself getting really turned on. I rolled back over to my back and he stood up and removed his pants and shirt.  His cock was standing straight out it had to be aleast ten inches and very thick.\n    I found myself rubbing my own cock as I watched him strock his.  For some reason I raised up and took him into my hand and began to suck it.  the tast of his pre=cum was warm and salty.  James placed his hand on the back of my head and started thrusting in and out of my mouth.\n   It wasn't long before he was shooting his warm load down my throat.  The tast was strange but good in a diffrent way.  He climbed on the bed and and sucked me off like I never had before.  We laid there for about another hour. \n   James whispered in my ear.\n   \"I want to cum in your ass.\"\n    I reached back and felt that he was hard again.\n    \"Please be easy.\"\n    James grabbed the lube beside the bed and lubed himself up.  he rolled me to my stomach and raised my ass.  I felt his thick head press against my small opening.  As he started to  inter me the pain was strong I did not know whether I could take it or not.  Then it popped in I let out a loud moan.\n    James sat there for a few minutes to let me relax.  As my hole began to relax and take his thick shaft Jame started to thrust little be little.  After a few minutes James grabbed my hips and thrusted deep the pain turned to pleasure.\n    The head of his huge cock was rubbing against my P-spot and I started to moan.  With in a few more strocked he let out grunt and filled my ass with his load.  God I never felt so sood after sex.",

            "content": "Hey! So, this is my first post on here, but I wanted to get advice from people who aren't a part of my biased family.\n\nLittle bit of backstory, I grew up Mormon, my parents are Mormon, but I realized about four years ago that I am pretty Atheist. I have told my parents this, but as long as I am in their household, I am required to attend church and seminary at school. \n\nMy father is a teacher at a BYU school, so if I went to BYU, I would have the option of either two years no tuition, or four years half tuition. I'm inclined to go for the former. \n\nI'm going to list out how I thought I could go about this. I'll put down the problems afterwards:\n\n-I would take a gap year to work my ass off(to pay for housing/rent, food, school supplies, future tuition)\n\n-I would go to BYU to get my Associates and lock down my GE classes\n\n-I would then transfer to Boise State University to get my Bachelor's, in English, Writing Emphasis, and a minor in Gender Studies\n\nThe problems:\n\n-taking a gap year is risky, so says my mother. I'm not sure why, I don't quite understand, but I'm inclined to believe her\n\n-I can barely stand going to seminary now in high school, and religion classes every semester are required\n\n-I'm sure I can get a bishop's indorsment, but even so, you're required to go to church every Sunday, and I can barely stand going to church now\n\n-I have to pay for my entire education by myself, since my parents make too much for me to get governmental support, and too little to help my pay. They have told me many times that they'd like to help, but they have two kids already in college they have to help keep ALIVE, one with special needs, and four other kids to take care of, two more with special needs. \n\nI am not afraid to work hard. I know that hard work is how anything gets done, but I also have a lot of mental disorders like severe anxiety and depression to keep me vastly unmotivated to even attempt to survive in this society.\n\nI've only ever wanted to be a writer. An author. As I've grown up, I've learned that I have to find some other job to pay the bills, so I've resigned myself to a life as a receptionist. But sometimes, my anxiety gets ahead of me, and I want to just go into accounting or something so that I don't end up penniless. I don't have high hopes in life. I'd like to get more out of it, but at this point, I don't even know how I'm going to pay for college and stand another harsh, religious atmosphere.\n\nPlease, if you have any advice on any of the ideas, or more correct information, or a better plan for something, I'd love to hear it. Thank you!",

            "content": "Hi guys...there are several threads I could've posted this in but I chose this one because it's something almost every adult must face: being separated from their parents. And being REALLY sad about it.\n\nSome background:\nI'm a 20 year old woman who starts university this fall. I have it all planned out. However my parents have just moved out of state (they purchased a house out of state actually...). I was told I can do whatever I feel is comfortable including moving with them and going to a uni in their new state. This state is a 24 hour drive away btw...\n\nWell I decided due to cost, my very good job, and the fact that I'm comfortable here I would stay here and complete university for 4 years. I have a roommate completely lined up and really my finances are perfect.  On top of all this I have two very caring and loving sisters living both less than a 15min drive away and they are married with kids so lots of company to keep. Every aspect is ideal. \n\nBut one thing: I'm a huge fucking baby and I didn't realize it until my mom hugged me goodbye this morning and she and I both sobbed. Then my dad started to sob. It's definitely because I'm they're youngest. They have been on the road for 8 hours and I'm not kidding...I've only spent one hour NOT crying. I even threw up. \n\nThey also took our family cat because she's attached to my mom and old so needs them. So this made me cry too.\n\nWell i know it's healthy and normal for lots of adults to cry their first day away/moved out from mom and Dad but I'm seriously a severe mess. And I can't be like this because I have work in the morning and can't miss it. \n\nAnyone else like this?? Was it hard for you? How did you cope? I feel like a small child. My parents never really had me away for more than a night at a time growing up so being separated is super hard for me. I feel ridiculous because they're both SUPER HEALTHY, and now they're happy to be in their beautiful home soon. AND I AM TOO OLD TO HAVE SEPARATION ANXIETY.\n\nI have no significant other and not many friends to help distract me. I already have diagnosed depression too and that's hard as hell. But I know it's time for me to learn how to exist without my parents.\n\nOne other thing; my sisters and their husbands are looking at homes in that state and each plan to be gone in about 2-4 years, that state has a lot of great aspects and is more affordable than where we live. So I will be following suit after i graduate more than likely (unless some great opportunity here pops up). So this is really just like any other uni kid moving away for four years.\n\nAny advice on how to cope is welcomed. \n\nTl;dr: Parents moved away, I'm in the same place to complete university, I'm a bitch baby and can't pull myself together to do adult things. Need coping skills",

Maybe just a room/studio unit, an apartment of some sort will do. I know this is not the right place for me to look for a space but I'm having a hard time looking and I wanted to hear straight from people.\n\nJust to give you a background, I'm a 25 y/o professional, grew up in Laguna, currently living with my sister (who's still studying) in a condomunium in Sampaloc, Manila with my parents paying for the rent. I moved in with her with my parents' consent to have someone, to look for her to cut costs also and to live technically near my work place. Travelling to and from Laguna got me burnt out at work at some point so I decided to moved in here.\n\nMy salary isn't that much to cover expenses living in a condominium near my office (in Malate, Manila) where units cost minimum Php13,000 monthly. I just wanted my own space, that's it. \n\nI hope you can feed me in some websites, contacts or listings where i can look for one. Doesn't have to be necessarily spaceous or walking distance from my place, maybe a 30min ride to my work place with about a maximum of P6,000 rent per month, based on my computation on how much I can shell out for a place to live in alone.\n\nThanks for all of those who will comment.",

I live at home with my parents, and they are awesome, HOWEVER I'm finding I'm getting progressively more and more annoyed that I don't have any real independence from them. I don't have any kind of problem with anyone in my family, I'm just simply outgrowing things and running out of breathing room. I've recently bought a car, fixed it up, and now I'm getting ready to get my full license. From there I'm wondering...how do I move out? Especially if I have to move to, say, another city entirely because of affordability? How do most people manage to do that? I work 2 part-time jobs right now and I'm kind of loathe to leave either one, but if I must then I must. :/ It was tough to even get hired, so if I move out of this area do I apply for jobs somewhere first and THEN look for agreeable housing there? Do I look for housing first? Simultaneously? Do I try and live out of my car for a bit? How does one actually begin the process of \"moving out\"? I'm sure I will do fine once I'm out of my parents home...I went to abroad in the past to stay with an ex-bf for 3 months and I managed incredibly well. I traveled completely alone most of the time, managed my money, did the shopping, prepared meals for both of us, kept the apartment in order, kept myself healthy, made all the important phone calls and appointments...I'll be just fine, I just have no idea how to get to the point of actually having a place of my own. :/",

My someday plan, thats been taking over my headspace, is to shift from as employee who does bookkeeping, to a small business who bookkeeps for small businesses or people's personal finance. I will stay with the company I'm with, but will slowly start taking on new customers. But quite frankly I dont know what the first step in that transition should be.\n\nThis planning of mine has sparked a million other thoughts and questions. I bring in the majority of money between my long term boyfriend and I - he is building his streaming channel. Our living situation makes it easy to live on my income, but we aren't saving much - even thought we do have a little emergency fund of $6000 at this point.\n\nBut. Being 21 and 23 im starting to think about how I should be planning on aquiring a house. I dont know what my first step should be there. We plan to adopt and that gets quite costly - I dont even know how to breach into that. Since we live simply we want to save heavy and invest so we can retire early-ish. But I have absolutely no idea how to invest or make our money work for us. We have zero debt. But we also have zero credit. So I know that needs to change.\n\nAny advice in these areas or questions, suggestions, etc would be MUCH appreciated. \n\nThanks (:",

She still has the mind set that girls CANNOT travel on their own.\n\nI've mentioned this Thailand trip like a year ago and she was like, okay yeah, let's go (my sister, my mom, and me).  Now she's taking back her words and does not want me to go.  She would go if work lets her take off but now she says she only wants to go if we also go to the neighboring country and visit our distant relatives there---which I do NOT want to do.  My sister and I were just planning to go ourselves instead.  Now my mom is not okay with this and keeps saying that I want her to die from worrying if I do go.  \n\nShe says she'll be okay with it if I get some other friends to go so it's a bigger group.   I've already asked all my friends and they aren't interested/don't have money/already have other trips planned.  Also the thing with traveling in a bigger group is that you won't have as much flexibility in the places you actually want to go....\n\nI've wanted to get out of the country for a long time now and each time I attempted to, I got turned down by my mom. I wanted to study abroad in Japan and would be with a group of people and she said no.  So I don't feel like getting more people to go would even solve the problem anyways.  \n\nNow my sister is iffy for the trip. Regardless if they go or not, I want to go.  I wasn't asking for permission. I know I can do it, but I don't want to have her die while I'm out of the country or be blamed for any health issues she gets from being overly worried for me. \n\nWhat would you guys do?  \n\n",

Right now, I\u2019m trying to determine if I am better off focusing on a).   Saving money for a used car or b).  Saving money for an apartment deposit/putting aside money for rent, so that I can move somewhere where SEPTA is within walking distance.  Unfortunately, I had a number of very high medical bills that I was paying off for several years, so I was unable to gain this independence on a more \u201cage-appropriate\u201d timeline.  Now that they\u2019re paid off, I\u2019m eager to move forward.\n\n I have approximately $4,000 in savings, but my job was eliminated last week  so I\u2019ll be going on unemployment benefits.  My hope is to secure another job ASAP, but I know I can\u2019t conjure a job out of thin air, despite the fact I\u2019ve been applying to places like crazy.  I have found that my lack of vehicle paired with living out in the boonies is really limiting my job prospects.  Most jobs are too far away for family/friends to give me rides.  Something needs to change!  Ideally, I\u2019d love to move somewhere closer to Philly/in the city where there are more bountiful jobs AND buy a car, but given that I\u2019m unemployed at the moment, that won\u2019t be feasible for some time. \n\nI recognize that most likely landlords would not want to rent to me given my only income is unemployment benefits (likewise, it will be difficult for me to apply for an auto loan.  My credit score is decent, but I doubt anyone would want to take a chance on me without a job).  However, I will certainly look into both.

But.. as well as I\u2019m doing with Adulting, I\u2019m still dealing with my parents. They\u2019ve always supported me, helped with things around my house and have always been my greatest allies.. but they won\u2019t let me go. \n\nSome background.. I\u2019m now a 30 minute drive (about 14-16 miles) from my parents. I never left them for college, I lived at home until 22 when I bought the house and moved out six months ago. I\u2019m an only child. \n\nEvery phone call to my parents, primarily my mom, and I continuously get bitched at. Always about how I moved too far, and they can\u2019t just stop by, can\u2019t see my dog, and hangout, and visit, and that it\u2019s unfair and how I\u2019ve left them and they feel like I\u2019m deserting them, I don\u2019t want them around, I\u2019m replacing them with my boyfriends parents, and I\u2019m ruining our family, and it\u2019s never the same etc etc. it gets to the point where I can put my phone down and hear my mom yell and bitch for around 5 minutes without me saying anything. \n\nI\u2019m constantly made to feel guilty about taking a job not down the road from them, and though they never say it, I constantly feel like they resent me for my life decisions. They should be proud their kid is successful and that she can support herself. But instead it\u2019s guilt they put on me.\n\nShe says she feels like I don\u2019t want to talk to her, or want them around. As much as I love them, the more I talk to them the more Im made to feel bad. So it\u2019s getting to the point where I don\u2019t want to talk, or deal with them because it only results in guilt and then fights. She continuously compares my boyfriends parents (who live 7 minutes away from me) to how they stop at his house and care for his dog on long work days, or drop food off. honestly, my boyfriend is seen as more of a threat to her than anything else. \n\nThey\u2019ll have plans to come visit, but then she throws a fit and then cries and yells and cancels the plans and tries to make me feel guilty until I come to their house and hangout instead. Which internally pisses me off.. I have things to do which I put off to do nothing at their house. \n\n\nI guess what I\u2019m asking, is how can I get my parents (primarily my mom) to calm down and let me go without hurting them or starting a war? Has anyone dealt with this? \n\nPlease. I\u2019m begging for help. \n",

I knew growing up... I needed to figure things out on my own and try to be as independent as I could be.\n\n\n- I felt like such a dunce when I was trying to fill out my financial aid. I'm the first person in my family to go to college. I was mostly scared of fucking it up immensely for myself (got a big fear of messing up, it's a deep-rooted thing and blah blah blah, don't want to get into it, lol). I easily get anxious over these things, especially when it comes to money and reading important documents, trying to understand health insurance, plans to buy a car -- adult stuff. I also don't want to look stupid. Hah.\n\n\n- When I was younger I was used to helping others out and being the one people go to for help/advice, so I can't help but feel inadequate and slow when I tend to ask others for help on these things that I feel like I should know already. Am I being honest with myself here, or is it a very normal thing? To feel this way? I still live with my parents, because -- again, health reasons -- and I feel bad for asking my parents about certain things. They just don't know how to explain things in the right words. They do try to help to a certain extent, but they usually would just do it for me instead of explaining, which is **not** what I want. I'm grateful for it, don't get me wrong, but how am I supposed to learn if I don't do these things myself?\n\n\n- I started college very recently, and students who are two years younger than me, fresh out of high school are talking about things that I don't understand. I just feel really behind.\n\n\n- So, referring to the title again: *As soon as you turned 18, did you already understand everything about taxes, saving money, car payments, jobs, college, financial aid, etc.?*\n\n\n- Also, what were your experiences like when you started figuring out the adult world? Lots of embarrassing moments? Mistakes you've made and learned from? Things you wish you could tell yourself if you could turn back time to when you were 18 (or whatever age you decided to be ~fully~ independent)?\n\n*Thank you.*\n\n(I bullet-ed everything because I thought it made it easier to read, lol.

I texted pretty often lately, and went down and visited maybe once a week. As of recently, things regressed. \n\nPlease, someone tell me if I\u2019m in the wrong for the things I\u2019ve said, and how I feel. I\u2019m trying to be independent and be an adult. \n\nHow can I maintain a relationship with my mom without these issues? Has anyone else has these issues? She\u2019s important to me, I love her, but I\u2019m tired of this. \n\nThis has been all my life and because I was financially dependent on her, I didn\u2019t stand up for myself often. ( whenever I did stand up, she\u2019d threatened to cancel this and that ) Now that I\u2019m not financially dependent, and she doesn\u2019t control any thing in my life, it\u2019s gotten harder for her to keep controlling me.\n\nBackground... Im 23, I moved out in June. Bought a house. Handle all my own bills (except car insurance which is under them for now\u2014 but by tomorrow I\u2019ll probably be on my own.) and started to branch out. I met a guy, a month after moving out and we hit it off, and it\u2019s been a serious relationship since the first date. They haven\u2019t really had a great chance to get to know him, nor do they seem to want to since he\u2019s taking me away from them. \n\n[Screenshots of the convo with my Mom.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/X4SSf8rKHfOjLHzx1)\n",

            "content": "Thank you in advance to anyone willing to read this wall of text. If you know a better subreddit to post for advice on this, let me know! Anyways:\n\nAfter a few great visits to Philly, I'm beginning to seriously consider moving out there. I have a friend from college currently at Temple for Dentistry, and a cousin who I'm pretty close with working/living in the city. I think I've successfully infiltrated his friend group, and I met a girl out on my own during my last visit, so I have a little bit of a network already hahah.\n\n**My Situation:**\nI went to college in upstate NY, earned a B.S. in IT, moved back home (north jersey) almost two years ago and ended up finding work outside of my field of study and just kind of got stuck in the job. I hate it, pay is not impressive at all (about 32k/year after taxes) but I'm pretty minimalist so I've been able to save, solid benefits. Honestly I didn't know what the heck I wanted to do with my life after college so my time at this job gave me time to think and figure it out a little bit. Now that I have an idea though, I'm itching to get out of this job and get started on building that life.\n\n**Reasons to Move:**\nHonestly there's nothing really wrong with my home life. I don't have a good relationship with my brother but we stay out of each others' way. My mom and I are close, and my dad and I get along pretty well 90% of the time. They know I'm safe/responsible when I go out so they let me do my thing without any rules/interference. I just feel like it's time to take the next step in life and take full control. I like where I live, but it just feels a little stale. I tend to get restless when I'm in the same place for too long. Not to mention rent is crazy in North Jersey, so it wouldn't make sense/be worth it to move out to somewhere local. Furthermore, I'm ready to quit my job, but I wouldn't want to get a new job in an area that I'm not happy with and end up quitting again in order to move. I've only been at this first job for a year and a half, so doing that would look bad on my resume.\n\nSo onto my concerns.\n\n**The Financial:**\nHow much did you guys have saved up when you moved out?  Right now, I've got about 10k in the bank, 4k in a 401k (3.5k vested, so I'd lose a bit if I left my job), fully paid off car worth maybe 8-9k, 11k in student loans. I pay about $500/mo into my student loans, $80ish a month for my phone plan, $150/mo for car insurance (under my mom's plan, it will be a good bit more if I move out based on the quotes I looked at before purchasing since I'm young). From what I've seen, I think I could get a decent (decent for 22 y/o man with low standards) 1br in the city for around $700-1000, or a less than decent place for a bit less. Credit score is around 750. I feel pretty good about where I'm at, but I know it's a lot different when you're out on your own. Do you think I would be able to secure a lease with my standing? I'm young and I'd be a first time renter obviously, so I know I'd be seen as a risk either way.\n\n**The Guilt:**\nHow did you deal with the guilt you felt (if you felt it) moving away from home? I know my mom would be upset. I'm not all that close with my dad, but he is sick. He doesn't require anyone to take care of him, but it could come to that sooner than later. They're both getting older, and I feel almost selfish for wanting to leave. I love my parents, but I think I'm at that point where I'm ready to experience life on my own terms. I don't think that's unreasonable, but I don't know. Hard to say it isn't selfish. My brother lives at home, but he's kind of a fuck-up for lack of a better term. He causes more trouble than good for both of my parents, so that's another thing to be concerned about. Thoughts?\n\n\n**TLDR**\nRecent college grad feeling the itch to spread wings and ffflllyyyyyyyyyyyy on to new city and new life. Decent (I think) financial standing, but guilt about \"abandoning\" parents. What do",

I decided to move at the start of the summer before classes begin for this reason as well as to find some work and expand my housing options.\n\nI have experience as a barista (as well being a certified personal trainer) and seeing as they're big in coffee, I don't think I'll have much of a problem finding a job there.

If you have any ideas of jobs/activities that would grant me great exposure to Seattlites or if you know anyone who you think I could possibly add something of value for, please message me or leave a comment!\n\nThis will be my first major life change and I am so excited yet nervous. I'm reaching out to this community in hopes of any and all advice or to hear some of your past experiences; what worked out/didn't.\n\nA little bit about me: I am studying nutritional science and exercise physiology, I love reading, music, writing, exercising, coffee and would consider myself quite open-minded. I also have a bit of an obsession with health in general and self-improvement. I love spending time with people more experienced than myself in business, art or anything really.

I love the occasional drink and socializing but am not a complete \"jock\" nor am I a complete \"nerd even though I'll bury myself in books and have a burning passion for learning (haha...

My offices would be 30 minutes (+/- 10min with traffic) out of the city center, and it's closer to a suburban area with a more family feel. Housing options are definitely much more worth my $ if I live closer to work, and I found some options for decent housing about 10 minutes away. I've been told that being a single young person moving to a new city, I should consider living near to the city, but is 30-40 minutes really that big of an issue if I wanted to go downtown? It's just that the ones closer downtown are really crummy in comparison to how much I'd save if I lived further out. \n\nI don't mind going out but it's not a dealbreaker if I have to drive or uber. Sure, I'd like to keep busy, but I feel like I can still do that if I live further out? I don't know, most of my new incoming coworkers have been discussing it and it's been a 50-50 split between living close to the city vs further out. My only concern is that most of them are from the area, so they already have friends from college/from the area. The ones living closer to the city are ones who are moving like me, and so I feel like that might be a choice that I should make? I plan on volunteering or joining activities to help meet new people/make new friends outside of work, too. Would meeting new people be that big of an issue if I lived further out?

            "title": "Apartment smells like chemical smoke. Please help.",
            "content": "Five months ago I moved into a semi-nice apartment that was advertised as newly renovated. All the appliances were brand new. (Also a bit of required context: I have allergies and asthma. I am also young and don't know much about moving into a new place) On the third night at my new apartment I turned the oven on to make pizza, after three minutes I looked over a saw smokey fumes rising from the oven. I instantly turned the oven off. I googled new oven fuming and read that many new ovens have factory chemicals that need to be burned off before actual use. I also read that the room should be well ventilated and that birds exposed to oven fumes may die. I live in a studio apartment and decided I didn't want to be around while these toxic bird killing fumes were being created. I was worried about having my oven on for too long while I was out so I switched it to self clean because that is on a timer. I thought self clean is probably exactly what would take care of the factory chemical problem. Anyways when I come back from being out with friends my apartment is filled with these nasty fumes. I open all the windows. I run to a store and buy a two fans and set them up. At this point I'm pissed and worried. I have breathing problems as it is and now my appliance manufacturing company expects me to deal with the toxic fumes created by turning on their oven. Fuck them and fuck my newly renovated apartment for not mentioning this shit or providing a user manual for any of the appliances. Even with my windows open, fans going, and leaving my apartment door wide open, like a weirdo, the chemical smell doesn't go away. It's not the worst thing but it's enough to hate paying for this relatively \"nice\" apartment. It's kind of like when you buy a new mattress and it smells chemically but the smell is always there. I was too much of a push over to advocate for myself when this oven thing happened and I kinda feel like part of it is my fault for putting the oven on self clean but forgetting to take out the metal oven racks, I read that you have to take the oven racks out during the self cleaning process because they have a finishing coat that will burn during the high heat process. I decide ok maybe I can just live with this till my lease is up. So fast forward to now. I have had a cancer diagnosis. It is not an aggressive cancer but enough to have to go to the doctor a lot. I get surgery to get the malignant tumor removed. But the doctor says I have to get CT scans every couple of months or so to make sure the cancer doesn't come back. Now I am anxious and hyper aware of chemicals in my life that could be carcinogens. One night I am doing homework at a grocery store seating area because I don't want to be in my weird smelling possibly harmful apartment. I check my email and see a customer satisfaction survey sent by my apartment's property management company. It's late I'm anxious, I'm pissed, and I just kind of go off in this survey about how \"I wouldn't ever recommend this place to a friend because my studio sucks and is probably unhealthy\" I also mention that the hall smells like mildew since some guy's washer flooded and even though they replaced the hall carpet they didn't take care of the underlying moisture problem and two of my outlet panels don't work and my sliding bathroom door scrapes of some paint everytime it slides. All these things kinda suck but they would be bearable if it wasn't for my apartment having smoke damage. I have trouble doing anything in my apartment because all I can think about is how this place might make my acinic cell carcinoma come back. I don't know how to deal with this. I got a call today talking about how they want to look at my apartment because of the survey and my apartment is a mess because I try to use it only for sleeping so I never clean my paper/mail up and I leave my clothes on the floor until I decide to do a load of laundry. I feel like they wont take me seriously and if they do then I have to clean up the messy library that is my unit. What could they do to make the chemical smell go away. Would they send in a smoke restoration team? What if that doesn't work? What if they just write it off as a weird apartment smell. Cause when I was little I did live in a ghetto place that always had a vague smell of cigarettes, fried food, and old people clothes. So it is normal for apartments to smell kinda weird but there is a difference between drunk person smell and factory chemical smell. Any advice? Thanks for reading. I love you reddit people.",

It was great for a little while and then I felt myself slipping into this really dark place in my life. I started drinking a lot (I know I\u2019m 19 I should be drinking) but it felt excessive. And then I started smoking pot, a lot. Every day I would get high, even before going to work just so I could be a little happier I guess. I started cutting people off cause I was ashamed of what I\u2019d become. A gained a little weight and though it wasn\u2019t much it really bothered me. Anyway, I decided to move back in with my parents only a year later, but as much as I feel a tiny bit better I can\u2019t help feel pathetic. Kind of like I\u2019ve failed at real life and that I\u2019ll just end up in this pathetic circle the rest of my life. Anyone know the feeling or this just really fucking pathetic? I\u2019m really trying to be an adult but damn it\u2019s not easy. ",

I mean I know that's good advice, but that wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I don't want to be a burden on my family. I have scholarships, but my food, apartment, and schooling aren't completely paid for, so everytime I have to pick up that check from my grandmother I feel so ashamed of myself and like I am failing.

We're working 50+ hours a week, so checks aren't too bad. Once the overtime ends, however, I will probably be at $2,100 a month. I don't want half my check going just to rent.

I was never good at finances and it's part of why I feel so helpless.\n\nI've considered studio apartments, but I worry that getting one might make me look even more like a loser divorcee, not that any women are in my life. It's all a big pity party over here and I'm desperately trying to crawl out of this rut.\n\nAny advice on figuring out money and is a studio apartment an direct ticket to Forever Alone land or a smart choice for someone hoping to one day move on with a special someone into a bigger home?\n\n",

Grad school is a must for my career choice, but what if this whole plan doesn't go well?\n\nAnd lately I've been reading posts floating around on other threads about people asking for advice to their life problems and I keep thinking, \"How would I handle that situation if that were me?\". I feel so naive and behind on life experience. I don't know how to file taxes, I don't know how to manage or budget my money, I don't know how to start my career and make wages I can live off of, I've only had one real job at 22 last summer, I have no car, etc. It's come to a point where I get overwhelmed over just seeing or hearing \"adult vocab words\" as I like to call it. Words like itemize or subsidize or deductible, or what a car note and other words that school doesn't teach you about because I'm like, \"What the hell is all of this stuff?\". \n\nI see posts about 20 yr olds or guys my age who stress over their two jobs and not making enough money to make ends meet and shit and moving in with their bf's and gf's and in my head I'm like, \"So this is what I'm expected to experience at this age?\"\n\nBelieve it or not, I even get scared to drive to certain places or distances because of my fear of driving but no adult thinks like that, right? \n\nThere's a guy I like that I believe he likes me too. But he's much older and more experienced in life than I am and I feel that I won't be able to match up to him. I don't want to come across as immature to him but that's how my life could be described imo and I hate it.

I'm not a slob and I like the rest of my house to be clean because that's the part of the home that I socialize in. I do NOT like people hanging out in my bedroom. Maybe it's because I'm an only child and I'd rather not share if I don't have to; but my bedroom is where I sleep, relax from stressful days at work, etc. I've lived elsewhere with roommates before. My sophomore year was stressful because we were three girls sharing a *small ass* **ONE BEDROOM** apartment. My junior year was great because my best friend and I shared a room and we have the exact same habits - messy bedroom but an immaculately clean everything else. My senior year, I moved back with my sophomore years roommates but we had a three bedroom apartment this time, so it didn't matter if my room was messy, because it was *my* room. A few months ago I lived with a family member and that was stressful as fuck because he's an ultra neat freak, so I found myself only going to his home to sleep so I wouldn't feel like my presence was messy in general. Now I'm finding I can't even get comfortable in my bedroom at my parents' home. I call it my parents' home now because to me, home is where you're most comfortable, and I'm not comfortable anymore. \n\nThankfully, I've been hired at a better job with better pay, so now I can actually afford to move out. And I'm getting all new things for myself so I could actually be independent. I know my parents would let me take the furniture in my bedroom, but I would feel like I owe them something. Aside from being and feeling more independent, I'd be able to date too. Dating is hard with parents like mine. I don't need them scaring men off because he wants to meet them on the first date.",

My boyfriend and I don't live together but we often talk when we both get out of work. I have four hours from when I get home and go to bed and like my relaxation.

I haven't really been chatting with him during my half hour lunches because I'm making friends with other staff, and when I get home, like I mentioned, I just need \"me\" time.

A rough estimate of a part time job is 600 monthly and I have budgeted my groceries at 120 a month, planning to get a bus pass and a bike, and a phone plan with 60 a month.

            "content": "So as the title says, I would really like to build a social life and enjoy life more and make some friends. I\u2019m a 22 year old male and whilst I was pretty popular and had a fun social life in sixth form and at university, I feel like I\u2019m losing that and I\u2019m getting pretty lonely. I have asperger\u2019s syndrome and I don\u2019t find it easy to meet new people, before sixth form I was a complete social outcast, no friends, no social life, got bullied and lots of people were either apathetic to my existence or actively mean to me, leaving me with pretty low self esteem and low confidence socially. I get to sixth form and I start making friends, going to parties, bars etc and I have some really good memories and I look back and smile at what I once had and that carried on through university. I guess I got used to the idea of friendships just falling onto my lap with minimal effort on my part from school and university and wrongly assumed that would happen as an adult. One regret is that I now realise how much I took my friendships for granted as I sometimes distances myself as I remember often getting depressed over the stupidest fucking thing and I absolutely hated the idea of showing emotion and being vulnerable and I still do. I still have my old friends from school but we all live in different parts of the country now and we only get to meet up every once in a while and my uni friendships are kind of fizzling away and I have no idea how I can rekindle them or whether I should considering they too, live in different parts of the country, a few moving to different countries also. I have a girlfriend and I really really love her, we see each other about a couple weeks per month as she currently lives quite far away. Whilst I do love her and genuinely enjoy her company, I don\u2019t want her to be the only person I ever hang out with and the worst part is that I\u2019m too proud to open up to her and admit that I\u2019m lonely and yearning for a social life. I\u2019m currently employed as a software engineer in Hull, UK but I\u2019m moving shortly to Leeds as I\u2019m starting a new job, also as a software engineer, this could be a fresh start and an opportunity to reinvent myself. One thing I would absolutely love to do is join a sports club of some kind, I always really enjoyed doing that at university and school, my favourite being rugby but I\u2019m open to trying something new should the mood take me, my one hang up is that me visiting my girlfriend is done on an irregular schedule, currently it\u2019s during the week but she might be going back to university after taking a year off and so it might change to weekends, the reason I have a hang up is because if I join a sports club, I want to commit to it properly and not find myself skipping sessions to see my girlfriend, I feel quite strongly about commitment. One upside about my new location is my cousins live there who are all around my age who love going out and having fun but I\u2019d also like to make some friends. I don\u2019t want to just cut off the old friends I\u2019m still in contact with but I have this fear of coming off as clingy and annoying them when they\u2019re living their own lives so I find myself not contacting them as often as I\u2019d like to. I guess I am rambling a bit, I don\u2019t know what to expect, I\u2019m just sad and lonely and I miss having friends and going to parties, bars, days out, sports and other adventures and it\u2019s starting to get to me. I don\u2019t find it easy to meet new people and I\u2019ve still got issues with myself to work on but I\u2019m sick of just sitting on my ass and complaining about my situation, I want to start taking action and work to improve my situation, but I don\u2019t know what to do! Does anyone have any ideas on how I can go about starting to build a social life and making friends? I miss having people to hang out with, I miss going on nights out, I miss going on adventures with friends and I miss enjoying life. \n\nThank you in advance and I hope you all have a great day!",

Housing here is fairly expensive (we live in SoCal) so the cheapest I could find is $1.3k per month for rent in a reasonable location without a lot of crime and in good driving distance to both of our universities, but if we'd optimistically both be making about $700 per month, each, as part-time workers and full-time students, we definitely wouldn't have enough money for food or gas in our budget, let alone much of anything else. We seriously don't even have a third friend nearby that would be okay with renting with us, either, to cut down on costs. The $1.3k rented place I'm looking at is a studio, anyways, as are most of the other properties in this price point near us, so we'd be tight on space and fitting a third person in would be difficult. Main reason we're moving out is for more independence; she's transferring schools by fall of next year so it'd be inevitable anyways, and I'd move in to cut rental costs and to have my own independence, but with the expenses we're looking at, it just seems to be too much. We could always ask for financial help from our parents but it really defeats the whole purpose of moving out to be independent. Any advice on where we could look to for cheaper housing or anything we could do for some extra cash without tearing our hair out as full-time students and part-time workers?

She thinks I\u2019m embarrassing myself if I stay over his house or for a while after ata. Friends etc. she\u2019s overprotective and I hate this sooo much. Any tips and tricks on how to let them be more okay with this?\nI\u2019ve thought of lying though. And being upfront with it but I know she\u2019s gonna blast my ducking phone twenty times per 5 minutes and be all \u201cworried\u201d and I get she cares but she\u2019s not me and I\u2019m not her so let me the fuck be. I\u2019m 20, almost 21 and the only daughter so ergo. I feel as though lying would be the only formidable thing. I know I gotta do that with his parents if they ask about it.\nI\u2019m so tired of being restricted.",

            "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm 22 and planning to move out after graduation this Spring. My initial plan was to wait, save a ton, and buy my first house in cash while staying with family, but my home situation is so unhealthy. I feel it's effecting my overall productivity, happiness, health, etc, and not helping me grow, so I'm preparing to move and rent my first apartment! I'm looking for advice from perhaps those who have had this experience or simply understand the struggle of being self sustainable. Given housing costs I'm certainly thinking of having a room mate - Which would really reduce the probability of me running out of money and needing to return home. I'm currently researching a number of far more affordable places (compared to New York) and deciding which areas are best based on opportunity, affordability, and their closeness to nature.\n\nThank you in advance!",

I visit some game stores to browse, but don't really have money to do anything other than pay taxes, bills, and rent. Don't have any friends in the area, but many online that I talk to daily. Have this bizarre innate fear of my family dying and leaving me alone, despite the odds of that being very low because they're all healthy and none are really that old (nobody above 60). I don't drink a ton but I like a beer at the end of the day. Maybe two on a weekend if I also go to the gym. Play lots of video games, but half of them are mobile games that I can safely spend 5 minutes on once per hour, so the overall amount of time I spend on games is maybe 1-2 hours per day. I have a pretty normal sleep schedule. Church on Sundays, I'm Christian and appreciate the food for thought.  \n  \nI still feel like something's wrong. I have zero motivation for absolutely anything. I have the job I've trained my whole life for, and while I don't hate it, it's boring 80% of the time. Not stressful per se, but boring. Constantly daydreaming about different fantasy worlds I make up in my head, complete with stories, characters, etc. Some are surprisingly detailed too with long enough stories to make the extended version of LoTR blush. Not a fan of writing though, just daydreaming. Don't really like movies, anime is fun sometimes but not really a vice either. Quite frankly I just feel empty. Like I can't even differentiate between the last month and this month. Oh, I guess it's almost August now? No wait I mean October. That kind of thing. I wouldn't say I feel sad about anything in particular, but the words \"lethargic\" and \"slightly melancholy\" come to mind. Don't have an SO or anyone I'm particularly attached to either outside of some friends that are far away, even if I do talk to them on a daily basis for 2-3 hours. I feel minimal attachment to anyone at work.\n  \nIs this normal as an adult? Do normal people just go about their lives in near complete apathy?

I have $25,000 in savings and $18,000 in federal student loans. Eight weeks ago, I began my first ~real salaried position, making $45,000 before taxes. I also have a side hustle where I make anywhere between $500 and $3000 dollars monthly. \n\nWhen I first began my full time job, I had high hopes. However, it seems to me that the position mostly involves doing secretarial work, and offers no possibility of teaching me 'hard' skills that can be utilized in another role. I try to have a good attitude, but I feel stressed out and bored at the same time while I'm there, and currently have no idea how well I'm doing because (despite my requests for a meeting) my manager has not provided me with any feedback regarding my work. There is high turnover, and my position is notorious for poor possibility of growth within the firm. \n\nThe position requires about 50-60 hours of work per week, on a \"Chinese overtime\" schedule - meaning that for every hour over 40 that I work, I make half of my regular hourly rate. So, $45000/2080 = $21.63 comes to $21.63/2 = $10.80. If I work the required 50 hours a week, I make $106 before tax, on top of my weekly pay. \n\nI am incredibly thankful to be getting a regular paycheck, but my schedule provides me with little ability to apply to jobs or develop skills/connections. I am living at home while working at the job, and feel like I've gotten worked into a stagnant pattern in the past two months, and that I need to make a radical change in my surroundings in order to actually gain momentum in a job search. However, I am also terrified of the possibility that I may not get a job for months and months, and that this decision will end in financial ruin. \n\nPart of me feels like a spoiled baby for even disliking the job (after all, it's a regular paycheck, and the most financially sustainable option by far would be to stay working). However, the other half of me is hyper aware of the options and opportunities that I am letting pass by while I am working 60 hours in menial labor. \n\nAm I a brat?

I got my undergrad degree two years ago and I still feel so incredibly stuck and lost. I got my first job two months after grad and lasted four months because I cannot seem to keep up with the task at hand (also, it was output based so each project has a specific price and we were required to do 13 a day. I could barely make through eight. What made it better was that 8 other people who got in the same time as me couldn\u2019t keep up either). I had 9 months wherein I was doing side gigs while looking for work but wasn\u2019t hired until the end of 2017 where I got a seasonal job at a company. It was great, but ended too soon. While waiting for a full time position at the same company I got a work from home night shift job which I absolutely hate. Thankfully, I just got hired for a full time position at my old company and I\u2019m so, so happy but also sad at the same time. My main issues now is how to quit from this night shift job after only 2 months of working for them.\n\nFor all three times I\u2019ve gotten hired, I\u2019ve always felt this severe sadness loom over me. I don\u2019t know why exactly, but I would randomly cry and feel unmotivated to do anything. I hate myself because I feel this way and I\u2019ve been so fortunate to have been able to earn even when I am between jobs. I\u2019m so lucky that I have a family who is so understanding, especially since I still live at home, rent free, and have yet to consistently contribute to bills. I just want this sadness to go away. I try to distract myself by trying new hobbies and whatnot but it\u2019s always there looming in the back of my mind. It\u2019s all encompassing sometimes. There are moments where I feel ashamed because I feel so unaccomplished\u2014my mom had me at 23 and was already paying for a home and everything else. But then there\u2019s me who gets anxious at the mere thought of working. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. Sometimes I feel so sad that I consider ending my life to make things easier for my family and for everyone and even then I\u2019d berate myself for being so weak. I\u2019m so tired of being sad and ungrateful. Why won\u2019t it go away? \n\nTo be honest I sometimes wish that I was magically rich and never have to work a day in my life anymore. That the pressure of earning a living, becoming successful, etc. will fade away by a good family name and inheritance. I mean what kind of scumbag am I,???\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m so sorry if my post was a mess and so pathetic. I\u2019ve read that reddit helps. I honestly have no one to talk to and Ive been holding this for two years. thank you for listening and again I hope no one thinks ill of me for these thoughts but they\u2019re just there and I can\u2019t make them shut up.

But because she somehow still has a use for him, and values family too much, shes never going to kick him out. This results in him going several months without paying any sort of rent, while my mom complains and cries about why he wont help out.\n\nI seriously dont know whats up with him. Could he be depressed? He wanted to study engineering but got kicked out of college. Ever since then hes been staying at home playing videos games most of the time locked up in his room. \n\nI used to suggest jobs or things he could do but he always found a way to shoot it down. The very few times he has worked he decided to quit not long after. \n\nI just want to help imrpove the situation, becuase if my mom gets mad at him she gets pissed at everyone else. She makes a lot of threats though (taking away his ps4, tv, computer etc.) but never really does anything until shes at a peak (which she rarely ever reaches) \n\nIs there any kind of program for this situation to help him? Ive told him maybe he just needs some sort of therapy but he doesnt like the idea. Anything that can convince him to can help! He'd be willing to listen to logical arguments that suit him, I just havent found one for him yet. \n\nTL;DR\nOlder brother is addicted to gaming and not really sure how to help out so he find some sort of job and help around the house.

Basically though I just quit my job, (but I have some monies saved up so I'm k) my car is currently not working (Kevin pls help) and I need to have blood test and a CT scan done within less than a month (as requested by an Ophthalmologist)  - any information on help for getting insurance\n\n27/f I live in Reno, NV I am still currently a CA resident though, my credit is shit (not sure if this would be a thing, fuck if it is) and I haven't been to a DR in over like 10 years so I'm due.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFull Story Time!!\n\nLast week my car decided to stop working, I/bf/family assume it's the starter but I do have a friend coming to look at it tomorrow he has one of those diagnostic kits and then I can figure that out. Due to that I have been taking an uber to and from work. I just had my weekend on tues/weds this week, I noticed Tuesday night above my right eye lid was a bit swollen and there was a bit of pressure, after poking around a bit I lifted my eye lid to see a white mass thing to the right side and I just lost it. My sister is going to nursing school and had a test the next morning so I didn't tell her about it till Wednesday night after work. (Not messing with this woman's grades...)  I was still just trying to stay calm because I didn't know what it was. After I told Kalyn (sister) she informed me she has a friend who is an Ophthalmologist assistant, she was able to get me in Friday for an emergency appointment, now keep in mind I don't have insurance so my sister and I had to pay out of pocket and thanks to her friend it was cheaper then it could have been but we had to wait till Friday, so I worked Thursday and didn't say anything to anyone because I didn't know my sister had accepted the appointment. I was just still freaking out about (what I was hoping wasn't a tumor (my dad just beat lymphoma go dad!) and stressing about telling my sister and how she would react. I knew it may need to been seen immediately but I figured if it's medical related my boss wouldn't mind. I'm also a very anxious person by nature and have been stressing about my car, now my health and tossing my boss in the mix is just mean...\n\nSo I see the DR who tells me my right Meibomian Gland was swollen and it could be caused from a number of things but generally leads to an immune deficiency. So now I have to get blood drawn next week and I have a CT scan set for Nov 1st and a follow up with my DR on Nov 30.\n\nThursday night after I got off work Kalyns friend said my appointment was at 930am I texted my boss I will go in 930 I was not sure when I will be done but I will come back to work as soon as I was able. He replied telling me I needed to be to be back by 2pm which was fine. Plenty of time, after everything was said and done with my appointment my sister dropped me off at work. Now let me say I was already apprehensive to go into work because my boss has a tendency to lecture me about how I am unreliable anytime I call in or ask to come in late. So I show up around 1:35 explain to him whats happening/give him the DR's note and inform him that I will need to do blood testing next week. The first thing he says is to make sure it's on my day off. I agree and said I intended to-to which he asked to have a meeting in his office. The meeting was him explaining that me requesting and taking days off means he has to cover my shifts and I should see that as somewhat embarrassing to have my boss cover my shifts. He is the only other receptionist at his business besides me. I've worked for him for 6 months and he said I have asked for 2 weeks total off. A week of it was requested before employment and he admitted, 3 days was a request to visit my dad while he started radiation, one was a free snow day he gave me and the other three would be sick days or days I'm counting of me showing up to work, leaving to do something and returning to finish my shift. I was also bawling through all of this. The last thing he asked/said to me before I told him I was done talking to him and walked out was \" I've noticed your lack of enthusiasm to work here lately, is it because you're looking for another job?\"  I just feel exhausted and used. I'm responsible for my person and as such I decided to quit to be able to worry about my health. Fuck you James.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's it, give me insurance info, anything would be helpful. I don't know what it is or even if I'm sick, maybe it's something simple. Can a UTI can cause this? that'd be neat. Either way thank you. Should I post this in a different subreddit?",

I live in California, and my parents and I decided we'd be movnig out of state once I graduated for numerous reasons. We're not sure when we'll be able to leave, so I have to assume that I'll still be spending some time out here in California before I leave. My tight group of friends [4 including me] (one of them is my girlfriend, and we all became friends from being on the same team) are considering buying an apartment together since the other three are pretty much getting kicked out once they graduate. We're looking at two bedroom apartments (one room for my girlfriend and I, the other for the other two (also dating)) and it seems to be a reasonable thing for us to accomplish; some of the cheaper apartments in our area are running about $1.9K ent/month, and if we split the rent evenly that's about $475 per person. We have another friend who's offering to help with rent, but I don't want to rely on her and something happen to where she can't/won't help us. \n\nMy problem here is that I don't really know anything about being an adult. I didn't grow up with a lot of money so I'm good at budgeting, but that's about it. I don't know what you need to have in your first apartment/house, what to put into an emergency kit, how to pay bills, anything. My parents had been working for a few years before they graduated high school so they had money saved up to help them when they graduated and for college, and I don't have a job currently (I live about 40 minutes away from my school so getting a job without having a liscense or a car is really tricky). Wha advice do you have for an almost-adult about to step into the real world? What's something you wish you knew before you got an apartment? Things that would help to know so I can somewhat survive my first years of adulthood? \n\nTLDR; i have some time before i graduate but i'm trying to prepare for adulthood before it slaps me in the face.",

I'm stressed about money and I think it's making my health (mental and physical) worse, which just leads back to the doc.\n\nI'm currently sitting here awake five hours before my ten hour work shift starts because of extreme UTI pain, waiting for my pain meds to kick in so I can hopefully sleep a little tonight.

I'm cutting back to therapy every two weeks to help with my financial situation and I've resorted to Dr on demand but they said that I'll need a urine culture next time I get a UTI because obviously the first round of meds didn't cut it back enough for it to not come back. I don't know how much that'll cost. I'm so done with medical issues.\n\nI'm sorry this post is kind of a rant; I feel like health issues and financial insecurity are just eating me alive right now.

Obligatory I'm on mobile.\n\nMy husband (26M) and I (25F) moved into our first place together April 2017. From then, to this day, we have almost exclusively eaten fast food for lunch and dinner. Once per week we'll go have homemade dinner at his parents' house, and every once in a while we'll buy and cook some burgers or steaks ourselves, but a solid 90% of our diets are fast food.\n\nThis hasn't seemed to have any *noticable* averse effects on our health or weight. However, we decided to sit down and hash out a budget, and oh boy did we find out how much we were spending per month on fast food. I'm embarrassed to say.\n\nNeedless to say, we decided to stop going out or getting delivery for dinner, and that we'd actually start buying groceries and cooking for ourselves. With that in mind, I'm seeking 2 bits of advice: how do we work taking the time and energy to cook into our days and what should a grocery store budget look like?\n\nFor details:\n\nWe both know how to cook, nothing fancy, but no risk of burning down the apartment or getting food poisoning. Eating homemade meals is just going to require us to budget time and energy into our days that we haven't had to do before. Plus, there's the ever-elusive aspect of motivation.\n\nFor creating a budget, it's only the two of us. Neither of us eat breakfast. He'll grab lunch at a gas station while he's at work (it's not conducive for him to pack/bring lunch to his job), I've previously just taken light lunches of fruit and yogurt to work so i can do that again. Dinners we imagine as being meat + veggie + carb, where I have half portions and he has double portions. We don't snack often or heavily, but it's nice to have a bit of munchies around the house. And, for some reason, we just never manage to eat leftovers.\n\nJust to recap: I'm trying to figure out how to work cooking at home into our days and grocery shopping into our budgets.\n\nTIA! ",

After a few contact checks and an interview, I thought we were perfect for each other. I was looking for a mentor, and she was looking for someone who was professional. After college, I had moved back home for my first year in a job and then for my second year, moved out to my current job. This has been my first experience with a roommate not in a college dorm so I don\u2019t know what is normal behavior and what is not.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together for about 4 months now. She has older dogs and so most of her attention revolves around them. I like them a lot too, so I don\u2019t mind doing things for them but I feel as though she has been relying on me too much. One of her dogs has started peeing on the carpet because the dog is getting older, and she keeps talking about getting diapers for it. The dogs are like her kids so I get it. When she has things to do after work, she asked if I could feed the dogs and I said I could, because I do like them.\n\nWhat really gets me is that I feel that she is becoming less of a mentor and more of a mom. I feel as though some of the choices she makes are oppressive and I can\u2019t express my true feelings. I was considering adopting an older dog, the same size as hers, but she shot me down almost immediately with the fact that her dogs had a pack mentality and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to bring another dog in. I get it because her dogs are like her kids, but it still stings, and I\u2019m becoming resentful. I can\u2019t tell if my feelings are childish or not. There are some other things she has said, but I really feel as though I have just left my parents to get another parent. What should I do in terms of this relationship? Should I consider moving out? She\u2019s an agreeable person.",

Once you factor in the drive (in rush-hour traffic) to the other side of the city, it's more like 7-6. He is absolutely exhausted when he gets home, he pretty much just eats dinner and passes out. I'm worried about him! Both his physical and mental health. (We both suffer from anxiety and depression.)\n\nThe job isn't in his field, it's not something he's particularly interested in, and he feels out of place. Almost everyone who works there is 30+ years older than him and have been doing this work since practically before he was born. (Unfortunately, this is his only option right now). He's also very introverted and I think being in an office for 9 hours a day is really draining him. \n\nI'm currently unemployed, so I've taken on the role of super wife. I make sure dinner is ready when he gets home, I pack his lunches, make sure the laundry is washed, the car is full of gas, etc etc. I'm also in charge of our budgeting and bill paying, so he doesn't need to worry about anything (besides actually earning the money). Is there anything else that I can be doing to help him out? Or anything that he could be doing to be less exhausted?\n\n(I want to work exercise somewhere into this equation, but I really don't think I can convince him to get up at 4:30 to go to the gym....)",

            "title": "Moving back home?",
            "content": "This might be a long post. I\u2019m seriously considering moving back home (not necessarily into my folks\u2019 place, just back to the same city). \n\nSome background: I currently live in Cape Town, South Africa. My hometown is a much smaller city, about 1,000km away. \n\nSome background: I\u2019m a 28 year old, bisexual woman, with Bipolar Mood Disorder. I am a medical doctor, 4 years post-graduation. \n\nMy whole life I have wanted to \u201cbreak free\u201d (yes, now you have an earworm, sorry). I\u2019ve always been restless and traveled a lot. Specific reasons I wanted to move here:\n- better career opportunities, including better training opportunities; I can actually become well-know in my field here, and do clinically relevant and well-supported research, and I do have a mentor here, which I never had in the hometown, and I\u2019m actually already involved in two research projects;\n- well-run city (the healthcare system in this city is actually somewhat functional here, which makes my job much better to do); \n- sexual freedom: I\u2019d never had the opportunity to explore my sexuality, so coming here has helped me a LOT with that;\n- anonimity: coming from a small city, I never got a psychiatrist or a therapist, because everyone knew everyone. Since coming here, I\u2019ve got both a psychiatrist and a therapist, and am actually on the right medication for the right condition;\n- generally liberal, so I thought I\u2019d make a lot of friends who \u201cthink like me\u201d. \n\nReasons I\u2019m considering moving back:\n- most importantly: I am desperately alone. I have a couple of friends but nobody who checks up on me. Nobody who will drop things when I\u2019m in crisis to support me. Maybe that\u2019s expecting too much, but it\u2019s what I do for my friends;\n- family: my family is there. This is tricky, because I\u2019ve always had a complicated relationship with my family. They love me, and I them, but we are vastly different. But despite that, they will be there for me when I have a depressive episode;\n- job scarcity: jobs in the field I want (anaesthetics) are incredibly sought after and rare. In my hometown, the hospital administration knows me and the senior doctors have regularly asked me to come back;\n- expenses: rent here is about 4 times as expensive as at home. Because the city is bigger, I spend more on fuel. Electricity is more expensive. Everything is more expensive. I\u2019m not even managing to save for retirement. (IF I get an anaesthetics job I will manage. But who knows when that is.);\n- safety: I lived in my hometown for 26 years and never got robbed or threatened. In the two years that I have stayed here, I have been robbed twice, and attacked while in my car. This is one of the more dangerous cities in the country, with a very high gang activity. \n\nThere\u2019s one other important thing tying me to Cape Town... I\u2019ve found a partner. It\u2019s exceedingly complicated, that I can\u2019t go into now, but it\u2019s intense and amazing and satisfies me sexually in ways I\u2019ve never before experienced. However, there is no way for him to move with me. Not a chance in hell. For multiple reasons. \nI realise that making a decision based on a lover is such a shit move, and it\u2019s one I\u2019ve always criticised. But... here I am. \n\nI can\u2019t decide what weighs more. What if I just need to hang on a bit longer til things get better? What if my dream job is just around the corner? And how will I deal with having my family involved in my life so regularly? They can be pretty imposing and I can feel quite suppressed. \n\nAlso... I feel like moving home will be a failure. Like, I\u2019ve gone to the \u201cbig city\u201d and failed to cope and now I\u2019m going home with my tail between my legs?\n\nPlease... any advice will be appreciated. \n\n",

It's hard to pay attention in class when the work is uninteresting. I've failed almost all my classes so am dropping out to work full-time.\n\nFirst of all, I'm the kind of person who considered living out of a van (I still might), so I don't need much besides the ability to use my PC, have a social activity, and have a savings to add to. I've never had a real job before though, and no retail position has responded to me yet. I live in Georgia, 30 minutes from Atlanta too.\n\nIs there some military stuff I could do that wouldn't have the possibility of me having to go to war? Is there work where I have the possibility of moving up? I think retail is like that. Anything to improve my applying responses? I've been programming since a kid and have a portfolio, but haven't snagged anything from startups.\n\nI know college is such a common thing to go to, but I don't feel what I do is meaningful there. My life is dull and it's probably why I started smoking marijuana and speeding on local highways for a rush. What can I do? Can I afford an appartment making like $10/hr working full time hours?",

This is something I thought I\u2019d never accomplish, but here I am, 29 years old, about to start the home buying process. \n\nI\u2019ll give you a brief backstory, so you understand why this is a huge deal for me. \n\nI come from poverty and rampant drug abuse. A truly dysfunctional family. My mom kicked me out when I was 18, and I promptly lost my job at the gym 2 weeks after signing my first apartment lease. As a student, I had limited availability to work, but I put my mind to it and went job hunting every single day. Ultimately I was hired at a retail job that I loved. \n\nOver the following seven years, I racked up (and paid off. And racked up again. And paid off again) tons of stupid credit card debt. I was duped into buying a used car with an outrageous interest rate and then made the situation worse by trading up for a better car. I was massively upside down. My car payments are still $400+. I\u2019m glad to say I\u2019ll own that car free and clear within the next 2 years. \n\nI\u2019ve been in and out of apartments my whole life. Often with a boyfriend or a friend. And it often failed. Not that I can\u2019t live with other people... but I have standards for my home. And so many people violated those standards (smoking in the house! Never washing dishes, etc). \n\nI have not finished my education, but I have amassed $20k+ in student loans. Those cost me $250/mo. Between rent, loans, insurance, and other lines of credit I\u2019m whittling down, plus bills and the gym, the doctor and physical therapy, and groceries, gas and entertainment ...... it\u2019s been a lot. I also care for my little sister in a few ways, like taking care of her phone bill. I have made every effort to make payments on time and more than the minimum when i can. Bonuses go to debts. I have a little cash savings and my 401(k) is looking really good. \n\nI work my ass off. As a flight attendant, I can work nearly as much as I want, and it\u2019s been great! It\u2019s a costly career. I often MUST buy things out of convenience or replace my luggage and uniforms. But I am making it all work. \n\nI tell you allllllll this to say: you CAN do it! Your past will not define your future. Be brave and make things happen. ",

I have a college certificate in administrative work, and I\u2019m currently enrolled in college for a wholistic health diploma in therapy. \n\nMy main problem other than the money issue is: I can\u2019t seem to stay disciplined at all. I call in sick constantly, or I\u2019m late to work. I feel bad about it, oftentimes I genuinely feel like I can\u2019t cope but I don\u2019t want to be this victim type of person. I want to be able to stand on my own two feet I\u2019m just having trouble building a good foundation for myself. \n\nI have to pay off 10 k debt on top of my mortgage contributions and I am barely making enough money to pay my phone bill some months let alone anything else. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying anymore... I\u2019m just...overwhelmed. How do I fix my fucking life?",

            "content": "Hi y'all, I couldn't think of a better subreddit to turn to about this than r/adulting so hopefully this is okay, haha;; this is kind of a long post so I'm sorry, it just requires some back story.\n\nSo I'm 22, with a boyfriend of 2.5 years, I have recently decided to go back to college to get my AA (and eventually my BA, but I'm going to community college to start), I'm working on getting a job that will work with my school schedule, and...\n\n... I'm the youngest of three siblings so my mom has decided to baby the living hell out of me for years. My boyfriend and I live in the bottom part of her tri level home, rent free. My mom pays for my health insurance, car insurance, and gas, I take care of our phone bill, my credit cards (been working on building my credit the past couple years with no problems), mostly I take care of our food, outings, etc. So while I'm not too worried about eventually taking on the big bills, here's where things get dicey. \n\nI wouldn't exactly call my mom an alcoholic, but I know whenever she drinks (which happens in phases, she may drop it for a week or two then start again full force) she picks fights with me. The other night it happened again. I went upstairs to show her something cute I bought and somehow it blew up into this massive thing about, somehow, my boyfriend. But the subject is beside the point here, the point is that I'm sick of being afraid of my mother and her drinking. This last time I stood up for myself after being diplomatic didnt work and honestly, I was fully expecting to get slapped or even kicked out. I'm so tired of this endless cycle of her drinking, fighting, then sucking up to the point I'm ready to move out. My siblings have told me to move out since I turned 18 but I've been financially under my moms thumb.\n\nI'm scared for my mental health and well being as well as the security in my place to stay. I have issues with my brainbits that make it hard for me to function sometimes, I know depression and anxiety are a component but in the coming months I'm going to seek treatment and get diagnosed. I've attempted suicide before and while I'm not looking for a way OUT but instead a way out of my parent's (thankfully that's the difference this time versus other times shes pulled stunts like this), I have a bit of another issue with just getting an apartment and moving tf out.\n\nAfter high school I got a dog to be my unofficial ESA. His name is kodiak and he is the dumbest, sweetest creature on the face of the earth. Hes half rottweiler/half goldendoodle. Hes been an amazing emotional support animal, and once I seek treatment I plan on getting him fully established as my ESA from my therapist. But hes an \"aggressive breed\" which blacklists us from 95% of apartments around us. In addition, my boyfriend has a German shepherd of equally good nature. I've heard you can get two dogs registered as ESAs under one name and it removes the ability to discriminate on breed and weight, and while I have no problem vouching that the pup has helped me (I paid for her anyway, shes my boyfriend's in name only), I just don't know what power landlords can have when it comes to ESAs and the ability to find housing.\n\nMy goal is to move out by the end of the year, but my boyfriend thinks we should stay until I've gotten my associates. While I've dealt with my moms possible alcoholism for years, my desire for autonomy is really clashing. While I'm sure I could keep things copacetic enough to be able to stay until then, I really dont want to. I'd rather slowly work on my associates but be free (or face it full force head on while we look for places, then slow down).\n\nHonestly, r/adulting, I just need some advice here.\nA) given the backstory, is moving out wise? I cant change my mom, she refuses to believe alcohol has any affect on her and instead it's all my fault, so there's really no changing her behavior. Shes 63 and stubborn as a mule. My siblings have no leverage here either. So it's either move out or suck it up till I graduate, which should I do? \n\nB) if we decide to move out, what do I do with my dogs? Get both registered as ESAs? Does that even help?\n\nC) regardless of the people around me's opinion of it, I fully plan on utilizing food stamps and my college's support systems for poor students if we need it. Are there any other reliable programs to help support us if we need them? I honestly dont know what's out there besides food stamps, if there even IS anything out there besides food stamps lol\n\nSorry for the long post, but any help is super appreciated.\n\nEDIT: just changed wording on question C \n\n",

Give me some advice on how to get into the habit of making dinner again. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I haven\u2019t cooked lunch or dinner in about six months. It\u2019s been driving me crazy. It\u2019s hard on both our wallets, as well as our bodies. We both work very labor intensive jobs.

            "content": "TLDR: each choice you make will have consequences. It\u2019s better to take time and weigh the outcomes of the choices before making a final decision. \n\nBeing upfront and honest especially about mistakes saves everyone involved time (maybe money as well)\n\nSo today after I saw on a Linkdin that a college classmate is an intern pro scout for the Arizona Coyotes, I relooked at decision I have made in my life\n\nTo fully understand the story we have to go back to grade 11 where I dropped U math (I\u2019m Canadian) because I didn\u2019t like the work I needed to put in (missed a shit load of grade 10 math class). This became the start of my terrible decisions and the reason for me to quit on things\n\nFlash forward; I rushed into University (for business). Thinking of business class was cool in high school I love it. That was not the case. More research would have shown me that. Do to my parents putting an importance of school (both a blessing and a curse) I was terrified to tell them after the first semester I didn\u2019t like it and wanted to leave. So I wasted both their money and my time doing another semester where I dropped 4/6 courses. \n\nThat one year  would have been very different had I done 1 of 2 things: looked into school and realized I hate business or owned my mistake and talked to my parents about hating school after first semester\n\nOver the summer I again I rushed into school. This time I go to school an hour away from my hometown (I go to school in Toronto for sports management). Honestly I am depressed. Having to leave to come back to my school house every Sunday at 7pm it\u2019s a fucking sad thing. Just because I said \u201cI didn\u2019t like my first business program so a 3 year supply chain management program at the same school I did business at (legit 20 minutes from my house) would suck compared to sports management an hour away. \n\nThis is just my school decisions but that I have learned is never ever rush a decision. If you have the option to take time and think about it. (Even an hour is a good amount of time) do it. Had I taken time I wouldn\u2019t have spent a year wasting time and money or being depressed for 3 years as opposed to mediocre for 3 years. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk financially and how IMPORTANT FINANCIAL LITERACY IS\n\nso this started last year where towards the end of the school year I could only pay off part of credit card bill. All through September I knew I would need to work (at my dads factory) during the school year (not a fan of it, as we learned when I dropped grade 11 U math). So first semester goes by with me saying (everything will work out in the end. It always does). Ya it never does. Come winter break where I had to work 2 full weeks of my 4 week break and spent another week for surgery (fuck groin hernia). What was suppose to be a delightful relaxing break turned into the start of hell for me (thanks gambling problem). And it became worse as I replaced and spent $1300 (that I didn\u2019t have and charged in to my credit card bill that will be due in Feb). So now I have the amazing opportunity to work 24 hours at my dads place (every week in Jan then 16 every week starting in Feb until the end of March) and with this work, I also get to do an unpaid 250 hour internship for school this semester (another 20 hours a week at a ski hill) then you get to factor in annoying group work and class. Oh what fun hell is. \n\nSo the importance of financial decision is (at least for me) just because you can spend money on something you think you want (for me it was micro transactions is video games) doesn\u2019t mean you should. 100% you are better off waiting some time to decide it it\u2019s the best idea. \n\nSo the importance of decision making. Take time to consider the positive of decision of the choices. Whatever choice you make will have an impact on your life, mostly likely one of the choices will be more negative than the other choice. \n\nAs for the importance of owning your mistakes. It\u2019s much better to be up front and honest and admit your mistake than you wait until it is forced out. You will save everyone involved time (and money)\n\n\nFeel free to add the time I completely destroyed a great friendship of mine over jealousy on here to my list of regrets (I have). It started after my baseball game and she texted me about her new boyfriend (me being impulsive and irrational) replied with an offensive term (slut)! She got mad told me not to talk to her again. I waited a week. Her still being mad I dug the whole even deeper by being a huge not ok douche (I lied about being terminally ill) which work until I felt bad and came clean a week later. Making a small hole a larger hole. Then I did more stuff such as harass her (luckily she never pressed charges. Thank god!) and make this now large hole into a fucking colossal pit. (Btw this was when I was in grade 10, I\u2019m now 4 year of college or 22 in 2019). I message her last year as I do every quarter to try and make admen\u2019s she responded with \u201cme being a complete psychopath and lying to her about everything. \n\n\nSo if we chalk that friend situation on the decision making board. Waiting after my ball game before deciding how to respond to her texting me about her new bf would have definitely saved our friendship instead I made my decision immediately and have been paying the consequences of it ever since\n",

I have a lease that is titled \"At Will Room Agreement\" and it states that I must stay for an initial period of 6 months and then it is month-to-month from there. The 6 months will be over on June 1. Rent is $725 and I can't really afford that even with a job (currently no job)\n\nI got an offer from a good friend to move in as his roommate in march, because his roommate is leaving by march 1. I would be paying only $475 a month there! I have spent a lot of time at his place and I think it would be a much better fit. I'd have my own room, there is a kitchen with a dishwasher, the walls are much more soundproof, and I know some of the other people on his floor. I feel comfortable there, whereas here I am very afraid of my neighbors to the point it is terrifying to walk from my door to my car.\n\nI need to break my lease here. But I don't know what the consequences of that would be. I did not pay a deposit, only first and last months rent. Currently my plan is to pay February's rent before February 1 and include a signed note saying I cannot afford to continue living here and march will be my last month and I will return my keys as soon as I have vacated the unit (before the end of march). If I do this can they evict me? I worry they would claim I didn't pay the rent. Should I use a certified check to pay the rent for February? Can they charge me a fine even though I did not have a deposit?\n\nIf these questions would be better answered in a different subreddit let me know! Thank you!

I want to do it, but I'm thinking of my family. Most of my family has expressed how they want me to enjoy life and have told me that they didn't really want me to get married right after college. However, they all said they would support me as long as I was doing things that I truly wanted. There's a huge part of me that wants to start this life with my boyfriend, and I really mean that, but I also realize that there comes goodbyes and major changes in my life that I can't believe I have made it to. I want the adulting life, but why does it come with so many emotions? I just don't want to disappoint anyone and I know that I tend to overthink and care too much and cater to others. I guess the biggest question in my head is do I take this leap of faith, or do I do the safe thing and wait it out? ",

It kept going, stopped being an internship, and turned into my first full-time job.\n\nI'm ready to leave. The commute stinks and I've had a switch in bosses to someone who has even admitted that she is not \"cut out to be a manager.\" She's nice, but I can't say I totally disagree.\n\nI have been looking at openings in a very non-serious way for months, if not longer just so that I have an eye on what kind of options I might have. My hesitation has been (1) the fact that my resume needs work, (2) the fact that I feel like I'm always in the middle of something at work and (3) probably just some normal levels of nervousness, I guess.\n\nLast month I saw a position that sounded really exciting, and the thought of it kicked me into gear. The thought of applying to it then-and-there made me feel like my resume needed to be worked on ASAP. My resume was not something that I would have been proud enough to send off for a job that I wanted. I made an appointment with my alma mater's career center and they were a huge help in going through what would make my resume stronger. Basically, I have to recreate it. But it's okay! *When I see a job I want, I want to give them the resume that suits.*\n\nSo, I'm working on fixing my resume now. When that's ready, I guess I'll get to the ever-important step of applying to things! But my big concern is that there are protocols I should follow at work through this process and up until my last day, when that day comes. I haven't told a soul at work. There are like two people I *would* tell, but I really don't want to create and chatter or concern until I'm ready to give them some notice.\n\nSo... is there anything I should know about the process of leaving/starting something new? I know I need to get over the whole excuse of \"well, I'm in the middle of something at work right now,\" because I guess that will never *not* be true. \n\nThanks so much!",

I'm dawning on an opportunity to potentially get a place of my own but I've been under their roof for so long, I don't think I'll survive by myself.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I'm tired of this lifestyle, but I'm also afraid to leave it. Have anyone ever been in my shoes before? And is there any advice you can give me?\n\nP.S. Since I don't know how to drive, alot of my food would be takeout. Hence, why I'm so afraid of being on my own.",

            "content": "I am 25 years old turning 26 in July and I have always heard that I will be taken off my parent's insurance once I reach 26. I just moved to a new city to live on my own last year and I'm trying to figure things out for myself.\n\nCurrently, I'm scrambling to book my own doctor and dentist appointments to take care of my hernias and wisdom teeth before my parents' insurance runs out. Luckily, I was able to use Aetna's website to find doctors that are covered by them. But now I'm hearing all these words like PPO, HMO, deductibles, and premiums and I am utterly lost.\n\nWhat the hell is insurance anyway? To be honest, I only have a vague idea about how insurance really works and with all this back and forth about Universal Healthcare (or lack thereof) I really have no clue what the policies of this administration mean for me.\n\nCan I even get insurance? Where do I start?\n\nI know that sometimes you can get insurance via your work, but I work a non-traditional job. I work in film/tv in LA, and some jobs last a few days, while some last a few months (my last job was 7 months!). Often times, I'm unemployed. I keep getting mailers about health insurance when I work, but I just don't know what to do with them. Here in LA, the industry is run by about 3 different payroll companies and I get my checks from each of them depending on which payroll the studio is running. So, technically I don't even know who the hell I work for.\n\nIf you guys can help an aspiring adult with your knowledge on how the hell I should tackle this or point me to a place that I can call and get a consultation about my situation, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nThanks.",

I\u2019m a F, 19yo that thought she had a deviated septum for the longest time. Come to find out I just have very large adenoids that never shrunk and my nose just grew abnormally. I wish it was more normal for parents to accept the fact that their child has something wrong with them; my mother never wanted to admit it. The surgery will consist of two procedures where they will cauterize my adenoids as well as suction out everything that\u2019s \u2018clogging\u2019 up my turbinates.

My body creates so much mucus I\u2019m always sniffling. It also causes ear problems constantly, right now it\u2019s pretty bad & I\u2019ve cried myself to sleep some nights because I seriously feel deaf. This has been my whole life. But the good news is that we scheduled my surgery for April 12th!! It\u2019s going to be one of the best days of my life, I just know it. My nose isn\u2019t perfectly aligned and is slightly crooked so that led me to believe I had a deviated septum. Since that\u2019s not the case I just have to learn to love my nose the way it grew ;p Much love to all of you, I am so happy, thank you for letting me express my excitement. ",

I have always been the \"fav\"grandchild because over the years I am the only one that calls or visits I have a lot of cousins and siblings. Grandparents moved to the other side of the country and the older I got the less time I've had to do anything. \n\nMy grandmother is very sick and was given 1 month to live about a year ago. She has Alzheimers and gets angry and doesn't know who anyone is anymore. Of course I love her. But I can't lie and say I don't want to be a little selfish either and not go visit. (Feel like I can be honest on the internet)\n\nI have had a few different consulting jobs over the past 10 years and haven't gotten ANY time off. Watching friends go on amazing trips Ive always been jealous and its running joke how I never have time off. I finally have a FT job and am about to take my first vaca with my fiance soon which is a pre-honeymoon and we are planning to get married in OCT this year so I'd need a few days then too (we haven't made it official so I can't really tell anyone). (I have seriously never had a single vacation in my life so this was a big deal for me) - My company gives me two weeks of vaca time and Im so burned out and exhausted for never having more than a 3 day weekend in forever. My fiance was livid when I mentioned that I may not have enough PTO to do our trip this year because every year I never have time off with my types of jobs and money is tight. We've been together 8 years and haven't even gone away for the weekend. \n\nI knew I'd have to take time off for my grandmother once she passes and to take time to help with getting the house across the country sold and getting my grandfather set up. So when my mom reached out to me saying to take off a few days I kinda freaked. I don't know how to say no, I don't want to go but I feel like a selfish ass. \n\nNo one guilts my siblings or cousins about not visiting and im not even the oldest. Yet Im being guilted big time. Is it so horrible if I don't go? \n\nMaybe Im writing this because I need someone to be mean and call me out and tell me to suck it up or something but right now im torn because im not even a year into a new job and Im having a mental breakdown with not having a break. Visiting her is NOT a break. Its cleaning the house and cooking and to be honest, my mom doesn't work so she has the time to do this. I know family should come first, but she doesnt remember me. \n\nIdk does anyone have any advice. I know im being selfish but I guess just hearing from anyone would help. I asked a friend who told me to go, but this friend has also taken 4 weeks of vaca every year for many years and has no idea the level of burn out I feel. I've been messing up at work im so tired.

Most of the time, is about my mom and how we treat eachother.\n\nI'm an adult, I take responsability of everything I do and try to be as independent as possible. I decided to work last year because of this, so I could give myself all my needs without asking for it, but last month droped my job because it was slowing down my career and not paying enought to start living by myself.\n\nMy mom... let's say she's responsible, but doesn't think or worry too much about things unless they're extremely important or has anything to do about her. She tries to help or do some chores, but many times she messes up or do things without thinking trough them and ends up angry, frustrated and agitated, and because of that starts acting like nobody exists except her and doing everything fast and blaming everyone for not helping her.\n\nAlso, my house is pretty small and my room is tiny. I'm used to that but whenever I sit or lay in my room to relax she just goes straight in without saying anything (I usually leave my door open), and stays there just watching me, until she makes up ANY question that comes up to her mind even if it don't make any sense, or comes by just to offer something. This happens every hour or half an hour as long as I'm in my room. My brother does exactly the same thing but just peeks, says nothing and goes away.\n\nShe also asks a lot about my life and my brother's life. Asking everyday 'What are your plans tomorrow? How are your classes going? Do you have to study? Do you have any exams soon?' Or when I go to hang out with my friend she's always asking who was I meeting, what I was doing, etc. Also she usually bring up questions about things that feel more like a critic to me and my image, like why I'm wearing a certain clothe or why I don't shave (I love my beard btw).\n\nI also feel sick when I'm home, I can't focus on anywhing other than playing a game or watching a video. I feel fatigue all day long, and some days I get migraines or shortness of breath like I had a strong alergy. I oversleep a lot even if I don't want to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel stalked, I have 0 privacy in my own home. I don't even dare to act like this with her, I respect her and she doesn't respect me. Is this wrong? She has the right to be this way just because she is my mom? \n\nI don't know how to talk to her about it. I alredy talked with her some times before and she stops stalking for a week and then starts being the same all over again. I need my space, but I don't have money or time to live by myself and do a career at the same time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "content": "I hope I am posting in the right subreddit, haha. If not, I would be happy to post in a more relevant setting, recommendations always appreciated as always! My very second post ever, lool. \n\nSo yeah, a couple of things have recently started bothering me about Elle Woods. I first watched the movie when I was like... 13-14? At the time, I didn't understand a lot of the sexual innuendos given that I was living in a very conservative country at the time. Then I rewatched it over a decade later at the age of 26 in 2016 when I was studying for some standardized exams, in an effort to gain some inspiration actually - and I did, kind of! I particularly love the colours pink and purple so it was nice to see that it's totally fine to take notes in a bright pen if that's your thing!\n\nBut let's dig deeper: honestly, we really don't have to dig that deep at all - anyone with half a brain should be able to see that, Elle Woods is literally SWIMMING in privilege. First of all, she is gorgeous: blonde and blue eyed, not to mention slim. And secondly, consider her socioeconomic status: she clearly is from the upper crust and the only adversity that she ever faces (if it can be considered an adversity at all) is her own choices. I am not saying that she isn't smart... but she had the privilege of hunkering down and studying for her LSAT because she didn't have to worry about a job or helping her family make ends meet. Her only \"adversity\" was just not partying for a few months - whoop de doo, we should all be so lucky.\n\nSame when she goes to college. I am surprised no one brings up the fact that the first thing she buys in college is a fucking Apple laptop! Those are expensive! I work full time as does my partner and there is no way I can just decide on a whim to go buy one! And why doesn't anyone mention that once she IS taking classes, she has the luxury of not having to work to support herself and all she needs to do is simply stay in her luxurious dorm room and study - she has a freaking STAIRMASTER in her dorm, for crissakes - and again, those things are expensive! I still can't afford one without hearing the wrath of my husband who will remind me that we still have car payments to make. Oh, and getting her hair done while studying. Sigh.\n\nI recently started thinking about this even more now that Kylie Jenner is the world's \"first self made billionaire.\" While it's undeniable that the young lady has made an extremely big name for herself and no doubt is an excellent marketer knowing how to cater to literally millions of people out there who are clearly interested in her product, she isn't fucking self-made in the slightest. Why aren't other people her age raking in billions? Because they don't have the family name, nor the big bucks, nor the privilege that will give them even 1/10th of what she has achieved. Privilege begets privilege indeed.\n\nI honestly don't find Elle Woods all that inspiring anymore. While I definitely still enjoy the movie whenever I see it and continues to remain one of my favourite movies, I look at it more as something to shut my brain off after a long tiring day, as opposed to viewing it as some kind of life changing epiphany inspirational moment that many people view it as And as I am going to be 30 soon, I have started taking shit a LOT more seriously now! I look at people who are going to be 50 soon, who are imperishably unhappy... and who refuse to do anything about it! However, it would be mighty difficult for them now to make any kind of significant change in their lives given that they have family to support, bills to pay, etc. So I am trying to ingrain discipline habits in me NOW and do things that will reap awards later so that I don't have to look back to my life twenty years down the road and have regrets\n\nAlthough I suppose I SHOULD say that I DO find Elle Woods' work ethic very inspiring! So I take back what I said in the previous paragraph: I do find Elle Woods inspiring in the sense that, if you want something, don't let anything or anyone stop you! Make a plan, COMMIT to it, and work on it every single day! And don't let anything distract you or get in your way :) And yes, you have to believe in yourself because you are all you have :)\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all the comments, it's awesome getting so much feedback! ALSO, I understand that some people may not find the thread r/adulting not the most relevant thread... I am very new to posting on Reddit despite being an avid reader for the longest time.

            "content": "Hi all. Posting here because I feel pretty lost, and like I need to change some things in my life. I\u2019m graduating from college in May, but I\u2019m feeling extremely unprepared to enter the real world post-college. Here\u2019s a brief description of some areas of my life, to give y\u2019all an idea of where I\u2019m at:\n\n\nAcademic/career\n\nMy undergrad majors are music and theology, with a philosophy minor. I\u2019m considering law as a career path and I\u2019ve applied to several law schools, but at this point it\u2019s unlikely that I\u2019ll start law school right away- based on my GPA and LSAT score I probably won\u2019t be able to get into a great school, or get scholarships (going to law school for close to nothing is my goal, for reasons explained below). It would be much better for me to work for a year, save money, retake the LSAT, and reapply in a year or two. I\u2019m also interested in sacred/liturgical music, as well as music education, and I have some experience in those fields, but I\u2019m not interested in doing more education for that right now. I don\u2019t have a job lined up but I\u2019m working on applications for pre-law positions at legal firms. I should have a job by now, and it\u2019s totally my fault for not being proactive in the job search. This is my top priority atm.\n\n\nFinancial:\n\nI worked throughout high school and college, and spent all of my savings on college tuition (my parents and I split the cost of tuition). I am very anti-debt and wanted to avoid it in college, but between all of my savings and my parents\u2019 contribution I still ended up needing to take student loans. Upon graduation I\u2019ll have about $1500 in savings, and $9K in debt. My parents are willing to buy me a car worth about 5K- which I will definitely need to commute to a job or law school- and then I\u2019ll pay them back once I\u2019m working. They also pay for pretty much everything else for me. \n\n\nFamily/living situation:\n\nSince I\u2019m currently broke and unemployed, I will have to move back home after college. My parents are able to help me out financially and are quite generous, and I\u2019m really grateful for that. However, they\u2019re also classic helicopter parents. Well meaning, but way too involved in my life. They\u2019ve always tried to do things for me that I should do myself, and want to have a say in every aspect of my life. Living at home with them is difficult to say the least... I constantly feel stifled, like I don\u2019t have space to make my own decisions and have my own voice without being openly confrontational towards them, which I never do because I hate confrontation. Part of this is definitely my fault, because I\u2019ve never been that motivated. I know sometimes I need someone pestering me to get me off my butt and start being responsible. But they also \u201chelicopter\u201d my older sister, who is extremely motivated on her own (she left home as soon as she could). I think maybe the whole thing is a vicious cycle: they try to be over-involved and push me to do what they think I should, without letting me fail or succeed for myself, and I end up not getting things done because I\u2019m resentful of being told what to do, and I fail to accomplish what I need to, which leads them to \u201chelicopter\u201d me even more. I\u2019m not making an excuse for my own shortcomings; I know it\u2019s my own fault for being lazy. But the lack of space and independence doesn\u2019t help that; their over-involvement makes it difficult to feel capable of being a responsible adult.\n\n\nSo, the point of all this is that I\u2019m tired of feeling like a child being provided for and directed. And I\u2019m tired of failing myself and not living up to my potential. I want to be independent, financially and otherwise, and not have to have my parents as a safety net for my own lack of drive and motivation. My goal is to move out ASAP, and become self-reliant in all areas of my life. I guess the question I have for y\u2019all is, what are the things I need to do to reach independence? I know getting a job and saving money is the most important thing. But in addition to that, I\u2019m not used to taking care of any adult responsibilities: bills, doctors appointments, insurance, etc. I also have a lousy work ethic, but I really want to change that, and I\u2019ve been trying to. I know this post is a mess (just like me lol). But if anyone has advice, it would be so appreciated. Thanks in advance to all you lovely people.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR- I\u2019m graduating college, and I\u2019m broke, unemployed, and gonna be living with my helicopter parents- largely due to my own lack of motivation and mistakes. I want to become independent and move out ASAP, but I need specific tips for how to do that.",

            "content": "Hey everyone, long time lurker here, finally posting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been trying to adult for some time, probably since I dropped out of school 5 years ago. I don't want to go into why I left college, but ever since then I've been more or less on my own and supporting myself with waitressing. I've lived mostly with roommates, but I've been living with family since the October before last. I'm not comfortable relying on family, even though I pay rent, and I want to move out soon. Ideally, by next fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently got a job outside of the food industry, with a vendor for Amazon. I work in a call center, doing customer service and very basic remote tech support for Amazon members. I enjoy that I get to work with computers and other devices all day, and my workplace has great amenities, like a cafeteria, gym, and showers. My peers are generally nice and I have nothing to complain about management either. I *actually like* my job and the money isn't too bad. I make $15.00/hour, which is enough to rent a room with family, eat, pay car and phone bills, and save money in order to move out (I pay $800/month to my savings account).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce I move out, however, I know my monthly expenses are only going to increase. On top of that, I want to start a business one day. So, I am trying to move over to the IT team where I work; I want to be able to support myself financially and finally be independent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is, I'm a little overwhelmed with the amount of information I have to learn before I'll be ready to apply for the helpdesk job. I was hoping to volunteer with the IT team, and I had the green light from the higher ups until I had a sudden schedule change to graveyard. Now I won't be able to work with them because I'm scheduled from 10pm-9am when they aren't in the building.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, in the mean time, I've been preparing to take the compTIA A+ certification in order to prepare for the job. I watch Professor Messer, Linus Tech Tips, and Tech quickies on youtube. At least every other day, I listen to and taking notes on a few audiobooks: \"A Comprehensive Introduction to Computer Systems and Beyond: A Supplemental Study Guide for the CompTIA A+ Certification Exam\" and \"CompTIA A+ Essentials (220-701) Lecture Series\". I've purchased Professor Messers study guide too, but most of the practice questions are still too advanced for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a fairly good intuitive problem solving ability when I'm troubleshooting, so I know I can get this job and do it well, but I'm not there yet. I have so many questions about the path, but I still feel like its my best bet at making a living wage some time in the near future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, am I doing this right? I haven't seriously studied anything like this since high school. I'm worried that, without a clear plan, I'll burn out and fail. So, what's the best way to study for the compTIA A+ so I actually make some tangible progress? I want to be able to answer Prof. Messers sample questions confidently before I take the exam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do I take the compTIA A+ test anyway? How hard is it really? If you got the certification, did you find that it was worth the $400.00\\~(?) you paid for the exam?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish there we're someone I knew who had these answers, or at least who had these same questions, but there isn't. So, I ask you, reddit, for any advice you may have (eg. if I'm in the wrong sub lol)! Thank you!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; How do I (25f) hold myself accountable to self study for an IT certification? What resources should I be focusing on?",

            "content": "26, recent college grad, living in California, USA. Have been unemployed 3 months since I moved in with my partner and one of my parents. I graduated in December in a field related to Linguistics (called Language Studies, which is like sociolinguistics + ling foundational stuff + cultural studies in a particular regional concentration.) Basically, we moved after being priced out of our college town, and there were hardly any full-time opportunities locally, let alone any that paid enough to live on. \n\nMy work experience involves a couple random internships in disparate fields. Mostly I've held jobs in retail and as a caregiver over the past few years. I'm having a few issues with job searching. \n\nFirst and foremost, I have no idea what the hell keywords I should be using. I am Aspergers and in part I chalk up my inability to think outside the box to Asperger's. It seems like if only I knew what to search for I could find a job that I could at least grow with or lend my skills to.\n\nSecondly, my mom has me convinced that if I take Just Any Job^TM then I'm dooming my chances to find a career, let alone something in my field. I had an interview with Starbucks for a barista position and it's dumb, but when I got a call back from them I was too scared to return their call. It's been a couple days. \n\nA corollary to (2) perhaps, I seem to keep getting pigeonholed for sales associate positions when people see my resume. I do but don't understand it... Is this typical for people who had to work jobs like that to survive during college?\n\nThe way I see it, I have a number of diverse skills, have medical needs and need a job that is either full-time with benefits OR pays me enough so that ACA doesn't bankrupt me each month. I would love to have a career that is in or adjacent to linguistics, but what's happening now is I find myself desperately applying for teller jobs at banks; or to be a receptionist in a doctor's office; or jobs like the barista position I mentioned because I'm desperate not to continually be asking my mother for financial assistance. \n\nIn addition, I have something like $15k or so in student loans. Not terrible, but my 6-month grace period ends in June, and I'm terrified I'll be just as jobless and just as depressed and anxious and socially withdrawn as I am now. It feels like all the job openings I've been looking at make me gag or have no upward mobility, or otherwise are in fields that I have no business working in and make me feel so very out of my depth. \n\nThe more I search for jobs and apply to positions that don't feel or look right, the more I'm feeling hopeless, disgusted with myself, and depressed. The whole thing with my family's \"career advice\" has created a perfect storm of anxiety and not being sure what to believe. I've applied to probably hundreds of openings by now and receiving very few calls back. \n\nMy bank account is overdrawn, I have unpaid bills I need to pay, and I hate asking my parents for financial help. I feel like I'm drowning. I have no idea where to start. My partner is much in the same boat I am, minus having an overdrawn bank account or unpaid bills. I've never lived as an adult in my location, and so I'm feeling socially isolated, too. I feel worthless, helpless, and lost.\n\nHow do I even begin to recover?",

I hate that Im an introvert but when I try to be social, its forced, awkward and just end up wishing I stayed home. I do get lonely and I wish I was in extrovert. \n\nI also just feel like I don't relate to others and just had such a different life that I don't fit in. \n\nMy last job was full of extroverted females. They always invited me out to lunch with them. They were all late 20s early 30s living at home with parents, that paid for school and for them. They travelled everywhere because they could and I just couldn't relate. I was a single 26 yr old with a mortgage to pay and I wasn't trying to just eat out for lunch because I honestly couldn't afford it. I didn't have the help they did. I grew up on welfare and vacations was just not something we did bc we \"deserve\" it.\n\nThey'd invite me out on weekends but again, I was cool with going on a free hike, or just chilling low key at home but I just can't do what they do. They'd complain about how they had no money and it always bugged me because they lived an amazing life, traveling, clubs, drinks, lunches out every day, starbucks coffee, free rent. I legit NEVER travelled because my parents didn't help at all and I had to pay everything myself so I can't relate to them. It sucks because now I feel like a loser with no friends. I remember going out with them for someones birthday and they ordered so much, I always watched the bill bc again, I had a lot of expenses having had to take care of myself since 14 but everyone\n\nI moved jobs and now work alone. I tried reaching out to old friends and coworkers but they always have some excuse. I don't blame anyone because I know I turned everyone down because I couldn't afford to go out. \n\nSInce then. I paid off all my debt, student loans, cars etc. But now Im lonely. I look back and I feel i did the \"right thing\" but i feel like doing the right thing made me unlikeable and with no friends. Im not sure where to go from here. \n\nWhen people say they have no money but live it up and have all the help in the world. i mean honeslty, i paid off my student dept making $15/hr with no help and overtime but when a girl travels the world and complains of high student loan debt when she lives at home for free and is 30 and went to a state school, spends $200/mth for a gym and has starbucks everyday for breakfast and lunch I just can't relate. \n\nI thought there would be more people in my life that were like my life but seems like I am the outlier. No one else I meet is like me and its becoming so hard. I want to have friends but I can't afford this fancy life to afford the social life.

NOT decompressing at all!). But how do I fix this?? What does a normal, healthy adult routine look like? If I Cook and eat healthy for 5-6 days I ALWAYS feel like I need to just relax and end up overeating. How do I live for months and years without doing this to myself? It\u2019s like an addiction and a habit and NEVER ENDING all rolled into one. I just want to eat healthy forever and stop overeating crappy food and feel relaxed and happy still. HOW DO I DO THAT?

Since I can recall, I have never been sure of what my call in life was, like I have no amazing talent or even an interest that sticks out more than anything else. I've always been keen to art and I love cinema, but mostly opinion and analysis, so in 2014 I left my Photography studies and signed up for a Bachelor's Degree in Cinema, Thatre and Dance Studies in my regional university. \n\nSince then, I continously doubt about if that's \"my calling\". Specially, because public university here has many pros but a LOT of cons like horrible hour schedule and worse job opportunities. Also, everyday I doubt more and more if I see myself working in that field. \n\nI studied English as a second language for almost 15 years and I always enjoyed very much. I remember my learning years as fulfilling and interesting ones, also I never had any difficulties in the process. So, I keep regretting myself for not continuing my English studies after school, when I had more energy and more time.\n\nNow, being fed up of doubting and feeling like a failure, I start seeing very concrete the possibility of shifting careers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?

Because of the nature of our relationship, marriage has already been talked about. In fact, she kind of already proposed awhile ago, but it was just between the two of us. So we're not really engaged yet. I finally feel like I'm ready, but she's not quite there, and that's okay with me.\n\nIt's just confusing. Is it okay to get engaged and still be living at home? Should we move in together first? Should we move in while engaged, or completely get married first? Are we just too young? Any advice welcome.

            "content": "Hey everyone, \n\n  \ntl;dr: I'm at my first graduate job where I've been thrown in the deep end and I'm really struggling\n\n  \nI'm not entirely sure if this is the best place to post this but I'm not doing so hot and I'm wondering if anyone has some advice. So I graduated last year and managed to get a really good graduate job, but I'm really struggling with it and I'm really scared I'm going to get fired if I don't manage to get it together. I feel like this job isn't really a 'graduate' job, it's significantly more senior than I could've imagined getting at this stage, to the point that for a few weeks I had someone underneath me who I was in charge of, not officially but I was giving him orders and checking his work etc. Kinda like a supervisor, but I was not an actual supervisor. He was let go recently, a decision that I strongly disagreed with but I didn't really get much of a say. The point I'm trying to get across here is I am essentially a 1 person department, I have a list of responsibilities as tall as me, the amount of things I have to produce and ship out is very high and the deadlines are very tight. I'm not complaining about this, I don't have a problem with working hard, the only trouble is I don't have much in the way of oversight or have anyone to proofread things/give quality control, except for my boss. \n\n  \nMy boss does not like to proofread things, she asks me to send her things to see before they go, but if she finds mistakes she gets very angry. I do ask her to check things for mistakes, but if she finds \\*a\\* mistake, she'll stop looking at it and send it back for everything to be fixed without me necessarily knowing if what she has highlighted is it or if there are other mistakes. This is making me so nervous that I'm reading things 15 - 20 times and obsessing over them which takes forever to do and is causing me to get seriously backlogged. So I find myself caught in this triangle of quality, speed and quantity, and finding the sweet spot really difficult since I'm really being asked to deliver at the extreme of all three.   \nI'm really not sure what to do about this, I've got Grammarly installed on everything to maybe spot some mistakes and and I'm trying to be a lot more deliberate with my writing and what I'm producing but I don't know how to do that and meet my deadlines. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really don't know how to talk to my boss about, well, anything. We had a meeting on Friday where we discussed a bunch of issues, and I feel like I should've been able to stand up for myself during this but I couldn't. For example, she was angry at me for being late to an event we were at despite me being there when she asked me to be, something that she even admitted later. During this meeting, I was trying to answer her questions and give my side of these issues but I just couldn't, and the more I tried the less able to speak I was until I broke down in tears in front of her, which was so embarrassing.   \nOn top of this, my boss has complained about my hygiene which is really stressing me out. I shower once a day minimum, twice a day often, I wear 2 different types of deodorant and I don't spare the horses in applying them. I wash my clothes every weekend and never wear the same clothes for more than 2 days at worst, when I wash my clothes I don't leave them in the washing machine for any length of time, just put them straight on the drying rack. I've never had any complaints before about smell and I haven't noticed anything myself but I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing wrong or what to do differently.  I've bought a new aftershave and a roll-on deodorant to add to the roster. On top of that, I'm going to start mandating 2 showers a day and not wearing any of the same clothes more than once. Do you guys think that is enough?  \n\n\nThis jobs really taking a toll on me, I'm very anxious now, I'm breaking out in spots and rashes all over, I've been having on average 2 panic attacks a week and I keep needing to go to the bathroom to cry.  I find myself obsessing over things at work and developing ticks, I feel scared going into work or when I have to send anything to anyone because I know I'm going to get an earful when there's a mistake I haven't spotted.  I'm trying really hard to do a good job at this place but I'm really scared they're going to let me go or something.  I don't know how to improve or step up what I'm doing to the level that they want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really sorry that this has been a long, rambling mess and if you've read this far I really appreciate it.  If anyone has any words of advice I'd also really appreciate it.",

My dad basically took my car and uses it as his now to get to and from work since no one wants to fix this other car we have. So I don\u2019t really have a vehicle to go anywhere with. Funny I never drive it, but I did this weekend for the first time in weeks & the gas was on E. I never drive it & I fill it up. Go figure. I have a little bit of money I\u2019ve kept safe for a couple of months.. it\u2019s not much just emergency money.\n\nAnyways, at my age there aren\u2019t really any jobs that I could work and make enough to live on my own. It\u2019s mostly like minimum wage jobs & apartments where I live are honestly about $1,200-1,500 a month. I plan on being a full time student when fall comes. Anyways, life is really coming quick. Any tips or advice would be nice. My parents kinda did everything backwards and aren\u2019t the most responsible. I just want to have my stuff together.",

We knoe the rental office is a pretty far bike ride for him but the houses are in town. How do we do the rental process we literally have no idea. The only resources we have is a bit over 1000 dollars (most of which is used for rent and such) a skate board a bike (on my boyfriends end in that town) and what i own. I was thinking sell stuff but idk. Please assist me adults!\n\nTLDR; Im stuck in a city with a crapton of stuff and will be homeless unless i get to my chosen town and I have no clue how to rent a house or how my boyfriend will do a walk through with no car to go to the office.

            "content": "tl;dr: I\u2019m 19 F with a 5 month old baby. My mom is trying to control me and prevent me from moving into low-income housing for single student moms. I think I can do it, and it will be good experience. I need any advice on living alone, and on how to keep my mom from hating/disowning me over this.\n\nHey guys. 19 F here and I am a junior on a scholarship in my town\u2019s university. My child is 5 months old and after she was born, I had an extreme health crisis; I almost passed away and had to get an emergency hysterectomy. I was on medical leave from school, but am now re-registered with no issues regaining my scholarship.\n\nSince I graduated high school at 17, it has been a constant battle living with my mom. She doesn\u2019t want me to work because she wants to just pay for my stuff, which is so sweet and nice, but I want independence and freedom. Not working while pregnant really hurt me though. I had two jobs my first year of college. I saved up enough money to move into a house close to campus, but my mom refused to allow it (despite me being 18) because it was in a bad part of town and she thought I couldn\u2019t handle it financially. Now, my mom has so much financial strain on her from my older sister, grandma, and aunt, so I don\u2019t want me and the baby to contribute any more to that.\n\nThere is a program here in my city for single student moms to apply for low-income housing. They\u2019re really nice apartments that already have appliances, and the rent is all utilities included, minus things like better internet, Netflix, etc. This place offers classes like managing finances, establishing relationships, and they also monitor your grades closely and check how clean your apartment is once every 4 months. There\u2019s an on-site daycare and headstart and even though it\u2019s in a \u201cbad\u201d area of town, police officers patrol the area often to ensure the women and children living there are safe. I am also mutual friends with the owner through my brother-in-law, so that\u2019s always a plus.\n\nI honestly think that I could handle this. I really only need kitchen supplies, and a living room set, but I can ask around my family to see if anyone has anything they don\u2019t want or need. Also, my boyfriend is allowed to live with us if I want him to, which would mean he could help me pay rent and things. Together, we would do even better I believe. I want to prove to my mom that I can be responsible and take care of my child on my own.\n\nWhat are your thoughts based on what I have written? Any advice for moving out as a young mom? I need my moms help with applying because of questions about my current state of living and income, but I am worried she won\u2019t help me because she\u2019s mad; any tips? Thanks in advance!",

            "title": "How to adult when you are too depressed to function",
            "content": "Depression and Anxiety blow major chunks. There is nothing quite like living in a literal hellscape and having your brain try to get all dramatic and start thinking that death is the answer because you haven\u2019t showered in 6 days. This isn\u2019t to make light of mental health issues or poke fun at feeling suicidal. I get it, I do. I was there myself not too long ago. And here are some tricks that worked to get me out of my mental arm pit, and maybe they will help you too.\n\nThe starting point: If you haven\u2019t already visited a mental health professional, start there. They may be able to help you so much more than you know by prescribing medicine to get your hormones back to baseline or find out if you have a vitamin deficiency. If you are too poor, save up and MAKE THIS A PRIORITY. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s so fucking hard. But you battle your own brain every damn day and THAT\u2019S already hard, so how much harder can finding a doctor be? I\u2019m not going to lie. It took TWO YEARS of constant doctors' visits and med adjusting and a hospital stay after trying to take my own life to get my mental health FINALLY back to baseline. It took me advocating for my own mental health and being AGGRESSIVE when a medicine wasn\u2019t working for me and demanding a change. You CAN NOT get most of your life together if you are busy dealing with the adrenaline rushes that being triggered cause, or if you are dealing with past unhealed trauma or PTSD. Things WILL continue to suck unless you take action and get your health fixed. Quit trying to walk on a broken leg. Accept the meds and you can start working on yourself.\u00a0\n\nOnce you have gotten your mental health fixed, or are at least on the path to getting it fixed, the next step is to start managing your body and physical health. Take a cheap ass vitamin D pill every couple of days. Vitamin D helps your body to process your medication, and unless you are outside for a good portion of every day, you are likely low on it. I DO recommend getting a blood test if you want to be sure or start to feel weird. Even vitamins can have side effects in too large of doses, and I am not a fucking doctor, so take my advice with a grain of salt. If you\u2019re a chick, take iron around that time of the month. It will help you feel less tired. If you are wanting to lose weight, take some vitamin B pills, they help boost your metabolism.\u00a0\n\nOne of the KEY things a lot of folk don\u2019t talk about is that your gut flora are a BIG part of your overall health. Learn to like kombucha and drink that instead of soda. (you can do it, you learned to like beer, and coffee, and wine, so you can learn to like this. Brew Dr is a good starting brand that doesn\u2019t taste like vinegar) Take probiotics and prebiotics. Grow your little gut buggies and then NURTURE them. No joke, when I am eating, I imagine a whole osmosis jones thing where my internal gut flora are like \u201cHELL YEAH VEGTABLES\u201d when I eat. It makes choking down an entire raw cucumber instead of a twinkie a bunch easier. You don\u2019t have to get crazy with the eating healthy. Just eat a vegetable that isn\u2019t a potato or corn once a day. Then twice a day and so on and so forth. If you can\u2019t remember the last time you did eat vegetables, then that\u2019s probably one of the contributing factors to you feeling so shit right now. Maybe think about eating less sugar too if you wanna get REAL crazy.\u00a0\n\nDiet advice aside, the whole \u201cwe are what we eat\u201d saying is super true. And yeah, if you\u2019re broke its hard to be anything more than ramen or cold cereal. But one day, one day you will evolve into a warm cereal. Like oatmeal. And then home-made noodles. With vegetables. Because that\u2019s part of growing up.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPart of managing your physical health is moving. I know I know. Every single tom dick and jerry is all like \u201cExercise will make you happy!\u201d Yeah,\u00a0yeah. They are full of shit. Exercise hurts. Running hurts. Even professional runners admit running hurts. Its NORMAL to hate every single second of busting ass at the gym or on a hike or even\u00a0just a walk around the block. It\u2019s the AFTER that you begin to crave once you do it enough. The endorphins, the feel-good rush. The muscle flex in the mirror. Ya know. That good good. I am not a fit person. I have never been a fit person. But I go to the gym several times a week now. I didn\u2019t use to. It took me a MONTH of forcing myself not to sit on the couch and binge tv and go for a run instead. I would CONSTANTLY repeat to myself \u201cThe days I don\u2019t want to are the days I need to most\u201d and then force myself out the door. Even if it was a 10-minute walk, I praised myself like I was a dog learning to potty train. I literally verbally said to myself that I was fucking awesome for getting some walking/running/biking whatever in and that I was doing so good. I was my OWN hype man. I didn\u2019t want to buy a gym membership for a long time, so I just walked my dogs around the block. Don\u2019t have dogs? Volunteer to walk a shelter dog. It will get you and them out of doors, plus it can change both of your lives. Get out of your own head, there are solutions out there to every problem if you look.\u00a0\n\nSometimes all of these things I mentioned are hard, too hard for that day. And I understand. If going for a walk or eating something is hard for you right now, then take a second and BREATHE. You are doing it anyways, and learning to breathe and focus on the breath correctly is a form of mindfulness that helps panic attacks and stressful situations.\u00a0\n\nTake a deep breath in, then breathe out as slowly as you can. Do this 10 times at LEAST. More if you can. Focus on the feeling of your chest rising and falling. See if you can get your breath to whistle out of your nose when you breathe out. Do whatever you need to to, to ONLY focus on breathing. Doing this will calm the fight or flight system that is ringing in your head right now.\u00a0 And then talk to yourself, the same way you would talk to a hurt child. Literally treat yourself as if you were talking to yourself when you were a child. Did you deal with some sort of trauma growing up? Give YOURSELF that love you never received. Tell yourself how much you love you, and that you are strong and smart and cherished. Repeat these 10 times. Give YOURSELF that validation you need that is causing a yawning pit inside of you.\u00a0\n\nYou don\u2019t need anyone else to tell you how much they love you or want you. You only need to tell that to yourself. You love you. You want you.\u00a0\n\nAnd yeah, it feels stupid as shit the first few times you talk to yourself in a loving way. I laughed the first time. And then doing this was able to heal a WHOLE bunch of hurt that I had kept buried down that was preventing me from LIVING my life. If you have specific stuff you need to work on, go to you-tube and look up shadow work meditations. I do these weekly, and they have literally changed my life.\u00a0\n\nTLDR; If you are struggling with self-care, know that you are not alone. It happens. It sucks. But its temporary. These negative emotions have an expiration date, and maybe that date is a few months or even a few years from now, but it WILL end and you WILL get by. And once you feel like YOU again, suddenly being an adult isn\u2019t so daunting after all.\u00a0",

Details below.\n\n\nBasically, I (23F) have to move in a couple weeks for a job and I want to know what is a \"normal\" amount of stuff for me to own. Of course this will differ from person to person but I just need some advice. I'll save my questions for the end.\n\n\nWhen I moved out for college, I was told that anything I didn't bring with me will be thrown away. So, since I was only able to bring with me what would fit in my car, I had to get rid of a ton of stuff. Mostly replaceable, but a bunch of sentimental stuff as well. Throughout college, I replaced the replaceable stuff (household type items) and added some stuff too, mostly kitchen stuff and a bunch of college textbooks and other materials I want to keep. I had an apartment's worth of furniture by the end too. The way I had to move after graduation was unexpected and I once again had to get rid of anything that wouldn't fit in my car. This time it was very hard for me because, well the obvious for sentimental stuff, but also I had no money so I wouldn't be able to replace household/kitchen stuff, or anything for that matter. I guess that's pretty obvious too (I come from an abusive upbringing and have a hard time believing that any of my needs/wants are real, basically). I ended up getting rid of a ton of both sentimental stuff and replaceable stuff. Most of the replaceable stuff hasn't been replaced yet due to lack of money.\n\n\nFast forward to now. I once again have to move and can only take what will fit in my car and anything left behind will be thrown away.\n\n\nThe biggest item I have is a chest freezer (got it after my most recent move, so haven't moved with it yet). I know it fits in my car because I brought it home from the store myself, however it takes out a good 60% of my available space (yes I can and will fill it with stuff, obviously wouldn't leave it empty, but it's still bulky and won't fit much inside).\n\nThanks for listening to my ranty details. I guess my questions are:\n\nFirst of all, is it normal to have to live with an amount of stuff that only fits in a car? I am genuinely asking here because I feel like this sounds really entitled. But, don't most people get a moving truck or at least like a uhaul attachment thing when they move? (Forgot to mention, my move is an 8 hour drive 1 way, so no second trip or anything like that). (Also, shout out to my car. What a trooper)\n\nHow do I get rid of more stuff now? Last time, I got rid of a lot of sentimental stuff (shout out to konmari) because I figured due to lack of funds, it would be better to keep essential items that I can't afford to replace. Now, I have to do it all again. How do I get rid of stuff that I've already decided I can't get rid of? (Also, does this sound entitled? Again, genuinely asking here. Am I just being a greedy American?)\n\nIs this an age-related thing? Is a 23 year old not supposed to own household items? What about furniture? Window curtains?Luckily the place I'm moving into for the next few months is furnished, or else I'd be in shitsville right now.\n\nNot really a question, but I guess just a note that I don't really have the \"typical\" things a \"typical\" female my age has due to all these circumstances. I have 2 pairs of shoes and a pair of flip flops, 1 purse, no makeup except a stick of eyeliner, no hair blow-dryer or other tools, etc. Not really by choice, but I mean pots and pans are more important than this kind of stuff I guess.\n\nWell this got way longer than I intended so I'll stop. Please, any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you!",

I believe leaving was the best decision I could have made for myself. \n\nSo now I\u2019m a 20 y/o unemployed college drop out. I\u2019ve never had a real job before (save for one I had before going to college; I was there for a week before I quit because I felt like I was going to pass out on the job at one point and panicked), but now I need employment fast. I thought I had a job lined up after I left school, but unfortunately, that opportunity fell through. \n\nI want to look into the possibility of working from home because I think one of my mental problems is social anxiety (that\u2019s the reason I felt like I was gonna pass out at my old job), which has been an ongoing problem for me since my teen years, but I\u2019ve never gotten properly treated for it because I guess I was in denial about it. \n\nAnother reason I want to work from home is because I\u2019m supposed to move this summer to somewhere that\u2019s 3 hours away from where I currently live, so if I do end up finding a job here, I\u2019m just gonna have to quit and go through the job searching process again in a few months. \n\nSo, is it even possible for someone without a college education to make decent money by working from home?  Where do you find legit opportunities like that? Do they exist? I\u2019m not opposed to finding a \u201creal job\u201d after I move, but right now, this just seems like the most convenient option.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019d like to make it clear that I view working from home for me personally as a temporary solution until I move. And thankfully I am in a position to where I don\u2019t have to worry about bills or groceries until then.

I'm a freshman in high school (I started school a year early so I'm 14 and will start college at 17) And this question is starting to be more of a, \"come on you should know by now \" type of thing. But what if I end up with a job that I thought I would love but I don't and I end up getting paid pennies and just hate my life because of my job? I don't want to become my parents my mom never went to college and she works as a cashier at a grocery store and my dad went to college but he is a contractor but gets paid awfully and is almost 50 so he is always in so much pain because the labor is too much and he always says how much he hates his job. But he fell in love with it and used to love it when he was younger because he loved to make things and is very creative and artistic. But now he deals with crap customers all day who just try to get discounts by making damages up which cut into his already small percentage. And my parents are divorced but mom is obviously doing the naughty with the 20-year-old bald asshole guy at check out aisle 3.  My parents both always say how they wish they did that or that or blah blah blah \"could have had a better life\".I don't want to make the wrong decision and ruin my whole life. But I'm intersted in being a ASL interpreter so I'm taking ASL classes and I LOVE it soooo much. But as far as I have researched it, it would only be considered a good high paying job if I didnt have any kids because raising a kid on that salary would not work without struggle. But I love kids but it wouldnt work unless i got into a happy marriage with someone who has a successful career but they leaving me or not isn't something that I can rely on my dad thought that my mom and him were perfect together. And also my kid couldnt have any medical problems or then there would be a struggle for money which is sad but true. Also I dont even know if I could be a ASL interpreter because I'm Hard Of Hearing but only a little but it could get worse then I would end up with a useless degree and doomed. I love baking but unless I can manage to open my own bakery which would take years and years I would just be scraping by I feel like.Also I'm intersted in being a mortician because I have no problem seeing dead people or anything and it seems very interesting what I have researched is a not a good salary either. And no one is helpful and just say that I'm a smart kid and I will figure it out but I'm not that smart I just think ahead and like to be prepared for everything this is my one problem trying to adult I bascially have alot of everything down. Like I can cook full on meals, bake, do all the house hold chores, use a debit card, use public transportation (city bus, trains, trolleys, I have been dropped of at the airport plenty of times and been just fine getting on a plenty and making connections and finding terminals in time from the age of 8), Im able to not procrastinate, and i have escaped a kidnapper so far 3 out of 4 times in my life which will be useful because I'm short (5.5 ft), order a pizza, pour that gas thing for the car, Use a first aid kit, i took a week long CPR class so I'm CPR certified, etc.But none of this will matter if I have no career I'm scared I'm just one of those kids who thinks that I have everything figured out but I dont. Also my parents are broke so who even knows there. How do I know/ decide what I want to be? This is my biggest problem with becoming a adult.",

Never asked for a single penny.\n\nThis job across the country is my dream job. I\u2019ve been wanting to work here ever since I entered college.

It takes all but about $150-$200 of my income every month to pay for my necessities (and that\u2019s being on a pretty strict Dave Ramsey cash envelope inspired budget). I totaled out my car last year and am saving up for another cash vehicle because I can\u2019t afford a car note with my shitty credit, so that\u2019s where all of my extra money is going. Another plus for my current job is that it is a 15 minute walk through a pretty chill residential area from house lol. \n\nI\u2019m just having a hard time progressing in the job market, as I live in a fairly small town and have no education and no means to commute right now. Maybe it screams ENTITLED MILLENNIAL but it would be nice to have a job that I\u2019m actually proud of and am fulfilled by.  I\u2019m considering going back to school online (through a reputable college with online education, not one of these degree mills) but I\u2019m not really sure what to study. What I don\u2019t want is to have a degree and more debt under my belt while still having to take the same kind of jobs, you know? I just feel stuck in a rut and am trying to find an alternative to losing 20 lbs and taking up stripping \ud83d\ude43",

            "content": "I'm gonna start my 3rd year of college next month. I'm starting to get worried about my future. \n\nI'm working a Communications Studies Major, but I don't feel like I have any possible job prospects in the future besides minimum wage work or some kind of labor. I'm scared that I'm gonna end up being a burden on my parents in 5 years or so, that I'll just be a drain on their resources. They're both wonderful, incredible, and hardworking people, and I want to pay them back somehow by at least managing to become independent.\n\nFor context - I've only had two jobs before this, they were both internships that I took over two high school summers. One was an office job sort of deal, the other one was doing busywork for the manager of a stadium. Apart from that, I've had terrible luck looking for work, all the applications I've sent out for Winter Break work or a summer job have all gone bust or ended in interviews that didn't get me anywhere.\n\nThankfully, I think I will be able to graduate with okay grades from college, but I'm worried that I won't be able to find a job. I also have a lot of worries on whether if I even find a job, if it will be able to pay for my expenses at all. The most I really want in life is a job that can support me having a cozy little apartment I can share with my boyfriend, a car that works, and just light creature comforts and hobbies, and also, if possible, some money set aside to help my little brother through college. I can't see myself living in something as extravagant as a two story house. But even with such modest aspirations (or at least, that seems modest to me. Thoughts on that?) I'm worried that I won't even be able to hold a life like that together. My parents say that it's okay, that I can take as long as I need to to leave the nest, and that they'll even help me with things like rent money and student loans even after I've moved out, and that's awesome, but I feel guilty accepting that help when they've already worked so hard for me.\n\nThis might seem out of left field, but I've been giving it some thought, and I'm interested in bartending as a career option. It doesn't seem like that difficult of a field to break into, and it seems like the kind of work I'd like, but I could be wrong. My perception of what the job could be like could be totally out of whack. I know you need to be of legal drinking age to be one (it's 21 in where I am, the good old USA) and I know that it also takes a certain talent. Still, it's an idea, and it seems a lot more viable than anything else I've had in mind. \n\nThere is also one small problem I am worried about though, if I'm going to actually pursue this idea, which, if I'm going to, I'll probably attend a bartending school after I graduate. (That seems like the straightforward approach) Basically, the problem is - I don't drink. Like, at all. Total teetotaler. My biggest excuse thus far for it is that I'm just underage. The more true reason though is that I have something of an addictive personality. I'm worried that if I were to start drinking more than just a little, I might accidentally fall into it and develop a problem. So, in a profession where you need to know that you're making good-tasting drinks, wouldn't that be a problem? Wouldn't I need to hone a taste for that kind of thing to be able to work with it properly? If that's the case, I don't think I'd mind giving up not drinking, and I'd probably be able to drink responsibly if I had to start, but I'm still nervous about making that kind of decision. I know that this seems like a trivial issue, but it does matter to me somewhat.\n\nAnyways, all general advice would be appreciated, but if there is anyone who could fill me in better on what a bartender's job is actually like (and if you need a good taste for alcohol) so that I have a more accurate perception of this idea, that'd be a great help.",

I wanted at one point in High School to go for fashion design, but when looking into schools they all wanted SAT scores. I never took my SATs because I have never felt smart enough for it. So I never applied for any of the fashion programs. Instead I went for cosmetology school, had a kid and eventually graduated took half of the licensing test and never went back to take the other half. I didn't want to do old lady perms for the rest of my life.  Then I worked odd jobs, had my second kid then decided I needed to go back to school. For some fucking reason I went to nursing school, never really wanted to get into healthcare but with aging parents I thought it would be practical to do and make some money while doing it (basically, in a nutshell). \n\nNow after working for a decade in healthcare I FUCKING HATE IT! I WANT OUT! \n\nBut I cant leave as I need to be a \\*Responsible Adult\\* and pay bills and shit that I cant afford. But all I want to do is pull my hair out and quit. I've tried different areas of healthcare and every single one I come to hate. But I cant seem to figure out what else I could do and still make about the same amount of money.

I keep feeling like I\u2019m making mistakes and not doing my job well enough, and that it will severely negatively impact my career. \nSo many other aspects of my life are amazing. I have a wonderful support system of family and friends, my partner and I are doing very well, I have my own place and my finances are solid. But so much of that has been clouded by my stress from work.\nI try to remind myself of these things to be grateful for, and to put life into perspective - that it is multifaceted. Out of the different aspects of my life, ultimately my career is not as important to me as my relationships or my health, for example. But I struggle with this on a daily basis, as I regularly feel inadequate at work. \nNot sure how to word this - perhaps if you have a story to share about a rocky beginning to adulthood, a challenging first job, that could provide some perspective?

I work nights, and my brother \u201clives\u201d here (as in every time he has two days off in a row he comes here for a night but pays rent full time). So I decided to hire someone to do the lawn. \n\nFirst guy was the definition of white trash. But for a while was okay. Next guy was unreliable but it was nearing the end of mowing season. So finally I gave up on him and dad and my middle brothers came up and did my lawn. \n\nNow it\u2019s summer again. I posted a searching ad on Facebook. Tons of responses but no one actually came out to give a quote. No one. One day, checking the mail, I found a guy who came and did it. He tried to come back 7 days later but I didn\u2019t have $40 and honestly the yard didn\u2019t need it. He tried to come back 5 days later - still didn\u2019t have it and the yard was barely any higher. \n\nNext week he didn\u2019t contact. I was ready to ask him to do it. So I texted. He comes out Saturday (now nearly two weeks later) and says \u201csince it\u2019s so high it will be double\u201d. I don\u2019t have $80. I don\u2019t want to pay $80. So I said no. \n\nI posted a new ad on Facebook. Again a lot of responses. Thinking the people around here may not ring bells, I told people that I\u2019m a day sleeper (against my better judgement as I\u2019m a woman home alone). \n\nSaturday, a guy comes and rings the bell during the day. Now I\u2019m asleep, sick as a dog, and tired. I told him to take a look at the yard (through the doorbell camera). He cave back, gave a quote, and sleepy me just wanted more sleep. So I asked him to message me on Facebook. He didn\u2019t. \n\nOne lady did reply, said pictures of the yard would work. So I supplied those and she said her son and husband would come yesterday (monday) after 3. I go check the ad to mark it sold. \n\nThe guy from Saturday morning has posted, trash talking me and saying \u201cI think she wants it free\u201d. I made a passive aggressive \u201cI was sick as a dog Saturday, sorry for not replying\u201d to a comment he replied to, and then had a minor panic attack. During this time I\u2019m working and waiting on lawn guy and son to show. \n\n7:30 comes and the sun starts to set. I let my dog out and message wife of lawn guy and ask for an eta so I can close the doggy door. No answer. No show. Nothing. \n\nAt this point I don\u2019t know what to do. My lawn needs to be done desperately before it\u2019s unmanageable entirely. I cannot do it - mostly mental disabilities and the fact that I sleep during the day. I hate being an adult and I really just wanted to vent because I\u2019m stressed out and at a loss. \n\nTL;DR: lawn care is hard, mkay?",

            "content": "I'm a 20F uni student in the UK. Basically, should I rent a place now and move out like I want to, or should I stay with my mum and save like mad for a few years? Sorry this is a bit rambly\n\nFor the last few years, I was in a committed relationship with this girl, and basically spent 80% of my time at her parents' house with her, then the rest of the time at my mum's house up the road. There were MANY times my stress and happiness were chaotic because I didn't feel settled, but due to some stuff in the relationship, I didnt feel able to spend more time at my technical \"home\". Now, I'm with a man (21) who lives across town, and again I split my time fairly equally between houses, but more so at his parents'. This worked okay because I was a lot happier and could cope with the daily travelling, it also got me out the house more.\n\nBut now there's a good chance I'll be getting a full time job alongside my 2 days at uni which will include extremely long shifts, possibly overnights as well. The whole thing is stressing me out to the max because I feel homeless? Like I'm split between 2 houses constantly, and don't have a real emotional/physical base at either house. There's no chance of me having a real routine, and I feel like an outsider wherever I am. Knowing me, with the stress of spending long amounts of time between 4 places (mum, bf, uni classes, work), I'm terrified that I won't cope with all the moving around if I'm split so cleanly in half between the places I \"live\".\n\nI've looked into renting in my town, and could afford it with a full time job, but it won't leave much room to save for a mortgage. I don't really understand the issue with renting a place I like for a few years while saving more slowly, but my older sisters have made me feel like I'm making terrible, stupid and rash decisions. The other option is putting what I'd spent on rent and bills into savings, and then getting a mortgage in a couple of years. It's a toss-up between my immediate happiness and stress, and furthering my adult life down the road. \n\nI feel like renting ASAP would give me the base of operations I need to feel settled and \"regrouped\" each day, and it would also mean my boyfriend could focus on HIS mortgage savings if he stayed with me and paid less than he does at his parents' (we're in this together for the long run, and i intended to afford this with or without him). I'm genuinely not sure how well I'll cope with feeling stressed and unhappy with the current arrangement while work is thrown in too. \n\n(Yes I could easily spend less time at my boyfriend's parents' house, but even when I'm home for the majority of the time, I feel like such an outsider and as if I don't belong simply because it hasn't been my 100% home for my whole young adult life)\n\n(Also yes I will be saving for a mortgage as well as renting, but more slowly than if I wasn't renting) \n\nTldr: I have an extremely messed up routine which is about to get even harder with work, is it sensible for my happiness from renting ASAP to outweigh the investment of working towards a mortgage?",

            "content": "I've been at this adulting thing a while (yes, I'm kinda old), but I've never financed a vehicle. Or furniture. Or anything else. I've never taken out a loan of any kind. Part of me loathes the idea of paying money for a thing and not technically owning it. But, making payments on a car seems a necessity at this point, and I'm confident we can afford it as long as we don't borrow too much.\n\nThe issue I'm having is that the car salesman they've paired us with seems sort of... Not good at his job. But maybe I just don't really know enough about how it all works? Idk, I hope someone here knows. \n\nSo last week my fiance and I went to the dealership to get the ball rolling. Neither of us has done this, and my credit is only decent, so I wasn't really sure how much we'd even qualify for. They take our info and the salesman just HAS to show us a certain car. It's ok, but not wow, and i want to keep looking. Salesman keeps trying to push it. Weird thing is, it's one of the cheapest on the lot. \n\nWe went in a bit late in the afternoon, so we ended up leaving to wait on the bank to get back to them. Salesman says he'll call the next morning. He doesn't, so i wait til the next day and call him. No info yet, he says he'll call later that day. He doesn't. It's the weekend so i wait til Monday. Tell salesman I'll try to make it in Tuesday. He texts me Tuesday and asks if I'm still coming. I say no, i feel like crap (been working 7 days at that point). I ask if they've heard back from the bank. He says yes, we were approved, and that \"Mr. Baker\" called in a favor for us. I have no fucking clue who \"Mr. Baker\" is, or why he's calling in favors on our behalf, or why he would even need to. My credit isn't THAT bad.\n\nAnyway, i was still at work so i said I'd call him later. I call him and he says he doesn't have an amount that we will be able to borrow, but we were approved for a 2016 Jeep, which I've never mentioned nor looked at. I can't even afford it. \n\nNone of this makes sense to me. I thought it would be more like \"based on your credit score and income, you can borrow x amount with x interest rate\". Do they have to put through a specific car on the paperwork or something? I'm so confused and i haven't had time to actually go down there yet. Also, am i just being bitchy about this salesman? I work in customer service, and he's broken several cardinal rules. But are the rules different for a car salesman? Someone send help, I am so stressed.",

But I've now realised that it's time for me to be independent and face the fact that my parents are not always going to have my back. So i went forward and jotted down a list of problems that I'm facing and am hoping for some tips from you about the same.\n\nNote: I'm leaving for uni soon and will be residing in a completely new city. Before this I've haven't even spent more than a week apart from my family and friends.\n\n1) How do I become more responsible? \n\nThe thing is I've not yet come to terms with being an adult. Everytime I decide to learn to do something new like learning to do my own laundry, I end up getting bored and procrastinating a lot. It's just that I'm scared and just not used to doing my work by myself. So what are some good motivational tips and  tricks that can help me keep my head in the game and not let my mind drift back to my normal teenagery thoughts?\n\n2) How do I sort my priorities right?\n\nWhat are the major aspects of living on my own that I should sort out first? So like should I focus more on learning some important money managing skills  or should I focus more on my own security in a strange city? Also what are some basic skills requisite for living on my own?\n\n3) How do I overcome my fear of failing to do the above said things?\n\nThis is a constant pressure on me which also demotivates me from learning a new skill.\n\nTLDR:\nMoving out soon. Have no experience being an adult. What are the basic aspects of adulthood that I should learn first? How do I motivate myself to not quit and give up? How do I overcome the fear of failing?\n\nAnswers to any one of the above questions are also greatly appreciated. Sorry for the very long post.",

I even reached a point where I asked the receptionist if she had any idea what I could do because all of the ones I had called gave me the same thing. All she said was, \"Sorry kid, if you arent in need of a methadone treatment I can't help you.\" Granted I understand theres onle so much someone being put in that position could tell me, I wish she could've given me more. \nAny advice would be super helpful, a lot of the threads I've been digging through so far have been significantly helpful in other problem areas.

In response I said that I was in school, but I don't think that'll fly as well now as it didn't before.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really wish there was some sort of walkthrough for this, but I this is a good first step.",

Yes yes I could get a doctor's note (I actually am clinically diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and used to take meds for it), but my doctor cannot see me for weeks, and you need an appointment to get the letter. The only available appointment is in the morning and I cannot afford to miss work as I do not yet get Paid Time Off. We have found 3 available apartments that will take both pets. The thing is the deposits are so high, idk how we will do this. She has $3,000 in savings, and I have $200. 2 months ago I had way more, but my car got rear-ended by some idiot, his insurance company considered it \"unsafe to drive\", and took it from me with no money for a new one. So my savings went to a new car. I make anywhere from $700-$850 a paycheck every 2 weeks, and do Uber Eats on the side where I make around $125 a week so far. I could work more hours though doing it. The pet deposit is $500, security is $800, and monthly rent is $1,200. I am not too worried about monthly rent, just about getting our deposits and first month. We would both be paying half. I have medical bills, student loans,( I am on income-based repayment so techinally I owe $0 every month, but I like to make payments when I can) and car insurance. I am in panic mode:( How am I going to get enough money within like a month to move??? I cannot let my best friend pay more than her fair share.",

I recently picked up a hobby that\u2019s basically a money sink which doesn\u2019t stand to offer any monetary returns and now that I have income again after some time I\u2019ve already invented a million excuses as to why I should just buy into it.

I am perfectly capable of everything on the daily checklist, but the fact that I am doing everything all by myself is having a negative impact on my mental health. I was welcomed very warmly by the staff and every day I'm told by someone how much I'm appreciated, but everyone outside of work that I've talked to thinks it's ridiculous how much I'm being expected to do all by myself.\n\nI'm also not used to working evening shift (which I wasn't even told it would be until after I was hired) so that's thrown me off quite a bit.\n\nSo I'm quitting. I have never quit a job on my own accord before and I'll admit I'm scared fucking shitless about it. But I have to face the facts that I've put too much pressure on myself with life and I need to back off, plus this job isn't going to work out in the long run when school starts back up (it's an evening shift job and I have school-year activities with evening commitments that I'm just not willing to give up) so it's no use prolonging the inevitable.\n\nI don't plan to just quit and let that be the end of it, though. I am a pre-vet student always looking for learning opportunities so I'm going to ask if it's possible for me to come back to the hospital on occasion for observation. I don't want to leave on bad terms at all.\n\nAnd before anyone asks, financially I'll be fine. I'm nannying a few weeks out of the summer, I picked up a shift at my old job, and I have an Etsy shop. Plus I have a job that runs through the school year that'll start up again in late August/early September. My boyfriend (who I live with) is job hunting as well so we'll survive.

            "content": "There's a lot that goes into this, and I (F 19) really just don't know what to do any more. A tragic family event happened last year that left me basically homeless and with some pretty severe PTSD. I missed my last week of high school, my two graduations, my summer job, lost out on the opportunity of going to college, and probably the biggest hitter was I lost my grandpa who was a father figure to me for 15 years of my life, and my cousin both at the same time. Everything would of been okay if I didn't get kicked out by my abusive grandmother (grandfather's wife) who had custody of me. (Event happened 5-10-2018 - got kicked out after I turned 18 on the 12th of may). \n\nMy GF let me move in with her a few weeks later, but she was still living with her parents. Between grieving my grandfather, losing everything, the trauma, and my whole life falling apart I fell into one of the worst depressions I've ever been in. 3 months later and my state getting worse I ended things with her, packed a few trashbags and bounced from place to place. My grandmother opened her house back up to me but I wasn't able to handle the abusive tendencies coming back, so I gathered my stuff up once more after reaching out to the only person I really had left.\n\nIn November of 2018 My brother (21) offered me a place to stay in Pennsylvania which was where I was born and was put into foster care before I got placed in Ohio. With options short I took the chance packed up my car and took the 9 hour drive from Ohio to his house in PA. I arrived 2 days before Thanksgiving. I instantly was wondering if I made the right choice. It was a small studio apartment (him and his gf lived in). Not clean, mouse crap everywhere, just not a clean and healthy place, also in a very very bad area crime rate wise. Keep in mind I lived in a small farming town and I moved to an area with a county population of 1.1 million. While I tried to relax and keep in mind I can build myself up and make a home for myself if I work hard small things started showing through.\n\nI started talking to a guy on tinder and we hit it off, he was sweet and we had a lot of good times together. I don't like saying we got serious fast, but we got serious fast. Within 3 weeks I was staying at his house and his moms house more than I was at my brothers apartment. This started causing issues between my brother and I. I figured out he was back on cocaine and lost his job, and his license. I gave him over $1500 because they were about to lost the apartment which I still haven't seen a penny back of after momths and months of different plans. Tensions were constantly on the rise and it ended up to the point where I was only there once a week. I packed my shit up once more and left and moved in with my BF and his mom temporarily. About 3 weeks later after getting a job and his mom agreeing to be a co-signer I got my first studio apartment at the end of March.\n\nI was thrilled. Even though I needed a cosigner I was self completely self sufficient and I have a home for the next year, things started to really look up, I was genuinely happy.\nFast forward to a few weeks ago. Things are taking a turn for the worst again. My brother is severely addicted again. Got held at gunpoint and called me right after. I can't get how shakey his voice was out of my head, (which is screwing with my ptsd and nightmares) and is actively destroying his relationship and it's falling back on me. They're asking for month long stays which I can't risk because their names aren't on the lease. \nOut of pure frustration I went off on my brother. Nothing crazy was said, just that I was at a loss and with everything going on I can't mentally handle everything as bad as I felt.. and I blocked him. He sent me a text (one thing I forgot to block him on) essentially telling me \"Wish I never bought you out here\" telling me that if anything happens to my \"Fa**ot worthless boyfriend not to come crawling back\" because I spit in his face and I'm the most inconsiderate heartless person he's ever met.\n\nI'm working 40 hrs full time a week as an IT contractor with no option for over time and people keep getting cut off left and right and I have no idea if I'm next. I've been applying to places with no word back except one job that would leave me off worse. I live paycheck to paycheck and have virtually no money to fall back on. I just got food poisoning or something last week.. but it turned into some insane chest pains and tightness the next day. It felt like I was being stabbed in the chest and I could barely get a 3rd of a normal breath in. I had no insurance and thought I was completely out of luck I kept getting turned away. My boyfriend's mom took me to a charity ER and after an ecg, chest xray, blood tests, and other lab tests everything came back fine and they told me it's just anxiety. They offered me a shot for it but i turned it down, I just wanted to go home and sleep. \n\nI've had major depressive episodes and a history of mental health issues but never really thought it was that bad. I need to get back into therapy but with no insurance it's making it impossible. I contacted the Children and Youth for the county I was a foster kid through (I live in the county next to it currently) but no one is returning my calls, and I can't miss work but my work hours are the only days they are open. I figured they would be able to give me guidance or help me out because I should qualify for some sort of state insurance or assistance or something. So that's one thing on my plate right now, this large bill I'm going to have if i can't get this figured out.\n\nMy boyfriend is going to college over 3 hours away mid August, and that is also starting to really hit me. I got attached very fast which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I have 0 friends. I know absolutely no one in this area or know how to go about making friends in ways that doesn't cost.. again I'm broke. \n\nI'm already struggling with the idea of not having him around that much any more.. he's really been my rock the past 7 months. I cannot give that man enough credit for all he has done for me. I've never loved anyone as much as I love him. I try to keep in mind he has friends and a social life and is trying to get time in with his friends and family and work before he goes but I'm very lonely and very worried about how I'm going to handle not having him around.. or if him and I will even be able to keep this relationship going and healthy with him being so far away. That, and the fact that when he goes to college I have absolutely no one again and I don't want to feel that again.\n\nMy future is just starting to look really bad again and I need help with figuring something out in the next 2 months, or I really don't know what I'm going to do or how I'm going to handle this. I'm so so fucking sad and lost, and all of what I'm going on about now isn't even the half of it. I'm tired of beind sad and depressed, but I can't escape it any more.",

            "content": "Hi reddit. First time posting on this subreddit, and looking for some advice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm 19F (soon-to-be 20) and seriously considering the idea of moving in to an apartment with my boyfriend (20M) of almost 2 years, along with two of his friends. I have talked to him about moving in together with his sister a few months ago, but neither one of us has brought up the idea since then. A week or two ago, my boyfriend's close friend brought up the idea of them getting an apartment along with another friend. I discussed it with my boyfriend directly, and he and I think that it would be good for both of us to move in together and finally evolve into more responsible adults. To provide a little background on the both of us; at the moment, we both still live with our parents. We both have been living in mentally/emotionally/verbally abusive households for a majority of our lives. His parents are divorced, so he has lived with his mom since then. She is extremely unreasonable and refuses to listen to anything he says. Because he doesn't have any idea as to what career or college classes he wants to pursue, she is forcing him out of her house. At the moment, he doesn't have a job, but he is actively looking and applying for jobs to speed up the move-out process. My mother is an alcoholic and has BPD (Bipolar Personality Disorder). In terms of personality and actions, she is very similar to my boyfriend's mom (unreasonable, set in her ways, only listens to herself, always gets what she wants, etc.). I was brought up in a Christian-oriented household, but, with my mom being a terrible example, I'm really not that religious. I wouldn't say I'm Ex-Christian, but I also can't say that I'm an avid follower. Her and I have major communication issues, and denounces my attempts in becoming more adult-like and saying that I'm \"too young\" and I have my whole life ahead of me and I have no idea what I'm talking about. I'm the youngest and the only girl in my family, so it feels as though my mom won't \"allow\" me to become an adult and still treat me like a baby. My parents do not know about my boyfriend, either. It's complicated... I have an okay paying grocery store job and can ask for more hours if needed, so I have a pretty steady source of income. I will be applying for company insurance very soon, so I'll have that, as well. \n\n(Sorry for the long intro) I'm very new to the idea of moving out and finally being independent from my family, so I'm a little lost. Most of my friends haven't moved out from their childhood homes either, so I can't ask them for help. I've tried asking my siblings, but they completely ignore how I feel living at home and tell me that I have to \"hang on a little longer.\" I'm tired of waiting and I want to get my life started. \n\nWhat are the most basic essentials I need to aquire in order to qualify for renting an apartment? How do I explain to either one of my parents that I'm (possibly) moving soon and I don't want anyone to stop me? How do I convince everyone I'm capable enough to take care of myself and finally be a damn adult?\n\nHELP!",

This is a trailer but it isn't the park's doing. They are lenient on lot rent and said we could figure out the mortgage first before calling them with a plan to pay the backed up lot rent, so this is definitely the mortgage company that just yesterday gave us until the end of the month. Now I know there was prior talk of eviction before I moved in but that is why we called yesterday. Is this a clerical error between the mortgage and the court? Did a communication that they wanted to give us an extension not happen?

It's bad especially since no one else in my family is in no hurry to teach me how to drive. I just learned there are things about renting an apartment that I didn't know was a thing. And then when I ask my parents about it, they're just like 'oh don't worry about that now. Wait until you graduate and then we'll talk' which is not comforting at all. I am NOT living with my parents because I have no future in the town they live in. I graduate at the end of the fall semester provide all my classes go well. Chances are since I'm way too dependent on my family on too many things, I highly doubt they will ever even approach me about renting any kind of place anytime soon even when I do graduate. I do not know the first thing about taxes. Like what the hell do I do for that? I'm not a child anymore and yet, my parents seem to still think I am one. I'm sick of it and I want out of this cycle of 'grow the hell up' and 'don't worry about it now'.\n\n  \n1. I decided to come here to ask about rent since my family seems to evade that topic so much and I cannot look it up without having to sort through ads for apartments and stuff. My cousin said something about making certain kinds of payments when first renting a place that I had no idea existed. I don't even think my family plans on letting me rent if they can help it. I hate it that they seem to want me to depend on them and yet tell me to grow up.  Damn bunch of hypocrites they are.  \n\n\n2. if my parents actually do decide to teach me how to drive, I will probably own a car although my family will probably pay for my first one. Is there anything about that I should know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Any advice on budgeting? I am a college student that will soon be graduating and while I'm not in nearly as much debt as most students since my dad is a retired veteran and I did get benefits from that, I will still have some loans to pay off. Also, is there anything about paying off loans that I should know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Taxes... I know this is going to sound stupid but what are they even? I'm not even sure where to begin with this.

(yes I did go to the ER after trying to get help at a walk in clinic which did not have the right resources to see me for severe back pain but I know that bill is probably huge)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Any additional information I should know, please tell me. I live in North Dakota, I go to school at Minot State University, I'll have a bachelor's degree in art with a minor in humanities and a concentration in social media. I want to be an artist but we all know that that will not pay the bills when I graduate unless some miracle happens. And ceramics is not a cheap media. I have been looking into artist residencies though. But I need to find some stability before pursuing my art first.",

I am really depressed right now because my ex and I were seeing each other again and now he is going away and I will be alone again. I dont have friends ti hang out with often. He was my only consistent person I had besides my family. So now I'm trying to prepare for the upcoming loneliness by trying to decide what to do about my dog wants. My parents hate pets. I have had a parakeet, fish, and hamsters, but they all bored me and I hated having to have them locked in cages as I thought it was cruel. \n\nMy parents helped me come up with a budget. I'm not paying rent here. So that is a plus.  If I move out in October I could save $8,000 in 2 years. \nIf I moved out in 2 years, that number could be $41,000. But then that's 2 years of my adult life gone. 2 years of no sex whenever, 2 years of having a curfew, 2 more years of driving 40 mins to work every day because my parents live far from my job. Heres my options which one should I pick?\n\n\nOption 1: move out within a few months into an apartment, get a doggo, live my adult life\n\nOption 2: stay with parents for 2 more years to save up for a house down payment, get a house, then move out and get a doggo. \n\nObviously option 2 is better financially but with option 1, I have a chance to live my life to its fullest sooner and what if I die in 2 years and never got to have a dog because was trying to wait!? Wow that would suck. Also I get scared of option 2 because what if I meet a guy that I want to marry and I have a house and he put in no effort to earn it like I did.. you know? I kinda feel like getting a house is more of a couples thing but I don't know. What do you guys think? Or is there another mind of pet I can get for now to kill this baby fever?

We\u2019ve had the same cleaning lady for about a year and she comes from a company (it\u2019s really just one guy who has cleaning ladies he hires out). At first she did a great job but slowly over time the cleaning has been getting much less thorough. Now she doesn\u2019t dust smaller things (only large surfaces, nothing on top like lamps, decorative items, etc.), will totally miss some areas (like dusting our bay window, wiping down the coffee table, etc.) and she doesn\u2019t seem to vacuum our rugs any more (we have wood floors and carpet on the stairs which she vacuums but she stopped doing the two area rugs). I\u2019m nervous to mention these things. My husband (who has no problem with it because he grew up with house servants) did tell her boss but nothing has come of it. We\u2019ve had other cleaning ladies from the same guy a few times and they all forgot to do different (normal cleaning) things, so maybe it\u2019s just normal? \n\nAlso, I have trouble asking her to do things at a certain order of time too. Like, for example, I asked if she could pause cleaning one room and clean another because I had to leave and had to let the dogs in the house before I left, and they needed to go in the room she hadn\u2019t cleaned yet (and she won\u2019t go in the room with the dogs inside). She said she was almost done with the kitchen and was doing the dog room next and then she was done with the house (although I noticed other things like the rugs, etc. weren\u2019t done yet) so I said OK and waited. 20 minutes later I asked her again if she could pause with the kitchen and do the dog room because I was getting late and it would make me late for everything today if I started out late. She again she\u2019ll finish the kitchen and clean the dog room. About 10 minutes later she finished the kitchen and started on the dog room. She doesn\u2019t do anything g but the floor in there (although it\u2019s actually our family room and she\u2019s supposed to clean it like a normal room) so it takes less than 10 minutes to do. But I was 20 minutes late because she wouldn\u2019t do what I asked. \n\nI\u2019m really bad at being a boss I think, and I\u2019m uncomfortable with the status inequality I think which makes me not want to tell her what to do. I was a nanny for 10 years so I understand how people treat you when they think they\u2019re above you because of your job or because you work for them in their home, and I don\u2019t want to act like those people.",

Ever since this started I\u2019ve been averaging 3-5 hours a night. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for medical advice. Im doing the best I can to navigate our broken fucking healthcare system but you know.. it\u2019s killing people and that scares me. I spend most of the day in my bed in pain. Sometimes I try to move my legs and they just won\u2019t move. I\u2019m getting the treatment they\u2019re willing to give me and it isn\u2019t much.\n\nI know this is a really broad question but what are small, manageable things I can do to work towards a better quality of life for myself? Learning to navigate the adult world is hard enough as it is, but becoming disabled out of nowhere/as the result of something really traumatic is really throwing me. I\u2019ve been really depressed about it lately and figured I could maybe get some more tangible advice here.\n\nTLDR: I was assaulted this spring and as a result am now chronically ill and physically disabled. I\u2019m a college student and already acutely aware of the fact that I\u2019m navigating a whole new world I don\u2019t know shit about. What are some small, tangible ways for me to ensure my net quality of life is improved? I know it\u2019s like chipping away at a stone wall but I\u2019d appreciate any wisdom, however small.",

            "content": "I'm a 27 year old single woman who works full time at a stable career, owns a home with a yard, a car and a back-up vehicle, all being used vehicles/a relatively fixer upper status home/etc. (I'm not rich). Though I've earned these things myself over the years and own nothing really fancy, I realize how lucky I am and that I am \"adulting\" on some level here. \n\nBut now the reality of maintaining these things is becoming overwhelming as I am alone, petite (and weak, honestly), and unskilled in home or car repairs in particular. I make to-do lists to try to  see all of what needs done, but it's becoming a really long and expensive list and a lot of projects feel out of my league. I do make attempts at tackling some tasks like yard work and small home projects, but often I am left spending forever trying to figure out how to complete something I've never done or being physically challenged (or downright unable) to do something due to my stature/lacking strength. \n\nSome things I realize I will have to pay for, like the dead tree hanging over my house that needs cut away, and I guess I should just accept that I may need to pay to have more of these things done for me, but I'm kind of stubborn and was raised in a do-it-yourself way, and more importantly I don't have endless money to pay for projects that I think I should be able to do myself with some instructions and research (Installing a fence, for example). \n\nI'm making this post now because my daily driver vehicle is kicking the bucket without some pretty immediate intense repairs, and they are the kind of jobs that will be very expensive if I take it to a garage, I'm talking not even worth keeping the vehicle expensive. At this juncture I'll probably try to replace it and accept the loss, but it's killing me that with the know-how and time I could probably save the vehicle. There are just too many jobs to do and the time it would take to learn to do everything from scratch seems impossible to keep up with. \n\n...Please Discuss...\nSo what do you think? Am I unrealistic to think that I could accomplish these things alone with the right amount of time/discipline? Any tips for picking up some of these skills and tackling projects solo (as someone who is pretty much clueless?) How do you prioritize and maintain your home as projects pile up when you have time consuming repeated tasks (ex: mowing the lawn, grocery shopping, laundry/housework) that end up taking up large chunks of your days off? Is it better to just budget for these things to be paid for (at the cost of my savings or other things I'd rather spend money on)? \n\nSorry for the long post, I appreciate your thoughts!",

            "content": "So I recently (finally) bought my own place (35f). A tiny condo surrounded by other condos. To make more space I built a loft. 95% of the building process I did on the other side of town in my gf\u2019s garage but the assembly and install meant a lot of pounding noises and drill noises for 1.5 hours after work during the week (6-ish-8pm).  \nDuring that time a person in the next porch over who appeared to be a teenager asked me if  I would stop the noises because they \u201chad to work in the morning.\u201d I explained it would all be over by 8 PM but that I really needed to assemble it right now so I\u2019d have a bed, which is actually true.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I are polyamorous and I can\u2019t sleep at her house every night even though I have been sleeping at her house many nights while trying to build this loft. It took us a good two weeks to build it. This was basically the last hour and a half of work before I had my own bed back. The quiet time hours in our condominium HOA are 10 PM to 7 AM, so I was not doing anything wrong per say.   \n\nWhile speaking with this person they said something I couldn\u2019t understand and I asked them to repeat themselves but instead they just got mad and went inside slamming the door.  \n\n After that we continued to build the loft and were done at 8 PM as promised. But all the while we were building it that person made banging sounds on the other side of the wall every time we had to pound the boards in place and drill in the screws. It was like they were responding to our banging with more banging, at times I could hear them yelling curse words behind the wall too. It really stressed me out at the time, because I could feel the hatred from this person at me for making the noise.  \nMy other neighbors are really great so far. I think this person is autistic because I was told one of my neighbors is autistic and that person certainly acted very oddly to me that night.  \n\nAnyway, I know I stressed this person out as well as stressed out myself. And in general I want to be good with all my neighbors, so how should I apologize to this person? I don\u2019t really feel like I owe them an apology but at the moment I feel afraid of them. I went out to my scooter the other day and found a very sharp pair of scissors sitting on the seat. I don\u2019t know if that was them. But I want my living situation to feel safe again.    \nShould I just make them some cookies and write a note saying it won\u2019t happen again? What is truly the adult thing to do here?\n\nEdit: AUTISTIC NEIGHBOR, not Austin. Autocorrect got me THRICE.   \nEdit: words",

            "content": "My relationship of >11yrs may be (amicably, so far) dissolving. Neither of us are fully sure, yet; we're in a \"we'll see how things go\" mode, right now. But I'd like to have some kind of plan in place in the case that we do separate because I don't think I'd feel comfortable remaining living with an ex-partner (even though he's stated it's an option for me) for any significant period of time.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n* I am 31. I have never lived on my own or even fully supported myself. I moved in with my partner shortly after we got together when I was BARELY 20 years old (we were long distance and didn't want to stay long distance) and I have been living with him ever since. We live in a property owned by his family, so we haven't had to worry about rent, etc, and the only bills I've needed to cover myself have been my phone, car insurance, etc. Somehow, despite that, I don't have ANY savings to speak of.\n* I live in Los Angeles and would like to remain in the area for at least the next couple of years because of the following reasons:\n   * I am a student with 1.5 years of university left before graduating, and I'd REALLY like to be able to finish it without having to move across country (to live with my family) and having to transfer credits to another school, jumping through all those red tape hoops, etc. That, and I just like the university I am attending and would rather finish there.\n   * I have finally found a doctor who listens to me like a human being (a rare find, I'm sure you all know) who I am reluctant to give up just yet.\n   * I JUST started therapy with a specialist and have a lot of work to do. If I move out of state, I can guarantee I won't have the same mental health insurance coverage I currently do.\n* I don't have much income at all. And as I said, I live in LA, one of the most expensive places in the country. There is no way I could afford to live on my own as things stand right now, even with financial aid from school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay. So. The first thing I know I'm going to do is contact my university and talk to them about any housing options they have available to me. I'd really prefer not to share a bedroom with someone at this point in my life (especially a teenager or someone in their early 20s), so I'm hoping they'll have some availability in one of the graduate dorms or some such for \"non-traditional\" students who aren't in their early 20s. But I honestly don't know if I'd be able to afford that even with the financial aid I receive.\n\nAside from that, if we do indeed part amicably, my bf's family has a little tiny apartment that last I heard they were planing to Air BnB but have never gotten around to finishing (setting it up with furniture and a couple of minor repairs, etc). I could possibly ask them to rent that apartment and just live super minimally for a while without any furniture. What his family quoted to my partner and I a few months back when we were considering leaving our current residence was that we'd have to pay $500/month for rent, which is AMAAAZIIIING in Los Angeles. But like I said, I'm a student with very little income, so I'm not sure I could even swing that along with bills, food, car insurance, books/supplies for school, etc. I'd PREFER not to take fewer classes to work more hours because I've already been in school for 6 years and would like to just be DONE as soon as possible (also because the sooner I'm done with school, the sooner other options open up to me about where I might go if I'm ready to set aside my doctor/therapist, etc), but if that's what it comes down to then so be it. Gotta do whatcha gotta do.\n\nI guess my questions are:\n\n* Where do I go from here? Just as someone who's never lived on their own before in the first place. I'm intimidated by the idea and would like to be mentally prepared if it comes to that point.\n* Does anyone have any suggestions for affordable housing in LA that won't involve me sharing a bedroom with someone?\n* I would actually also be open to other, more non-traditional and creative suggestions as well (for further down the line after I graduate). I am a budding metalsmith and have even considered buying a van and setting it up as a mobile work/living space so I can travel wherever I want and bring my work with me. I have also considered long-term volunteering or WWOOFing (but I am unsure what I would do with all my stuff in these cases; storage units add up). I'm wondering if anyone has any other creative suggestions for free or almost-free housing along similar lines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance.",

Not to mention living expenses for a bit while I get  a new job.  \n3: What all needs to be changed with moving out of state? I know there needs to be a change of address but is there other paperwork regarding counties and the like?  \n4: If anyone here lives in washington do you know any nice/affordable areas? I'll do my best to make a trip up there before buying but it's going to be a shoestring budget kind of trip. \n\nThanks all ahead of time for your help :)",

            "content": "Heres the situation: \nI am a single woman (26) who's lived on her own for a year. Before that I bounced between my mom's and living with partners, and also spent two years living for free in a very, very bad situation. I was excited and grateful to live on my own. \n\nBut I recently lost my job. I'm employed again, but this new job pays a few dollars less, and I can't reasonably afford to live on my own, and expect to save money. \n\nTwo of my long time friends (both 30) are also looking for roommates. They're a couple, one of whom has been unemployed for about 9 months. Well call them A. A was laid off and a few months later began taking care of a sick loved one. The loved one recovered about 2 months ago, and they are still unemployed. The other is employed with a reasonably paying job. Well call them B. \n\nOther information: \nI signed the lease for another year on my 1 bedroom this morning. If this happens we'd split 250 transfer fee and stay in the same complex. No first and last needed. \n\nMy concerns are: \n1. They want to split the rent my room, 50/50 between the two of them and I. They also want the bigger, better room. I'm not sure that's fair. I feel like everyone should contribute equal amounts, per person. They've been a couple for 10+ years. It feels like they're almost taking advantage of that. I'm also worried that the motivation is that A is currently unemployed, and B has (at least in the last 3/4 years) played the role of main breadwinner off and on, and doesn't want to pay 2/3rds of the rent (vs 1/2) assuming A stays or later becomes unemployed. I, of course, can't know for sure. I know a lot of people find it's more fair to pay by room. I'm curious for yalls opinion and reasoning on that. \n\n2. They fight, a lot. A admitted to throwing a bottle (I didn't clarify the kind) at her door during a fight with B recently. I've never witnessed them be violent towards each other, or in general, but I've also never lived with them. They've admitted to being more physical in their younger days. (To clarify I DO NOT believe for a moment one is abusing the other. They're just obviously struggling with unhealthy coping tools. But regardless, it's still concerning as a potential roommate.) I've thought about confronting them directly before hand and making a rule that they HAVE to take it to their car, or just away from me. No fighting like that in the apartment. No screaming. No throwing. (This feels ridiculous to even have to say. I'm also not sure the extent of their fighting, persay. At least in terms of volume and physicality.) \n\n3. Is it even a good idea to roommate with friends at all? \n\n\nThings I'm excited about: \n\n1. We're friends! And there are many things I like about them and we never get to hang out anymore. \n\n2. Were all fairly well matched on needing alone time, and will likely have opposite schedules. (Although I'm a little concerned about how early I have to go to sleep and how sensitive of a sleeper I am. That said, I'm not worried about them respecting that as best they can.) Although this might cancel out reason 1, but, eh. \n\n3. I'll save about 300 a month, even if we split by room. \n\nI don't have a lot of other options. I'm going to look for strangers, look on craigslist, look on Facebook groups. But last year when I moved to this area I couldnt find anyone. \n\nWhat do you think? What experiences have you had in the past living with friends? All advice is appreciated!",

When I work and when I research is at max determined 1 week in advance. \n\nSo daily, I'm  either out of the house at work and back for a bed to sleep in, or on a train to the city to be in my apartment/research lab. Things like meal prepping, exercising, or even just having a clean set of clothes with me have become difficult. \n\nOnce my new classes start, it'll be a new wave of class times, and then taking the train to the suburbs to work on the weekends.

            "content": " \n\nHello Reddit,\n\nJust yesterday I had a huge fight with my parents for unrelated reasons. From there I was lectured on how I wasn't doing much to help my own life as a college sophomore. They told me that I wasn't doing much in the way of becoming an adult, and I just want to improve that.\n\nFor context, here's what I've been doing:\n\n\\- I am finishing up my 3 month long engineering internship\n\n\\- I took two college classes this summer\n\n\\- Two semesters ago I established Korean classes at Purdue\n\n\\- I am in Purdue Space Program, the source of my internship and some of my aerospace engineering information\n\nOf course, this isn't nearly enough. It all sounds good on paper, but I'm currently lazy about logistical stuff (missed the deadline on lofting my bed because I didn't know about it, etc) and I'm not good enough about motivating myself to learn more about things like student loans, budgeting, etc - **even learning about my own major**. I was told in the past that I wouldn't have to support myself financially - as long as I was doing things that would help me out in the future, such as having a job or taking classes, my parents would fully support my endeavors. This means not having to worry about gas, car upkeep, even down to packing my own lunch.\n\nI realize now that I've been extremely lucky and pretty much terribly ungrateful for what I've been given, so much so that I hadn't been talking to my parents. I fell under the guise of \"I'm too tired\" or \"I'm too busy with class/job/relationship\" - and I want to fix all of this.\n\nSince yesterday and today then, all I've been doing is researching how to invest in the stock market, how to be on top of my loans, and trying to take baby steps into true adulthood. My only problem is that I've always been on the mindset of \"if I was just shown the proper steps to get to where I want, I'll be golden\" which I realize is not the case in real life.\n\nI'd just like any and all advice from you lovely people on how to stop being dependent on my parents, how to be more educated outside of what I already know, and what to do to become accomplished and realistic about the rest of my life.",

            "content": "Hi adults!\n\nTL;DR at the end to save you some time...\n\nFirstly, let me introduce myself. I'm a woman, in October this year I'll turn 30 years old, I'm a lawyer and I used to work for government but I ended up quiting because payment was just an insult, so my mom asked me to help her in her law firm because well... after all it's family business, so I agreed. I've already been a year there, but I feel stupid coping with all the other lawyers, I just feel like I don't know a fkn thing and I'm getting it really hard to keep up with them, I just can't, I mean I know what I saw in school but real life is completely different. She also has a business partner (sort of) that plans on keeping the business for himself and there's my older brother, who is a very competent lawyer but he has a job, also, he has the strongest possibility of keeping the \"boss\" title after my mother retires, so as I can see from the future, I'm destined to be an employee forever there hahaha.\n\nMy mother is already tired, I can see that, but she is still working because she feels that if she goes now, the other lawyer will \"get\" over her law firm because well, I'm a trainee, I don't have enough experience or anything to keep it working and my brother won't leave his job for now. So basically she's there because I'm too stupid to take the lead and I will be devoured by the others.\n\nNow, I also have an MBA degree because somehow I discovered I really like business administration, specially marketing, by the time I discovered it, it was too late to study a new bachelor degree so I just took a master's degree, and I'm actually good at it, I've done some work from time to time as an independent business advisor and I've done well,  Besides that, my husband studied the same and he complements everything I'm not (financial stuff) and I think we could really develop our careers together.\n\nNow, as I'm already a lawyer and I already have an MBA, I'm thinking of getting a scholarship to Europe and study a program of international business law that I think could join my MBA and my law degree together in something that I actually like and -think- I'm good at. It would imply me and my husband being separated for one year, but we don't have a problem with that. I also think it's a great opportunity for my future because first and foremost; it's something I LIKE, also, it's a way of standing out in something not my brother or the other business partners do, besides the opportunity of working abroad. I think this could give me the option of doing something I like, I'm good at and that my brother and I can complement in the future, so we could share the same office but he would be in charge of his own cases and I would have mine.\n\nNow, the problem here is that by the time I finish those studies, I will be 32/33 years old, and I've been told by my doctors that that's already an... Older age for having children, also more dangerous BLa bla, and I do want to have children, I could have children now but I don't think we can afford it by the moment, and I think I have an insecure future here. I don't want to have children \"just because\" now and then turn my life in a stressful bunch of nerves because I won't be able to afford it, but also,  I don't want to loose the opportunity of having children for maybe beeing too ambitious and let time pass on me.\n\nI know 33 years is not as old as I think, but I may say that I have some hormones problems, so of I want to get pregnant I would need maybe one or two more years in treatment if I'm lucky.\n\nSo, what do you think?? Should I go for it or stay and fight with my brother and the other guy to get a spot here? I think this will be a real watershed in my life.\n\nTL;DR: I want to study a master degree that I think will help me get a better life but I'm afraid that by the time I finish I'll be too old (or find too hard) to get pregnant. I want both things in my life, need advice.",

So with this, my youth is officially over, at least in terms of stages in life. I think most people feel like once you start working your first job after college, you're childhood is over and now you're officially an adult. Only issue is, I'm 28. So by sheer age, my youth/childhood ended a while ago. \n\nNow I could get into a long story about why I'm 28 years old and just now getting my BS, but thats not what this thread is about. Now that school is done, I can't stop myself from continuously looking back and thinking about what I could have done differently. I'm not going to let someone tell me that its \"OK\" to graduate with a BS at 28, when you know most kids graduate at 22/23. That is a big part of why I look back so much. I just keep thinking that at this point in my life, I should have done soooooooo much more. I really look back at just one decision I should have made differently when I was 15, and how it could have changed everything for the better.  \n\nNow one thing I've learned about Engineering school is that just cuz you get a degree, you're not guaranteed a job. I know plenty of people who have better grades than me, and they ether dont have jobs, or found jobs way later than me. So I should be thankful that I already had one 6 months prior to graduation. I should be thankful that I'll be able to start building myself up really soon. But I just keep looking back on what I could have done differently.... Why?",

I'm doing everything as well as I can, being helpful, customer facing and centric, and yet I feel like it's a dead end. \n\nFor the past year or so, I've been constantly reworking my resume and applying to jobs in any field. I'm trying to teach myself SQL and Python on the side, and I'm also dealing with untangling myself from my parents' insurance, who refuse to remove me from it even though I left them the moment I turned 18 (they're abusive, cannot trust in the slightest). \n\nI live currently in a HCOL city, and while it is high in cost, I have access to food stamps and plenty of social programs that have been helping me adult, file my taxes, etc. I also have the possibility of more educational access than compared to a small town. I am currently on section 8, which, while helping me over all compared to the actual rent in the city, it's cutting my checks essentially given my hours are being cut almost every week. I'm scrimping and saving as much as possible, but by my calculations, I went from making $23k with what hours I was originally given, to $16k. \n\nYesterday I received an email from a recruiter for a tech company offering me a position that is full time (which I'm currently not), base of $40k annually, alongside commission and bonuses, and they specifically want me because I'm conversationally bilingual. I am, and I am constantly trying to improve my linguistic ability as well. They offer full benefits by the looks of it as well. \n\nThing is, it's in a small town over 4 hours away where I currently live, and I don't have a car. I don't have car insurance. Furthermore, I've been searching and I cannot find what the base salary is aside from the email stating it's $40k annually. \n\nI'm interested in the position itself, but I don't think I can currently go to that specific location given these circumstances. I need advice on the matter, and at the very least, how should I word a reply to the recruiter and state to them that I'm interested, but I need more info before making a decision, without sounding rude?",

I could use the advice of the collective Reddit adults! Context is below to give you all a frame of reference.\n\nI want to start \"winding down\" about 2 hours before I'd ideally like to be in bed; this would entail finishing whatever homework assignment(s) I absolutely *need* to get done that day and I'd also like to include soothing activities such as watching a little TV (I own anti-blue light glasses that I wear at night when I use electronics), cleansing my face, drinking tea, reading my Bible/devotional book, meditation, and/or the pelvic floor exercises given to me by my physical therapist.\n\nSince the time I have to get up in the morning will vary each day of the week depending on my work schedule I plan to adjust the time I really need to be in bed accordingly to ensure a proper 8 hours (I've had sleep issues my whole life and 8 hours seems like a longshot but I want to at least try the best I can). For my own sanity I will need to do bedtime preparation things in a certain order and although I know what all needs to be done before I can settle down for the night, I'm having trouble putting each task in the \"right\" order.\n\nThoughts? Suggestions? Recommendations? Anything helps. Thank you in advance!",

So needless to say I\u2019m not sure if it is just these illnesses acting up or what, however I\u2019ve come to realize that I\u2019m just going through the motions of my life. I was married once before, I married at 18 & had two kids before I was 21 so I didn\u2019t get a chance to go wild. I went through the motions, had mental breakdowns, but idk if it was due to my illnesses or if that\u2019s just part of being an adult. Fast forward to now I\u2019m in a much better relationship, but I\u2019m a store manager at Papa John\u2019s, have been working for them for over two years & have been a gm for 7 months now. I\u2019m starting to feel the same way I did with my ex, not necessarily the relationship, my relationship is amazing. But I dread going to work. When I\u2019m at work, all I want to do is go home. I\u2019m counting down the minutes until my days off. It may just be because the job is very stressful at times, or it may be that my illnesses are acting up, but is this what my grandparents meant when they said I would miss being a kid? Is this how adults feel? Wake up, go to work, spend a couple hours with loved ones, go to sleep, pray for the weekend to come faster? I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m going through the motions. I work over 55 hours a week & so does my boyfriend (he has the same job as me). I go to sleep at 12am, wake up at 7, get to work at 8:30, get off at 8, get home around 9, take a shower & eat & by that time it\u2019s around 10:30-11pm.

We see each other once or twice each year. I like his new country. It has a warm climate and my owh hime country is cold for 6 months and snowy for 3. I am sicj and my symotoms get worse due the cold.  I thought I could spend my real elder years in an Old Age home there in my friends' new country. He simply is able to be more caring towards me ( if I will need it) - my wife focuses on her job and the grownup student children. Or to put it more correctly - my wife does all caring in an angry fuss that is stressing and he can remain calm and kind always. For that - to have a place in a Senior Center I need citizenship. So I plan to go to the Notary Office. Each expected paper ( birth certificate and \"non-punished\" document and papers on \"cultural identification\" / in that country it is possible to claim it even if you just do language teaching or wrote about that culture/ and language exam document) costs 100 EUR and I did collect that on a crowdfunding. In our country there is only one BTW. So all this is adult planning. The non-adult stuff is my fantasy about trying to work on the basis of * being close* to this ex friend. After all I have other countries where I could find a place also in the South. And maybe my papers ( on the cultural identity )will not be accepted. In that case I still have the option of working there for 2 years and that gives me the needed citizenship too. My feeling is that the intensity of missing my friend is okay to have ( because our closeness -BTW nonsexually- was so  healing) as part of my grief over losing regular contact. But it still is partly a childish clinging and maybe it is not adultish or wise to make decisions on it. Of course an extra passport may never do harm.",

To be able to buy those new pair of shoes or go to Starbucks every day 3 times a day just because without having to worry about if I\u2019m going to have enough money to grocery shop.\n\nI\u2019m not 23 and i just graduated (this past May) with my BS in health care admin, magna cum lauded with a minor in HR. which I\u2019m super excited about. But I\u2019m scared shitless to do anything really. I have the GPA to get into really good grad  programs but I would rather wait until I had at least 2-3 years of experience, especially since my life has been all work no play AND I can\u2019t seem to decide on a program(do i want to do social work, mba, mph, mpa?). So I really want to just relax and get to know myself outside of being a student because I honestly don\u2019t really know who i am. \n\nI\u2019m currently working full time at my internship mom grateful they hired me and I\u2019m getting experience in my field. But I\u2019m terrified of looking for a new job because where I currently live (in the city i went to school) i would have to commute 45+ minutes to work one way. And I don\u2019t really like that because the last time I had a commute that long i got in car accident on the freeway. I I\u2019m don\u2019t have the money to be able to afford another car if that was to happen. And moving to those cities where the jobs are is almost impossible without the job because the cost of living there is absolutely ridiculous. And lowkey the pay is not where I personally think it should be. \n\nI have an apartment with 3 roommates right now. We each pay 600 for a shared room. But it comes furnished and includes pretty much everything (WiFi utilities cable laundry onsite). I want to move out. But like I know that the going rate for a single room is about 1000. And I don\u2019t have that right now unless I get a new job. But that goes back to me being scared. \n\nI want to move back home. Probably because I know at least I have a safety net. But also because I miss my family. My little brother is 17 and is leaving for the army shortly after is 18th birthday since he\u2019s graduating high school early. I want to be home to spend more time with them all when he comes back. It also doesn\u2019t help that my family and all of my best friends that live down there or moved back after school keep telling me that they wish i was there. Because i freaking wish that too. And i kinda hate driving 2 hrs oneway to visit home. My goal for moving home is to stay with my mom for 6- months to a year depending on when i find a job. And then move to a city in the county that is still fairly close but far enough to be independent. \n\nI keep thinking I\u2019m gonna wake up and be middle aged with everything figured out. And it hasn\u2019t happened yet. When i tell you that I\u2019ve focused on school so much and the end goal. I mean it 100%. But also while I focus on the end goal of me being comfortable and I\u2019m this amazing career. I never really paid attention to the in between. And i feel like now I\u2019m in the in between and i don\u2019t know what to do. Do I move home where it might be a little tougher to find a job in my field. Or do i stay here but have to deal with the insane cost of living and the commuting. When do I look for a new job?\n\nI have these goals for myself but i feel like I\u2019m in this post grad limbo where I\u2019m just to scared to do anything about it. My \u201cadult\u201d friend as i like to call her as she is about 10 years older than me. Suggested I read Quarterlife Crisis. And so far it\u2019s describing where I\u2019m at right now. My friends where I live now keep telling me that \u201cI\u2019m exactly where I need to be\u201d and that \u201ceverything will work itself out\u201d but why does it feel like it won\u2019t? I also feel like they\u2019re tired of me talking abut it. \n\nThe positives in my life is that I\u2019m forcing myself to try new things. And doing things that interest me. I created a blog about health care 2 years ago. But I\u2019m currently revamping/creating a new one that\u2019s literally just gonna be about whatever I I\u2019m interested in. I figured this would be a good way to keep track of my interest hobbies and to self reflect. Idk. It\u2019s something right?\n\nI just wish i wasn\u2019t scare. But I also wish that I had some kind of roadmap or something. \n\nEdit: this probably doesn\u2019t matter. But I\u2019ve also been seeing a therapist. I know I have anxiety. But she thinks that I\u2019ve had depression for a while and that I\u2019ve used school and work to keep myself busy and ignore my feelings. So I\u2019m dealing with that too.\n\n\nThanks for listening/reading.",

In addition: sometimes I struggle with just not feeling like I\u2019m putting any good out in the world.\n\n\nVolunteering with the Big Brothers program really made a huge difference for me. And they only ask for you to do 1-2 hours a week! Now I\u2019ve transitioned into tutoring a high schooler. It\u2019s a similar commitment of just 1 hour a week but I get to make an extra $20 a week (yay! Beer money!).\n\n\nEdit: to clarify about the age range. I picked this range because it\u2019s typically before you have children. Once you have a little one at home you probably just wanna head home after work and take care of them. However, I hear a lot of parents become active in coaching their kids team or volunteering at the school as their kids grow older so they can make a little money and feel more involved.

It was just A phone interview and it doesn't mean anything yet but it's a start. Ive always felt I was behind everyone else my age cause I didn't have a plan after HS because I didn't like school. I applied to local Community College as a joke a month before I graduated at first just to get an acceptance letter while everyone else I knew were getting multiple for 4yr colleges. I changed my major about two weeks before I started and did a my college online. While at home I did school work and helped my family with house work while everyone was gone. I've learned to cook, clean, laundry, and fix things around the house. Ive never been a social bug and much prefer staying in rather than going out. This is partly due to anxiety but it is what it is. I've lost touch with most of my friends but I'm learning that I can be happy with or without other people. I just graduated in May which I never thought I'd do and now I'm on a job search. I can only get a part time job because of my complicated circumstances but it's a start. But slowly but surly since I graduated from HS 3yrs ago with no plan and no dreams I've learned to drive, bought two cars, learned to jump the cars, went to college for something I enjoyed, finished with an associates and a Certificate, learned to cook, clean, do laundry, made a business plan, and now a job search. I did all this while dealing with diabetes and a chronic lung disease.

Unlike other countries, it's not customary for us to move out when we turn 18. Some of us would rather stay home because moving out is way out of our comfort zone. I'm turning 25 this month and moved out two weeks ago. The first thing my dad said when I told him about my decision was \"Are you sure about this? Would you be able to do it?\" I was really confident. My paycheck can handle the expenses, I thought.\n\nThe first day, my boyfriend helped me out buy some of the necessities such as a dish rack, trash can, a mattress, etc. We planned to buy some of the other stuff on my next paycheck. I didn't have a stove for the last two weeks and lived off my boyfriend bringing me food or ordering fast food. \n\nThis morning, I received my paycheck. I didn't get enough commission so I budgeted hard. I planned to have a couple of thousands left so I can save it for the next rent payment (which includes electric, water, and internet bill). So there we were, buying a stove good enough for me to cook for one instead of ordering again and again.\n\nI really thought a new LPG would be really cheap. Of course I needed one to cook as the stove would be useless. When the lady told me it cost above 2k pesos, my knees started shaking. I panicked. Buying this would cut the budget short and I would be left with only 1k (excluding the rent payment saved). I almost cried. I wanted to call my dad and move back home.\n\nBack in our apartment, I cried to my boyfriend. It was so stressful budgeting my own finances. I realized how much my parents went through. They needed to budget for three kids and a grandchild (my sister's). When I was living under their roof, I never really cared about expenses. Whenever I receive my paycheck, I buy shit I don't really need. \"Savings? Fuck that.\" I used to say.\n\nIt hit me so hard today. But all was said and done, right? I already bought it. When I got home, I started doing chores like crazy. When I was back home, I never really did stuff. Now that I live alone, there's no one else to do this but me.\n\nHonestly though, I want to give up. I don't know how you guys do it. I need some tips.

We were roomates for a bit before college, and I was the best man in his wedding. We're both in our 30s.\n\nOnce he got settled from the move, we had lunch and caught up. It was like old times and I thought we'd be hanging out much more often. One of our traditions growing up was going to a renaissance festival with his family. He now has a step daughter and a toddler, so we planned for all of us to go together (his family, my wife, and myself).\n\nAfter discussing it with my wife, we decided on a date and I confirmed with my friend. Both my wife and I put in for vacation several months in advance since taking time off is not easy with our jobs. I explained this to my friend. \n\nMonths later, he shoots me a text out of the blue saying something like \"Hey, we're going to the ren fest on x day right?\" The day he mentions is not even remotely close to the date we agreed on, so I let him know that's not what's on my calendar. His reply is his wife changed the date. I explain to him that's only a month away and we can't go that particular weekend. He's not really apologetic, pretty much just a \"Sorry, I know it's short notice.\" I'm pissed frankly and don't even reply. I'm now weighing if I even want this person in my life. Our conversations are sort of one-sided as he mostly talks about himself, and rarely asks about my life. This seems to be an extension of that behavior. We also don't have many common interests at this point in our lives.\n\nHas anyone ever cut out a best friend as part of your adulting? How would you handle this situation? I'm not sure I want to work it out, so I haven't even told him how pissed I am. It's not like he cancelled lunch last minute... This is something that was important to both of us in the past, and has taken months of advance planning.\n\nTL;DR:\nMy best childhood friend changed date of important plans and didn't even bother to tell me.

            "content": "First off, thank you for clicking and reading. I'm a 24 year old hispanic female that just started physical therapy school this past summer. The summer semester was the most difficult thing i've ever done, academically. I spent every hour of the last three months studying, barely sleeping, barely eating and crying. Even after all the studying and sacrifice I ended up with a 2.8 GPA for the semester, which is borderline for the allowed 2.5 GPA that you need to stay in the program. If I get an F in any class, I get kicked out. I did so bad that my program advisor called me in to discuss my struggle and poor academic performance. This is all new to me, I've never struggled like this in school before. I'm having a hard time focusing in class, all I can think about is failing out, not being good enough to be in the program, how everyone around me is so much smarter than me. ALL thoughts that don't allow me to focus on the material being taught and just giving me an overwhelming amount of anxiety. It's becoming crippling. I'm already having a difficult time with the material itself and then on top of that the anxiety just makes me perform worse. \n\nMy entire life I thought that if I worked hard enough I could do anything. I mean, it's gotten me this far... working towards my doctorate at a very competitive school. I can honestly say that I'm not a naturally smart person, I've had to work EXTREMELY hard to get where I am. Study for longer than most people. But as I sit in class, not understanding half of the material ...I can't help but think I've reached my mental & intellectual capacity. You know the saying \"fake it till you make it?\" I'm afraid I faked it too well, I fooled everyone into letting me into a good PT program and now I can't do it. I feel like a fraud. This goes beyond imposter syndrome. I also feel really guilty and undeserving of the opportunity to be in such a great program. I got rejected from PT schools the first time I applied back in 2016, so I quit my job as a PT aide and bought a ticket to Europe, eventually came back to the states and got another job as a PT aide, made great connections got strong recommendation letters and the next application round actually got in to multiple schools. I'm afraid that I only got in to the school where I am because of my connections. And I HATE thinking about that. It also adds a layer of pressure because I don't want to let the person that recommended me down. \n\nPOINT OF THE STORY is that seriously I'm considering quitting PT school. I think it may be the smart decision before I get into more debt. Drop out now, and avoid the possibility of getting deeper into the program and failing out in my 2nd or 3rd year and being in MORE debt. The crazy part is that before this summer I had ZERO debt. I made it through undergrad without any student loans. And in just 2 semesters (summer and now currently fall) later i'm already in $32,000 in debt. It makes me sick to my stomach. I worked so hard to get here and I'm the unhappiest I've ever been. I really like physical therapy, and I can really imagine being happy being a PT. But the way things are going I just don't think I can do this. Academically, I am so behind everyone. I don't know if I should hang in there and try my best (which is what I'm doing now) or quit while I can \\[before my debt gets to be 100k+\\]. I'm so lost. I would appreciate ANY advice and guidance. Please help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've recently started seeing a counselor to help with my anxiety, which I hope puts me at ease and allows me to think things through to make a smart decision but right now I'm not at that place yet.",

I know I'm good at my job, I know I'm fine but theres something in there saying \"you suck. they are going to find a better employee and fire you. Everyone hates you.\" \n\nI am constantly pressurizing myself to be the best daughter, girlfriend, friend, employee.

I haven't slept in 2 weeks... \n\nI have diagnosed moderate anxiety. I know I need therapy, but I'm scared to take that step.",

Writing to redit in the hopes to ease my mind and that no one makes the same mistake as I did. Oh, and as an added negative, my back doesn't feel better.

I can't bring a guy home, I have to be sneaky, My parents (mainly mom) want to know my every move, every guy I talk to, every date I'm going on..etc. dont get me wrong my mom is my best friend and I love to include her, but i made mistakes in the past by telling her everything about my ex which caused issues. I can't have any pets. I really want a dog or cat or bunny. My parents are anti-furry anything lol. I have to clean my room all the time. You know the normal, living w in th ur parents kind of things. I'm grateful to have them and be with them. But this fear of missing out is killing me. Like what if I die b4 I ever get to have a dog?? Or a one night stand??!! Probably not a big deal but I just feel like my life clock is ticking real fast. \n\nI fucked up and procrastinated a lot since high school ended. I got an associate's degree and then stopped going to school completely until I figured out what I really wanted to do. \n\nLast year at 23, I moved out for the first time to live with my bf (currently and ex now) That didnt work out so I came back home with my parents. While I was moved out I realized you cant really go to school for anything that requires clinicals while you have rent to pay. Maybe I could find something part time but the places i want to live in (not the ghetto) cost $950-1400 per month. Rn i make $20 an hour so that's enough to afford a good place, but I kinda hate my job and it's so boring and not me. I dont wanna be stuck here.  If I quit and work part time while in an apartment, by MYSELF, it seems nearly impossible. \n\nSince I'm with my parents, now is my perfect opportunity to go back to school since the things I want to get into requires you to basically not have a full time job (medical lab science or nursing--you have to do clinicals 40hrs a week, aka no full time job for you) I can get my career going and stay with parents and save for now. Then get my apartment,  pets, etc once I have everything going for me. \n\nI guess I know which path is best for me (staying with parents) but also I want to experience and enjoy my single 20s the best I can you know?? Because life is short and what if I die b4 I get to experience anything. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place in my decisions lol. \n\nI would like to keep my same pay and get an apartment. Part of me wants to just take out a big loan to pay for my apartment while I go to school during the clinicals time? Is that a good idea? Theres got to be a way to do both school and living on your own while paying for your bills. Has anyone done this or any recommendations? Being an adult is literally the worst.",

To give you a brief rundown about my trials and tribulations: I just graduated from undergrad in May (got a BS in public health). Moved to TX to start working on my masters in public health and realized after a couple of weeks that this wasn't the right move for me. Withdrew, and now I'm kinda stuck here in TX with a lease and all that jazz (which is fine, I actually like it here....I just need to stay afloat). \n\nI had plans of going back to school to study nursing, but in the last couple of weeks, I've had time to finally breathe and not worry about school. I'm slowly starting to feel like I actually don't want to go back to school (physically, at least). Undergrad drug me through the mud and going to school over the last 4 years has mentally drained me, I'm coming to find. \n\nSo here's my thing, I guess (and I may be in the wrong place to get feedback on this): I'm not sure what my next move \"career-wise\" could be? I've been interviewing for some positions over the last few weeks, and while these are good jobs (unrelated to my degree, I should add), they aren't jobs I would turn into careers. Also, with my degree, it's not a field I wanna practice in (I was in engineering for the majority of undergrad, wanted to get out, and just switched to PH to graduate on time and get out of school). This becomes extra difficult when I'm also not even sure where my interests lie anymore. So I'm kinda stuck in this spot wondering how can I advance in the future or what field I can delve into *or* if I should consider getting a masters at some point to give myself more options (maybe online because I don't think I have it in me to go back to campus-based ed).

            "content": "I'm sorry that this is long. I'm working through some stuff! TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI have incurable chronic pain exacerbated by standing/walking/moving/doing anything. It makes it hard to do the things that one must do to exist. It's stressful to have my income and livelihood riding on my ability to stand up, go somewhere, function at work all day, and get home again, when those aren\u2019t abilities I can rely on. I thought I'd found the solution to surviving as a spoonie when I got married right after college to someone who hates cooking and cleaning but had a good reliable income: I became a housewife. I was very good at that job since I didn\u2019t have to go anywhere at preset times, and I had the flexibility to work within my physical limits and to take breaks when the pain was too much.\n\nHowever, he recently divorced me and I'm now totally on my own for the first time in my life.  Finding a job was not easy, due to my work history gap. The best I could find was the same position (different place) as the last job I had, but for $7 less and without benefits. (And I was struggling to get by when I had that last job!) I'm definitely dealing with some anger and resentment over my ex spending our marriage racking up job experience and now making $125/hour, while I spent our marriage supporting him and becoming less employable, on the assumption that he took commitment as seriously as I did.\n\nI\u2019ve been at this job for almost a month. Getting there, being on my feet for much of the day, and getting back home again really wipes me out physically. I'm in so much pain when I get home that I just lie down until I have to leave again the next morning. I haven\u2019t really been eating because I'm always in too much pain to get up and make dinner or make a lunch to bring to work, and going grocery shopping is out of the question. I haven\u2019t been to the store since before I started this job. There are no cafes, restaurants, grocery stores, vending machines, etc close enough to my work to get there and back during my lunch break. I haven\u2019t even managed to shower on weekdays.\n\nMy limited understanding of social security is that there are two options: one requires you to be super poor for life, with no more than $2,000 in assets or savings at any point or you immediately lose your benefits, which is frankly insane based on the rents in this city if nothing else (not to mention that it means you can never have a house, or a car, or a child, or emergency medical funds, or save for retirement, etc etc etc). And the other option is based on how much income tax you paid before you became disabled? I was a 21-year-old college student when I became disabled. The only income tax I'd paid was for a few low-paying summer jobs. I have never been well-employed since then, either. So I don't think I would qualify.\n\nWhat is someone like me supposed to do? I don\u2019t see much point in living like this. I had a nice life, love and companionship, and happiness and hope for the future during my marriage, but now I\u2019m in pain all the time and I'm poor, hungry, lonely, and miserable.  If this is what life has in store for me, I would rather not do this. Knowing that my pets need me is what\u2019s keeping me alive right now. What can I do? Should I take the $2,000 lifetime curse for SSI? Or should I make a different terrible financial decision and put all my income into rent in order to live next to my workplace (even though my wages are bad, benefits are nonexistent, and I don\u2019t have a permanent contract)? Should I move to a country with better social services? Should I marry for money ASAP? (I seriously doubt I\u2019m young enough or attractive enough to be a gold-digger, heh.) Do I just have to struggle through this way of life every day for the next X decades until I die? Should I go back to college to learn a completely different career? I\u2019m not really excited about that idea because I already did that, and still paying for it. I used to be in a very physical line of work, and I completely switched what I was studying when I became ill. Changing majors = more time in college = more debt. My current line of work is not physical, but just getting there and back every day and not being able to lie down during the day results in constant flare-ups.\n\nThank you very much for any insight you might be able to offer. Feel free to redirect me to a more appropriate sub if you know one (was looking at r/Advice but it seems to be mostly teens). I\u2019m willing to answer questions if you need more information.\n\nP.S. If you'd like to offer advice on my health, please just consider before posting that I might know more about it than you do, and of course I've been to doctors and been through every treatment available to me. I\u2019ve intentionally been nonspecific with my issues because giving people details seems to invite the whole \u201cjust go to the doctor/ just do yoga/ just take CBD/ just be more positive!\u201d thing. Go ahead though, I'm not hostile on this point, just a bit weary of well-meaning but uninformed advice. :)\n\n**TL;DR**: I'm trying to be responsible after being dealt a blow, but struggling to adult independently. I accept that I can\u2019t have a normal able-bodied life with things like errands, friends, hobbies, and staying in shape, but my life currently consists of working 7 hours/day, commuting 2 hours/day, lying down in pain alone 15 hours/day, and a shower every Saturday. Am I right in thinking that\u2019s not sustainable? How do I fix it? How do actual adults survive?",

Do's and don't's of moving into an apartment. How to find romance. Weight loss I am about 235 and I want to drop to 200. I am avoiding all fast food and drinking smoothies at least every other day.

A lot of it is tied to not being where I want to be in life and feeling worthless and like my life lacks meaning as a result. I'm single, no kids, no real close friendships, no parents in the picture (one deceased, one checked out), and though my siblings and I are tight, they have spouses and never really *need* me for anything. My job is an entry level customer service position that pays $15 an hour and is usually a stepping stone for college kids who need to make rent. They come into work all bright eyed and bushy tailed and full of hope for the future...and then there's my old jaded ass. I'm planning to go back to school next semester and hopefully that will spice things up a bit. But as for now, I just feel like I'm loafing and not really doing much for myself. Maybe it's a millenial ideal that life is supposed to be exciting and productive and purposeful all of the time but I can't help it. \n\nHow do you personally cope with feeling this way?",

This is going to be a bit of a sad read so I'm sorry in advance. \nF/18\n\nTldr:\n2 months agomy mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and to make it easier on my mom and dad I have been living with my brother and his large family. They have been teaching me adulting stuff but I feel like such a burden and need help with how to manage money and car insurance stuff and working, etc.\n\nAbout 2 months ago my mom and dad and me went back to the state I left when they drug me around the US for 7 years. My mom had been hurting for a while and had suddenly woke up at night in pain so my dad finally caved in and took her to the ER despite us not having insurance. They found out that night that she had tumors all over her body and that it was cancer. About a week later they finally got stuff back from biopsies that it was stage 4 lung cancer and it will kill her because it's progressed so far. The day after we had come to the ER and we found out that it was definitely cancer I was told that I could stay at a siblings house so I wouldn't be alone because my father was constantly at my mother's side and I for various reasons couldn't stay with my mother despite how much I loved her. My parents never taught me anything about adulting and put their jobs and time above teaching me to drive, having appropriate living conditions for me to actually be able to get a part time job, and keep me as a teenager accountable for my schoolwork. I've got no GED or highschool diploma, I have only recently gotten my first job as a part time sales associate at Dollar general, and I bought a $1k car so I could start learning to drive. I also recently passed my permit test ! The only bad things are the fact that I'm going to have to get insurance by myself and the job I'm working at has cut my hours from 20 hours to only 9 hours this week. (I get $9.25/h) I give my brother and sister in law $40 a week to help pay for gas and groceries because they take me around to places I need to go. If my job continues to put my hours this low I'll have to search for another job in town but the options are severely limited.  Do you guys have any tips for how to live as cheaply as possible when all of my groceries are shared between 7 different people ? If any of you have any kind of tips on how to make some kind of extra money I'd appreciate that too! Sorry that my questions are vague. If you want any kind of specific clarifications just ask!",

I studied too hard at high school (to distract from bullying, went from bottom of the school to top) and too hard at university.  At university though I began to experience resistance which made it a struggle and practically had no life as I had to study harder to counteract the fatigue (which led to me having to resit an entire year). Resentment of virtually spending several years behind a desk started to settle in.\n\n I then left university but it took me a year to get a decent job (poor soft skills from years virtually being behind a desk), have had three jobs in three years in three different cities, one engineering and two in legal. I've been very unhappy in all three to the point where I've just got depressed, sat back, done minimal work and either quit or let them fire me once they've caught on.\n\nI'm now like that Spacey character from American Beauty, sort of gone through apathy and out of the other side into a smug I-just-don't-care.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that I hit burnout 20 years too early. I never really got to enjoy my youth or professional life as a result and have been increasingly running on empty.  I also made some bad career decisions which didn't help. I'm now in a situation where I lurch from half-arsed major setback to half-arsed major setback.\n\nI feel like the solution is to just coast for a bit and just dump all that attainment and career shite and just pull pints, clean chalets, fix boats, generally throw caution to the wind and just live life.\n\nHas anyone else hit this point?",

            "title": "Has shoe culture driven me insane, or is that just being an adult today?",
            "content": "I believe that this is first off likely only relatable if you're my age or older. I'm 32.  \n\n\nWhen I was growing up, in the 90's and early 00's, my family was middle class and each year before school started my mother would take me to buy a new pair of trainer/tennis shoes for the year. We would make a day of it, but it usually was all done at one mall or shops in the center of town, and I'm unable to remember any tougher time I couldn't find a pair of shoes I would like within going to just 2-3 stores.  But depending on how much I'd outgrown my current pair, these were the shoes I'd be stuck with for the next YEAR (also living where it had all 4 seasons) until basically I got my first job and had my own income (but even then, I spend it mostly on food).  I look back at this now and find it odd I could commit to one pair so easily.  For school, after school, golfing with my dad, playing soccer/biking with my neighborhood friends weekends..  I would have a full costume on Halloween but wear the same shoes and not give any shit about it.  But getting to the point my question is that I am always buying new pairs of casual shoes as an adult.  Why? Because other than the shopping and errands I do to support myself, and a job where I'm on my feet more than school years, I don't find my personality or personal time to be all that different.   I'm just an average joe, Jason Bateman or similar type  \n\n\nI think that shoes were less attention growing then as they are today, and even the biggest sellers were sticking with monotone or two-tone and those colors being of white/black/brown.  My dad was a teacher, so he had (I guess) a black and brown pair for work, and tennis shoes for leisurely backyard things, but I don't recall him often caring about getting a new pair.  He has a closet with older pairs that I think he never went into. This is what I thought would happen to me. Once my feet stopped growing, I'd basically have the same shoes for longer and longer, and here's the interesting thing- not desire anything else when I was wearing casual shoes around the house or running errands.  I guess the idea of having a stockpile of shoes was for just a matriarchal and fashion obsessed society.  But my mom loves flats, and tennis shoes, so from both sides I saw no heavy inborn burden for walking shoes keeping up with changes.    \nNow here's the thing about it.  Like I said earlier, when I was working my first fast food job making minimum wage at 16, the paycheck would go to the bank to save up for a car, and I'd keep about $40-50 for spending money which was often too much cause I didn't use if on anything but a stop at 7-11 or fast food.  I didn't go buying clothing unless it was for replacing something that was worn out.  That was '04-06.  I guess I had no hobbies other than golfing in the summers.  \n\n\nSo I guess I'm just trying to reason the problem down to a few answers.  Either my brain and personality was still growing in my teens and late teens (not dating until later as well) and not until my early 20s and late 00's would having the outdated pair of shoes anger me.  Does my childhood religion (Irish catholic-> agnostic today) have any influence on a reason why I need more shoes today?    \nOR, at about the same time, online shopping exploded, our new internet based industrial revolution came and shoe culture as a result went much more overblown and outrageous and the monotones went away?   And because of this of just happening to go on the same time I was maturing to the man I am now, is just coincidence.  \n\n  \nMore other questions:  \nWasn't there some sort of society stigma back in the 90s for owning several pairs because it was well advertised that \"kids in africa\" had no shoes?  or what that just in my own family? was that only what middle class parents said to their kids?  Why is it gone?  \n\n\nWhy are my shoes getting worn out quicker than I think my dad's did? \n\nHow much does being a man factor into this?  or being a white man in a very multiracial area.  I'm making 40-45K a year, so for an entry level job, not bad.  All throughout my life I always thought adult professionals wore suits and still wore clothing like they were going yachting on their weekends. Obviously, norms have changed, but all cultures have different casual looks.  Lots of men who are \"doing well\" nowadays in my area are laid back in dressing on weekends, jeans and t-shirts, loose fitting, beards, etc. to break the norm that men are groomed to conform and be in uniform/suits and have to be a slave to society.  And this is oversimplified, but I do have to be aggressively aware of how certain colors are gang colors so I can't just wear simple black, which is a real shame. So if my tops have to be colors, than my shoes need to match with every damn color.\n\nIs something else unrelated making me insecure, and there are plenty of adults who don't care how much white shoes are a bold color or can't clash with a hat if you're wearing one, if you can wear tennis shoes with cargo pants, the impression you make in casual outings, etc and just go for comfort? Like I say we are middle class and but happen to live in a suburb with a larger amount of upper-middle class, and I remember other kids saying they owned 4-5 pairs when they were still growing so I'm obviously unsure what is normal.",

I\u2019m a 26 year old male with high functioning autism and some very expensive to treat illnesses. On paper I\u2019ve done everything right, I got a bachelors and masters degree and a prestigious internship with a think tank in DC. I started applying to jobs right after graduation about a year and a half ago. At first I wanted to find something in my field but had no luck, I continued and also applied to others just for right now. About a year and 1200 applications later I ended up with two part time jobs, neither of which is enough. I could probably make that work if it weren\u2019t for the health issue. One of my medications would cost 50,000 dollars per dose without insurance, and the way my parents insurance works is I have to live with them to keep having it since I\u2019m 26. Aside from the financial issue, I feel like I\u2019ve been really socially isolated since I graduated. I had a tight knit friend group that was honestly like a second family in college and after graduation we scattered all over the world. My parents live in a really small town and I legitimately have no idea how to meet people at all, much less my own age, here. \n\nWhat bothers me most is the change in myself. I was a type A personality in college and my internship, just constantly doing something and getting ahead and the second I finished it all just stopped. My two jobs are relatively easy most of the time so going without the work, and the reward system in the brains response, almost feels like withdrawal. No disrespect to anyone who has dealt with that, it\u2019s not the same but it\u2019s the best comparison I could think of. Combine that with the general feeling that nothing I do has any affect after so many job applications I\u2019m constantly caught between feeling like I need to do something and feeling like it won\u2019t help my situation. I\u2019ve done everything I can think of, I applied at the think tank I worked with, I asked for help at my university\u2019s career center who helped but also said they couldn\u2019t see anything major I was doing wrong.

I did my Bachelor\u2019s Degree in IT which wasn\u2019t my dream major. I\u2019ve always been a creative person and music has been my passion, but of course my parents wouldn\u2019t let me do that because I \u201ccan\u2019t make a career out of music\u201d. I also realized halfway through my undergrad that I had a knack for marketing/PR but I was already too far along in my degree to switch. So I picked IT because it seemed interesting enough to me to want to pursue, and because it\u2019s a high-demand field. Well, it turned out my program was really shitty and I felt like it didn\u2019t prepare me for the field at all. So I decided to go on and continue to do my Master\u2019s in Digital Forensics so I can work in a crime lab (which actually does seem exciting to me). Because I\u2019m an only child, my family does fairly well financially, and I\u2019ve been riding on a couple scholarships, I didn\u2019t work at all during high school or my undergrad. I just wanted to focus on school. I\u2019m only working my first job now because I want to save up to move in with my boyfriend. But it\u2019s a part-time retail job and my parents pick on me all the time and lecture me because I didn\u2019t get a job in my field. I know it\u2019s extremely difficult to find a part-time entry level IT job (especially since the problem of \u201centry level but x years of experience\u201d has been growing lately) so that doesn\u2019t make me feel as bad, but seeing all my friends working adult jobs kind of makes me feel embarrassed. And my manager always jokes that I\u2019m overqualified to work there. But I love my job so much. I work at a Hot Topic so it\u2019s like I can 100% be myself at work.

I avoid her, try not to talk to her, don't go to our shared lunch break in the break room anymore, but she is now talking about me behind my back. I know I've ruined some of my credibility as I have confided with about 4 other teachers who I trust in my frustration even though I'm trying not to stir drama. I don't know what to do, she insults me and my teaching style, mocks my generation and the fact that I'm \"too nice\" and I guess accepting of my students and the changing political climate. It's truly like she just loves clout and is somehow putting my face as the leader of the teacher's who don't like her because I'm the most outspoken of all the other teachers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't wanna make this post ridiculously long, so if you're actually interested I do have more specific details of said racism/homophobia if people are interested.",

I have no idea what my long-term career goals are or if I want to go back to school. If I were to go back to school, what for?

Loved so much, I didn't mind going every day, and was really heartbroken over the idea of ever leaving. The hours were perfect for me. It was theatre, so I was still working 8-12 hours a day, but they were from like noon-midnight or 3pm-11pm. I still had the daylight hours to myself to get things done. I have 2 autoimmune illnesses and Chronic Fatigue, so doctor's appointments were easy to schedule and if I couldn't get out of bed at 7 am, I didn't have to and was still considered a model employee. I loved my co-workers and the environment and really felt like I was making a difference. But, the pay was atrocious. I worked my ass off, but was making barely anything and had no benefits. I was living with my parents and felt severe pressure to \"grow up.\" So I got a new job. Good pay. Amazing benefits. But my greatest fear - 8:30-4:30 are the hours. I've been here for 8 weeks now and it's a lot to not cry every day. Not to sound like a \"precious millennial\" as my mother would call me - but I'm having a hard time. I've dealt with manic depression and anxiety for years but not in this way. Even when I was SUICIDAL in high school and actively self-harming, I didn't feel this way, because I least had a glimmer of hope that it would be over in x amount of years. But now, it's like - is this my life? Everyday? Till I die? 8-5? Pretending like I don't feel like crap every day from my autoimmune problems? Feeling like I have no time for anything other than working and hopefully having enough energy at the end of the day to take my makeup off before collapsing? Crying in my office because I don't feel well and just need to lie down but can't tell anyone because \"this is adulthood\"? My anxiety is constantly through the roof. More panic attacks than ever. I don't know what to do. I just feel absolutely lost and hopeless and like I'm constantly going to crawl out of my skin.  Is this it?",

It's just been me and my dad the past two years.\n\nI've been actively trying to get an apartment for a long time now, but things didn't start happening until last month. I've since done a lot of work in preparation for moving out. I got sick for about two weeks so the move has been delayed a little (officially I've already \"moved\" on the 1st of November, which is when I got my keys). I started the arduous task of deep cleaning the new apartment last weekend but I've had to take a few days off as I pushed myself a little too hard after having just recovered from a very bad flu.\n\nCleaning aside, the only thing left is moving all of my stuff there. My sister has a car and I don't have a whole lot of stuff so it should be doable. I'm more worried about the actual *living* aspect. There are a lot of things that I don't know the first thing about, and I feel like I'm fucking myself over by moving out. But at the same time, I really want to do it! I want to have some privacy, and I want to be able to get my own life moving in some direction. I want freedom, which I don't have if I'm stuck living with my dad.\n\nI've gotten used to so many luxuries by living with my dad all these years. He's always cooked us dinner so I never learned how to cook anything. He did the laundry too and took care of pretty much everything. It might sound like I'm a spoiled piece of shit, but I have my reasons for why it was like this (mostly due to my bad health).\n\nBut now I need to learn to do everything by myself. Also, no more dishwasher! The apartment is too small to get one so I'll have to clean dishes with my bare hands. That's a nightmare for a germaphobe like me. I literally gag by just putting dirty dishes in the machine. Can't get a washing machine for clothes either so I'll have to use the neighborhood's washing machine. No idea how that's gonna go but I'll just have to figure it out.\n\nI don't know if I'm looking for any kind of advice here, I just wanted to vent out some of my frustrations. As awesome as it is to move out and have privacy and freedom, I'm giving up a lot by doing it. But I also acknowledge that my dad won't be around forever to take care of me, and one day it might even be the other way around. Which is why I see this as a necessary step forward. It's gonna suck at first but I'll do what I always did and just figure shit out as I go.",

            "content": "In the past (when I was in my early 20s), I never got the meaning of this line in Kelly Clarkson's song \"Stronger\" whenever it was played on the radio here in Canada. \n\nI thought it didn't even make sense; most things don't kill you, so that means we can all easily become stronger? Smoking isn't going to kill people right away, so does smoking make people stronger?\n\nThen in 2018, I had my first major/emotionally traumatic failure. I've certainly failed before that but it was mostly exams, tests, one or two courses in undergrad \u2014 but all insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  This time I failed my teaching practicum as part of the Bachelor of Education program I was in, and consequently I couldn't advance/graduate the following year as expected. For about 4 months, I was an unstable emotional wreck. I felt ashamed that I might have been the only one who failed their 2-week practicum, out of 300+ people in the program. I was aware that I'm not a naturally assertive person, don't like to raise my voice to call students out on their behaviour, so I lack presence in front of a big classroom but I didn't expect to judged as unqualified to be a teacher. Ultimately, I decided to move on by finding a full-time job and redo my practicum two years later (I have four years to finish the program). \n\nFast forward to 2019 \u2014 I find an admin assistant job but I get laid off 7 months later. Two significant blows to my self-esteem within a year. I was in a daze as I walked out of the office for the last time. \n\nBut I found that I bounced back faster this time than after I failed my practicum. Though I was still feeling excruciatingly empty, I started applying for other jobs the very next day, whereas after the failed practicum it took me about two months to consistently apply for jobs every day, without wallowing in self-pity every ten minutes. I also thought I was more stoic when my manager broke the news to me than I would've expected myself to be. \n\nIn early December, I was offered a full-time job at my alma mater. I'm in a better place now, internally, than I've ever been since I began my 20s. At the same time I know anything can happen/change, so I'm still cautious, but I feel that I'm much better mentally equipped now to take on setbacks/emotionally traumatic events. \n\nI guess at least in my case, and hopefully in many others', failures are the key to success (however you may define it). What I experienced did suffocate me emotionally but didn't utterly kill me/my spirit, so in the end I did actually come out stronger and less sensitive to what people may or may not think about me.\n\nAnyway, I hope that you all have an exceptional new year in spite of setbacks or roadblocks in your life. It is never easy when you are experiencing them but time will show that you've become stronger through the hardships, or at least gained insight about what you want to do and/or what you are truly good at.",

In a bubble, I am getting paid extremely well - probably the top 5% for my graduating class. My performance reviews have been very positive. I actually really do like my team.\n\nI'm a few months short of 2 years at my first job out of college. I don't think I'm very good at  'chilling out.' Recently, I've been feeling pretty agitated at work. Just a general sense of frustration and irritability. These are some of the things I've gotten in a fuss over.\n\n\\-Coworker is basically useless. We have to work in a team of two. They are basically incapable of doing the job properly, and I often have to pick up the slack. Again, serious levels of incompetence considering they have 7 years experience to my 1. \n\n\\-Feeling like our 'back office' bombard me with emails. Me having to give 'accounting' approvals and such. \n\n\\-Even though I get paid **extremely** well, I still think our leadership is chintzy regarding time off and such. No culture of ever being able to leave early, work from home, etc. They made us sit around doing nothing for almost a full day on NYE - almost everyone in our industry was off. I need to get better at demanding my own needs, but I'm going to have unused vacation for 2019.\n\n \\-It seems like I get a bit infantilized. I have learned super quick, but it feels like I don't get enough opportunities to do stuff just because of my age. Again, I am trying to keep it in relativity, but I know I have better judgement than a lot of my senior coworkers\n\nHonestly, I have it pretty great. I just feel like my morale is really low right now. Eventually, I do want a new job. But I want to keep my attitude positive for the time being. I think \\*outwardly\\*, I give off a positive vibe. But I still feel extremely irritable inside.\n\nWhat are some tips to improve this for 2020? \n\nSome things I thought of were:\n\n* getting better at leaving my work at work. Not checking my work email so often\n* Pushing back a little bit internally, as to deadlines and such\n* Talking more openly with my supervisor as to my ambitions\n* Compartmentalizing more between my responsibilities, and other people's.",

I started a slow pace good habit routine to combat my depression.\n\nAnd the routine is brushing my teeth and flossing once a day every day. \n\nIt's been three weeks and it's the longest I have ever done in started a good habit. \n\n2020 I'm not making new years resolution because I have never fully follow through with the past ones. \n\nBut I will do things in 2020 to combat to reach my goals I always wanted to reach. \n\nI also want to add my parents were born in the 40s/50s so they're old school they have admit they're wrong doings and apologies for thier mistakes and I have forgiven them. \n\nThanks for reading.",

And here I am lying to lower my hours of work. Just so I could have days off laying in bed watching Tv and reading books that have zero educational benefits.  I feel so ungrateful for what I have. Idk, I complain a lot that I have so much stress juggling school and work, where while it is true I am stressed, I'm only stressed about all the work I could have finished had I not procrastinated. Stressed about school means I spent 7  hours binge-watching a show and forgot to finish my homework. Which is completely unjustifiable. \n\nI am also too proud for my own good. I'm pretty good with my studies (Here we go again, I HATE MYSELF FOR THIS) and so if I pay attention in class, I rarely study outside of class. And guess what, I get good grades. It had been the same all my schooling life up until now, a freshman in college. I still don't touch my notes until 15 hours before my exam. Doing this, I still got good grades 4/5 classes. Got As and an A+. But the single most important class to me and my life, I got a B. DANG was that a pang to my pride. I went, okay, we are going to study my butt off next semester. But to be completely honest, I don't have the confidence in myself. I know too well how this is gonna go. I'll tell myself its okay, tomorrow. tomorrow. tomorrow. Next thing u know, its 15hrs before an exam. Am I going to be able to do it? IDK I guess I will have to see. \n\nThis makes me look like I hate myself, but don't worry, I love myself, and I have friends and family who loves me. I'm just writing about my thoughts to get it out of my mind so I can look back and face it. Also maybe this is kinda trying to put this negative side of me in 2019 and have a better me in 2020. \n\nHappy New Year to those who read this.",

Earlier in the week for 4 days straight I tried just deleting the app by by the end of day 4 I caved but then that night I deactivated and it feels more permanent so I\u2019m less tempted to go back!\n\nInstagram was giving me severe FOMO and anxiety constantly throughout the day! I was on it all the time comparing my life to the lives of others such as influencers and people I know irl! It was such a toxic environment and truly made me feel like I had a boring life which is far from the truth! \n\nI have previously deleted my ig account when it had 2k followers and it was great for me mentally when I stayed off it for a few months. But now I barely had 180 and I was still constantly anxious to the point where I\u2019d get random outbursts of anger that I\u2019d take out on my bf for not sending me memes or liking someone\u2019s picture when I know it\u2019s not that big a deal.\n\nI hope to improve significantly so I can go back on it in a healthier way once I graduate in May! I do feel flight disconnect from my peers but the ones closest to me I text every day if not every week. \n\nReally think that being young and growing up w social media has made it so addictive that I\u2019ve had severe headaches and sweats since deleting the app off my phone (the 4 days I didn\u2019t go on) .

I don't know. \n\nI used to meditate, journal and practice math daily. I also used to exercise in the gym on a regular basis. On top of that, I managed to successfully cut down my phone usage down to 2.5hours. However, suddenly something happened, I don't know what, and all my habits just came crashing down, one by one. (I must mention here that I likely do have something like CPTSD, but that's another subject, and I'm very ambitious and harsh to myself because I want to do everything in my power to secure the topmost place in whatever I do, in order to avoid feeling inferior to people)\n\nNothing seems to motivate me anymore. School? The prospect of getting into a good college? Improving myself to find a beautiful and amazing girlfriend someday? The latter used to motivate me a lot. It made me do insane things. However, right now it's like, none of these seem important enough for me to take action. I don't know how to describe this feeling. Yeah, it sort of seems like nothing matters as much as it used to do. \n\nTaking action has become very difficult. Well, I sometimes catch myself thinking \"*man, you're just lazy. You're making up excuses in order to avoid taking action. You just gotta force yourself, break through that initial barrier of resistance and keep going. Rise and grind!*\", but I doubt it's the case. I'm like, sick of it to be fair. It doesn't matter anymore, this whole \"grind\" thingy has got the best of me. Now I found myself using my phone for 7 hours straight.\n\nI stopped meditating. Why? Because I've been doing this for the past 3 months, every single day, to no avail. I'm trying my best, I even bought this book called Mindfulness in plain english, but I'm still stuck on the \"nimitta/sign\" part, because I'm frustrated and I can't achieve it so I can't progress further. Not to mention the lack of any significant benefits from this practice whatsoever.\n\nThe feeling is hard to describe, it's like, I technically \"could\" take action, I know I could, yet it's 10 times harder than usual, and I give up 5 times faster than usual. I don't see a point in that anymore. I lost my entire motivation to self-improvement, and all I am doing is engaging in instant gratification and using my phone to play games or mindlessly surf the internet. It feels like I'm getting numb. \n\nI don't feel sadness, I... well, do I even feel anything? It feels pretty weird as I do not feel anything in particular. Life seems dull, boring and not exciting. Well, I have to correct myself. I do feel emotions. But these emotions are either those quick, fleeting experiences gained as a result of instant gratification, or the negative ones. \n\nI'm barely able to get out of bed. It's not like I am extremely sad, or something. I just don't see the point, why should I get up earlier, if the only thing I'm going to do is slack off all the fucking day?\n\nOr am I just weak and lazy?

Anyway,... a little about me: I'm a 25 year old guy. I'm not the sort of person to sit at home playing computer games or anything like that.

I wake up at 8am in the week (a nice lie-in compared to most jobs), then do very little in my office job, find it easy and stress-free despite it being boring. All of this I don't mind though as I don't like stress. I then go to the gym for 2 hours after work and lift weights. I then go home and sleep for day 2. When the weekend comes I usually do the same sort of thing... see friends, go for dinner, get very drunk somewhere and usually spend Sunday hungover and sleeping. I have friends that have goals like becoming a millionaire or having \u00a31m in assets (property) or generally very career driven but I don't want the long days and stress that comes with this.\n\nI'm happy with a simple life without the stress and increases leisure/home time to do things I enjoy. I wake up and it's light outside and get home before it's dark. I do feel guilty sometimes because naturally I can push myself very hard (eg at the gym I work very hard) and sometimes I do feel guilty that I should want or expect more out of life.\n\nI don't know if it's laziness being how I am. I've seen posts like this before on Reddit but the difference is, usually the person who writes it says things like \"I don't know what I want out of life - I don't have a job, play computer games and watch porn through the day, don't leave my messy bedroom and don't socialise with friends apart from gamer friends\". That's not my personality at all however I guess the similar theme is I don't want much other than stress-limitation.\n\nI guess the only goal I have for this year is to find a girlfriend. However even then I'm not going to actively force this. If it happens it happens but I'm not going to chase anything especially if it leads to stress. Also if I feel the relationship is going to lead to stress then I quickly cut it off.\n\nIs it weird to want so little from life and be happy with a minimalistic, simple life?",

You\u2019re damned right, actually. I got up, I did my usual routine, I did positive things through out the day besides a nap, cause New Years stuff left me a bit tired. But I just finished my list. Lists, honestly. I made a budgeting and a scheduling for my day to day within the week, so I can focus on my passion and create. I have a great work schedule that leaves me with plenty of time and I haven\u2019t utilized it other than to explore the new area I live in.

Graduate with a PhD, and get a faculty position in an institution that adds value to my field and community that is important to me (i.e. my dream job). To achieve this, I dedicate 1 hour everyday to working on a manuscript, build collaborations, and learn to be a better speaker.\n2. Find a companion, and hopefully have family. To do this, I am going to put out the energy into the universe that I'm open to love, and allow myself to be loved by others around me.\n3. Get my weight down to 120 pounds, maintain that, and run a marathon. IF is slowly becoming a regular part of my routine and I cant see myself turning my back on it. I am also going to slowly start training for a marathon and try to run one every other year from when I graduate from my PhD.\n4. Live intentionally in the world-- so that I moderate my consumption in all aspects and make my living more sustainable. For this, I will revisit a checklist every 6 months (food, entertainment, clothes, plastic usage etc) to keep myself on track. \n\nGood humans -- what are your decade goals?",

            "content": "I am a 23 year old and I still live at home with my family. It\u2019s winter break now, so I\u2019ve kind of had some time to think. Firstly, I\u2019m jobless. Longest job I\u2019ve ever held was 5 months. (People can\u2019t ever believe only 5 months) So I\u2019ve been going to community college for about 4 years now on and off. (Don\u2019t take that lightly) I FINALLY have almost all of my prerequisites for the field I chose, in dental hygiene. I absolutely have no idea if this is what I want to do. I spent all these years  messing around and not taking anything serious. I feel so much less confident now like a completely different person than who I use to be and if I could go back in time to change It all I would in a heartbeat. I know I messed up and now I have to deal with it. (Suffer?) my life is filled with depression but I mostly feel lost and alone and very confused about who I am and where I am in my life. \n\nMy brother (18) lives at home with me and my parents and he also is just now starting community college. Like o said, I am struggling and my entire family knows it, and my brother randomly decides to have this huge ego and get into all of my life\u2019s business and drama and he tries to find me at any low point he can. He points it out to my parents so that they favor him and forget about me? He\u2019s JUST NOW starting to almost subtly bully me and he constantly tries to \u201cbrag\u201d about how he\u2019s moving out soon. Which I think he\u2019s actually just saying that to make me feel bad or lesser or lower than him. Just my luck, he randomly this year decides to act like this and treat me like that. The problem with this is that my confidence is so so low now, not like it use to be. I try to tell my parents what about this small situation and they feel bad for me and say they\u2019re sorry there\u2019s nothing they can do to really help. Which I kind of understand. They can\u2019t spank my brother. So I\u2019m really stuck in that situation. My brother now makes me feel worse and very uncomfortable to live with and makes my anxiety and therefore insomnia so much worse. \n\nI\u2019m also currently seeing a therapist once a week. I\u2019ve tried medication for depression and anxiety (last semester in fall) and I felt like I was in a constant depressive dream. I felt so strange and felt like nothing was real. I\u2019ve been off my medicine for about 4 months now. \n\nBasically, my life seems to be stuck still and that can only make things worse. I\u2019ve lost all of my friends due to my own embarrassment. I\u2019ve lost myself. I feel like because I feel I have no personality to be better I can\u2019t get better or be successful. I know I burden my family especially my mom. And they\u2019ve always supported me, which makes me feel almost worse. I want to give them the world and pay them back for this. I know they want me to be happy I feel like I\u2019m letting everyone including myself down. I\u2019ve tried everything it seems but it never is a success. I\u2019m lost any advice would be appreciated, no idea what to do. I know talking helps for me, so that\u2019s why I decided to post this.",

I reported my bully (the damage he has done to me was worth like 250$ so i came out on top), my hygiene improved (i started using floss and mouthwash, q-tips, face cleaning gels and stuff), i graduated my school and my new school is 1000x better. Im drinking at least 1.5 litre of water each day and i hardly ever eat candy bars. Im living in a dorm and i met a lot of awesome people here. I kissed the girl of my life on a new years eve party. I started working out (not a lot tbh, just like 40 pushups a day and some situps) and i already see some results. Life is so much better now.

We have been working very hard on building a positive dynamic at home in terms of boundaries between each other,  in the way we raise our daughter, and compromising and respecting each other\u2019s feelings in terms of seeing other people and allowing each other equal time to do what they want. \n\nWe are both doing a great job of this and honestly are handling the best we can. Most nights are really good between us and having this time and space between each other has really strengthened our ability to communicate and a vast amount of hard feelings have been put to bed. \n\nHowever, for me, I\u2019m struggling to accept the fact that she has feelings for a guy who she gas lighted me for a year to not worry about. For our daughter and our dynamic, I\u2019m trying to let these feelings go so she can be happy and that I don\u2019t let it cause issues at home. I\u2019ve tried to see another girl, get back in the swing of things, but it\u2019s just not something I want to do at this time. I want to be in a good headspace for myself before I devote that time to someone because I want to actually mean it and be who I am. \n\nSo for my family and for my own self, I want to let this go so I can began to be truly happy and enjoy this time that I still have. I\u2019m working on forgiving her so I can allow the pain, anger, and other negative feelings go so I can open up room for happiness. \nWhat are so suggestions from people who may have been in a similar situation and what are some resources to help with this? I don\u2019t expect to do everything perfectly, but I want to preserve the happiness that I have towards her so it doesn\u2019t affect our dynamic for our daughter. \n\nI attend therapy and have began to work on being active.

            "content": "In my early teens, I was interested in building model airplanes, then I moved onto airsoft(expensive electric guns, not walmart stuff).  Then I played video games a lot, after that, longboarding, then more recently I've kind of become a coffee nerd and now the idea of getting into guns/shooting as a hobby is interesting to me because I've always thought guns were cool but never been old enough to have the money or maturity to handle the idea of gun ownership before.  However, as with any hobby, it can get expensive and I don't want to sink money into it again just like every other hobby just to get bored of it eventually.  I got into coffee and different brewing methods, learning how to make it well, etc. about a year ago and while I still enjoy coffee, as well as airsoft, longboarding, video games, etc, they're not near as interesting to me anymore.\n\nMy problem with getting into guns as a hobby is that I don't know if it's a financially wise decision.  I'm going to college and working a part time job where I make about $750/mo. but few expenses apart from my phone bill and car insurance, etc.  I've been setting aside some money to save up for the gun I wanted to buy but I know the most frugal choice would be to leave it in there, because the car I have now is a beater and I want to get rid of it and get a more decent one.\n\nTwo questions:  \n\n1.  Is jumping hobbies like this normal?  I feel like other people have pretty stable hobbies whereas I often gain and lose interest in a hobby quickly.  I almost feel doomed when I start to get interested in something else because I know I'm going to get bored of it eventually, but I manage to convince myself that I'll stick with it and get a lot out of it.  \n\n\n2.  Although I know it would be an expensive hobby, it's hard to let my interest in guns and shooting \"pass me by\" so to speak without getting a chance to try it out or \"satiate\" my interest in it.  I know that just saving my money would be the most financially smart thing but having no hobby and relying on YouTube, Reddit, and Netflix to entertain me gets really boring, really quick.",

            "content": "I've been miserable for as long as i can remember. I keep thinking that every new stage of my life will be better and i will find happiness - but its quite the opposite. Wherever I go, there I am. I just keep hoping that there will be a time in my life were i wont be miserable. There are moments where i am completey content, like when im drunk or distracted by the internet. However the bad times usually outweigh the good. I feel aimless, depressed, and unmotivated to take any action to improve my life.\n\nI'm currently in my first year at a university away from my home town, and am anxious about going back. Mostly, about seeing the people i live with again. I retreat into my room for weeks on end. I spend my time sleeping, watching YouTube videos, and listening to podcasts. My studies have suffered. I don't attend my lectures and have had to drink 4-5 shots of vodka to get myself to attend compulsory ones (e.g. when im giving a presentation).\n\nI have a very poor diet. I get so anxious about interacting with others that i resent spending large amounts of time in the shared kitchen. Therefore i don't cook and usually only eat cereal and takeout food. Since coming home over break i have eaten lots of junk food and also drank quite heavily which has resulted substantial weight gain in a short time - which i know people are going to notice.\n\nI come from a very different background than almost every single person ive met at university and i really do not fit in. I'm the butt of quite a lot of jokes (which i don't necessarily mind, in fact i would say i make about 90% of them) but sometimes feel extremely isolated and more like people are laughing at me rather than with me. I expect a reaction to this along the lines of \"hey, they're not you're friends\" or \"they are bad people\". But here's the thing - they're not. They are genuinely really nice and get along with everyone else just fine. They always make an effort to invite me on nights out (which i accept most of the time and enjoy) and i can tell they are worried about me, but don't really know how to bring it up. I think the problem solely lies with me and my inability to connect with others. I've never been in a relationship. I'm still a virgin and haven't even kissed anyone since i was like 10. I rarely cry but the few times i have during my time at uni have just been me silently weeping into my pillow from the loneliness i felt.\n\nI have friends back home, but literally never see them in person. Even before i moved away, i would never see them outside of school. Now i only talk to them in xbox live parties (which is literally 99% of the \"socialising\" I do in a given week). If i didnt talk to them, i couldnt imagine how completely alone i would feel.\n\nI believe most of my problems boil down to my lack of confidence and self-esteem, for which there are two main factors. (1) My weight and (2) the way i talk.\n\nI've been fat my entire life. I think this is the main cause of my lack of confidence but i've heard stories of former-fatties whose problems didnt go away with weight loss like they expected. If i lost the fat and become physically fit, I think i would be considered above average looks wise (but then again i guess most people would think this about themselves).\n\nI also mumble and speak very softly, which results in people mishearing what i say about 50% of the time. It doesn't help that i have a strong regional accent, but even my own family need me to repeat myself more often than not. I think i speak at a loud enough tone but evidently not, and it feels like im shouting when repeating what i said. I believe this is why i actively avoid conversations with people - it is humiliating to be asked to repeat yourself multiple times (and i know its awkward for the other person too). I feel like if i try too hard to speak clearly, im either shouting or exaggerating an already strong and unfamiliar accent, which people sometimes find funny (not that i mind, but it can be annoying when you are trying to have a normal conversation). In groups i usually just stay completely quite, which is something i never used to do.\n\nI don't even know what i expect or want from the people that actually read this as to why i've posted it in multiple subreddits i've found helpful over the years. But maybe it was good to write it all down as i've never opened up about this to anyone or even admitted there was an issue.

I keep getting the feeling that they just feel bad for me. I have no car, and hate the idea of having someone pick me up. I was walking to 4 miles to and from work, even though my coworker offered it, because i didn't want him going out of his way. I settled with meeting him on the only street that leads up the hill to the job-site, which is still 2 miles away from me and the job-site. I have trouble talking to people that want to be friends, but I know what I want to say and ask but it never really fits. I can talk to people just fine, but struggle with maintaining friendships. I feel little connection with people now, especially since I lost my best friend of 17 years. I've run into old friends that offer to go out, but I never know if it's sincere and feel too embarrassed to ask. On top of that, I don't want them to feel like I just turned a casual invite into an obligation.",

I'm doing reasonably OK, according to my program standards, but I know deep down that I can definitely be better. \n\nMy day recently just seems to go in a haze; though I am making small progress daily, I know theoretically I can do a lot more. But that's just it right - theoretically we can do anything at all. I really want to attain that theoretical efficiency maximum, but I always fall short. My ideal day would be wake up early, work, lunch, work, gym, dinner, work and repeat - with appropriate time for socialization and hygiene. But no matter how motivated I am in the morning, I always slack off during the day. As I said, I do manage to get work done to appear to be a good student, but I know that I have more within me. \n\nAnother thing is that I have been single for my entire life now, and I have reached the age where I realized that most of my friends are actually more content with their SOs than with me. I have roommates, and each night I come home, they're always with their SOs, and I get hit by a wave of loneliness. I have tried to be with someone, but it has never reached a stage of commitment from the other side. I try to convince myself that they're wasting time with their SOs, which is kind of true - but neither am I being miraculously productive. I want to solve this conundrum - if I am single, I should be able to devote more time to my academics right? But it just never happens. I think I'm at this cynical viewpoint, where I view everyone with an SO with distaste. How do I change this attitude?\n\nAny ideas of improvement on both topics would be really appreciated.",

We broke up because there was some guy in our 9th grade class she'd always talk to and eventually I couldn't take it anymore and I left her and they started dating, while i was alone for a month waiting to enroll in my new classes, I masterbated more than 3 times a day to the thought of them fucking and it just kept getting worse. To sum things up i eventually got into financial domination and Forced-Feminzation and realized something needed to change. I have now quit financial domination, not being able to afford it, But i can't get the thoughts of being humiliated, cuckolded and turned into a girl out of my head, I watched a lot of hypnosis videos, telling me im a loser, not a man, am a women, a beta male, etc. and now thats all I think,\n\nI have a new girlfriend now and she constantly has to deal with my insecurity, and lack of energy/fatigue from binging on porn everyday.

Making friends seems hard to me now, but female friends is another   story, since i left school i dont remember having a female friend, i   just don't know how to, i try to behave with them as i do with my   friends but for some reason i scare them away, that's when i have that   voice in my head called low self-esteem saying that im too ugly and  unworthy for them to like me, deep down i know they can see through my   insecurities but there is nothing i can do.\n\n3  months ago i finally stop enjoying playing games and all my problems   came to ground, since then i have been trying to meet people online, i   did meet a wonderful smart woman who i started to develop some interest,   the thing is, she is working and she has a stable life and im ashamed   of still being dependent of my parents and still have a college degree   to complete from scratch, but we kept talking 4 or 5 hours per day till  we start developing feelings, for one week we shared how much we like  each other but i felt something was wrong she was not sharing something  with me, after a couple of days insisting she told me she cant be with  me because she is married and im till today depressed, i don't know how  to handle this situation any more, she says she loves me but don't know  what to do, and i wonder if this is honesty or manipulation\n\nI   cant find any motivation to learn new things, study, be more social or   chase my goals.One week ago i did my first step and went to my college   psychiatry because its free but, she only asked me questions, it was  me  talking the whole time, i don't know if its suppose to be like that  but i  don't feel any improvement at all,  the only thing that i   realized was  how big my problems actually are but i see no light in the  end of the  tunnel.\n\nThe only  thing that helps  me through the day is reading motivational e-books and  read about  psychology, it helps me have a better sense of me and raise  my awareness  to deal with life the best and most comfortable way i  can, but one  thing is understanding the concept and another is apply it  in real life,  i don't have money to go out, my money is just for  college and food and  some occasionally coffees with friends, the few i  still have because  most of them next year will finish college and i  will find myself alone.\n\nI  hate  that i waste so many time of my life playing games instead of  fixing my  problems, i hate that i no longer feel motivated to learn  stuff and i  can see how that  harmed my social interactions because most  of times  im the guy who only listen and i feel like i have nothing to  say hence,  i feel im dumb as hell i lost my ability to engage in smart   conversations because i know nothing about the topic and people just   loss interest in me.\n\nIf you know how to get out of rabbit hole please teach me because all i see is darkness",

The feeling that whatever you do, there's always someone better.   \n\n\nMaybe I'm just feeling pretty discouraged from a tough internship hunt and I'm seriously afraid that if I don't land something, my career upon graduation will be absolutely screwed. I've applied to 100 positions so far, and I've had a few interviews with competitive and/or big companies, so the chances of success are pretty small. I've started putting more focus on smaller companies but I'm wondering if it's already too late? I've signed up for my school's spring semester career fair in February and I'm hoping to land something before then, but if not, it's my best shot. It's a sense of dread where the clock is ticking and if I don't get industry-related job experience before I graduate, then I'm going to end up jobless when I finish school.\n\nLooking at engineering Reddits hasn't really helped things, people in every subreddit says that their field has dried up, or that even with a good GPA and EC's it's impossible to land a good entry level job, or that even with an internship it's still difficult. I tell myself that there's plenty of people who have successful careers despite \"starting late\", and that there's plenty of people out there with the same struggles as I do, and that academic-wise, I'm doing pretty good. I've held a summer job where I taught kids some techy stuff and I'm doing independent research in a lab, although the latter doesn't really help my imposter syndrome because everything is so niche and complex and I feel like everyone there is so much smarter than me.  \n\n\nBut compared to those who already have internships or those who can achieve the same results in class as I do even with less effort, I feel like I'm nothing. And I can't really talk about these troubles with many friends, because I dislike hearing the \"you'll be fine\" or \"you're doing better than many people\" type responses. I want to figure out how to improve myself. I've signed up for my school's career services for resumes and mock interviews and all that jazz. Now that my hardest classes are out of the way, I'll be networking more and doing more EC's. But I don't know how to get out of this mental rut and I don't know if my fears about my careers are justified or if I'm in big trouble and I'm not sure if I'm missing anything major.  \n\n\nTLDR: Imposter syndrome, college junior studying engineering. Struggling with finding internships and worried about my career as a result. Good GPA + research experience but there's so many other people much smarter than me. Made a plan for self improvement but still struggling with self esteem and fear of the future.",

She told me that if I can't bring my grades up by the end of the semester, which is in three weeks, I will go to live with my dad. \n\n   Now, to give you some context, let me tell you a little bit about me. Since eighth grade or so I have slowly started to care less and less about school. I normally don't do homework, sometimes I don't do classwork, and this year, I have started to bomb most of my tests. In the past, I have normally pulled my grades up to A's and B's at the last minute. This hasn't worked for me this school year though, because my classes have gotten harder and I really haven't put much effort into them. It's not that I don't understand the work, I just procrastinate and don't apply myself. Currently, I have failing grades in four classes. My GPA is a 3.3, not including this school year. \n\n   This has been really hard on my mom. My performance in school stresses her out on a daily basis and just adds onto the stress of her job. She has tried everything to get me to do my work. She takes my phone, grounds me so I can't see my friends or girlfriend, put me on medication for my depression, given me appointments with a counselor every week, even changed my school because I wasn't happy at my old high school, as well as the countless lectures I have been given on how school should be my top priority. Nothing has worked. It is not just her either, my grandparents have begged me to keep up with school, my dad and stepmom have talked to me about it, as well as various other family friends. \n\n   She says that she's had enough and that she gives up. She told me that she has given up on her dream for my future and that she cannot stand it anymore. She wants to send me to my dads for this reason, as well as the fact that my dad and I are very similar. She said multiple times that there is no way that I am getting into college. She thinks that I need to learn discipline, and my only other option aside from college is the military. So, sometime soon, she is going to take me to see a Marines recruiter to talk to. I have absolutely zero interest to join the military, by the way. Nor do I want to live with my dad. He lives about an hour away from my house, and in a different city. The few good friends I have all live in my city, as well as my girlfriend of six months. \n\n   After the lecture, I came upstairs to my room and honestly, I just feel numb. I would like to continue to live at my moms house but I don't know if I can fix my grades by the end of the three weeks, or if I even have the will to do so. Now I turn to you Reddit for advice.",

Next to none of my responsibilities get done, and even though I do manage to get by sometimes, it\u2019s mostly due to raw luck. I have tried get out of this on my own, through the help of journaling, routines, short-term goals, etc, but all these have only last for the short term, a week or two at best. I\u2019ve talked to this to my mother, she got me a life-coach, and I\u2019ve been having sessions with a psychotherapist for 3-4 months now (diagnosed Moderate Depression, but still), I followed their advice, but not much has changed. It\u2019s gotten to a point where It\u2019s very hard for me to get fully engaged in anything, as I am mostly on \u201cautomatic mode\u201d, meaning that most of the time, I am either not completely aware of what I doing, or I recognize what I\u2019m doing, but can\u2019t bring myself to stop. Emotionally speaking, up until a few months all of this produced massive amounts of self-loathing and frustrating. It\u2019s there, but now it\u2019s sort of numbed down with an attitude of hopelessness, apathy, even cynicism. In other words, every time I think of something that might work, my first instinct is to dismiss out of disbelief and telling myself \u201cso?\u201d \u201cLike that\u2019ll work.\u201d \u201cWhy even bother?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the point if I know how that\u2019s going to go down?\u201d Etc. For an origin, I was doing great up until my final semester of sophomore year(two years ago, I skipped junior year) but ever since then, my performance and productivity has been declining. As to why, I have no idea; or rather, I have plenty of ideas, they\u2019re just unfounded at best. First off, I live with my high-income mother, and even though I lived away from her during high school and stayed at my grandfather\u2019s house, he really wasn\u2019t doing badly in any sort of way, and I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have a very loving family. Besides, I did great in my first sophomore semester(I did sophomore and senior years living there), so theoretically, there shouldn\u2019t be any reason why I\u2019m behaving or thinking like this. What I\u2019m thinking is that it may be a growth stage, which would mean the problem is eventually going to sort itself out. It could be the case that I\u2019m too attached to my phone. Another thing to consider is that I didn\u2019t grew up with a father, though I have no idea what that could cause. One other psychologist I went to one time said that the most likely reason was brain chemistry, and so the solution was a diagnosis from a psychiatrist. I could go on all night on possible causes, but all of them ultimately end up unfounded, untestable, or disproven by my own previous attempts. Given how my current state is even worst than I thought possible, I thought of taking matters into my own hands even if I see no realistic way out of this mess. The problem is, my critical thinking abilities have been compromised so much, I highly doubt I know where to start or that I can manage to figure that much out. \n\nSorry for the long post!",

            "content": "Hi all, \n\nThis question has come up for me because I've just broken up with a partner recently and one of the things that's become obvious in the wake of this break-up is that I don't really know what to do with myself when I'm alone. When I was in the relationship I spent a lot of my time thinking about the relationship when I was alone, over analysing it. It served as a distraction from my own life and generally if I wasn't thinking about it then I would be watching Twitch, playing video games, occasionally using porn or reading. \n\nThis has happened to me in previous relationships as well. It feels like once I'm with someone I feel like I don't have to improve, and then when I'm not with someone I continually think about either my ex or finding a future partner. All of which means I'm generally not thinking about my own life, goals or values.\n\nOther people around me think I'm doing fine. For context, I'm 25, have a Masters degree in Counselling and Psychotherapy and work part-time tree planting. But inside I feel an emptiness and I have little motivation to look for a full-time job in my field. Even the completion of my Masters feels hollow as for much of my degree I didn't feel like I wanted to be there but I stuck it out because it seemed like the \"right thing to do\". I do enjoy counselling people but I also don't think it's what I truly want to be doing. Part of me has always dreamed of being a writer or musician but I've never put a whole lot of effort into either. \n\nSo all-in-all I feel stuck. I'm still living at home with my parents and planning to move out in the next 6 weeks. I hope that that will put some fire into me and change things as I feel like I've been repeating the same cycle of avoiding myself since I graduated high school. \n\nHas anyone else faced similar struggles and have some direction for me, or any basic ideas on how to tackle this issue? \n\nThanks for reading.",

I am worried that I will live with my parents forever; my  brother had a mental breakdown earlier this year, and it appears that  that will be where he'll end up.\n\nAs  I grow older, I am becoming more concerned about having a financially  stable life when I become an adult.

I\u2019m a 27 year old male who just accepted an awesome new job with a significant increase in salary, but I still can\u2019t seem to break out of this funk I\u2019ve been in. I\u2019m not saying my quality of life is tied directly to income, but I figured it would help not feeling guilty for buying a soda instead of putting that dollar aside for rent/bills. \n\nI was hoping a new job would help spark something, but I just don\u2019t seem to have the desire to actually better myself. I\u2019m out of shape (multiple back surgeries makes it difficult to find exercise that doesn\u2019t actually hurt), have only one friend (roommate), and just don\u2019t seem to care about anything anymore. Smoked daily until I found out about this new job so I stopped a few months ago. Not even sure if I miss it and I never cared for alcohol. \n\nI used to enjoy watching Razorback football and basketball, but now basing my enjoyment on kids 5+ years younger than me playing a game seems childish. Back home I would play ultimate frisbee with some friends, but constantly being the one to put in all the effort to make anything happen got exhausting. I haven\u2019t so much as texted anyone in months outside of collecting money for winning fantasy football this year. When asked about hobbies or what I do in my free time I always mention exploring with my dogs. My patience is at an all time low for even doing that when they don\u2019t always listen I just get frustrated and snap at them. \n\nIt seems like I have an excuse for everything and a reason why doing something to better myself won\u2019t work. I guess I\u2019m here asking.. What can I do to actually make positive strides in my life that I will actually stick with? I\u2019ve begun riding a stationary bike 5 of 6 days so far so I guess that\u2019s a start. \n\nI\u2019ve never been able to actually open up to people in person and feel like a bother when I\u2019m expressing feelings so anonymously turning to reddit was unfortunately the best idea I came up with. \n\nThanks in advance and go hogs.",

I actually gave THAT up when I started my self development grind. \n\nI played in bands and did solo acoustic stuff all throughout high school (age 14-18) but then got really bad mental health my freshman year of college and stopped performing for that time... which led me to self development in the first place.\n\nSo now, in 2020 i\u2019m back on my music grind and have some friends getting ready to start and band and move forward. I am super excited and grateful that I have found this path again... but, I feel unsatisfied with my current habits.\n\nIt\u2019s like, as i\u2019m transitioning into music as my main focus, my great self development habits have fell behind a bit.

For this year I want to finally \"win the war\".    \nSo to begin with, I am a 20 years old girl, student and already working in the field I want(CyberSecurity), and growing in that field, so far so good,ah?  \n\nBut with all of that I constantly have something poking me, and making me think that I am not good enough, that I am an imposter, and I will never reach my goals. And this has become like a cycle to me since high school, it's always the same, I go out of the \"Not worthy, not good enough\" hole, things are fine for a bit, and then I just go there again. I know that everyone has doubts, but I want to be able to just \"ignore\" them and not put so much energy in that. The irony is that in my career I have a success that people my age rarely have, and I do realize it, but still, this doesn't stop me from doubting myself.  \n\n\nOn the other hand is my other life destroyer, even thou I have fairly good social life, friends and so on. I have never been in a relationship, I had sex only a couple of times in my life, and in my circle of friends my closest friends when someone mentions that they are going to have sex tonight or the whole weekend, something just dies inside of me. I feel that no boy/man was ever interested in me or ever liked me, I am always the third wheel, if boy starts going out with me and a girlfriend of mine, it is always my girlfriend they are after. On the other hand all my friends tell me that I am not ugly, but then when nobody ever approaches me, ever, I start getting the feeling that my friends are lying to me just to make me feel good.   \n\n\nAnd for the past let's say 4 months I've been battling myself just to understand what the hell is wrong with me. And well people just view me as the sneakers/jeans type of girl(or a bro), even thou I can say I am very stylish, and I do wear \"girly\" stuff from time to time, so I am not a butch at all. I know it could be worse, because even thou there is something off with me, I don't have weight problems or deformities, which some people here are also fighting with.  \nThing is I can't fix who I am, how I look and so on. So this is the next thing I want to get rid off, I am tired of feeling unwanted and ugly, and this only made me a very sour and negative person. Sometimes I can't even look at myself in the mirror. But every time I get the courage and turn to my positive self and start believing that I am not that bad, start dressing up, and in general feel good about who I am, things like \"This boy was ever a friend with me just to go out with me and my friend, because he likes her\". And everything is shattered. \n\n  \nOn this matter I am not sure how to approach it, if I have to accept that it won't ever happend to me(love,sex,passion, whatever), and just live my life and don't give a fuck if I am alone, because at least I have some self-worth and won't settle for someone just so I am not alone. Or I should try to improve the vibes I give off?  \n\nI am not sure if both issues are not somehow related to each other? And I would be glad if people here that were in somewhat the same situation, can share their experience, because for me it is like we are several people in one body and constantly fight. And in the end I have become my own worst enemy, and have put myself inside a pretty painful cycle of self-hatred and doubt.",

It had gotten so bad to the point that I had dropped out of college because I didnt know what I wanted out of my life. I didnt know whether i wanted to help my mother living in a hard situation with an emotionally abusive ex spouse, or try and follow my dreams to pursue music and try to be happy. My mom chooses to live with him and I think it's up to me to get her out. So I stress about what I'm doing with my life productively more than ever. I had no idea what to study in school and wasnt sure how to further pursue my dreams so I became depressed and thought I was worthless. I can't seem to maintain a steady work ethic because of this so I'm stuck in this loop where I'm getting by, living paycheck by paycheck to make rent at home, dealing with occasional outbursts from my mothers ex spouse, and feeling like a failure.

I'm wondering if anyone else has ever felt stuck and if so, how did you motivate yourself to get out? What have you told yourself to stay motivated and keep going until you became happy?",

I know for a fact that this isn't true and sex is a normal thing but for some reason I can't reason with my feelings. If I went for what my heart says then I'll being single forever because the type of girls I like cannot exist as virgins. They must have had partners in past.

I have my schedule, workout app, audio books, podcasts, music, social media, banking, and more games than I can count. \n\nBut a while ago I discovered the feature of seeing how much time I spend on the phone... It was not fun discovering I spend several hours on it each day, most with REALLY stupid apps. I mean, it can be great to use the phone to relax or just have something to do, but when realizing I spent 3 hours playing solitaire it gets a bit... sad. Especially since my husband is the same, and we spend evenings \"watching\" a show together while aimlessly scrolling through our phones and missing half the plot. Lying in bed awake checking instagram for the 10th time that day. Or hiding in the bathroom at work playing games (I'm ashamed so admit it has happened **a lot** when I get stressed).   \nI'm not talking about answering one too many emails in the evening or always being on call. I'm not nearly important enough for that to be a problem. No, I'm talking about using the phone as a crutch, a safe space, because it is a good way to hide from socializing or to pass the time (and distract myself from all the things I *should* be doing).\n\nSo I have decided to change. But the problem with habits is that you do it without thinking. And in this technological world it's hard to just leave the phone at home. So I did something drastic. From 9 am to 4 pm, and from 7 pm to 6 am, I have blocked my phone use. There is a function (at least on iphone) called screen time, where you can schedule screen free time. Also, you can set certain apps to always be available. Mine are phone, messages, email, podcasts (listening is not as limiting as looking), music and calculator (because I have a nerdy job). \n\nThe screen free time is set with a code. And here comes the genius part. I don't have the code. My husband does. And he loves the power (maybe a little too much) and will never give it up unless absolutely necessary (like if we have a vacation and I'll allow myself some extra phone time. \n\nSo far I have been more productive at work, better at cleaning at home, and I have started reading books again. Hoping to keep it up (unless I snap and torture the code out of my husband). \n\nWish me luck! Any more advice on how to break the addiction are more than welcome!",

            "content": "hello everyone. I've been stalking here for a few days and I think I'm ready to post. im hoping posting might give me some sort of accountability, which is what I really need right now.\n\nmy entire life I've been an absolute mess. multiple mental health issues, toxic relationships with those close to me, extreme codependency, and always being told I wasn't living up to my high potential has basically defined me. I always knew I couldn't sustain this, but it was what I'd always done, so I never really took change seriously. last year, I graduated high school, to the surprise of everyone, including me, and this past fall I went off to college, expecting to just continue my habits in a semi-miserable way as I always had. \n\nit was hell. I've been severely depressed before, once even hospitalized, but none of it was like this. I started out the semester with straight As, held onto them until about 75% in, and then I just didn't leave my bed for a week. I didn't understand. I had been relatively fine, I hated college, of course, but I had pretty much never been satisfied with my circumstances before so that wasn't anything major. this was different. here I was, now an adult, who felt like my entire mental growth had been stunted at the age of 13. my hygiene was nonexistent, my self esteem even more so, and I realized I'd been on the most default form of autopilot possible for practically my whole life.\n\nI finished the semester with all Cs. it was disappointing. a small part of me had thought maybe things would change magically once I graduated, but I now realize I was wrong. if I want change, im going to have to commit to doing it.\n\nI've spent all of break preparing to fix things for myself. I have issues with handwriting (dysgraphia) so I've created digital agendas, note taking systems, calendars, planners, and a daily review for me to fill out at the end of each day to help make sure im doing what I need. on top of that, I've created a list of goals for myself.\n\nevery day, I should:\n\n* brush my teeth\n* shower\n* do something for my skin (either my whole routine or just one step)\n* stretch\n* do whatever that day's \"chore\" is (I have one thing assigned to each day of the week, except Saturdays, which are my free days)\n* try to reach out and talk with one person, either through text or in person\n* go to sleep and wake up at my scheduled times\n* go to my classes\n\nto me, this simultaneously seems like a ton and not nearly enough. not enough in the idea that these are normal things most people do without thinking. almost too much in the fact that I know I will get depressed, I will feel miserable, and I will make mistakes. I've decided that that's okay. if I mess up, I refuse to punish myself. in a way, Ive been punishing myself enough already. the point isn't to get everything right all the time. it's just to try. \n\nany support, tips, encouragement, hell, even critique would be appreciated. I know the basics of hygiene, like what soap and shampoo are, but the rest is kind of blurry, so random hair care/skin scare/ any other type of routine could be useful! I also kind of want to make things fun :) I've ordered some products and im actually really excited to try them out. im trying to learn some recipes I can cook in my dorms kitchen. just things like that, to keep my excited and motivate me into taking care of myself.\n\nI also just want to say a quick good luck to other people on similar journeys! I have faith in everyone and I'm ready to finally meet thee great person I know I can be. :)",

            "content": "... and believe me, it\u2019s not the same thing.\n\nAfter ten years of doing stuff, I\u2019ve realized something. Most of the advice flying around is not to shoot yourself in the leg. Stuff like \u201cdon\u2019t spend beyond your means\u201d and \u201cexercise\u201d and \u201cread a book from time to time\u201d. And that\u2019s good advice. There are many ways to make your life very hard, ranging from drugs to simply being stupid and avoiding those habits and behaviors helps a lot.\n\nHowever, PLAYING NOT TO LOSE isn\u2019t the same as PLAYING TO WIN. Getting to 60 with no credit card debt and enough money in your 401K is a worthwhile outcome, but it\u2019s not really what you or I or anyone else imagined makes for a good life. \n\nPlaying to win is simply doing the things you are scared of. There\u2019s no other way around it. Playing to win is about constantly exiting your comfort zone and constantly updating your reality of what\u2019s possible. Much of the advice here flies in the face of common wisdom. Playing not to lose may be to stay at the same job for 20 years because that\u2019s safe... and because you can retire and downgrade and have money to enjoy your later years.\n\nThis is good advice... but playing to win is to use all your savings to start your own company or to follow your dream. It comes with RISK. This is the major difference. When you\u2019re following common sense and what\u2019s mature, you\u2019re taking a lot of small actions that are quite safe and you\u2019ll end up in the middle of the pack. It\u2019s like \u201ckeep your head low and get to the finish line\u201d. \n\nPlaying to win always comes with the risk of losing everything. Taking your money from your 401K and investing in a business CAN MEAN that you\u2019ll lose all your money. Quitting your job to become a freelancer CAN MEAN that you\u2019ll have months with no income and potentially end up not being able to pay your rent.\n\nThis is what bothers me about self-development nowadays - the ratio between upside and downside. You don\u2019t get a big upside with a small downside. If you want to get what other people aren\u2019t getting... you must be willing to do things other people aren\u2019t willing to do. It\u2019s as simple as that and there\u2019s no way around it.\n\nTo CAPTURE AND ACCOMPLISH your dreams, you must first pursue them. When you pursue them, there is an existential risk that all will go to hell and you\u2019ll have no safety net. There is also a chance that it will work and you\u2019ll get what you want. The RISK RATIO for playing to win is ALWAYS HIGHER than playing not to lose. It is a LOT SAFER to stay at the same job but give up on the idea of being a business owner or do your own thing than it is to START YOUR OWN BUSINESS. It\u2019s a lot LESS LIKELY your employer will go bankrupt than it is that you will go bankrupt.\n\nThe same with relationship - most people stay in a relationship that has gone sour simply because they\u2019re afraid of being with someone new or afraid they\u2019ll not find someone new. And yes, there is a RISK that you\u2019ll end up alone and you must balance that risk with the reward.\n\nIs the question of - will staying with this person and be of average happiness is BETTER OR WORSE than being alone and risking either being very unhappy alone or very happy with someone new?\n\nSo at the end of the day, one can try meditation and walking 10.000 steps a day and many other things and these DO MATTER. But the big chance comes when you take decisions that have a higher risk - reward ratio than you\u2019re taking right now. The more you want, the higher the chance of failure. SAFETY comes with limitations and it\u2019s very hard to have both what you want and the certainty of getting it.\n\nStrategy will always beat tactics.\n\nDeciding WHERE to attack will always be more important than HOW to attack.\nDeciding WHAT to do will always carry more impact than HOW you\u2019re doing it.\n\nAnd this is a very bitter pill to swallow because we want to believe it\u2019s the opposite. We want to believe that those five minutes a day that we\u2019re improving ourselves makes a huge difference. But even then...\n\nA SMALL FISH IN THE OCEAN has more options than a BIG FISH IN A POND. And my honest advice is to focus on jumping into the ocean than trying to get bigger within boundaries. After all, ANY SYSTEM IS LIMITED BY ITS EXTERNAL BOUNDARIES. You can work hard on something but if the environment limits you, that\u2019s the bottleneck.\n\nRazvan",

It gets especially frustrating when the person giving me their \"insight\" has some serious flaws of their own that need addressed.\n\nMainly,I don't know if it's something with my personality that let's people think they have the answers for my life or if it's just something I need to accept that people do.  If it's the former case, I want to figure out how I can develop skills to prevent people from doing it.  If it's the latter case, I guess I'll have to manage a way to live with it.\n\nThoughts?",

I had a breakdown yesterday, where for the first time in my life I felt completely lost and hopeless. To give some background, I have always been considered entrepreneurial and a techie. I started programming and started a company when I was 13, failed. Then again at 17, failed. When I graduated highschool I decided to not go to college to pursue another business endeavor, which was an app I developed last year. However, my passion for this idea has deteriorated. It doesn't seem financially viable in the long term and now I'm questioning if I'm even cut out for entrepreneurship. I seem to never be able to kick myself in the ass and figure out what exactly needs to get done. Over the past year I haven't gotten out of my comfort zone, met many people or done much besides program and tweak like a perfectionist. I wouldn't even describe myself as a great programmer, I just learned to code to build stuff I thought people would like, I don't think I could ever do it as a career.\n\nI've cocooned myself in my parents basement the past year. I have no money, no friends (my only friend lives far away in Texas) and feel like I'm just wasting time. When I ask myself where I'd like to be in 5 years I have no clue, all I know is I love to build things, anything I'm passionate about. My parents have been incredibly supportive through all this, but I feel terrible because I don't think I have it as figured as they think I do. My biggest fear is having my head caught in the clouds believing I can be something I never can. When it comes to entrepreneurship I'm not picky about what it is, probably because I haven't found a true passion. I really enjoy cooking and have been told I'm good at it, so maybe a restaurant? I really like to build little Arduino toys, so maybe some sort of device? That's the hard part all I know is I love to build and create, but I don't know what to build and I'm scared I don't have the skillset and personality to actually build it into a viable business.\n\nTL;DR: About to turn 20, decided not to go to college to pursue a business, which I'm not optimistic about now. Love to build and create, but don't know what to build and if I'm even cut out for entrepreneurship. Feel lost and confused about where to go in my life.\n\nIf anybody has any advice, any at all, I would greatly appreciate it.",

I'm a psychology graduate since 2019 (bachelor) and I have always wanted to help people out, but I was never able to help myself. With that in mind I'm currently starting this journey of self improvement and normalization and I wish to invite you to be part of that with your own journey! I'm planning to do a series of youtube videos about my issues, my solutions and I would like you guys to participate with your own videos and issues, so we can discuss a better tomorrow among ourselves.  \n\nI've been having quite a lot of issues with depression, anxiety, panic attacks for the last year and a half, so I was not able to help myself and be productive, of course I have learned new things, but the overall issues that have been plaguing me have remained. Those issues are procrastination, no idea as to where my life should go, overall dissatisfaction with my life and addictions (nicotine, alcohol).  \nCurrently  I'm working as a customer support agent, but I would like to change that, so I'm starting a programming course in February. I won't work in psychology as of right now, since firstly the wages here are very low and also I do not believe I would be great for the job since I'm very emphatic and other people's issues take a toll on me to the point where I cannot function.\n\nWhat I can contribute for you guys in terms of skills is my psychology training and as I stated I have a mind that love problems and solving those for you! Of course I would be able to give you some outline as to what I'm thinking and everything else is up to you.\n\nI enjoy  music, films and philosophy a lot. I've played a couple of instruments (piano, guitar) for a little bit. I love the 60s and 70s Prog/Psychedelic rock era. I'm a chess player, not professional, but I'm pretty decent at it and it's one of the things that has helped me to get to the more logical side of myself.\n\nI want to end this post telling you that my first video that I have done today will be linked off on my reddit account, if this is a breach of the rules of this subreddit, please mods, edit it out or let me know so I can edit it out, I would not want to breach anything as this is my first post on reddit and I'm not sure how everything works around here!\n\nThank you for the read and have an awesome day!",

But whenever I try to make any step outside of my comfort zone, it is super hard to actually set my first step and then sticking with it for a longer period of time (like simple sports, meditation, reading, etc) due to getting distracted almost everytime. \nAlso, I often start to hate the process of these things, even though I'm aware that this is basically just a desillusion between how I imagined things to be vs the reality (i.e. I \"dream\" about doing Sports while IRL I started to hate gyms and feeling uncomfortable at doing any kind of sport (I have dermatitis and sweat itches to me) ). \n\nI hate that.

Hopefully you can excuse the long story and provide some feedback as to what I should do in my life to start a positive trend upwards, so here goes... everything.\n\nSo last year in October, my fiance left me, and it nearly broke me. Unfortunately, I made some ridiculously stupid decisions that led her not to trust me anymore, so it was all my fault for her to make that decision. Honestly I thought I was happy with this woman, but deep down, I wasn't. I just wasn't in love with myself, and did some really messed up things that became part of my lifestyle. Then when she found out, she dipped.\n\nSo post break-up, I'm depressed, of course. I'm currently seeing a therapist, which is definitely helping. I'm constantly going to the gym, reading anything I can get my hands on, and on the bare minimum, playing video games to keep my mind occupied at all times. I don't really hang out with people, mostly because of conflicting schedules (I'm currently undertaking a graveyard shift at a hospital, so it's hard to connect with people). Still, with all the things I'm doing, I feel like I've come a long way.\n\nNow I'm just looking for a constructive hobby that I can pursue. I've thought about so much, things like taking up a martial art (again), and yoga, and other things physically. I've researched some things about home-brewing beer and gardening.  I've gotten a lot of raised eyebrows, too, as I used to own a gun and go shooting at the range every now and then before meeting my ex, but I understand that shooting might not be the best hobby as of now, regarding how I'm feeling about life at the moment (I mean, I'm by no means suicidal, yet I don't want people to think that I've completely lost it, you know? I have thought of some archery, though).\n\nRight now, with it being the new year/decade, I feel like I have the freedom to do absolutely anything, and I really need some encouragement to reset my life in a positive way. I know what I did in the past was completely wrong, and I've atoned for it greatly. And now that I've finally forgiven myself-- which seemed like an impossible endeavor all in itself-- I'm now walking in the path to reshape my future in a more positive light.\n\nSo, Reddit, now you know what I'm looking for, and I'd appreciate any and all forms of opinions, feedback, advice, two cents, ideas, suggestions and snide remarks.

I also tend to have problems with making decisions and feeling confident about it, particularly when they are important/impactful.  \n\n\nHappy to give more detail but don't want to make this too complicated.  \n\n\nThank you!",

It took me a good 5 years to accept that this is what I had to live with now and that these conditions are part of me. It\u2019s been really tough going from a sporty, outgoing kid with lots of friends to becoming an introverted, loner who basically had to rebuild her life from scratch.\n\nAll this aside I often find it hard not to compare my life to others. I would usually avoid facebook like the plague because seeing old school friends progress with their lives (like having kids, getting married, buying houses) would make me depressed. And I\u2019d feel like I was nowhere near achieving anything. \n\nI often dread Christmas as this is usually the time for those milestones to come up on my newsfeed but surprisingly this Christmas I felt okay. Instead of feeling jealousy and sadness that I\u2019m nowhere near achieving this, I kinda felt happy for everyone. I\u2019ve began to realise that l\u2019ll get there eventually but in the meantime focussing on me is a good step forward. \n\nThere\u2019s still a long way to go, as it\u2019s still a struggle to pull myself out of bed in the mornings but the fact that I actually attempt to shower and get dressed everyday is a great step forward.

Look people directly in the eyes without irritating them. This is a great confidence hack. Remember, if you don\u2019t have self-confidence other people are feeling the same. Having self-confidence in the face of other people breaks the ice and keeps the ball rolling. Self-confidence builds self-esteem, which commands respect from other people.\n3. Don\u2019t show people you\u2019re broke. Another great confidence hack. Remember, humans are animals and tend to act by instinct rather than by rationality. A little sign of weakness doesn\u2019t earn you sympathy. To the contrary, it will just send the other human beings tearing down at you like ravenous wolves.\n4. Always aim higher than your expected goals. This boosts confidence. This applies pressure on yourself and gets you out of the comfort zone. Always over-deliver beyond expectations and you will never have competition.\n5. Computer programming is a relatively new skill. Surprisingly many people are still giving excuses why they can\u2019t learn programming. Regardless of your age, learn at least two modern programming languages and one classic programming language in order to remain relevant in a fast changing world. Showing people that you\u2019re in the cutting-edge of technology is a huge boost to your self-confidence.\n6. When walking in the streets, walk a little faster than everybody else. This is a confidence hack. This puts your mind always on alert, helps you stay healthy and focused, improves your judgment and decision making instincts and makes you a hard target for stalkers, muggers and predators.\n7. Always walk with your head held high. Another confidence hack. This will ensure you miss nothing that should not be missed while putting you in a pole position of advantage and at a vantage point in case of a disadvantage.\n8. Eliminate FEAR from your life. Be dead to fear. Instead of letting fear dominate you, dominate it. It is an effective weapon against your adversaries and a great advantage to you if you can control it.\n9. Don\u2019t fear to try. This world is controlled by people who dared to try. There would not have been an electric bulb if someone did not take the risk to try. The reason people don\u2019t try is because they lack confidence.\n10. Build faith. Faith is just the manifestation of imagination. Everything you see was created by faith. Faith works miracles and manifests the invisible to the visible. Faith is the mother of confidence.",

I just keep pushing everyone away, including all opposite sex/potention SO.\n\nI smoke, drink, and party fairly alot at the age of 17. I know I'm harming myself, I'm completely aware. I just can't see myself living a peaceful life. As in being fairly responsible, not living on the edge, refusing to party etc.\n\nNote: I am fairly responsible, but I meant personally responsible if that makes any sense. As in the drinking, smoking, and partying. All that said might not sound much. But for a 17 year old, it is incredibly irresponsible and reckless and indeed dangerous at most times. One does not know what one might encounter in vulnerable times.\n\nI dont consider myself incredibly smart, barely anyone is. Though I manage to deal with usually mentally exhausting matters, at extreme ease. Such as school (I never write anything in class due to me never studying at home so if I do it would indeed be pointless. Yet, I always get 85%+; I'm in grade 12 currently, a year ahead considering my age in the country I reside in; on most subjects), personal communication problems that require wit and quit thinking inorder for said matter not to go south.\n\nI've grown up in a fairly \"meh\" household financially, is the way I could describe it. Though that did not stop me from leading my life north. I consider my financial state currently, to be at its peak. I save 60% of my weekly salary, have around 7k in my bank, frozen untill I'm 18 so I stay clear from reckless spending. 7k accumulated from my weekly parental salary if that's what you want to call it, and my multiple side hustles. Already own a car that I bought with my own money aswell as I've had help investing a few thousand dollars and I honestly think of that invested amount as it never existed, so I don't cash out in a wrong time. Playing the long time longer numbers game.\n\nI have a terrible relationship with my parents. Possibly because I've grown up in a bad household where fights were extremely common to the point where I thought I was living a normal life back when i was a kid at some point. \n\nExample: at the age of 12, I watched my mother get stabbed twice in the face using a broken wine glass that my dad broke. All woke, and sober. Not affected by neither drugs, nor alcohol. For anyone wondering, she did press charges. Had full custody of me, and my then, 1 year old brother. Took us away for a couple of years, then she came back to him. I most deffinately wasnt surprised, my mother certainly wasnt the brightest and most knowledgeable of her significant choices.\n\nI am extremely stubborn, I tend to stick to what I say and that can be considered a bliss and most certainly a curse due to how stubborn I could be during situations where I have to simply let go of said matters otherwise the situation will unravel and get more tense. Which tends to happen very much often by the way.\n\n I wan't to improve myself, yet everytime I try to fix my unsuitable traits and stop my bad and unhealthy habits, I find myself having an urge to go back to them. Or in some cases, unwillingly doing things that I most certainly do not want to do, and those things in most cases lead to bigger, and more complicated and certainly unwanted problems. \n\nI'm sorry I made this extremely long, I do wholeheartedly appologize, though I really have no idea where to seek help, and who to ask for help. Thus as I've explained above, I trust no one. \n\nHow may I try working on myself, with guaranteed successful results?\n\nThank you for reading, and if have left any replies or advices, I thank you very much.

When someone asked me what I wanted to do when I grow up I always said I wanted to be a scientist. I wanted to contribute to an effort that will push the human race forward atleast a little bit forward.\n\nI finished by Ordinary Level exams and choosed to do Core Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics for my Advanced Levels. This was 7 years ago. A Levels was really rough. I discovered that I am a slow learner. And even when I do learn I tend to forget things If I don't study them over and over again. My life was soo stressful and I had no free time. I did manage to get 3A's and a B in the final exam but I was completed burned out. I will not go into detail about my learning dificulties in many other areas of life as well because I have made plenty of posts about them. I told myself that I am not cut out for science and resolves to study Accounting eventhough I had no interest in it. I saw other people in class getting very high grades in accounting with minimal effort. It is a job so why not?\n\nSo, I enrolled in university to study accounting. But after 1 semester I was depressed. The subject was easy but  I absolutely hated it. Then I stumbled upon Babara Oakley's Coursera Course Learning how to Learn from which I was encouraged to try science one more time. So, I switched to do CS. This I failed all by modules and dropped out of university and moved in with my parents again.  This was the lowest point in my life. Then I enrolled in a small college near my house and started CS again. Little by little I developed good study habits and started using flashcard software Anki which is a marvelous tool.  Now I don't have to study as furiously as before as Anki magically takes care of everything. It reminds me to practice topics right before I am about to forget them. And also the memonic technique called link method was helpful.\n\nI worked for one year in a web development company and will be find a job as a developer in 5 months after graduating. This was a farcry from the dream job of being a researcher I had growing up. I will be making websites for businesses. Is not very meaningful to me right now honestly. But right now I am a fresh graduate and I need to get experience and skill working somewhere. I hope that eventually I could do something I find meaningful. I don't know.

I can\u2019t stop thinking about how:\n\n1) in high school I quit the trombone when I was really good and could have gotten a full ride scholarship or even played professionally. Instead, I tried to go to college with no direction and dropped out from too much partying with drugs and alcohol. I still have not graduated college, and couldn\u2019t play the trombone or remember how to save my life. What\u2019s more, my parents were maybe too nice maybe and would have paid for some of my time in college, they worked hard to give me that opportunity. Instead I paid off the loan myself with no degree. I basically donated to the university.\n\n2) I spent the last decade of my life working at a niche job with no transferable skills anywhere else, and hated it the entire time. All that for them to lay me off and now I\u2019m unemployed looking at crap entry level jobs. I worked here because of #3 below.\n\n3) I moved to LA from the Midwest 10 years ago because I was brainwashed by culture and media to become a Hollywood actor and famous. I told myself I would change and make things happen. I went on 2 auditions and didn\u2019t amount to anything, because I didn\u2019t try. Now I feel like a washed up never was, and realize I desperately wanted to be famous. I cannot believe I became one of those lost souls who migrate to the west coast in search of a pipe dream. I spent months preparing to take great risks, and took zero.\n\n4) I sold a car that would today be considered a classic and worth good money for $50 because I didn\u2019t think to just store it somwhere it replace the engine. I was trying to save money but instead spent $8k on a pos car. I could have easily found a solution but I was impatient and pissed it broke. It was really unique and it\u2019s not a big deal but when I sold it, I knew EVEN THEN it would be a classic one day and did it anyway. Wtf was I thinking??\n\n5) I was scammed out of $12k for a deal that was clearly too good to be true. Buy a Ferrari for $8k and sell it for $90k. For reasons I still don\u2019t understand to this day, I forked over $8k as a cash advance and then sent $1.8k TWICE after that because he said it would \u201cclose the deal.\u201d I discovered after ONE YEAR it was a scam and sued him, which is nothing more than a piece of paper that says he owes me. He\u2019s off the map and I will never see a dime. That was only 2 years ago I did that as a grown ass person. Stupid, all my friends told me I was crazy and stupid, I told them they were haters wait and see. Joke\u2019s on me I guess. They were right...\n\n6) I had a golden chance when I was laid off earlier this year to make more money and get out of debt, my job gave me a good severance. I\u2019m in 45k debt with NO college degree or college loan just bad choices and poor financial management. Instead after I was laid off, I chased the school pipe dream and lived that fantasy for a semester as a full time student as my funds depleted and now I\u2019m broke with no job, no particular skills, and experience in a niche market with only a few job openings per city. Currently, there are none. I had to drop out of college again because I can\u2019t afford to continue, so that 6 months was a complete waste of time and I lost all the money I could have been spending time working to get instead of going to school with a bunch of 18-20 year olds...\n\n7) I got obsessed with rock climbing and did it so much I injured my shoulder and had to get surgery. Now I can never climb again and I\u2019m told I will have shoulder issues for the rest of my life. I thought I found my passion finally, and when I did it was cancelled because I liked it too much. I was told to take it easy by a climbing teacher, but I kept going because I was \u201cdetermined.\u201d If I just listened to that person, I wouldn\u2019t have a ruined shoulder and could still be climbing maybe.\n\n8) I used to be a black belt in Tae Kwon Do in high school and even taught classes. I could easily have used that skill or stuck with it and had a dope hobby, but instead I quit to \u201chang out with friends\u201d and to this day cannot remember a single thing about what I learned to become a black belt, it is too long ago. Cool skill and athleticism, dead.\n\n9) I started stand up comedy 10 years ago and was really in the scene. I quit because I needed a job and never kept it going. A lot of comics I knew at the time are now on national tv shows/commercials or touring the country doing stand up and making a living off their craft. What\u2019s more, at the time I was easily on par with their skills and deep within the scene with a lot of contacts and they all loved my stuff. I tried to reach out and try again recently, but it\u2019s just too painful. With the 10000 hour rule, I could easily have been at least marginal and kept a hobby and maybe have a side income or a cool skill of some sort. Instead I gave it up and I have no hobbies as of today.\n\nSo here I am, 35, and basically where I was in high school. I can\u2019t really trust myself because I\u2019ve made so many poor choices, even if I try to make newer and better ones, how can I trust those decisions because I\u2019ve so royally f*cked up? I\u2019m married now which is basically the only thing going for me but beyond that I have lost all motivation and trust in of all people, my own damn self. It\u2019s a screwed up feeling and I found this group so, I don\u2019t know, if anyone has suggestions on how to move on from mistakes I imposed on myself from the past I will take that advice. I swear this has held me back for decades and I feel like I\u2019m officially at a crossroads where I\u2019ll either do something with my life or just exist as a robot. I could have been a Tae Kwon Do kicking trombone playing stand up comic. Instead I\u2019m just some unemployed guy with no job skills and no hobbies. It\u2019s just an avalanche of regret.\n\nSorry to be such a downer, but any resources, books, videos, suggestions, or ideas will be helpful. This is a lot to make public but I\u2019m fed up and cannot seem to move out of the past. I feel drenched in woulda-coulda-land and I just don\u2019t know what to do. My wife tried to help me but it\u2019s up to me to change and I can\u2019t seem to get unstuck despite all of her good advice and to be honest I keep most of it to myself. It\u2019s like the past is draped on me like it\u2019s my own skin. I feel like I\u2019m trying to escape myself from the bottom of the Mariana Trench, but I can\u2019t move and I\u2019m chained to the floor by 1,000 elephants. That was dramatic, I think you get the point. Sorry for the long post, but I appreciate any suggestions.",

            "title": "Why Small Steps Actually Matter",
            "content": " This is one of the best methods that have worked in my favor, thanks to Darren Hardy\n\nYou win with the positive habits that you have developed - instead of overwhelming yourself with a bunch of complex goals, do simple tasks. As long as you\u2019re going forward, **even if you spend a few minutes a day \u2013 you are progressing step by step \u2013 avoiding stagnation.** Consistency and habits are the ultimate tools at your disposal for this.\n\nFormula. **Small and smart steps done consistently over a period of time = radical difference.**\n\nThis formula works with anything, not just for money. Spend 30 minutes a day to improve your fitness and health, read a few pages a day of any good book to improve your knowledge, save some money consistently and invest it, meditate for five minutes a day to have a clear mind and inner peace... - you can name a few more yourself!\n\nThere are no new fundamentals, truth is not new, it\u00b4s old. It\u2019s just like a guy coming up to you and showing you his latest manufactured antiques, you can\u2019t manufacture antiques.\n\nIn essence, you don\u00b4t really need to learn anything more \u2013 you have everything you need to succeed at your disposal. New or more information is not what you need \u2013 what you do need is a **new plan of action.**\n\n*EXAMPLE. The Magic Penny*\n\nIf you were given two choices: receive $3 million this very instant or a magical single penny that doubles every day 31 days. What would you choose? - If you chose the second option, you\u00b4d end up with $10.7M.\n\nThis is just an example, but serves as an exercise to show the importance of consistency and habit.\n\n*REAL LIFE EXAMPLE. The Three Friends*\n\n* **Friend number 1** starts making small, seemingly inconsequential steps in his life: he reads 10 pages of a book per day and has also taken the decision to reduce 125 calories per day. Moreover, he starts listening to 30 minutes of personal growth podcasts commuting to work.\n* **Friend number 2** doesn\u2019t make any changes and keeps going with the normal flow of life.\n* **Friend number 3** makes poor choices, he spends his free time watching TV, indulges in eating more, especially sweets and has a minibar installed in his house, adding 1 alcoholic drink per week, nothing too big.\n\nAt month 31 \u2013 the change is startling.\n\n* Friend number 1 is now fit having lost 33.5 pounds. He has also invested one thousand hours reading good books and listening to personal growth podcasts and has earned a job promotion and a considerable raise. His marriage is better than ever and feels energetic.\n* Friend number 2 is exactly where he was before \u2013 except now he is starting to regret not making good choices and is more frustrated.\n* Friend number 3 is now fat having gained an additional 33.5 pounds \u2013 weighing 67 pounds more than friend number 1.\n\n**The Ripple Effect**\n\nDue to friend number 3\u2019s weight gain \u2013 he starts feeling sluggish at night and wakes up tired, his performance in his job is affected and he receives harsh feedback from his boss, when he finishes work he is dissatisfied and his energy levels are low \u2013 commuting to home is harder than ever, and when he arrives home, he reaches for comfort food to lower the stress levels.

            "content": "Hey there! Here's my backstory: I'm 19 years old and I've always battled with depression and suicidal thoughts. My anxiety was severely high I was scared to talk to girls or anyone in general. I always used to give up way too easily and always had negative thoughts. My negative thoughts were always inside of me and always occurred at night. I had been dealing with hairloss and other medical issues that fucked with my mind. Everyday i would research side effects of the drug that treats hairloss and always scared me. I developed severe health anxiety and everyone was annoyed at me.i was also very insecure of my looks, my jealousy and paranoia of other people were so hard I'd always cry myself to sleep, I'd always get jealous of other people's looks it kills me. \n\nAugust: from the back story gradually getting worse and worse I attempted suicide. I was cutting myself and I always wanted to die. The thoughts were permanently in my mind. I'd always watch high school shooting videos like Columbine and I've been doing this every week. I watched it because i felt a connection between the shooters and I which are depression and isolation (which I'll explain later in how that's bullshit). I was crying everyday at work and the managers were always there for me, all my friends were freaking out and such , it was horrible. \n\nSeptember-October: after August even though I built a support system, everything was still going downhill, I'd get depressed outta nowhere and then watch those videos again to make myself feel good. I was failing university, I dropped all my courses except calculus because I didn't want to drop out. My friend was helping me since the beginning and told me to take a year off which I didn't. She kept on telling me to stop comparing myself to others which I never listened at the time. I was literally going to the darkest paths of my life. I then got a prescription of the drug but o had a anxiety attack and threw away the pills. In October I posted something really dark on social media and the police came to my door and I explained everything to them and brought me to the hospital. There I had to be awake till 5am waiting for a professional to evaluate me, and after I spoke I slept. The next morning I was so tired and two others had to evaluate me again by asking the same questions and later on there were other prisoners who were yelling profanity and it was the worst experience I've ever had.  I thought i was a criminal. The professional told me if I was in the United States I'd be charged with terrioism and I felt a relief of hope inside of me. Later I was released and I was having the best time of my life. My family and I reconnected and i started studying for the first time in months and I made so many friends. \n\nNovember: that didn't last long. After two and a half weeks I had a sudden crash. All those thoughts came again and I said something really bad to my friend and I told her i was gonna take the drug and kill myself, she called the cops and they came to my work place and I explained to them everything again. They then left and I realized at that point I need to change. I need to take action, this was my final wake up call. The police told me that the idea of me connecting to the school shooters is very bad bc they said I'm not insane they are and made me realize everyone has some type of isolation. It was eye opening. After that I lost my best friend but I couldn't make the same mistake again. My family is my support system as well as my friends \n\nDecember: this was the best months of my life. I made new friends, I talked to my favourite people, I stoped going on those websites that talk about the drug, I continued studying and I went from a failing grade to  B (my final grade), I was so happy. My university was checking up on me, and I was living my best life. I made plans for my future, I got rid of my old habits. I started exploring new things. I actually felt happy for once. I only had a crash ONCE but that was very minor and not like the crashes before. \n\nTo this day I haven't been suicidal or depressed. It's been two months since I haven't been suicidal or depressed. I actually feel amazing, at work I'm now filled with energy and filled with joy. I used to be abusive and extremely edgy. Now I'm the complete opposite. I feel like my old self again. I'm now going to start joining clubs at my school, skate (it's winter!), read,  make more friends, and enjoy my best fucking life! I no longer have severe health anxiety, I'm no longer depressed or suicidal, I'm still anxious and insecure but I've always been that way. No more negative thoughts thst happens at night. No more school shooting videos. I'm the best person. My next goal is to start brushing my teeth twice a day and try to reduce my lazziness. \n\nI'm really proud of myself. My friends are, my family is, my managers are. It feels amazing to still be living here and for once in three years, I actively feel like I have a purpose here in my life.",

            "content": "Hi, Reddit! I'm a bit new here (and also kinda shy) so if I am in the wrong place or something, please tell me (nicely).\n\nMy birthday was three days ago--I'm twenty-one now, which feels weird and strange and exciting. Even though 21 is one of those birthdays that people make a big deal out of, mine was pretty meh. My friends forgot about it completely and spent the weekend celebrating different friends' birthdays (I didn't make the guest list, sadly), and while I was super happy that my parents made the trip to see me, it felt very underwhelming. \n\nCall me vain, but my twenty-first birthday felt like a low point for me. Which is ridiculous! I don't need to outline my trauma under an anonymous username for the ten people who will skim through this, but a birthday seems like an absolutely stupid reason to feel upset, all things considered. Still, for a number of reasons (see: past trauma), I've had a history of terribly depressing birthdays, and having my 21st, one that is supposed to be exciting and celebrated, feel swept under the rug, was hard for me.\n\nI grieved for a few days. I have been holed up in my boyfriend's room (a single-occupancy room in the top floor of a frat house, the oasis of my dreams!), watching movies and eating junk food and avoiding contact with anyone who was not going to indulge my self-pitying episode. \n\nAnd then, as one does, I had this weird manic episode. *It's okay that I had another bad birthday! I do not have a bad life! And birthdays are like New Years', and I can use this new year of my life to become the woman I really want to be! A healthy woman. Someone who reads books from the library and eats healthfully and doesn't obsess about the constantly updating Instagram feed.*\n\nSo I deleted all of my social medias (save Twitter, forgive my weakness!) and convinced my boyfriend to take me to Kroger, where he watched me buy $50 in produce. Then, he drove to Walmart and found 12 mason jars for $7 (not trying to be Pinterest-y, but I need something to store all this in. Plus I grew up rural, so I'm keeping these so my dad will can me some garden veggies this summer).\n\nAnd then we spent two hours juicing everything. E v e r y t h i n g. We made breakfast juices, green juices, spicy tomato juices (with onion!!!!), raspberry dessert juices.... The bottom shelf of my communal fridge is completely stocked with mason jar juice. \n\nThis was a weird decision for me for a number of reasons. I'm a happily chubby girl with a past history of eating disorders, for one, so I've spent the past five or six years priding myself in my ability to eat things that I enjoy and to respect my body. I had gone a week or so at a time without eating before, but not like this. I had never juiced. Plus, my parents work in a clinic, so they've spent a very generous amount of time lecturing me about the dangers of fad dieting and the importance of eating foods (not juicing them!) to properly get their nutrients and fiber. And I also just love food. Food is the reason I get up in the morning, the reason I leave my room (I'm definitely an isolator), and how I extend a hand out to friends that I want to hang out with me. \n\nBut I think I decided, in that moment, that I wanted to set a goal for myself and to achieve it. I figured that, with my new (partial) social media cleanse and my juice cleanse, I could take some time to think about the things that make me feel like the woman I want to be. I want to enjoy healthy-tasting foods more than I currently do. I want to harness the discipline and willpower it takes to turn down a nicely buttered biscuit or an avocado BLT. Plus, I want to be able to say that while my birthday wasn't punctuated with 21 shots surrounded by friends, it was followed by 21 juices (seven days!) surrounded by my thoughts and reflections. \n\nThis week, I'm going to throw my juice into my bag, go to the library for fun, journal a lot, and maybe post some updates to a subreddit so I feel a little less alone. And I'm going to drink a lot of juice. \n\nI actually intended to start yesterday with a water fast, and I did pretty well until the evening. Smelling all the food as it went into the juicer made me incredibly hungry, so I drank one that was too full to fit into a jar. Then, when my boyfriend decided to go out with some friends, I got weirdly upset that I was alone on my birthday weekend, on a Saturday night no less, while my friends were partying with different people. So I found and ate an entire bag of Grippos. Then, I got into the mini fridge, dug out some vanilla bean ice cream, and mixed it with Nutella and walnuts in a solo cup and ate it. Then I got on my boyfriend's laptop, Venmo'd him $30, and used his account to have pizza and wings sent over (which he was very grateful to come home to after drinking with friends!).\n\nI thought that this little episode would absolutely trigger all those gross eating disorder feelings, but it didn't. I didn't hate myself for eating and I didn't feel gross. I just went to sleep. And then, when I thought about it, it was kind of funny--I completely had a TV sitcom \"sad girl\" moment (almost--I did substitute the romcom for a Youtube video game series).\n\nSo today is the new first day! I'm sixteen hours into a water fast, and I invited a friend of mine (no grudges!) to go watch Little Women with me in a few hours. I'm going to distract myself with a beautifully made movie about my childhood favorite book, and then I'm going to come home in the evening, take a sleeping medicine, and I am going to eat.\n\nAnd tomorrow, I will start drinking my juice.",

            "content": "I'm a 20 year old kissless virgin and I don't understand anything about the world. Idk much about history, politics, science, etc. I have no goals/ motivation, and when I do I never see them through because I don't feel like I deserve to. I always develop crushes on girls I have no shot with because they are in a relationship and/or are way too good for me. When I do try to flirt with girls I'm creepy.\n\nMy hobbies consist of watching TV and movies, playing video games and looking at my phone. I don't have the self-discipline to go to sleep early at night, it's always around 3 AM when I turn in. Then I don't get up until at least after 12 or when my mom calls me. I can't cook anything, I can't drive, I don't have a job. I don't go to the gym or exercise. \n\nI have friends who I'm always secretly jealous of because they're talented or attractive or creative. They have goals and ambitions and I barely want to get out of bed every day. I know I should be inspired by them but that's just not how my glass half-empty brain works. \n\nMy plan was to adapt a lot of New Year's resolutions to change all of this but I couldn't do it because I'm too weak. I haven't done much today, I played a game for a while, watched the dog and now I'm back in bed and feeling sorry for myself writing this post.\nI realize I have no one to blame for myself and that no one is handed anything in life. I'm just a lazy piece of shit who doesn't want to fix his life. I've tried, I've gotten some books, I looked at a lot of YT videos on self-improvement and organizing your life, but I can't put anything that I've learned into practice. \n\nIt's not like I don't want to do anything. I'd love to start working, reading more and write my own stories. I'd love to change everything but I don't know what I need to do to fully commit to changing myself and my life for the better.\n\nHonestly, if you made it this far, congrats. I know it's hard to read an idiot's self-pity.",

            "content": "&#x200B;\n\nA short backstory, first. At primary school I was the quiet kid, I had one friend and life was just \"meh\" not good, not bad. In fact, the biggest achievement was that I got to middle school I wanted. But there things change; I met wonderful people and started to feel the need to improve. I started going out, lose 7 kg and, most importantly, I realized that things can be changed.\n\nSo, this year, I decided to improve in the following areas:\n\n* stop procrastination - this is the biggest one, it prevents me from achieving other goals (this post was supposed to be written a week ago). When I get back home from school, I usually listen to music, watch YT videos, read news and all that useless stuff (even gaming is beneficial activity by my logic) and in the evening I just look into my textbooks and go sleep (on that one I procrastinate too).\n* improve social skills - I'm an introvert (probably?) so, communication between 4 eyes is fine for me, but when there are more, especially new, people involved I feel uncomfortable, even scrupulously sometimes.\n* I want to continue my #loseit challenge - last year, I lose 7 kg by ... walking the dog - 8 km 5 times a week. This year, I want to continue and I want to build some muscle (especially in the belly area ;). I 'm 68kg / 180 cm now, so it shouldn't be much.\n\nBecause I know myself, I would welcome some specifically advises (videos, articles, instructions,...)\n\nThanks for reading and possibly commenting!",

            "content": "I believe I can be a better person mainly for myself and for the people around me that deserve a better version of me.\n\nMy journey is like this.\nMy mother passed away rather suddenly in 2013. This was my first experience with death of a loving one. Both her sisters have passed away in the previous years but I have to admit I was fairly detached from these situations so I don't feel I was particularly impacted by their deaths.\n\nIn 2014 I left my home country to move to western Europe to study and build my life from scratch. My thought at that time was that I had not time to lose and a realization that everything can be over at an instant so I need to push myself to pursue my dreams and achieve all the things I would like for myself. I believe I did not properly understand the impact of these two events on my life (death, moving to a new country).\n\nFor the next 5 years I pushed myself to my limits. I completed my studies, found a job, another one, a girlfriend and built a new life. Moreover, I maintained an active social life and traveled extensively back and forth to my home country. Again, the modus operandi was \"no time to properly experience feelings, always in anxiety to achieve the next goal, do things now and once settled we can properly feel the feels\".\n\nBeing an extrovert person, I always wanted to surround myself with people. All these people acted as my \"drug\". A conversation with a person would recharge me adn I would actually go to a great extent out of my way to meet a friend or to do an activity with someone, even though this might not be what I wanted. Being with someone was alll what mattered.\n\nI felt my mental health deteriorating for the last 2 years. Depression, constant anxiety and the likes.\nI also felt my bod deteriorating. I became fatter and experienced multiple physical symptoms, such as numbness, palpitations, sudden chest pains etc. I did not like what I saw in the mirror.\n\nThat is a brief description of me.\n\n Here are some things I realized and some changes to improve my life.\n\n1. I need to properly let all the repressed emotions come to the surface.\n\nDuring all these years I kept a lot of anger, sadness, nostalgia about motherland etc to build inside me. I thought I was stronger or that all these feelings were properly expressed. I was wrong.\n\nI want to live in the moment. Not rush. I have achieved a lot in terms of actions but damaged my soul in the process. Now it is time to heal. No more rushing. No more extra goals on top of other goals. Just take everything as it comes.\n\n2. No more burdens on my soul and mind.\n\nI hold grudges. Some people I hate with passion. Some others I love with passion. I want to stop keeping tabs and let go of things that either don't matter anymore or never mattered. All these tabs were constantly running on the background of my mind exhausting me mentally. I would be thinking about situations from 10 years ago, or how I would respond to someone if I met them now. This buggage is too much. I will throw slowly what I can and see where it goes.\n\n3. No more toxic people or unnecessary people in my life.\n\nIn order to get my kick, I let many people surround me. I let them have access to my inner thoughts, I called them good friends. I had expectations. So basically everyone has easy access to me. Of course, not everyone gave me access to them. Maybe it's because they are mean or ignorant. That's fine.\nAs an easy going person, everyone opened their heart to me and left me with their buggage. For what? Just so I can say I have a big circle of people around me. I don't want to go off my way and play a second role to someone else's story. It is just not worth the effort yet. I believe once I am stronger and feel like a captain again, I would be able to give from my heart.\n\n4. No need to fully empathize with everyone. \n\nI am more sensitive than I thought. I would experience other people's problems as my own. I would be deeply sorry with their situation or happy with their happiness. And people got advantage of it. I would get a call from a friend saying \"Hey I have a problem\"  and in the end it was not a big problem. I would actively and with a passion try to solve other people's problems!!! \n\nI don't want to do that. My goal is to not let things  touch me so deeply. I will keep my innermost self and effort for a very close and selective group of people. \n\n5. I am taking responsibility for my life. \n\nI used to out strings attached to my actions. Either knowingly or unknowingly. I thought \"Since I am coming to visit you at home even though I am a bit tired (and to get my kick), that means next time is your time to come to my house and do something you don't want\". Of course most people never held their part of the bargain I had in my mind. \n\nI want to be the captain in my life. Whether I do something or not, this will reflect what I want. No strings attached. No confusion about other persons intention or even my own intentions. I do something (or not) because I want. \n\nFinal thoughts. \nSince performing this self reflection, I feel a bit lighter. I stopped fighting with my gf and focused my efforts on maintain healthy relationships with the people I want. Also, I don't feel guilty saying no. \n\nLet's see how it goes..",

            "content": "Okay so my tl;dr is I had a 6 year relationship end in June 2019. I also cut off a best friend during this time that I previously had feelings for during the other relationship (read below before judging). I am finding it incredibly difficult to let go of the pain of not talking and doing life together, not sharing the hard stuff, having an escape-person, and the 'what-if' since we didn't date. I am finding it hard to process without having a narrative to align moving on with, i.e. 'We weren't compatible. It wouldn't have worked. I am moving on so that I can find someone I'm compatible with.' How do I make sense of this so I can let go and work on myself as being someone better to date?\n\nOkay so the long story...in which i sound selfish, and own that.  \nMy ex and I dated for nearly 6 years. During the last year of our relationship, we weren't fulfilling each other. He had just been diagnosed with autism (which i struggled with as the social aspects became more pronounced after this), he worked 80 hours a week of his own volition, he didn't ask me about myself and didn't even know what course I was studying or if I was at uni or on break. He would be on his phone during dates, and blame shift everything all the time. Like, he literally stopped giving a shit about me for 18 months.   \nDuring this 18 months, I started a uni course, hated it, dropped out, my anxiety and depression intensified to the point i was barely able to work, I had severe OCD but had no idea, my parents went away for 2 months (which was hard for me as my mum was my main mental health person), I was assaulted at work (my boyfriend didn't care and wouldn't come see me and i was left home alone terrified). Because of all of this, I ended up getting really close to our mutual best friend. Because of our closeness and the fact i could rely on him and had my needs met, i got feelings for him, though to what extent i am not sure due to my OCD playing games. After a while longer, i admitted that to myself, and cut him off, and tried to repair my relationship. I didn't cheat on my boyfriend, but obviously went over the line for what is acceptable, and told my boyfriend this. We talked it out and made up (my boyfriend actually didn't care, which is a red flag in itself). My OCD took hold of this and ran with it, and i had constant guilt and anxiety, and would check with my boyfriend multiple times a day that it was okay. This was exhausting and terrible for him.   \nWe broke up in June because my loved ones sat me down and told me he treated me badly and it made them sad. I also just needed the OCD to stop, and my anxiety was bad enough that we broke up.  \n\n\nI've mostly let go of my love for my ex boyfriend. It should've ended earlier. It was good for the first four years and we were what we needed to be in that time. However, I'm finding it really hard to let go of the best friend. I can't nail down my feelings for him, I always wonder 'what if' even though I know there were non-negotiables i had about him that i couldn't deal with, i always wonder if it was mutual, and i just feel plain sad and lost. I want to let go of him and just accept it, but I feel like I can't, because I didn't try to work it out with him. I can get over my ex because our relationship failed. I can't get over the best friend because it didn't fail, it just never eventuated, and I think we could've been happy, though not forever.   \nI want to date someone new. I have hardcore feelings for someone and have had since september 2019. I want to be the best person I can for them, which includes letting go of the pain and love from old times, but I just don't know how.   \nPlease help me.",

With that, finding my group at school was a breeze.\n\nWe all get along together as a group and individually (as far as I know), but it was brought to my attention that I was making someone feel bad and emotional tonight after dinner with them. \n\nThe person in question we\u2019ll call \u201cA\u201d (18F). There was supposedly a remark I made tonight that was \u201ccurt\u201d and a \u201cjab\u201d at A which made her feel sad, according to her roommate. The roommate also said that she didn\u2019t get much sleep the night before and saying goodbye to friends from home that afternoon, which could have contributed to the reaction. \n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what I had said specifically, but my demeanor around them is usually quick responses to get a laugh out with a few roasts here and there. Overall, I recognize my humor is crude and I have tried to tone down the jabs but sadly, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve said something to make A feel like this before (this is the third time in five months).\n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s nerves or something but as hard as I try to be wary of my words and thinking before I speak, this is the third time this has happened and I\u2019m looking for advice. I\u2019ve tried witty responses to things being talked about but I notice I start to ramble sometimes and my humor gets out of control. I\u2019ve asked them to let me know if I reach this point but they seems to forget, which I understand as that shouldn\u2019t be their responsibility. \n\nWhat are some ways I could curb my behavior to be less hurtful? It really hurts me knowing that I\u2019m the direct source of someone feeling awful and crying in isolation.

I had the impulse to make funny replies to funny tweets and political replies to political ones. It was like a mini-addiction. I was also scrolling reddit for a long time. I don't post a lot but I do spend quite a lot of time on reddit too. I follow 150 models and movie stars (Indians) on instagram and kept checking their latest pics at least once every hour. I have two facebook accounts, one real and one fake. I opened linkedin at least 5 times a day to check new connections and notifications. I used to have multiple tabs open with at least two of the 5 sites open at any given time (I mostly use laptop instead of phone), even though i may not be looking at them and they were just open in the background.\n\nFinally I took the decision to cut down on SM usage and focus more on getting better at my job, improve my health and spend time talking to my wife. I have deactivated one of the facebook account and use the second account very rarely. I have logged out of twitter and log in at most once a day for a few minutes. I log in to linkedin only once a day. I haven't cut down much on reddit yet. I mostly stay logged out of Instagram too. I have lost about 3 pounds in the last 2 weeks (diet and exercise).

            "content": "So here I am - 21 year old male from medium-sized city in Poland. I fluctuate between being Neet and employed ( mostly fast food works) - I have a couple of mental disabilities on which I am working on for last 3 years. Currently I'm working in McSlavery, recently got a minor promotion (well +2z\u0142/h is 1/6 of my old wage so yeah it was quite a good raise - minimal wage no more). But I'm kinda learning to code... Why kinda? Because unfortunately while it feels very good and fulfilling to write an application with GUI or even a CMD based game... the industry is harsh and the only work other than frontend (which I hate, had some experiences with it during middle / high school working on my stillborn sites) for someone without a degree is working as a backend programmer... Well at least I like reading so it isn't totally lost cause. I am far from being a passionate person - though I know that once I secure an IT job I will finally be able to get back to making my RPGmaker games. \n\nSpeaking of passion... I am anything but that. I always had this \"straw enthusiasm\" (Idk if this idiom works in english XD). I used to draw and paint but - even though for some years I attended art classes, and drew during most of my free time... I sucked at it. And this wouldn't have been painful if not for this little fact that ... I ALWAYS WANTED TO BECOME AN ARTISTS. But after a major breakdown around my 17th birthday something inside me snapped - and ever since my art became even worse and after a few minutes of drawing I get suicidal. It got to this level where something I once loved now is impossible to do, because it hurts too much.  \nI never had any friends, nor do I feel passionate about meeting new people. To be honest - in my life I have only met 3 people with whom I wanted to be friends with. For majority of my life I was bullied - I have adhd and SPD, also used to be obese. My home situtation had it's (bad) influence too. Only recently (since like I was 15-16) I got to at least try to socialise with people, overcome my anxiety and lots of insecurities... Only to be put back in my place, having to suffer watching all the people around me have fun, have their moments of high, their lows. Only I was there sitting alone, trying to reach anyone but being sabotaged by my disabilities. Neither did school, nor attending festivals, nor extracullicular activies work. I went on group therapies - only to even there be alienated, something by which even my therapists was weirded out. I was talking with her after those sessions - trying to find out what I was doing wrong, only to realise that it's just me being me that is wrong.\n\nI tried a lot of things people do to cope - tried walks around the scarce nature ( had a habit of doing walks at least twice a week for around 3 years), tried running (12 to 19 - whenever it was warm outside I would run 5-6 kms once-twice a week), tried some gym  - for half a year but because of my body I can't do too much of exercising without the fear of collapsing, volunteered for a homeless shelter ( for a year), played in a teen theatre (for year too). I tried writing (even wrote a few shitty novels during middle school, also of course journals depicting ... my habitual behaviour xD), I tried flash dating (went on 7 dates before dropping out of university, never being able to do anything but get a hug), I even had Badoo and Tinder - while I had quite a few of matches - only once did it result in getting ghosted after 2-3 days of chatting, but even with her I didn't go on a date, because she figured out I am not a socially developed person. Ahh I got quite a few proposals of a hook-up but I am asexual - I long for someone with whom I would share a hobby, interest rather than putting my P in the V.\n\nI don't have any \"big dreams\" - I always knew I would be a lonely shut-in for rest of my life, playing games for most of the time... But I don't really enjoy games anymore - not like there ever were a lot of games I enjoyed, fact multiplied by my total lack of ability of strategic thinking or good perception. Even though I used to work as a child animator from time to time when I wanted extra money - I honestly despise children, it has always been like that - be it when I had to babysit cousins daughter, or was forced to play with my baby cousins, while I would do it - I would feel awful and disgusted by them. \n\nBecause of my adhd while I would like to learn Japanese (well it's a long story - while I don't care much for history and culture anymore - I still like asian cousine and anime ) I have to focus solely on learning java well now, so this is a thing I am sure I wanna do in future. While I would love to get an east asian wife (idk why but I always preferred asian woman, even before getting into weebshit my first \"crush\" was a chinese girl in my kindergarten xD), I know this is unlikely so currently my only goal is to get the hell out of my country and move to Thailand (because it's cheaper) or Japan if possible (I know about all those \"perks\" of gaijin - I am alienated and was discriminated against countless times so I don't care anymore).  \n\n\nBut what really hurts is my current day, close future - it's hard to keep on staying sane, especially with my mental creators argues). My every working day looks like this : 8-10 (depends whether I start work at 10 or 12) am - wake up, a quick shower, then I go to make breakfast/lunch. Then I eat it while reading daily updates of comics. Then most of the time it is time to \"gallop\" to work - I have a kilometer to my work so if I go kinda quickly I manage to get here in 7-8 minutes, leaving me perfect 2-3 minutes to get ready for work - I prefer to spend as little time here as I can - atmosphere here sucks. Then I get home around 10:30 pm - time to eat supper, and code a little before getting to sleep at around 1 am. On free days I make groceries, clean up around the house, make food for the day, sometimes for day after ( I don't really have much space in the fridge) - then it is time for coding. When it is dark I go for a short walk, extend my anger on random walls etc. When I get back I eat supper, read comics and get back to computer, mostly watch anime or go on reddit or sometimes I would read a book - I have kinda specific tastes, and get bored / disoriented quickly - so there's only a fraction of books suiting me.  \nI know that I should spend more time active outside - but again It's cold now in Poland and I get sick SUPER EASILY. For example I am now having a kinda bad cold but still have to go to work tommorrow ( I HAVE SUCH A \"GREAT\" JOB THAT WE DON'T REALLY EVEN HAVE SICK DAYS AVAILABLE AND I NEED MONEY SO YEAH XD)",

At the age of 11, I began homeschooling because of trouble I was having in school. Right after I left school I lost all the friends that I had. I began focusing on just keeping myself busy in my free time playing video games and spending hours on the computer. At the age of 18, I moved out of my parents house into my Aunt and Uncles because of issues at home. At 19 I got my GED and started going to a community college. I didn\u2019t really know what I wanted to do since I never gave a career much thought.  \n\nFrom the age of 19 till now (22), I have been at a community college taking classes part-time while working. My uncle convinced me that a career in a STEM field would be a good option so I chose mechanical engineering. However, because of the many mistakes I made while beginning college, only taking classes part time, and having to catch up from not going to high-school, I still have yet to transfer to a university to get my bachelors degree. If I took out a loan now and went to school full-time, I wouldn\u2019t graduate until I was 26-27.\n\nI currently work the night shift at a grocery store. The only other experience I have on my resume is repairing cell phones and working at another retail store.\n\nMy mother is divorcing my dad and my aunt and uncle are moving after their son, who started college a year after me, graduates next year. I will probably have to move in with my mother and my sister in a two bedroom apartment after my aunt and uncle sell the home we currently live in currently.\n\nA few weeks ago, like a light switch, I woke up and realized my life isn\u2019t going the way I ever expected it to. I feel like nothing has changed since I was 18. I in no way feel like an adult or like I could ever marry and support a family. It's very difficult for me to rationalize that I have missed out on so many opportunities in life already and that I\u2019m no longer an adolescent. \n\nGoing to college at this point feels like chewing glass. I\u2019m unsure if the field that I chose was actually right for me. I\u2019m so depressed and unmotivated that I worry I might fail this semester which will set me back even farther.\n\nI really need help, I want to change and get my life on course. I want a girlfriend but in my current situation, nobody in their right mind would want to deal with me. I want to make friends but don\u2019t have the skills to do so. I think I have been alone for far too long and it's hard for me to maintain a conversation. I feel like I still act as though I\u2019m a child.\n\nWhere can I go to get help? Are there services out there that I could benefit from? I\u2019m really lost and I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m able to fix this on my own.\n\nI greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to offer help.",

            "content": "Just to give you a little backstory on who I am and what I do. I\u2019m a 27 year old male, currently living in London, working in the field of Law which I enjoy. I was born and raised in London. In fact, practically my entire life has revolved around this city \u2013 I spent my formal education here, and went to two universities in this concrete jungle I all my home. Most of my family and friends still live here, so  I\u2019ve always got someone to hang out with. I live with my parents which saves me a lot of money, to the point I can travel 3-4 times a year (cutting this down due to becoming more conscious of climate change), so things are pretty great, right? But there just feels like something is missing in my life.  \n\nOver the past year or two, I\u2019ve had this sudden urge to really change and improve as a person. I work out 4x a week, started reading a whole lot more and practice mindfulness & meditation. It\u2019s great, but I want to get myself out there and improve my social skills. For anyone that\u2019s spent a considerable amount of time in London, you\u2019ll know talking to strangers is no walk in the park, which is fine but it doesn\u2019t give me a chance to be social with those I am unfamiliar with. I\u2019ve always been introverted and reserved, so breaking the ice with new people has usually been a challenge. It probably played a part as to why I decided to remain in London to study at university. I just couldn\u2019t see myself living with strangers. I feel like I missed an amazing opportunity to get out of my shell. Like I said, things are good in all other areas of my life, but I do wonder what sort of person I could have become if I just put myself out there more. I\u2019m looking at ways to challenge this part of myself as I feel it could not only help me with my social life but also professionally.   \n\nSo as the title suggests, how can I go about improving this side of me? I\u2019ve thought of joining an improv class, specially designed for people like me but I want to hear other peoples suggestions, and even thoughts on my situation. Is it relatable? Am I looking in the wrong places for fulfilment?",

            "content": "I just want to share my background, questions and struggles by hoping someone give me perspective that I miss. First of all who am I? I always have been an outcast. My life until now was just roller coaster, with incredible highs and lows. I am 22 years old male who double majoring engineering with physics in one of the most reputable college in my country. I am senior. It seems good while it is not. Last year I had major depression. After one year of constant daily struggles with suicidal thoughts. I hit rock bottom. For weeks, I couldn't left my room after I broke up with my gf. So I pretty much failed nearly all of my courses. This year should have been last year in my main major in college. While it is not. Actually, because of my double major, I had to study additional year anyway. But, I could have finished my main major this year which I can't. Beggining of this semester was good. After one solid year struggle with depression after 10 session of theraphy, I finally got out of it. I started exercise, make friends, my grades were fine but after one month everything started to going downhill. My ex gf memories haunted me, I got involved fight in my school gym and I stopped exercising. Actually, I had gf before her and also after her. But I really loved that girl, I worshipped her, I made a statue of her. After nearly 1.5 year of relationship she said that \"You are not strong enough\" and basically dumped me. (nearly 1.5 years ago) After breking up in that summer I got into 2 internship one of them for big international tech firm, one of them in good startup in my country, I ditched the offer for internship from one of the biggest bank in world because I was away from the home and I wanted to have surgery for my deviated septum which i am very regretful until today). By the way I had to say I went to this internship the day after I broke up with her which was hardest thing in my life. At that summer my hair start to fall out, my anxiety with all of these internships,surgery, my additional effort to learn programming get such a point that I had uncontrollable shakings in my hands. After broking up, for solid 6 months I didn't fell happiness even one day. After I fucked up my semester and after 7 months of break up, I forced myself into new relationship which was for 3-4 months. She was super nice but I was just shitty. At the beginning of my real should have been junior year, my physics cgpa was 3.7 and engineering was 3.4. Now physics 3.48 and engineering 2.75 even though it will change couple of days later. Physics will go down maybe engineering can get near 3 levels which is fucking bothering me because I wanted to do masters abroad which seems impossible with my shitty academics. I have zero recommendation and research experience. I got involved with 2 proffessor but they end up shit because of me, now I am trying to runaway from them and right know it is happening with 3rd which is quite respectable prof. researcher from MIT etc. but I don't have even nerve to write her because I didnt do shit but we talked that i will at least 3 months ago, fuck. So as I said when my first semester suffered last year and because of depression I couldnt even dared to apply anywhere. So I applied another not reputable startup I worked there nearly two months. They paid me nearly 5 times of my friends. But it was no-name startup it cant help me to do anything. Right now I am at point where my cpga is shitty, my body shitty 5'10.5 150 lbs zero muscle. No gf, no social circle,no hobby, no research, no prospect. Also I have 3 final tomorrow they fucking crashed at the same day and I am zero prepared. For this summer I wanted to make research abroad but with these shitty academics I am fucking nowhere to do it. I occasionally started to smokeling, I eat very little and dont exercise. Eventhough I start books I dont finish them, I always overestimate my talents go into stuff that I cant handle. It is fucking dunning kruger. I have lived my fucking life ostricized and isolated but in some way popular(remember extreme high and lows). I first become school president at 5th grade than region president. At 6th grade in new school I got ridiciled,bullied,ostricized due to,I dont fucking now, nerdiness? I was always verge of breakdown, constantly cry and fight(really sometimes fistful). At that year I become first in my region at national exam in nearly 30000 people. I was chess champion at school some other achievements. So I got into private school which my family wouldnt effort because my parents are middle wage worker. I become president at that school again,  chess championships regionally, not much friend though. At the end of my 8th grade. I become first 200 near 1 million people. I got in most prestigious high school in my country I changed region. At there everything started great, even I get tie for class presidency but then everything start to go downhill, internet addiction, isolation I had zero friend because everybody either stays in dormitory or know each other previously. I get ridiculed by my teachers and my peers because I didnt just fucking study and only study. I was artistic kid, I wrote poems, stories so they just make fucking fun of me. I couldnt adjust new region as well. 1.5 year of hell. But the important thing is this place was my fucking dream for 3 years. All effort was just flushed. I changed my high school which was so hard imagine everybodys opion of you just fucked up, getting shits from my peers, my relatives. I got solid panic attacks. But in there even started rough I got involved with great friends. I got involved in projects etc. But my dream was university abroad and all of these for that actually. But I couldnt because basically we were broke. I got into college, as I said it was one of the most prestigious college in my country in exam of 1.4 million people I got into first 2000. I unnecessarily get language preperation year(which was fucking unnecesssary and i still regret) to relax. But that fucking year unlike relaxing every fucking single day I felt anxiety to learn programming which I didnt. I got into debate club seems I was talented. I got into finals from several competition, best speaker and shit, but also guess what become binge drinker. But I cut it off so I am fine now. I first met the woman I couldnt forget in there. I become fell in love with her, I got into entrepreneurship competition just to be close to her, we got to finals. But my parents said she is using me so I just cut all ties and a year later we started again and rest is history. So right now academically,physically, mentally,socially I suffer. I dont know what I am good at, what I should do? What is your suggestion any fucking suggestion right now I could do anything to stop this shit storm. Please ask any question you want.",

            "content": "Today, I am going to share how being good at League of Legends gave me a lot of self-confidence when I was younger.\n\n# Let\u2019s go back in time.\n\nIn late 2012, I was a shy 15-year-old boy going through puberty. The world was scary, school was scary, girls were scary.\n\nLike any reasonable teenager, I escaped the real world through video games. My friends introduced me to League of Legends. I fell in love with the community, the characters, and especially the game mechanics.\n\nIn February 2013 I began my climb in the ladder system and initially started out in Silver III (fairly average). The competitive nature instantly activated my deep urge to prove myself and I started playing more and more. I fantasized about how it would feel like to be really good at this game and used that as motivation to take on the challenge.\n\n# In order to get better\n\nI studied the best players out there: observing their games, watching their streams, and reading their guides.\n\nI stopped getting upset by individual losses and instead cultivated a growth mindset. Everybody was obsessed with winning and climbing the ranks. I got obsessed with learning \u2014 winning became the result.\n\nI built upon my playstyle continuously. Each death and lost game became an opportunity to learn.\n\nI discussed the game in-depth with close friends who were exceptionally good at the game.\n\n# 7 months and 1000 games later\n\nI reached the top \\~2000 on the European Server (at the time League of Legends already had 12 million daily active players globally).\n\nI felt proud and accomplished.\n\nBut more importantly, I realized that if\n\n**\u2026 I set my mind towards something**\n\nand\n\n\u2026 **I put in the work**\n\nI could achieve whatever I wanted.\n\nAs someone who struggled a lot with self-confidence, it was a realization that hit hard.

            "title": "How to get better at speaking, interviewing, be more communicative and generally more fun?",
            "content": "I am a 27 years old male. This is a bit of a long story. I would like to be a better speaker. Most days I speak only a few sentences.\n\nI have a degree in engineering, so I like to think I'm not terribly dumb.\n\nI would like to be a better speaker. I went to acting classes and to a speech therapist already, but they didn't seem to get my point. At the time I was unemployed. Those people thought me being unemployed is the core problem. I was unemployed because in every interview they saw that my communication skills are weak and that I would not be a fit in their company. That judgement seemed fair, they're certainly not the first ones to reject me for this. However, when I asked for feedback, basically nobody could pin down how they made that judgement.\n\nOnly the most helpful interviewer said that I when I talk and solve problems, I tend to not go the core point directly. I reach the point eventually, but after some time. It's not only in how I discuss things, but also how I approach problem solving: I tend to think associatively and then I reach the core point (maybe), after basically wasting a lot of time. How can I get better at interviewing?\n\nMy acting teacher basically threw my out of his class, saying that I should 'grow up'.\n\nMy speech therapist focused on interview training, since she thought that was the core problem, although I had explained otherwise. Looking back, maybe I didn't make this more clear.\n\nI went to 2 psychologists and they suspect I'm on the autism spectrum. My speech therapist also suspects it. My co-workers also joked playfully about me having autism, so it seems pretty obvious to other people. People from high school also found it 'hard to connect' with me. I still am not sure what this means. I didn't went to a psychiatrist to test this. The remark about autism seems consistent with what that one interviewer said to me: the details come first to my mind, I find it hard to come to the core topic directly and to synthesize the point. I personally think I don't have ASS, but due to social circumstances I have developed that behaviour (my mother is schizophrenic by the way). I wasn't diagnosed as a kid with ASS, because at that time that diagnosis wasn't as common as today. I don't recognize myself in certain 'typical' aspects of ASS, like trouble processing wordplay. Also, some traits of highly functional ASS are employable: analytical skills, interest in exact sciences. I don't spend a lot of time with people, so I made more sense to me to develop those mathy skills more than people skills, because I have less opportunity time with the latter. So in my case, it's more of a survival strategy thinge, maybe.\n\nI went to the first psychologist around 10 times. A couple of years later, I went one time to the second psychologist.\n\nI don't know how I could get help from professionals. Most people don't seem to get my problem. So I'm considering doing self-improvement. I spend my free time mostly reading mathematics, computer science, investing or music. I would like to start making music again and also draw. Maybe that's a way to get a connection with other people? Maybe I should develop my humorous side a bit more, watch stuff like Monty Python, so I'm a less of bore?\n\nThe professionals I talked to also have a heard time to point down what it is that I lack and how to improve it. They just 'feel' and 'see' that I'm sort of a weirdo, but they can't explain it in words. This makes it hard for me to improve myself. How can I find out what I lack exactly? How can I get good feedback?\n\nI have also read that writing is a good way to get better at speaking. But how do I practise this to get more sociable benefits. Maybe I should write humorous pieces?\n\nI've hear the advice of 'be interested in other people', but I have a bit of a hard time to practise this. I'm not interested in what others eat or so. I'm not interested in what's in the newspaper. I would like be more of a sociable guy, someone people actually would like to talk at caf\u00e9s or at a party. I don't go to a parties because I consider it a waste of time and I also don't get any joy from it. To every party I attended, I went alone. So I don't attend a lot of parties, but I would like to feel comfortable at it. It's not really really important to me, since I am a bit past the age of 'parties', but I have never been able to go at a party and have fun.",

            "content": "Pressure, pressure, pressure. I feel it so strongly some days. If I mess up at work, I\u2019m a basket case re-evaluating my entire existence.  Making dinner last night with my boyfriend he tasked me with cutting the garlic bread since I never learned to cook and I ended up smushing it and halfway through I thought it looked so sad and I asked \u201cwhat am I doing?\u201d and put down the knife. He jumped in and showed me how to do it the right way and his came out looking fricken artistic next to my smooshes. \u201cI suck\u201d - Me. \u201cYou can\u2019t suck at something you don\u2019t know how to do, you just don\u2019t know how to do it. And you watch and learn. You practice.\u201d - Him. \n\nSometimes it frustrates me that I sit here and do all of this work on myself and I get mad about garlic bread and then my boyfriend comes through with the profound truth that\u2019s so aligned with what I try to learn and strive to achieve on the daily. He\u2019s never read an improvement book or spiritual book in his life. Meanwhile I study and take courses and read and write and expend so much (beautiful) energy on it. \n\nIt\u2019s becoming perfectly clear that I take life way too seriously most of the time. And I make myself miserable for no reason by doing it. I grew up in a very serious environment and death has followed me for most of my life. I get why I\u2019m serious. And I get why I got extremely mad when my mom who is the most fire-cracker tempered person would tell me to lighten up. \n\nBut it\u2019s time to lighten up. And I invite you to join me. \n\nLife is really hard sometimes. Stuff happens that I wouldn\u2019t wish upon anyone. I\u2019m not saying this is one size fits all advice and i realize I\u2019m very fortunate to live the life i live but I think so many people would benefit from lightening up. As a society, we are plagued. We\u2019re plagued with anxiety. We\u2019re plagued with depression. We\u2019re plagued with misery. And I think a lot of it is tied to the fact that we think we have to be perfect all the time and that it\u2019s not ok to screw up or to make a mistake or be spontaneous or to leave our comfort zone. Where\u2019s the fun? Where\u2019s the space for laughter? We only have one life here! Why does everything have to be so serious?! \n\nThere\u2019s a ton of expectations out there but what if we let go of some of them? Other people\u2019s expectations are not our problem or responsibility. Our own are though. And we\u2019re beating ourselves into the ground with them. What if we laughed at our screw ups? What if we said, \u201cok I tried my very best at this particular point in time, now I\u2019ll get up and try again with a little more experience.\u201d Why do we think mistakes are the end all be all? We\u2019re not screw ups because we made 1, 5, 20, 5000 mistakes. We\u2019re not screw ups because we let someone else down. We\u2019re human and this is a journey in which sometimes we do really well and sometimes we fall real hard. There\u2019s lessons in all of it. And it\u2019s beautiful (although not always pretty). \n\nSometimes we hurt people because we were hurt and didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. Let it go by acknowledging you did the best you could at any given point and work towards doing a little better. Stop carrying a guilt that does nothing but weigh you down. Apologize if you have the opportunity. And if you don\u2019t, say the apology out loud or write it out. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over and over for the same thing! We need to let go of the idea that our worth is based on what we\u2019ve done or how good we are at something or how much we have. we are inherently worthy.  We are worth something way beyond definitions or tangibles. As is everyone else. \n\nAnd a beautiful thing happens when we lighten up on ourselves. We lighten up on other people. We\u2019re kinder. We\u2019re loving. We\u2019re compassionate. What a world it would be if we didn\u2019t walk around trying to prove something. \n\nSo today I\u2019m not trying to prove anything. I\u2019m going to smile for no reason. I\u2019m going to laugh at my mistakes. I\u2019m going to focus my energy and attention on the joy instead of the places where i believe it\u2019s lacking. I\u2019m going to help my boyfriend cook dinner and probably mess it up again. And laugh. And keep going even if it\u2019s not pretty. And ask questions on how to cut an onion the best way because I still can\u2019t figure it out and it takes me about 25 minutes. And not get mad when it doesn\u2019t look as pretty as when my boyfriend does it. \n\nHope you all have a wonderful morning/day/evening. Whoever you may be. Wherever you may be. You deserve it. And remember: LIGHTEN UP :)!!\n\n\n\n_____ \nTL;DR\n\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of expectations out there but what if we let go of some of them? Other people\u2019s expectations are not our problem or responsibility. Our own are though. And we\u2019re beating ourselves into the ground with them. What if we laughed at our screw ups?

How did you humble yourself or become relatable?\n* If you live with someone similar; how do they come across which bothers you and boils that sentiment and how you wish they would change? \n* Do you have a book in mind that may help me change my ways? \n* Is it intentional mindfulness meditation that I need, or More Christian podcasts, or an apology to my roommates?\n\nThank you.",

Like I mentioned, my mind is kind of fucked up at the moment. Comment anything you want. I can't even get myself together long enough to figure out what kind of question I am asking.",

            "content": "So it's like always for me! I felt in love about 2 years ago in this wonderful orthodontist girl! First time I try to communicate with her on Social media. She rejected me quickly (don't want any relationship with patients). So I moved on a little bit (still was happy to see her). I tried to find someone and I failed every single time for multiple reasons (I'm already sick and tired of tinder etc.).\n\n1 month ago I had the next visit. She said weird things to me for example that she just want someone that loves her and never ever want to be hurt by anyone. She said personal things. I learned that her ex betrayed her with her best friend. Finally, she made multiple comments that I'm good-looking guy, and she likes my personality etc. Important to understand: it was always a very good energy when I talked to her, and she gave me a good feeling. I thought\u00a0hmmm\u00a0try this time. I did not expect this whole situation. Probably should have asked her directly after the visit, but of course I did not! So later learned for an important exam (it was the second\u00a0try and\u00a0I was very focused to give my best) and did not talk to her (and anyone else in this period of time). After the successful exam I felt new energy and tried to be offensive. We texted with each other and even call. I said that I want to spend some time with her on Saturday, and she rejected me that she will spend her day with her partner...\n\nI'm devastated right now! It's not that easy for me to fell in love with people! She was my hope! My only relationship ended after 4 months and I lost motivation multiple times. She was the third person in my life where I really felt a feeling like this. I'm now almost 27. There are some phases where I feel depressed and blamed\u00a0myself for being single almost my entire life. Do not\u00a0expect to ever fell in love again. Every family event is a horrible horror experience for me. All these questions... It's something wrong with you?\u00a0Etc. Some friends of me ask similar questions. It makes me sick. I need some advice! Should I try with therapy. I don't know what to do?",

The prospects are good and the money is ok too, but I still feel overwhelmed by a certain sadness....and I'm not really sure where it's coming from.\n\nRecently I read this book (Mastery by Robert Greene) and it made me question my life choices and where I am today. Greene talks about each and every one of us having a 'lifes purpose'....something that we were essentially born to do or become.\n\n I am torn between choosing something to specialise in and just letting life carry me wherever. I see people in good careers but i dont see how i can get there, is it my lack of planning or is it just not meant to be...\n\nI know I could gain very deep insights into a topic if I applied my mind to it but I am just scared/hesitant/reluctant to make the jump....part of the reason is i have many interests....partly because I'm unsure if i should focus on what i prefer as opposed to where the career opportunities are...partly also because i just get intimidated by the success and journey of people who have excelled in the field I am considering to specialise in.\n\nPart of my fears are that I am just doing what someone else has done, just copying another and staying in their shadow, as opposed to finding my own way. worst thing is I am not as confident or extroverted or charismatic as these people who are doing what i want to do only better.\n\nI have a degree in Civil Engineering, and part of me feels like I am straying from that education by choosing to do something away from the discipline...\n\nFor context I could specialise in a type of civil engineering, or a railway msc and that will dictate my future career.\n\nI have a performance review tomorrow for which I am presenting a summary of my experience and a report due very soon (for professional registration), and i will discuss it tomorrow with my supervisor.\n\nI am a bit all over the place, but it just feels like there isn't space for me..I just feel a bit overwhelmed, maybe i am missing something, maybe i am in the wrong career.

            "title": "An ode to Time (Management)",
            "content": "I am a time management geek.\n\nEver since I was old enough to conceive and process thoughts of ambition and success in my head, I made it my mission to be the best. To stand in the same space as my idols, to be the awe of everybody else and to be recognized for my talents became the main objectives of my life. Busyness was the name of the drug and discipline was the name of the game. I was 15 at the time.\n\nFast Forward 3 years - with a large scoop of mental breakdowns, personal growth and tinkering with myself and habits, here we are, with nothing tangible to show for it. I am no scientific rock-star, I don't have a booming YouTube channel, and neither am I in a hotshot university like I expected.\n\nSo where did it all go wrong ?\n\nNow the question implies that something went wrong, when clearly nothing has gone wrong.\n\nWell not entirely at least.\n\nBack to the time management part.\n\nI created a schedule. And I religiously (tried) to stick to it. And that is where things started getting interesting. Because Life very rarely yields. Life always finds a way - to get in your way.\n\nIt was easy enough at the start. Avoiding eye contact with people. If I got stuck in a conversation I didn't respond with words. I voluntarily became antisocial.\n\nEventually people got the message, I didn't want to talk. And I for one was happier with it. With no human interaction I could cram in more work into a single day, more productive things in a single hour, and unfortunately more malevolence than benevolence.\n\nI became more and more agitated with my inability to keep up with my schedule. A lack of human interaction proved detrimental to my health. Unrealistic expectations were being asked of me. And in my pursuit of making myself the greatest, I was losing the most important part - me.\n\nI was clearly in the wrong place and needed some help. So I decided to do some searching.\n\nIt turns out I was right, or at least I was partially right. Management was the key, just not of time, but of myself.\n\nBut really, how different would they be ? It turns out they are VERY different.\n\nBy managing my time hour by hour, I was becoming the very thing I hated - a mindless and soul less robot. It went against the very essence of me - that is of being proactive and being an active participator in my own life. By having a set of instructions I followed without questioning I basically was living life on autopilot mode.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong following a set of instructions, especially those written by you for you. However, not actively questioning them and not tussling with them is the biggest folly you can make. Because nothing is ever gospel, the world is evolving continuously, requirements and environments change at a dangerously fast pace, and if you regard your complacency as discipline, you are in for one hell of a shock.\n\nThe solution - being proactive. And managing your self. At the same time.\n\nWhat are some steps you can take towards this ?\n\n* **Declaring your Intentions -** The first step towards power over yourself is knowing what you want. Ask yourself what you're after. Maybe even record this on paper. These values act as your compass.\n* **Actually using it when in need -** Its well and good having a compass, but you need to use it. Evaluate each opportunity against this value compass of yours. Check to see if any of the tasks at hand represent less value than the opportunity in front of you.\n\nIt takes incredible awareness to know what is the best for you. None of us are born with the power to distinguish right from wrong inherently, but we can develop some tools to help us do so.\n\nTaking it a step further, why even focus on time as a deliverable. The result is really the only thing that matters, and if you can complete it within the time set, the better. Knowing your intentions (for the day or even long term) can help you a lot, and save a lot of time. Being pro-active and knowing what you want assists a lot in this regard, with the ability to gauge yourself based on the effort you put in instead of mindlessly being busy for a set amount of time and patting yourself on the back for it.\n\nThere is a lot of life happening around you - all the time. It really is up to you whether you want to be a passenger in your own life and completely surrender the reigns of control, or actually walk hand in hand with it and enjoy a balanced experience.\n\nUntil Next Time,\n\nMeliorem.",

I wake up, I do the same things everyday, I go to bed, then I wake up and do it all again. I really want to try and make this new year different and work on myself. \n\nI\u2019m the type of person that feels guilty when he thinks about only focusing on himself, taking care of himself, and not try to please others. I\u2019d much rather sacrifice myself if it would be more convenient or benefit others. This however has devolved into a lack of self care for myself, and it needs to stop. I\u2019m tired of feeling guilty about wanting to care for myself. Also it\u2019s a decent mix of self loathing mixed in that\u2019s causing me to not care for myself. I think \u201cwhat\u2019s the point, you already screwed up your body and things in your life, changing now will just be painful\u201d \n\nI also want to cut down my drinking, I really think it\u2019s making me miserable and is cutting into my money, meaning I can\u2019t do things I need to do like purchase things I need for my room and for myself, it seems only thing I spend money on is beer and fast food. I currently drink around 8 beers a night or more. My doctor informed me it\u2019s beginning to effect my liver so it\u2019s a health risk as well. I do t know if I\u2019m a alcoholic or not or just undisciplined. But either way I have to cut back. \n\nI\u2019ve also noticed while trying to date recently (I\u2019ve only attempted dating the last year or so and I\u2019m 30 years old, so have little experience on how to successfully do it) that I have little hobbies or interesting things I like. It\u2019s pretty much video games, drinking, and just staying in my room all day. And honestly, I think maybe I\u2019m not in the right place in my life to date because I can\u2019t even handle a lot of my own stuff, so how can I ha sleep a relationship? But I feel pressured to date because I\u2019m 30 years old and feel maybe time is running out for me. It\u2019s one of the things I hate most about myself, having never dated or had any real sexual experiences outside shady means. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sorry for the long post. I\u2019ve been wanting to put this stuff into words, I\u2019m sure I missed something though. But that\u2019s my current state right now. If anyone has any words of wisdom, I\u2019d truly appreciate it.",

But I also believe I need to be in committed a relationship to fully develop as a man. But bing honest with a new girl I was dating has always been hard for me, I felt I needed to hide a lot from her by lying, which she ofcourse senses when I keep contradicting myself, and then she's gone. I'm a lot more comfortable in my skin now bc I take care of myself and I look great, but I'm still way more comfortable being alone. Actually I enjoy myself more when I'm alone. Just 43 now.\n\nWhen there is anyone else (girl or guy) in my house I'm not comfortable with being myself, which entails not doing much physically, except reading/researching a lot on many subjects at the same time while listening to hours and hours of podcasts and 'weird' music and dancing in the living room. Meditating at least an hour everyday, and doing Yoga. When I have to get shit done I get into a frenzy of productivity, after which at least a week of nothing. I have ADHD so I also have like 6 hobby's I'm very skilled at and I'm a insanely interesting conversationalist (I've been told). And I've recently discovered a strong passion for teaching, I enjoy teaching things in my pottery class. And yet when I'm dating I can't help myself making her the centre of my excistence, which, again, scares her away. I get off on intelligence, smarts and kindness, the stable ones who don't scare easily.\n\nAlso I'm a lot more comfortable with my past now, accepted a lot of trauma and forgave a lot of toxic people. I feel I'm ready for her now, as long as she's not poking too much it at weak spots. So I want and will have that steady girlfriend, I know what kind, the older and more stable ones, like the ones who do yoga. My kind of woman, gorgeous, smart, spiritual and genuinely kindhearted, just like me. Having a casual long conversation and a good laugh is how I roll, but asking my yoga teacher out still seems 'weird'...should I ??\n\ntldr: I still have a lot to learn regarding relationships so I want to and 'need' to ask someone I know well out, which oufcourse scares the sh@#$t out of me, but I will still do it regardless and learn something from it.",

I've often complained over and over again that it was unfair that my peers were getting so ahead in life: why am I not getting job offers, why do I have no friends or invitations to parties, why can't I go to a prestigious college, get a date from attractive partners, etc.  Although I grew up fairly affluent, I did not have an easy life: my brother was an alcoholic, my family was mentally ill and stole stuff from us, mother died of brain cancer, and I was diagnosed with High Functioning Autism and had trouble with socializing and fine motor skills. Through self reflection, I'm assuming my sense of entitlement came from the fact that my learning disabilities made things difficult that seemed easier for other peers my age, but not sure. I also had behavior problems, meaning my teachers, parents, and other adults rarely trusted me because of my emotional immaturity and impulsiveness. It made me pissed off seeing all my peers happier than me and often compare myself to them. However, now I know that at my age, there is no excuse and need to work hard and have to expect life to be unfair with tons of rejections, etc.. However, that does not seem so straightforward.

I need to know what kind of therapy would be best suited for a single 24 year old guy trying to build the confidence to speak to women in anything other than a platonic sense.\n\n---\n\nI'm convinced I'm going to die alone. I cannot talk to women. I *know* they don't want to talk to me. Whether or not it's true, that's the reality in my mind. It's so convincing, and there's nothing in my life that's giving me any reason to challenge it.\n\nI killed it in school. I landed a fantastic job with amazing benefits. I'm financially stable (thriving even). I have a car and I'm planning on buying a house. Work has its ups and downs but I like it, and I'm doing well at it and getting better. I have an active hobby in rock climbing.\n\nBut socially, I'm in a pit. I have a few great friends, but despite them asking me to come along, I feel like I'd be better if I weren't there. I often feel like my friends and coworkers look down on me or are patronizing me. I feel like they're tired of me and the way I obsessively talk about my interests, or the stupid jokes I make that don't quite land. I was finally thinking about it today, and I realized that I don't share any major interests with any of my friends or coworkers anymore. I feel like I'm on an isolated little island despite being surrounded by people, because whenever I'm with someone, it's got something to do with their interests.\n\nI've also had girlfriends in the past, but since my 8th grade crush I haven't met a single one of them in person. Every relationship has started online, and a few were strictly online. I shouldn't feel weird about that, but I do. It makes me feel weak that I can't meet someone in person. And when I'm in these relationships, I don't connect with my partner. I've never felt \"in love\". I had a single crush in high school and a single crush in college, and they faded away quickly. I've been sexually intimate, but somehow I still feel like a virgin, and a pathetic one at that. I don't know if I'm afraid to approach women. I don't feel afraid to. What I feel is an immovable certainty that she doesn't want to talk to me. What I feel is an imagined reality so convincing that tells me I shouldn't even bother wasting my time, only to embarrass myself.\n\nI don't feel interesting. People don't engage with my interests. I don't feel funny. I'm not quick witted, I drop many of my jokes during execution, and others just simply fail to land. I suck at telling stories, forgetting details, sequences of events, and including too much irrelevant information.\n\nI've had friends and family both tell me the same thing, using the same words (which is so specific it was kind of suspicious): \"You're too clinical\". Honestly, I don't exactly know what they mean, but I assume it means that my personality is about as interesting as a 65 year old doctor giving a lecture on skin cancer to a 12 year old who doesn't want to wear sunscreen.\n\nI know I need to work on myself. I've lost 30 pounds and I'm no longer overweight. I've gotten my hair cut and long since fixed my facial hair (which no one liked). I dress pretty decently, especially for work. But I watched 4 years of high school melt away while I was \"working on myself\". I watched another 5 years of college do the same, with nothing to show for it socially. It feels like there's just nothing valuable about me as a romantic partner (or sometimes even as a friend). \n\nClearly I need help \"working on myself\". I just don't know where to go to get that help. I need someone to slap me on the wrist and tell me what I'm doing wrong. I need someone to teach me how to find value in myself and stop seeking external validation. It's just... when I have no external validation, it feels like an arrogant lie to say \"everyone else is wrong, I do have value\".\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through this mess. I know it's a story as old as time, and not quite as interesting the 1000th time through.",

And all the money it would cost.\n\n\nI don't come from a wealthy family and don't really get along with anyone in my family. They actually are the reason, I believe, for my stress, anxiety, and depression. When I was younger I felt strong as if I could do anything. Now I feel weak and like my mental state is really taking a toll on my life in a negative way.\n\n\n- Ican't focus on anything and get distracted easily. I can't study and I should be studying right now for my MCAT exam\u2026 for medical school admissions\n\nI hate how I look. My nose, my face, my body, my teeth, everything\u2026 stress and depression definitely had a big toll on me.\n\nBecause of my broken nose, I have trouble breathing sometimes and get overwhelmed quickly. Have like mini panic attacks that just come out of nowhere.\n\nI have white hairs like someone in his 50s\n\nI don't like my environment (living with my family)\n\nI'm socially not so great from not much experience with this. Therore, I can't find friends to keep me sane sometimes when I can't deal with the stress of my family.\n\nI can't sleep at night because of thoughts that are always running in my head.\n\nThere are constant thoughts running in my mind.\n\nI'm bored with everything in life. Tv, movies, YouTube, sports, games. Eventually turn to porn just to get some feeling out of something and that just makes things all the worse.\n\n\nThese are just some of the problems I'm facing right now. I was home alone for like 2 weeks and I was so happy. Socially, I was making convos with people at school. Life was good. Then, I meet up with family again\u2026 stress comes back, can't sleep at night, depressed, want to suicide. Just being around them is a constant reminder of why I am how I am. A person I don't like and a person who wants to change but can't.\n\n\nAnother problem that's been happening for a year now. Dreaming of winning the lottery\u2026 I play the lottery here and there and there are some days I just fantasize what I could do and wrote down all the things I would do in detail. Nothing like buy a yacht or a mansion. Just things like buying an apartment a bit far from where my current family lives and just focus on changing to be a better person. I want to make people proud. My dad had always pressured me to be something in my life and to focus on making money. I hate everything about him. Even if it's true it makes me want to do the opposite. This could be why I don't feel like studying sometimes. I feel like I'm just doing it for him. Grade-wise I feel like learning for me is easy but i have many mental barriers that prevents me from even begining. I've wasted months just fantasizing of a better life. The only way I see that happening is by winning the lottery and moving out.\n\n\nLast thing. I don't know why but I get really attached to girls recently. I was extremely in love with a girl for 2 years and I finally got over her and was feeling better. I promised myself not to think about a relationship for a while and focus on school. Then, I meet another girl and I just get too attached. I can't be chill when I'm around her. I act like an idiot and always say or do something stupid. Maybe it's the stress and anxiety that prevents me from saying or doing the right things. Afterwards, I think of all 1 million things I could have said or done differently. This lasts months at a time.\n\n\nI do have good days but I know they're going to end. Usually with some physical factor that leads to deep depressing bad days. These factors include any of the things mentioned above. Daydreaming of a better life, being self conscious, family arguments that are meaningless, etc. I don't know what to do to get out of this rut or how I'm gonna do it\u2026 but it has been 12 damn years and things have just gotten worse.\n\n\nI have seen a therapist, maybe he was just bad but it helped temporarily. I hate going to him cause it's the same generic questions and doesn't seem like he is actually listening or cares. It's his job.",

Currently living with my mom and my girlfriend (for financial reasons).\nPretty much since I left school, my life seems to be in a constant downward spiral.\nI moved out the house when I was 18, got my own place, had a car, a job. I managed to get into a college on a scholarship. Pretty much from there everything just flipped on its head.\nI had a car accident which killed the car, then with out transport to college, I was forced to drop out.\nMy then girlfriend and I moved in together into a place closer to work. We had a housemate who we didn't know was on some hardcore drugs, and that pushed us into a financial pickle. That pickle has not ended. We had a kid, who is now 4.\nAt a later stage, my mom and my gran moved in with us, to help with financial issues.\nWe then broke up.\nIt wasn't much longer and I met my current girlfriend. Last year, my gran passed away, and she was the main source of income in the house with her pension. Things went even further downhill.\nY current job is decent paying, but way under what it should be paying in the field. My boss is a cunt, and so on. I've been looking for a new job for some time now, with no luck. I have no inspiration to do anything but sit on the couch, get high or sleep. I have about 0 friends, simply because my best friend from a few years ago completely ruined how I see friends. We don't go out anymore, there's no money for it or we just don't want to be around people. I feel I have no drive to meet anyone or do anything which I could be passionate about. I don't even know how to find what I'm passionate about. I feel like an empty can, with almost no emotions, or care for anything. Almost numb about everything.\n\nI just need advice on how to find the spark again to get me going. I feel if I don't, things are not going to end well, and possibly with myself in a grave.\n\nTIA",

I'm a 19 year old man who already has grey hairs growing on my head because of the amount of stress I put myself through every day. \nIt's never been something I noticed before, just constantly grinding to improve and move forward in life, but it's lately been putting a big strain on myself and my relationship. I'm constantly ignoring all that I achieve and expecting more, expecting perfection. This habit has trickled over to doing the same to my girlfriend. Not something I'm proud of at all. We have both made huge strides in each of our lives in the last year and I'm constantly pushing myself and her for more, it feels like I have a constant need to achieve more and more. It's almost like I cannot allow myself to be proud of myself and I've started letting that habit apply to her to. \n\nIt's a habit I want to kill quick because seeing the effect it has on me and how it affects my behavior towards her makes me very concerned about what it will do to our daughter as she gets older. \n\nAny advice or words of wisdom for a young father and spouse?

TL;DR at the end**\n\nProfessionally, I simply don\u2019t know what I want, and pretty much never have. I have a BA in Sociology, which I chose because I ran out of time to pick a major and had to squeeze one into 3 semesters to graduate on time. I have a job in insurance claims because it basically fell into my lap. It\u2019s as unfulfilling of a job as I can imagine. I hate corporate America and view what I do as meaningless, spending my days cutting through red tape put there for seemingly no reason. But I stay because it pays well ($75k) and I have no idea what else to do.\n\nIf that was my only problem, I feel like I could motivate myself to figure things out. But simultaneously, I have the even more concerning issue of my personal life, or lack of one. A quick summary: I fell hard for a girl when I was in high school, never got a chance with her, and never got any of the basic relationship/sexual experience my peers did. This bled into college, and by the time I was really ready to move on from her, I was a junior and had no idea how to pursue any kind of romantic relationship or sexual encounter. I made a few unsuccessful attempts and found that girls were simply uninterested in me. Since college I\u2019ve pretty much stopped trying, with one exception when I came close to hooking up with a friend from HS but yet again failed to cross the finish line and watched things fizzle out.\n\nThe non-romantic side of my personal life is quickly becoming just as non-existent. Most of my friends have moved away to different states, and the ones left near me are busy with their own lives most of the time. I pretty much do nothing outside of work 99% of the time. I live at home with my parents and usually wind up watching TV with them or alone in my free time. I\u2019m an introvert so going out to socialize with strangers is just about the least-appealing thing I can imagine. I really feel like my best bet is to find someone to be in a relationship with and go all-in on that. One-on-one just feels more comfortable to me.\n\nIf I\u2019m being honest with myself, I\u2019m probably a 6/10 in the looks department. I know I\u2019m being objective, as overall I kinda hate myself anyway, so I\u2019d have no problem calling myself ugly if I was.  I\u2019ve tried using the usual dating apps but I rarely get likes. Most people I work with are older than me and have families, so I really have no idea how I\u2019m ever going to meet someone. And even the thought of meeting someone is terrifying because I know I\u2019d just screw it up thanks to my sheer lack of any experience whatsoever. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do and would appreciate any advice, input, or even just someone who\u2019s been there. If you read all this, thanks, I know it was long.\n\n\nTL;DR - Feel like I have no control. Hate my job, don\u2019t know what I want, lonely forever-single virgin with no friends, and fear that my lack of experience will blow any future chances I get.",

I\u2019m pretty outwardly normal and host a small but successful local tv program that hardly pays anything. People come to me for mentor ship and career advice, and while I\u2019m knowledgeable about these things I\u2019m a hypocrite who can\u2019t take his own advice.\n\nI got my \u201cstart\u201d on YouTube in 2012 by making a viral hit that blew up and gave me enough income to sustain myself without having to work. It was quick money and a long time dream of mine. It was also the beginning of my depression and anxiety when I started to try and figure out what to create next. I still can\u2019t decide if this was overall a good or bad thing to happen in my life, because I feel it enabled the lifestyle I live today.\n\nWell I tried and failed on that. Nothing stuck and I was hit with crippling creative block which furthered the depression. I turned to drinking to self medicate and over the next few years became an alcoholic. A lot of my drinking stems from the anxiety and depression that I felt like I was wasting my twenties while everyone was starting careers I was half-assedly trying to be an artist. It used to be a good way to alleviate the pain until eventually it wasn\u2019t and started creating more problems for me. \n\nIt slowly went from \u201cI am wasting my twenties\u201d to \u201cI have wasted my twenties\u201d. I have made attempts to rectify this and start a career but never really latched onto anything - although I am inherently smart, great with people, and good at sales - I could find nothing the really spoke to me. I worked as a software developer for a startup until a few months ago when the startup went under, but while I was good at it I just don\u2019t see myself doing that forever - it\u2019s too isolating and stressful. \n\nI\u2019m sober now but I feel the self loathing creeping up and I\u2019m trying to do everything I can to stop that because drinking will ruin me. At 30 I see on facebook friends of mine going to exotic locations, having fun, getting married and I feel like a failure.  Part of me just feels that I deserve this and this is my punishment for being a stubborn jackass and not doing something about this sooner. It\u2019s pathetic but I need help, I\u2019m bad at asking for it. I have a girlfriend now who thinks the world of me, she\u2019s a manager of an insurance company and incredibly badass - makes 6 figures - and doesn\u2019t mind paying the bills while I find a new job but that makes me feel even shittier and even a bit emasculating for me, I\u2019m sure she thinks less of me too.\n\nI\u2019m self conscious of what people think of me to a huge fault (was bullied a lot in high school), and I feel like if I start building a career now I am so far behind everyone else my age that I\u2019ll be playing catch-up forever, so what\u2019s the point? I recognize this is defeatist thinking but I can\u2019t help but feel this overbearing weight on me. I\u2019m tired of feeling like a leech and depending on handouts from my parents (nothing crazy, just $30 here or there once a month for doing odd jobs for them). I need some help or advice from people that have been through bouts of this - how did you guys pick yourselves up? Is being 30 too late to start over? The ironic thing is the only thing I am passionate about is fitness, not even video games or reddit help at this point.\n\nAre there any good books or stories of encouragement? I just feel like I\u2019m too old to get it together and it\u2019s incredibly demotivating, and I\u2019m better off pretending everything is alright to my friends. I have no savings or anything, shitty credit score, and still paying off my student loans for a degree I didn\u2019t even finish. I\u2019d literally be starting fresh at 30.",

            "content": "Hi there, wasn't really sure where to post this or if I should post it here, but it seemed relevant. If there is a better r/ feel free to tag it in comments. This is gonna sound depressing at first, but I think there's a point somewhere in all of it. \n\nSo a few days ago, I think I finally came to the realization that I've been self sabotaging myself for a long time, and avoiding as many responsibilities for as long as possible. I've always viewed myself as a very carefree personality, with some quirks as in, I like things a certain or particular way sometimes.\n\nLet me elaborate on self-sabotage. I am a CHRONIC procrastinator. For example, I avoid renewing my car tags for no good reason, for literally years, and I haven't had car insurance in a long time either. I've gotten multiple tickets for both of these, pay them off, then don't fix the problem. I blame a lot of my problems on not having enough money or time, or not having the capability, when truthfully, I usually have enough of all three. If I don't have enough money, it's because I irresponsibly spent it on something else because I convinced myself to not spend it on something I NEED. If I plan to do something but don't follow through and someone asks why, I casually brush it off with an \"It's not that big of a deal\" or \"I can always do it/try again later\". I don't have health insurance because I couldn't be bothered to go to the online Marketplace and fill some crap out. That was last year. This year I went through all the paperwork, then didn't pay my first premium in January because I procrastinated right past the date. This is absolutely stupid since I have chronic asthma and I'm nearing 30. I should be on preventative/maintenance medication but I'm not. Around the age of 22 I started smoking weed. I put it off for so long as a teenager because of negative bias with some acquaintances and my mothers chronic boyfriend. But then once I started I had my bias changed. Now, 5 years later, I'm starting to think that smoking may be contributing to my self-sabotage. It makes me feel good, I relax, procrastination becomes almost instinctual. Mostly because it is an amazing alternative to doing anything I really NEED or SHOULD be doing. If you need a recent example, just this week I starting having body pain in a sensitive area. I researched possibilities, googled symptoms, everything. And then did nothing about it all week. I self medicated with acetaminophen and weed. The fact that I even used acetaminophen shows you how bad my self sabotage is. I was so concerned with visiting a doctor, telling them I don't have insurance, where the pain is, having to decide which treatment I can afford because I don't have insurance, all of which is also my own fault... I would look up symptoms and the best way to handle them just to avoid the doctor. Even if it is something that antibiotics will have to clear up.\n\nAll of these things that I do or don't do, I always justify it in my mind. I literally have the thought that I should/shouldn't do these things, that there could be terrible consequences. I physically hear the voice in my head. And I ignore it. I can \"feel\" my brain actively ignoring the urgency and comforting itself into procrastination or denial like \"You can do it later.\" or \"You don't need to do this. What's really gonna happen?\" or \"Why spend money on that when you can spend it on something you actually want?\" \n\nI've spent the past two months in a deep mental crisis, thinking about all my mistakes, where I am now, where I could be, etc. And it wasn't until last week sometime, that I believe I discovered my root problem, is self sabotage. I am where I am because of me. External factors be blasted, I am upset with my life because of me, and the only way to change it, is to start ignoring that voice that says not to do anything. Stop giving in to procrastination. If I am aware that I am actively making a choice to not do something because of one tiny little voice, I need to recognize it.\n\nSo I made a doctor's appointment for my pain. Step one. It's not a lot, but I did something that needed to be done. Step two; ask about asthma medication while at the doctor. Look at that I can knock two things out at once. Step three; renew tags, even if it costs a lot. Step four; profit. lol\n\nI don't entirely know the point of this post. I think it's partially to show a look inside what it's like to be a slave to your self sabotage, and how it can literally hold your life hostage if you succumb to how comfortable procrastination and avoiding failure is. I've only just started this journey but, I don't know, I felt like maybe typing this out and posting it on reddit might make someone else feel like they can do it too.\n\nEDIT: I read somewhere that expressing yourself when you feel like you've achieved a victory, however small, can have a big impact on your future \"battles\", so I guess that's part of why I shared this too.",

For example:\n\n* Former sorority sister is basically facebook-blogging her recent journey with a professional mentor, and how happy she is now and now she's a mentor too and blah blah blah \\*eyeroll\\*\n* Posts with lots of \"ladies, you can DO this!!\" and \"find your tribe\" and all of that feminine positivity crap \\*eyeroll\\*\n* My best friend's sister-in-law posing in a flower field with her huge first-time pregnancy belly in a flowing gorgeous dress with her preppy husband, two beautiful dogs, boasting about how beautiful life is when i know they're living off two teacher salaries and just bought a house \\*VOMIT and eyeroll\\*\n* Perhaps saddest of all, someone being honestly goofy in front of the world, not to get likes or anything but to just live. \\*reluctant eyeroll because i actually wish i could do that\\*\n\nMaybe these posts are insincere.

I dont even try anymore, I am 20 now, and I dont wanna be stuck with this for the rest of my life. \n\nIn my personal life everything I set my mind to, I got really good at.

The incels tried to get me to join their cult, but I cried because I couldn't bear the thought of accepting this fate so early on in life, I wanted to make my life better, not accept the fate of an incel (or cuck? Apparently not hating women despite their rejection makes me a cuck, ironically, and unfortunately, I get off to cuckold porn, which makes me feel even worse about myself).\n\nOne of my professors in community college made a comment how we should be getting through our classes so we can move on in life, as opposed to repeating multiple years like some students have. Despite how high school sucked, I had a sense of what was going to happen, and I considered flunking on purpose so I'd get held back and couldn't graduate, didn't happen though, I graduated on time, and sat in the fucking house, too scared to drive, which was a literal roadblock, I just kind of got left at home and I was refused rides, now being in a decently urban area, I get them often, and have Uber to fill in the gaps.\n\nBack to what the professor said, \"You don't want to repeat, you want to get through your classes and move on with your life.\" This struck a particular chord with me, as I AM DREADING THE FUTURE. I feel I have nothing to move forward to, if I'm just going to be a foreveralone virgin, I don't care about anything else, that was the one thing I really looked forward to, not even just sex, but having a loving girlfriend too (but definitely sex too, I particularly want a gentlefemdom girlfriend, because I'm a submissive boy, not a dominant man, and I need lots of affection and nurturing, but I don't want a relationship that's 100% kink 24/7, I want normal relationship aspects too, and I never want kids, I can't risk them going through the suffering and misery I went, and still go through, I can not bring a child(ren) into this world without their consent, which obviously isn't possible to get, and I rather have a more sexual/adventurous relationship anyway, kids would interfere too much, and the cost of living is high enough just for one person to support theirself.\n\nI decided to post here, since you are about selfimprovement, as virgins (and definitely any incels, even \"withouthate\") just reinforce my terrifying beliefs, I mean, if they're failing too, they can't offer me advice, no offense to anyone, but even the ex-virgins that stick around are still pretty inexperienced. \n\nI'm miserable every day of my life, and sex and relationships is constantly on my mind. I've never even kissed a girl. \n\nThis is preventing me from truly diving into improving myself, which obviously lowers my chances even more. Sitting at home doing nothing was TERRIBLE, so I still go to work and school, but my mind is so busy/preoccupied, that my efforts are not as focused as they should be.\n\nI literally just turned a paper in (online) 7 hours before it was due because I've been busy worrying about my lonely celibate future (well, ALSO just getting distracted by funny YouTube videos, I also just flat out have horrible time management, always have, I wish I could freeze time!)\n\nI still don't have my full driver license, but did get a permit. I can almost never practice, as only my dad would do it with me, and he doesn't even come down once a week anymore because him and my mom are back to arguing like when they were married, over him disagreeing with how she parents my sister (his daughter). There are valid reasons for that, but that's off topic.\n\nMy step dad has driven with me too, but he's gone 4-5 days a week for his job.\n\nI have actually gotten over my FEAR of driving, BIG TIME, my parents made sure to let me know how much I\u2019ve improved (oh yeah, I can't drive with my mom because she's a nervous wreck, sometimes even when she's the one driving), I remember when 25 MPH was the max I felt safe, now I can go 60 MPH on roads with other cars (no highways or freeways yet though).\n\nIn the beginning of driving, it was really that I decided being alive was pointless if I had to always sit at home, so I might as well risk getting in a car wreck if that opens life up. \n\nI also haven't learned backing up yet, that's confusing, but I've been focusing on forward driving when I've been able to practice. My lefts and rights mix up when the POV is swapped (like my left is your right, your right is my left) but I'm sure I could figure this out with practice too?\n\nI still rather not have to drive, but the only other option is Uber here, and that gets expensive, I think more than owning a car would be.\n\nWomen would generally only not be turned off by a man who doesn't drive or have a car in a city/metro area where the transit is really good, at least from what I've gathered.\n\nI'd be so insecure if I did ask a woman out and I had to take Uber. My family shoved how important driving is down my throat for years, and in my part of the country it is really car dependent, sure we have Uber now, but that really adds up fast if you take it everywhere, and gas is actually pretty low right now.....\n\nI feel like I could probably get by without driving (I DO NOT want to have to do it ALL THE TIME, which the vast majority of people outside major cities with mass transit do) if I could get skilled in a good job that I could go do in a major city (with transit, as some major cities have really poor transit that only operates downtown).\n\nI really want to be able to work from home, by myself, clients being online, and not having to deal with a-hole bosses, being my own boss, self-employment. Although, if my degree also allowed me to work for a company, that would be a good safety net starting out.\n\nI'm currently aiming for graphic design, but since I just started and am taking my core classes first, I very well may change my major.\n\nAnother important note: I thought I was just too ugly so I was unlovable and unfuckable. Apparently, I'm at least average, but attractive to SOME number of women (but to most I'm unattractive or average).\n\nI've had people tell me that (especially for men) you don't even need to be physically attractive to get laid, and even a relationship. \n\nI was hoping that either way (if I'm ugly or not) I could make myself attractive in other ways like personality, skills, but virgins telling me \"BECOMING INDEPENDENT DOESN'T MAKE YOU MORE ATTRACTIVE AT ALL!\" is a hope killer....\n\nMaybe these guys are just stuck in the same mindset as me, feeling hopeless, so they echo it, and my brain takes everything so literally, but I have no evidence to prove that these literal thoughts aren\u2019t true.\n\nI\u2019m not a \u201ctraditional\u201d \u201cmasculine\u201d man, I\u2019m more like Nick\u2019s dad on \u201cBig Mouth\u201d (OK, I\u2019m a little more masculine than him, a little bit) and I never will be, and my fetishes/kinks will never go away, I\u2019ve had them since I was too young to even have sexual feelings and functions (they just weren\u2019t sexual before puberty).\n\nI don\u2019t want to be a foreveralone virgin. I don\u2019t even want to enter my 30s as a virgin who\u2019s never had a girlfriend. I didn\u2019t want to reach 25 this way, but that\u2019s eleven months away....\n\nCan I control my fate? I don\u2019t want to end up like those 30-40+ year old virgins!!! No offense guys if you see this, but I just can\u2019t go through life that way.",

            "content": "Hello /r/selfimprovement \n\n\n\nI'm honestly not that good in writing a coherent motivational and interesting post. However for many reasons i want to start tracking my progress here for atleast once a month, occasionally maybe more, for accountability and because writing it here feels more official than writing it only on a private journal.\n\nFor some people this may be interesting, for some it may be motivating, for some it may be boring. I'm not here to teach you techniques, im here to just track my progress with the techniques and knowledge I've learned.\n\nAbout me: I feel like i've missed out on many things in life, because ive been lazy, unaware, addicted. While lot of amazing things have happened too, last couple years i have felt pretty dead inside, that is why in 2020 i decided to revive myself. Im +20 years old, i recently decided to quit my school and apply for a new one soon because old one wasn't the right industry for me, right now im literally free to do anything, to completely reinvent myself, i have nowhere to go, no one to respond to but myself. Im searching for a job right now but apart from that i have only free time. \n \nI know that if i change what i do daily, i can completely change my life in 6 months.\n\nI know its going to be painful, it is going to be boring, but nothing is as painful and boring as staying here where i know i dont belong. I want to face my fears.\n\n\nthings i want to accomplish during these 6 months \n\n\nLosing a good amount of weight with ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, stay away from my food addiction which has been my #1 enemy in life, however, more than ever, im ready to fuck that motherfucker in the ass\n\nCure my social anxiety and low self-esteem and low self-confidence, or at the very least improve it by a big margin, which i know is definitely possible\n\nStart exercising consistently (even taking a extra walk intentionally 3 times a week counts, because right now its zero)\n\n-Read 20 pages of a book everyday\n\nMost of my unhappiness is because im obese, have no social connections, have anxiety in public and very likely desensitized dopamine receptors from coping with depression with the wrong things ( porn, alcohol, junk food etc)\n\nI'm not trying to change too much but i still have so much i want to accomplish and have gotten rid of what is not important to me right now.\n\nThrough countless failures, relapses, high realizations, I've realized how unhappy i am currently and how changing my daily habits will COMPLETELY change my life. Im in a point where simply only losing weight would make me 1000x happier, however i've been really interested about self-improvement for last couple years and have learned a lot and know many more things i want to improve in myself.\n\n\nI hope that by end of 2020 i will feel ALIVE (hence the revival), confident and more happy than i have been in years, and that is not a lot to ask because ive been at the bottom for last couple years.\n\nOkay so what I'm starting to do starting tomorrow? (i have already done these for weeks/months but this is a special day and since i quit the school which made me really unhappy i want a new fresh start and be the best person i can become when i get to a new school)\n\n\n- My new years resolution (20 minutes of meditation every single day of 2020, have done it so far even on days where i totally didnt feel like it, im committed as i notice its benefits)\n\n- Wake up atleast before 10 am and use the morning-day for working and then in the evening i can chill and relax with a good conscience feeling good about how i used the day\n\n- Committing to ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting\n\n- Not watching porn or masturbate for next 6 months, nothing to lose but so much to gain. My best is 29 days and i felt amazing.\n\nIve studied and felt how  porn negatively affects me, i've felt how amazing it feels to keep my sexual energy inside me. And i want to stop thinking about it and completely commit for 6 months to a lifestyle free of porn and masturbation. There hasnt been a relapse where i ever felt like it was worth it, but never have i regretted a day free of porn. \n\nI have spent last couple years very badly, and i realize i dont want to spend another year of my twenties living the way i have, i know there is so much more in me and im ready to see what i can become.\n\nThis is not everything im doing but i just wanted to make a post and not just forget it, so here it is. My goals are personal and they are not all listed here.\n\nI will not try to make this too long, and im sorry it is messy, in the end im writing this for myself, but just for everyone to see :)\n\nI will check in atleast once a month on how i am feeling, how well i have done on my habits, what i've learned etc. \n\nThank you for reading this\n\nto better days",

            "title": "30/M, struggling with long-time video game avoidance feedback loops, dissatisfaction in real-life activities, and possible eating disorder? Would love to hear from those who relate or found a solution",
            "content": "As my title probably already illustrates, I'm having a hard time framing what I'm trying to say. I'm going to try to keep it as short as possible, and I guess I can expand if someone thinks a direction is relevant.\n\nI've dealt with depression since I was a child, and for the most part I've just ignored my way past it. Medication and therapy was not my answer, and I've just done my best to weather the storm and keep aware of myself on the bad days when they come. I try to keep a lot of the healthy boxes checked, but as I'm 30 and I'm trying to really make progressive change in my life and my desires, I find myself holding my breath and trying to power through whatever new awareness I have, only to deflate as soon as I lose my concentration. I've fought this my whole life, feeling like I'm in unknown weather, and the only thing that comes out of it at the end is myself back at square one while my good intentions have collapsed.\n\nAs I have gotten older and also as video game models have shifted, I'm having an existential crisis. From a young age, I've always escaped into my games (Pokemon, Goldeneye as a kid, World of Warcraft through high school, misc games through the 20's.) But now I'm just not really getting the satisfaction from any of them. On top of the fact that morally I'm outraged that games these days are half-finished shit chocked full of payments for content. I've been slowly drifting away from games for a few years, especially as most of my social circle stopped playing games together, which I think was a big part of gaming in my teens/20's. I still play with some close friends, but we burn through games and it barely lasts.\n\nI KNOW that what I got out of games was grinding to unlock something for skill or player expression. For instance, Assassin's Creed, unlock all outfits, red dead redemption, get all guns, all outfits, horses, etc. I've always loved customizing, completing collections, and being able to make my experience MY OWN. Now that most games follow a 'pay to unlock' model, I find myself grinding out weapons or skins here or there, but I've lost interest in paying money to unlock a skin, then not wanting to play the game because the incentive is lost as the content was bought. I've spent thousands of dollars over my 20's on games like League of Legends, and I used to argue 20 dollars a month was acceptable, but the buy-in and time investment these days is too high to justify my continued subscription. Or the grind was artifically inflated and dragged out to incentivize financial buyout, which makes content feel tedious instead of rightfully earned (GTA:Online).\n\nSo I'm seeing the divide in where, I don't get the satisfaction I used to out of games, the games themselves have literally changed from what I used to enjoy, and now as I try to find other things to do, I just don't have ANY connection to it. I tell myself that I'm interested in reading, yoga, stretching, writing, drawing, just to name a few. And I do enjoy these things. But there's no maze to them, there's no unlock, no customization, my attention and motivation for them is completely gone. I'm stuck between 'turning my engine over' hopelessly trying to find what I crave from a new game, or I'm listlessly infuriated and bored that nothing in the real world will hold my interest.\n\nI used to remember playing legos for hours on end as a child, and now I struggle to spend five minutes playing Legos with my daughter, and I think it roots back to the 'where's the reward, no reward, no reason to be doing it' mentality. It's painful to admit this or think it out loud. I'm by definition a good dad in 90% of all aspects, but I'm fighting against some deeply ingrained negativity in the fabric of my own persona which makes me feel selfish and unable to connect on a deeper level than 'what interests me' - which is a catch 22, as really the answer is nothing. I'm terrified for my daughter to imprint this behavior, and I want to learn how to overcome it in myself.\n\nSo, I'm seeing the video game feedback loop issue - almost drug-like, where I want my fix, but can't get it anymore. If there isn't a series of rewards at given intervals, I am not motivated to pursue the actions to obtain them.\n\nI'm seeing my disconnection with real life, which is probably part of the 'drug/video game' mindset I've ingrained in myself, and also part that depression has honestly left me with very little connection to every day life. I have always just escaped from reality, that I have no relationship with it outside novelty here or there.\n\nAnd another big one is, I just hate food. My wife was talking to me the other day about how 'not all food disorders revolve around self-image', and it really made me wonder. Almost everyone in my immediate family has some hate relationship with cooking or food, even into cousins and aunts. I suffer extreme food choice paralysis, nothing stands out. My food choices are defined more by 'what doesn't sound like it would make me feel sick' rather than what sounds good. I hate eating breakfast, almost anything I can think of eating in the morning would again make me feel overwhelmed or sick to my stomach. As I've been supplementing more exercise into my daily routines, I have a stronger appetite, but STILL nothing sounds good, and it feels so shitty to be starving and all thought of food is bleh. I tend to eat a lot of yogurt/cheese/hard boiled eggs/quickly prepared foods (PBJ, bean/cheese burritos) because by the time I'm starving, I just need to eat something. I have no interest in preparing food, because I have no interest in consuming food. I don't know how much of that is a food issue, or ties back into the dissociation with real life issue.\n\nAnyway, I don't know what sort of response I expect, but I had to try to consolidate my feelings and thoughts on this topic. To say it out loud helps me feel like it's real, and not just that I'm a lazy sack of shit. I am a perfectionist, and it's so difficult to be below my own bar in regard to this issue. In dealing with depression and perfectionism, I just sort of learned to 'not care', and now I'm really afraid that I threw the baby out with the bathwater, and I have no idea how to get it back.\n\nI do enjoy going to yoga, it gets me out of the house and I'm held accountable to do something with a teacher present, but my schedule doesn't always allow it, and classes aren't always at the same times. I get a great sense of satisfaction from finding ways to better organize and aesthetically improve our home, but that is budget-restricted and some days I just want to throw everything out, as I can't find a system to provide the positive boost from completing an efficiency improvement circuit. Doing anything for the sake of \"it\" feels so empty. I want to walk SOMEWHERE, I want to drive to A PLACE, but I just don't have the 'things' which make it purposeful. I don't want to just buy new things all the time, I want to find actual meaning in things. Not just consumer/dopamine relief.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Does anyone have any tangible idea how to re-connect with the pleasure and satisfaction of real life? Can anyone relate to anything I'm thinking or experiencing? Thanks for any of your time you invested in reading about this. I really appreciate it.",

            "content": "Success is not a statement of account\n\nIt is a statement of your soul. \n\nIn continue to my previous post. \n\nLet\u2019s imagine that you\u2019ve just got an Oscar. You are standing on the stage, and you are supposed to be happy. You are smiling - broadly, because it is considered quite normal to smile if you\u2019ve just got Oscar. Millions of people looking at their screens believe you are happy and successful. But you (for whatever reason) are not happy at the moment, you don\u2019t think that you are particularly successful, and your smile is false. Maybe you think that you don\u2019t deserve it. Maybe you think that the jury was wrong and your job is not that good. Whatever. You must feel successful, but you don\u2019t. That\u2019s it.  \n\nWhen somebody pronounce a word \u201csuccess\u201d the first to things we start to think of are - money and fame. This is the consequence of the pressure of the traditional media, movies and social media. In contemporary society success equals a celebrity. Can you imagine people believing they are successful even though they are poor? It is hard to do. \n\nBut it is possible. \n\nLet\u2019s imagine a school teacher. In the majority of the countries people of this trade are paid rather poorly. One hardly can find a picture of The Teacher of The Year at the Forbes cover. They rarely drive Ferrari and travel in business class. \n\nSome of them are average teachers, some are bad ones. But some of them are great in what they do. We all remember some teachers from childhood who had the calling for the occupation. But were (or are) they successful? Depends from the point of view. \n\nSometimes when a teacher with the minimal wage looks at a showcase of a car dealership and see Land Rovers and BMWs, they might feel unhappy and unsuccessful. They work hard but will never be able to afford a car of that kind. \n\nBut when current and former students say them \u201cThank you so much!\u201d, and they do it sincerely, do teachers feel successful? Surely they do. \n\nSo, success is not on one\u2019s bank account. It is just in one\u2019s mind. I am not a millionaire and, I am afraid, will never be. Can\u2019t say that I desperately need it. I am happy being who I am. Of course, I would be glad to have a million or two on my bank account, but I have to take in consideration the way I am going to get it. I am not ready to sacrifice my health and my family to it. \n\nBut am I successful? A couple of years ago I would have said that I was not. Now I would rather say that I am. The statement of my account is approximately the same. So what\u2019s the difference? The difference is my mindset. I have found a work of my dream and I devote a lot of time to it. And it bears fruit. It not only brings me enough money to support my family - it also helps me feel successful. \n\nPeople spending majority of their time to the things they love to do are successful. And this is the only measure (if they are not criminals, of course:))",

            "content": "I worked hard in my first business. But I never knew how to work smart, not hard. I did well financially but still, I didn\u2019t work smart enough.\n\n## My story of working hard\n\nIn 2005, I created my first business: a Russian translation agency.\n\nI would wake up early, walk the dog, kiss my wife and son, and go to work at 5 am. And I would return around 9 pm. When I had urgent translation projects, I would sit translating for 18 hours straight. No rest. Just quick unhealthy snacks. On average, I worked about 90 hours per week for about 14 years.\n\nWith this hard work came two results.\n\n## Result 1\n\nI felt happy, probably at a level 8 out of 10. I loved what I was doing because I\u2019m passionate about languages and translation. And as a workaholic, hard work made me happy.\n\n## Result 2\n\nI built a solid business employing several people. And I was doing pretty well financially.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger wrote:\n\n*\u201cI\u2019m a great believer in hard work, grinding it out, and not stopping till it\u2019s done.\u201d*\n\n## Realization 1: I worked hard but not smart enough\n\nYet, here comes the big \u201cBUT.\u201d I worked hard all right, but did I work smart?\n\nSay, I had a press release to translate. And at the same time, I had to work on participating in an upcoming translation conference. And I would always choose to translate the press release, even though I could delegate it to a colleague. As a result, I was missing out on opportunities for marketing and growing my business that the conference presented.\n\nA life coach Pam Blanchard said:\n\n*\u201cWorking hard has little importance unless there\u2019s value in the work that you\u2019re doing. Anything we do hard in our life should fuel us, not deplete us.\u201d*\n\n## Realization 2: \u201cGet rich quick\u201d mindset\n\nStill, there is a second big \u201cBUT\u201d on top of the first one.\n\nYes, I should\u2019ve worked smarter. BUT it doesn\u2019t mean that I should\u2019ve not worked hard.\n\nPeople tend to misinterpret this principle. They believe smart work is more important than hard work. They see other people get rich quickly and it looks like a result of smart work alone. Like writing a hit song. But what they don\u2019t see is years of hard work that came before writing that one song.\n\n## How to work smart, not just hard\n\nHoping to succeed by working smart and avoiding hard work is a bad idea. It devalues hard work.\n\nBut working hard without thinking is just as bad.\n\nSee, they are both important. And we need to hit the sweet spot. To do so, we can discuss our strategy with a devil\u2019s advocate\u2014as a sanity check: a parent, a friend, a mentor, a coach, an accountability partner, etc.\n\nIn my example, they would\u2019ve told me to invest hard work into growing the business. That\u2019s how I could\u2019ve gone from 8 points to 10 points on the happiness scale.\n\n## Actionable tips\n\nMy first tip is to work smart, not just hard: have the right strategy for your business.\n\nSecond, make regular appointments with a mentor to review your strategy.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR;** : My workaholism taught me two lessons about how to work smart, not hard.

I will be exploring my mindset and subconscious and conscious thought patterns, as well as some things I\u2019ve studied and practiced to become better.\n\nI\u2019d also like to say, I\u2019m not spewing from an angle where I\u2019ve always been great, loved myself etc. I have multiple suicide attempts to my name, and was a very anxious depressed person who was violently bullied daily through almost all my years of school. This being said, I am now in a place where my therapist can confirm that I am now a healthy person, with healthy boundaries, and that I have achieved a state of being that people my age nearly never come to on their own. So I believe I can help you guys, and I hope you get something from this.\n\nWith that out of the way, I will now give you a story:\n\nOne day, I was blessed with the opportunity to partake in a psychology 12 course, while in grade 10. There are no words, for how simplistic and important that course was in developing my personality and skills. I urge everyone to have a crack at it. Either way, the course was like a launch pad, which propelled me into studying for 5+ years to this day, of peer reviewed studies on: Child development, Social psychology, Critical thinking, Healthy boundaries, Psychological defence tactics to deal with bullying and bullies and Personality repair through healing thought. I\u2019ve also studied concrete, useful psychology such as body language and tone of voice.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to describe how easy and useful this knowledge is, and it\u2019s at your local library folks!\n\nIn that same year, I got into a gym for Mixed Martial Arts. While only 15, 5\u2019 8\u201d and 130 lbs, it was a skill set that taught me how powerful the human body can truly be, with the technique required to use it effectively. For reference, I started boxing at 15, got into Jiu Jitsu at 17, and have been training in Muay Thai and Jiu Jitsu to this day. Along with this has been shin and knuckle conditioning. I personally use a dumbbell with 5 lbs and roll it up and down the shin with some hemp massage oil. It works great and is only unbearable for the first week or so. Anyways, I urge everyone to try this. A lot of people don\u2019t know, but it is not only sparring with others who want to hurt you. MMA is a lesson in discipline, and the people in those gyms are the most humble and nice human beings you could find, who only want to train you in technique. If you decide to do it, make sure you receive a brochure and know what class you are doing that day. I recommend kick boxing as a starting point, and evolve into Muay Thai if you can.\n\nAlso around the same time, I enrolled in a police bootcamp that was offered by my highschool. It was amazing! The people were great, the teamwork was a lesson in itself, probably the most exciting thing I\u2019ve ever done. It was also difficult, and a good mental trainer. I must add that I was youngest in this class, being 15 where everyone else was 17+. That in itself was a good lesson in maturity, and how to have mutual respect in a situation where people perceive you as lesser innately.\n\nNext in line: I graduated from high school at 16 in gr. 11. I skipped a grade earlier, and had extra credits at this point. So, I applied for the Army. For as long as I can remember, I always dreamed of having a job where I was highly trained, and could help people in third world countries. At 17, my application was processed and one thing after the next yada yada, here I am in bootcamp. Now, here\u2019s a twist; I left. After 2 weeks of bootcamp I left the military, and never looked back. I have my own reasons for leaving, and am not ashamed that I did so. In fact, I am quite proud that, instead of following peer pressure, I had the guts to form my own opinion on the matter, and did it only for myself. There were, and are people who dislike me by default for having left. To you I say, that\u2019s okay. Because you don\u2019t know what goes into it. And if you are a vet who says the same, well, just know your service is good enough for you, and I don\u2019t need that, so congratulations for making it! It takes heart.\n\nThen, I fell in love. The first girlfriend I had was at 19, and, for the first while it was an amazing relationship. Eventually, the butterflies wore off, and her insecurity of \u201cbeing out of my league\u201d began to reveal itself. I tried to help her and reinforce that she was in fact good enough. I tried to communicate, and none of it got through. At one point in time, I ended up catching her in the lie that she had gone to a guy\u2019s house, and didn\u2019t say anything. That was hard to take, and I was trapped with her by region, so it happened for 2 more abusive months. When I left the area, I broke up with her over text. The relationship lasted 6 months at this point. I ended it very well, told her we simply weren\u2019t compatible, things of that nature. She became very upset, told me how much of an asshole I was for breaking up with her, that I didn\u2019t have the balls to break up with her earlier, etc. This is all well and good, the breakup happened 1 month ago, and I am quite happy being single again!\n\nAs you may have guessed by that statement, I am currently 20 years old. It was shortly after the breakup that I discovered true wisdom and happiness through Taoism:\n\n\n*HOW TO BE HAPPY:*\n\n\nIn my time studying I\u2019ve learned 3 concrete things that apply to everyone and can change your life at their realization:\n\n*1. )* 90% of the general population believes subconsciously that, they are not good enough. That means, that out of 10 of your friends 1 of them believes they are good enough as a person. The rest, either fake the confidence or put on a face of positive attitude, that suddenly disappears when they get to their porch.\n\n*2. )* There is no such thing as a \u201cvictim of the past\u201d. I have uncomplicated PTSD from my childhood and I can say honestly, it\u2019s a choice to focus on, and identify with that. Right now, my life is great! I workout, eat healthy, work a job I am content with, am single, practice guitar, etc. I do all these things without social media or people to validate what I do, because I know for a fact that my life is awesome, even if it\u2019s no one else who sees it! As for the past? What past. The only place it exists, right now, is YOUR HEAD. The past, does not, exist. It is only through identifying as a victim, and believing anybody sympathizes with you as much or more than you do, that causes you to believe you\u2019ve \u201chad it bad\u201d. You take pleasure in thinking negatively, you take pleasure in being a victim. You aren\u2019t! It is your job as a human being, to function for yourself, as an individual. It is not for everyone else to help you, nor for your unrealistic attempts at seeking that. To speak truth, it\u2019s most akin to a crying baby, in its crib, waiting for its mother. The thing is, you still have that brain because you seek others\u2019 validation because your parent never gave it to you. Now, it\u2019s time to parent yourself! Give yourself the love you need to become an adult, and do not victimize yourself, out of self hatred or pity.\n\n*3. )* This is most important. You ARE good enough. That\u2019s something you just have to come to terms with. It\u2019s OKAY to get out of the rut for yourself. It\u2019s alright, to tell yourself that you are awesome! You don\u2019t have to feel guilty for feeling like a good person, and ultimately you don\u2019t have to do it for anybody except for you! It doesn\u2019t matter who is around you, it doesn\u2019t matter where you live. YOU can be the stone that the clouded water moves around and I know you can because I did it! YOU CAN DO IT GUYS!\n\nNow, I want to tell you the mindset of being good enough, that you may do the same.\n\nWhen you approach that stranger at the bar, and she rejects you, what do you think? Do you become a victim again, want sympathy, believe it\u2019s because you look awful or are an awful person? No. It\u2019s because a stranger at the bar didn\u2019t want to dance. That\u2019s the face value. If you dive any deeper AT ALL than that into the situation, then you are only giving reasons as to why you suck, in your own head. Isn\u2019t that insane? You\u2019re basing your self worth, on someone you don\u2019t know, who has never met you or done the things you do in a day, and believe it\u2019s because you aren\u2019t good enough for them.\n\nWell, hallelujah brother, I\u2019m here to tell you, it\u2019s because there are 7B people on earth and they are one person out of that number. The fact that they rejected you is ONLY proof that they are not the right one. THAT\u2019S IT. When you keep on looking, and happily do so, because you know you\u2019re worth looking for too? You will find the right one.\n\nUltimately this is to say one thing. You, are good enough, to love yourself. \u201cI am good enough to love myself. I am allowed to love myself for who I am. Whether or not others believe that as well has no affect on me, because I still know it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how you be happy. It\u2019s very simple. Escape the loop of negative thought. BELIEVE you deserve it. Just do, because you can, and you DO deserve it.\n\nSo, that\u2019s my piece. If this helped you, that\u2019s awesome! If it didn\u2019t, just know it will happen in time, whether you force it to or not, you will realize it eventually. Just know, if you\u2019re reading this, you are allowed, to love yourself! You deserve, to feel loved! It doesn\u2019t matter if someone else gives you that love, because ultimately you have the potential to love them, so you have proof that love is already within you! I love all of you, no matter where you\u2019re at, what situation you\u2019re in, please have a great day, and I wish you all the luck in the world.",

            "content": "hi , I\u2019m 18 M , about to be 19 in March and well.. like the title says it all I just want to grow up already mentally /: most of my teen years is when my downfall started , I spent too much time on my phone , slacked off , didn\u2019t care much about what was to become of me and it all brought me here. Affecting my school grades ever since I was in 6th grade , it started to show then. I didn\u2019t graduate all due to me mostly being on my phone , having a bad attitude , and emotional issues ( girlfriends ) I didn\u2019t even go to school 90% of the year on my senior year. It was so bad , I regret a lot of things. I just wish I would understand. At this point I just want to be able to turn my life around , I remember when I was much younger maybe around 13 -15 i had been going to therapy because well I guess that\u2019s when my rebellious behavior started to show. I never truly listened or cared at the time , I was just a dumb kid.. but to this day I still remember that my therapist told me in specific that I was a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d and that \u201cI\u2019m not a man of my word\u201d and how If I basically didn\u2019t change then I would go on to live a terrible life. How right he was and how ignorant I was , so blinded by my ignorance. My main problems are that... I\u2019m immature , I don\u2019t trust myself when I say I\u2019m going to do something, oversleeping , lack of consistency, I tend to stay too much in my comfort zone , and I have a lack of life experience. I live with my mom and she just moved in to a new home , tbh I feel babied by her.. she treats me way too good for what I\u2019ve become and for my current situation, I feel embarrassed and unworthy to be treated so well. I can\u2019t do this anymore , I just wanna be able to help my parents and provide for myself. I\u2019ve been trying to apply for jobs online but they haven\u2019t replied and it\u2019s been more than 2 weeks. I\u2019ve been thinking about asking my uncle to give me a second chance to work with him because last time I let him down due to me only lasting 3 days all because I\u2019m lazy and don\u2019t want to get up in the morning. I just wanna change that but once I\u2019m put in certain situation where I have the opportunity to do so I hardly ever take it... why must I be so stubborn? Perhaps I didn\u2019t deserve this lifestyle to be cared for by 2 loving parents that gave me everything I ever needed. Perhaps I needed to suffer like they did to get where they are today. I just don\u2019t want to become a good for nothing , a failure. I\u2019ve wanted to change for months now but I never really truly commit. Lately I\u2019ve not been feeling happy and haven\u2019t been feeling sad either , I just feel soulless. I don\u2019t even respond to my mom most of the time because I just feel so unmotivated, I rarely even ever touch my Xbox anymore which I do game quite a lot. The first thing I want to do is just get a job and maintaining that job without getting fired. My last job went well , never got fired.it was a seasonal job tho , my boss was really nice and I appreciate her a ton for that I spent 2 months working there waking up every morning at 6am. At least I had some rhythm going , at this point first thing I wanna do is get a job. I need to gain some traction at least , I have many interests. I try to work out a few times a week which I do. I\u2019ve been going to adult school on the path to graduate though I\u2019m really behind. I just wanna be able to make major change now , before i find myself here again when I\u2019m 21 crying for help /:",

I am way too hung up on this, I feel like even if a woman did walk into my life, I\u2019d sabotage the relationship, just from being too worried about and focused on losing my virginity, and it\u2019d be a real shame to lose a quality relationship just because I felt I had to lose it ASAP.\n\nI have people telling me that I SHOULD be perfectly content with being a foreveralone virgin, and people who say \u201cI think you\u2019ll find someone, even while you\u2019re still in your 20s\u201d. My mind latches onto everything and it becomes reality in my head. I mean, there ARE guys who reach their 30s, 40s, even 50s or later who are still kissless virgins!\n\nNo offense to anyone, but I can\u2019t bear going through that! That\u2019s too many miserable years ahead of me to go through (I\u2019d rather be able to take advantage of my age and get the life I want, but I\u2019m scared it won\u2019t work even if I really out in the effort, or scared that I\u2019m too depressed and hopeless to put the required effort in.).\n\nI can\u2019t bear having so many more years to go through lonely and celibate (or just paid sex, still depressing, possibly even more than no sex at all) I just want to die right now sometimes.

I\u2019m into women (obviously) but no desire to be a dominant partner. I really want a MDLB relationship dynamic (not necessarily playing roles 24/7 though, but I just that affection and to be nurtured, and to be sexually dominated by her, edged, teased, denied, tied up, sometimes ruined (ruined orgasm), maybe even experiment with chastity cages. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still want normal PIV sex, raw, bare skin to skin, but with her on top, still being the dominant partner. I may be interested in occasional \u201cswitching\u201d though, I probably wouldn\u2019t be into domming HER, but me getting on top and giving her a good fucking, I\u2019d be more than happy to do that sometimes.\n\nI need a kinky woman, maybe even kinkier and weirder than I am.\n\nAs you can see, \u201ctraditional\u201d gender roles (dominant man/submissive woman) do not appeal to me, and I\u2019m a soft boy.\n\nI also don\u2019t want kids, I can\u2019t risk passing down my misfortune, to someone who can\u2019t even consent to being conceived and born!\n\nI know women like this exist, even in my age group, but my own mental state is still in my way, insecurity, depression, hopelessness, anger, stress, overwhelm (maybe a happy ending massage from a pretty Asian woman would be good for me), and feeling the future is set, out of my control.\n\nWhy am I worried about this? Because I could never get a girlfriend in high/grade school. Tons of girls called me \u201cugly as fuck\u201d in school, and even more say the same thing online.\n\nBasically, I feel like attempting self improvement is futile.\n\nExperiencing sex and love is the one thing I REALLY desire in life. But I\u2019m also pretty interested in trying psychedelics (those are said to change your mental state/reality for the better, even from just one trip). Besides, reality is painful, taking a trip out of my own head would be good, right? It\u2019s pretty bad in my head.\n\nI\u2019ve read about some guys like me, who found their woman and enjoyed love and sex, some even older than me when they found it, so it can\u2019t be literally impossible.\n\nI was also thinking about trying to visit a psychic, to try out getting my future read/seen.\n\nThis is not the first time I\u2019ve thought of this, one time when I was almost homeless (too long of a story to tell on here) I just so happened to walk by a building that was a psychic\u2019s business! I was desperate af in that situation, the only thing that stopped me from going was that I was too broke. \n\nI may sound crazy, but becoming content with spending your entire life alone and celibate sounds crazy to me.\n\nI just started community college, and get work done later than I should, because this shit consumes my mind, and end up either posting or reading about this shit, or just sitting on my bed trying to imagine how it might possibly work out.? I don\u2019t want to flunk out.\n\nSo basically, the fear of not truly living is preventing me from living.\n\nI don\u2019t want to become content with being a foreveralone virgin, I want to live the life that I want to live.",

I have been living in hostels and student accommodations since I was 14. I have always lived with roommates (like actual roommates, at least 3 guys living in the same room), so when I moved to Melbourne an had to live alone in a room for the first time. I lived in a pretty social building, but I felt very out of place so I did not socialize. I ended up isolating myself from everyone and developed a very weird sort of social anxiety and a sort of aimlessness that sucked. So I spent all my free time playing video games, eating junk food and watching TV series. I couldn't find a job during my semester break which added to the feeling of worthlessness.\n\nThis changed around 2 weeks ago. I shifted to an apartment with one of my (very few) friends. Now I live with a Mexican guy (my friend) and a Finnish girl (she's nice but indifferent). I also decided to become more physically active and start studying again. I have tons of free time so I walk around 20 kilometres daily. I used my energy to explore the city. I have started to study web design and about the stock market (I find it oddly fascinating). I also deleted all the games in my system to prevent relapse.\n\nI feel more energetic and overall confident. I actually asked a girl out this week. She turned out to be engaged but I just felt so good that I could do it. It was the first time I have asked out a stranger. I have also lost weight. Overall I feel really good and happy with myself.\n\nIt is hard to gather the motivation to walk that much every day, but having some tangible results helps a lot.

My mind latches onto everything and it becomes reality in my head. I mean, there ARE guys who reach their 30s, 40s, even 50s or later who are still kissless virgins!\n\nNo offense to anyone, but I can\u2019t bear going through that! That\u2019s too many miserable years ahead of me to go through (I\u2019d rather be able to take advantage of my age and get the life I want, but I\u2019m scared it won\u2019t work even if I really out in the effort, or scared that I\u2019m too depressed and hopeless to put the required effort in.).\n\nI can\u2019t bear having so many more years to go through lonely and celibate (or just paid sex, still depressing, possibly even more than no sex at all) I just want to die right now sometimes. My mood is very fragile and easily swung, and either side hits HARD (positive or negative).\n\nI\u2019m not a traditional masculine man (if it\u2019s not already obvious). I\u2019m into women (obviously) but no desire to be a dominant partner. I really want a MDLB relationship dynamic (not necessarily playing roles 24/7 though, but I just that affection and to be nurtured, and to be sexually dominated by her, edged, teased, denied, tied up, sometimes ruined (ruined orgasm), maybe even experiment with chastity cages. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still want normal PIV sex, raw, bare skin to skin, but with her on top, still being the dominant partner. I may be interested in occasional \u201cswitching\u201d though, I probably wouldn\u2019t be into domming HER, but me getting on top and giving her a good fucking, I\u2019d be more than happy to do that sometimes.\n\nI need a kinky woman, maybe even kinkier and weirder than I am.\n\nAs you can see, \u201ctraditional\u201d gender roles (dominant man/submissive woman) do not appeal to me, and I\u2019m a soft boy.\n\nI also don\u2019t want kids, I can\u2019t risk passing down my misfortune, to someone who can\u2019t even consent to being conceived and born!\n\nI know women like this exist, even in my age group, but my own mental state is still in my way, insecurity, depression, hopelessness, anger, stress, overwhelm (maybe a happy ending massage from a pretty Asian woman would be good for me), and feeling the future is set, out of my control.\n\nWhy am I worried about this? Because I could never get a girlfriend in high/grade school. Tons of girls called me \u201cugly as fuck\u201d in school, and even more say the same thing online.\n\nBasically, I feel like attempting self improvement is futile.\n\nExperiencing sex and love is the one thing I REALLY desire in life. But I\u2019m also pretty interested in trying psychedelics (those are said to change your mental state/reality for the better, even from just one trip). Besides, reality is painful, taking a trip out of my own head would be good, right? It\u2019s pretty bad in my head.\n\nI\u2019ve read about some guys like me, who found their woman and enjoyed love and sex, some even older than me when they found it, so it can\u2019t be literally impossible.\n\nI was also thinking about trying to visit a psychic, to try out getting my future read/seen.\n\nThis is not the first time I\u2019ve thought of this, one time when I was almost homeless (too long of a story to tell on here) I just so happened to walk by a building that was a psychic\u2019s business! I was desperate af in that situation, the only thing that stopped me from going was that I was too broke. \n\nI may sound crazy, but becoming content with spending your entire life alone and celibate sounds crazy to me.\n\nI just started community college, and get work done later than I should, because this shit consumes my mind, and end up either posting or reading about this shit, or just sitting on my bed trying to imagine how it might possibly work out.? I don\u2019t want to flunk out.\n\nSo basically, the fear of not truly living is preventing me from living.\n\nI don\u2019t want to become content with being a foreveralone virgin, I want to live the life that I want to live.",

            "content": "I\u2019m an 18 year old male who is still a senior in high school. I got held back a year due to poor social skills in preschool. I have aspergers and ADHD. As a young kid, I was better. I wasn\u2019t the very good socially, but I felt like myself. I ended up getting speech therapy at school so I would at least talk. Then when I was like 8, my mom took me to some treatment place in town. For a short time, I was on focalin before being taken off. Then I was also put on all these \u201csupplements\u201d (described to me as probiotics) for my aspergers which is mostly pseudoscience but I didn\u2019t know then along with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. During all that though also, my mom was trying to stop my stimming behaviors. If you don\u2019t know, stimming is basically a thing many autistic people do to release energy. My stimming I think then wasn\u2019t actually that bad though and not harmful. I don\u2019t think I even did it as often as many autistic people. Somewhere around the time this was happening though, I may\u2019ve been 9 by this point. I ended up developing more anger and began to have outbursts nearly every day. Anytime I would do something wrong even in school, it would turn to anger because I felt stupid. This behavior continued for years after leaving all the treatments behind. My mom just still seemed to strive for me to be perfect somehow. She will deny that it is her goal, but I often get that feeling. These days, I rarely have the outbursts anymore, but they have developed into something not any better. I now really struggle to love myself and I feel horrible deep down nearly all the time. I often feel very unloved and it makes me very sad. Also, something put a mindset in me that I have to please everyone. This makes me uncomfortable to try any new things I actually want to try because I\u2019m worried I will disappoint someone. This has caused me to feel like I\u2019m not myself at all. I really want to help myself, but I don\u2019t really know what to do. I go to counseling but haven\u2019t felt much positive from it at least yet. Is there anything I can do?",

My brain and nervous system is overstimulated and every stimulating activity (as contact with other people) can make it even worse, so my system is just overloaded.\n\nI'm 25M and have this feelings since i remember. Most of the time i felt a little stressed and felt tight even when i had no reason for that. Sometimes my brain was \"overheating\" because of hours of overthinking about things that didnt even had a matter. In public i always react on almost every move and sound i get and in work at open space im following with my eyes almost every person i see pass in.

            "title": "Escaping video game addiction and how it changed my life...",
            "content": "Hello people\n\nI'd like to share my story as i believe it might be a little different from most, at least the way things have turned out in such a short amount of time - it's still a little surprising even to me. Maybe this post can inspire some of you as it is not only about getting rid of gaming addiction, but a full blown self-improvement journey.\n\nI'm going to skip the usual talk about how i spent more than 30 thousand hours in games by the time i was 19. Instead, i'm going to describe how i managed to do something about the poor state i got myself into. How i went from a school dropout with zero social skills and health problems to someone way ahead of his peers, to being someone who can say this with confidence. While i haven't managed to fix everything, i view the last 2 years as a huge accomplishment, much bigger than i could've imagined.\n\nWhat originally kickstarted this journey was a multitude of factors:\n\n**The ever-increasing amount of regrets.** I have become estranged from my family. I neglected any and all family meetings. There are relatives that wouldn't recognize me, i shit you not.\n\n**The subconsious feeling of unfullfilled potential.** I used to play guitar and do athletics. I went from a straight-A student to a dropout - got myself expelled from school, twice.\n\n**The desire to fight off social anxiety i developed.** This was the biggest one. It got to the point i'd have panic attacks just from entering a room with more than 3 people. I closed myself off and lost most of my friends. I would never stand up for myself and was bullied because of that. I wasn't a fully functioning person at this point.\n\nI was so sick of my life, but then, instead of the most obvious and usual approach - falling into depression and making everything tenfold worse - my brain did the opposite and turned all of the above into a spike of motivation. I'd bet psychology has a term for this.\n\nInstead of using this newfound energy to minmax the next game, i decided to take action. Dreams and goals followed, giving me hope, which in turn motivated me even further. See where i'm getting at? This was my wake-up call. Every step, no matter how small, meant more energy, allowing me to keep going and essentially creating a chain reaction. This works the same way in reverse. Every problem is almost guaranteed to create even more problems and oh boy, did i have problems. My solution was to take it step by step, one at a time.\n\nTo me it was obvious that to get rid of one addiction, i had to get rid of another first. It wasn't the occasional cigarette that every teen out there would tell you. I used to smoke close to a pack a day for around 5 years. I started when i was 13-14, let that sink in. I'd smoke at home, during school, while waiting for the bus to arrive... i'd buy cigarettes instead of food. I often compare gaming addiction to nicotine dependency as it's similiar in many ways. You go through phases - from being able to remain abstinent indefinitely to a very powerful urge that is nearly impossible to ignore. It also made me realize there are easy attempts with higher chances to relapse later on and hard attempts that you're much more likely to fail, however, if you manage to pull through you'll think twice about relapsing. Same goes for gaming addiction and while quitting smoking took a little more than willpower, dedication and way longer, to quit gaming i had to change completely. **The point here is to never ever give up, no matter what addiction.** Even if you relapse, don't feel bad, try again.\n\nI quit gaming cold turkey, no excuses, no bullshit. I deleted all of my games, saves and whatever spreadsheets, screenshots and videos i had saved, erased my Steam account, uninstalled Battlenet, unsubscribed from all youtube channels related to video games and eventually gave away my computer and bought a laptop instead. This probably sounds like an overkill, but in my case it was neccessary.\n\nThen i proceeded to follow a strict 30-day challenge. This included cold showers every day, waking up at 5am, no pornography, regular exercise, no junk food and more. Looking back at that now seems a little funny, but i managed to adopt some healthy habits along the way that i follow to this day. You'd be surprised how big of an impact things like cooking for yourself and exercising have on your well-being, both mental and physical. Combining all of these smaller things together equals to a happy human. I also documented absolutely everything that happened and reviewed my notes at the end of every week for the first few months, i suggest everyone to do this.\n\nReading books also played a part and helped me immensely. Books by Dale Carnegie, Charlie Houpert and Timothy A. Pychyl are a must read and if you've already read those books, read them again. DM me for full list.\n\nI also needed to figure out a way to fill the void, i suddenly had so much free time. I aimed to fill the emptiness by trying out all the popular self-improvement ideas you can find on reddit and all over the internet, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (or CBT), Xeffect and trying out various activities in hopes of finding a hobby having the biggest impact. I knew i succeeded when the craving to play any games was gone, when a re-release of a game i used to play 16 hours a day meant very little to me and when i realized i'm no longer hyped for any future releases. Real life became way more interesting.\n\nThis is the result and despite some points being rather controversial and involving luck, i am very proud of it all. Things i'd immediately dismiss as impossible not that long ago are now a reality.\n\n* The hardest thing and my greatest achievement was learning to control my social anxiety as i did it on my own with no help other than the internet. Believing it was something i developed and unrelated to genetic inheritance, i managed to reduce it to the point it no longer affects my daily life. It's still there, just not causing any trouble most of the time.\n* I applied to a college that i totally expected to reject me - they did not.\n* The weird introverted person changed into a chatty and lively dude, even if it's a little forced at times. Main thanks goes to books for this one.\n* I got a vasectomy at the youngest age my country legally allows. One of the most important decisions i made.\n* I have a simple, yet solid plan for the next few years and I'm eventually moving abroad.\n* No more migraines and no need to take any medications. I don't remember the last time i had a cold.\n\nHuge props to my parents for never giving up on me.\n\nEdit: Getting a vasectomy at such a young age (21) is an achievement in itself. I had absolutely zero support, i literally had to convince the doctor to approve me and everyone i know tried to talk me out if it the moment they realized i'm serious. Understandable, because few will ever agree with this decision. There is no place for kids in my life, ever, and i do need need to justify this to anyone. There is a chance, no matter how small, that sometime in the future i change my mind about all this. This vasectomy serves as a failsafe and i wouldn't feel complete without it. The surgery becomes near irreversible after some years and that is the main reason i got it done so early.",

I feel like I just project too many outcomes in my head before they happen.\n\nFor example, last night me and two buddies were supposed to have a meeting at 9 at our regular meet up which is the studio to follow through on some work that had to be done on our upcoming clothing line. \n\nSo we meet there. The energy was off. All 3 of us had low energy, not much to talk about. Hadn\u2019t caught up on much.\n\nAnyways, this is where it gets frustrating. Only 2 of us drive, I drive a sedan & the other driver has a coupe. Naturally, when something needs to get picked up or a errand needs to be ran, it\u2019s on me. It\u2019s happened EVERY single night. Errands fall on me, picking people up falls on me, dropping people off. It\u2019s just bullshit and I blame myself for being so readily available and agreeable. I\u2019d like to note we all go together, but IM always driving. Last night, we got no work done. Instead a few artists came by for studio time. I was not apologized or acknowledged for my time spent. Again, this is all my fault for not being upfront and outspoken. Usually when I am, I come off the wrong way. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, I don\u2019t take the responsibility to change myself to be assertive. Shits hard.

I am hoping the situation is that OP has known and just got confirmation at his/her/their most recent appointment? Who knows? It was good advice nonetheless.\n\nAnyway, a commenter mentioned OP didn't talk about meds or therapy or anything. If you want to talk about those things, I'm your gal. \n\nI've been through a lot, guys. Holy shit I've been through a lot. 6 years of undiagnosed narcolepsy, addiction, two degrees, 3 careers, self loathing, realizing I grew up in a narcissistic family...  I have processed and healed so much this past year. I started my emotional healing in the fall and have learned it's all about radical self acceptance. That shit changed my life. \n\nI thought I had a pretty regular family before all this. Um, no.  I was 33  when I realized that my mom's father is a narcissist and has fucked up the entire family. The reason I didn't realize this much sooner is quite a long story.  The main message is **before you decide you have depression or anxiety, make sure the cause isn't just shitty, toxic people that either raised you, were in your life, or are still in your life. They told you a lot of lies and made you believe a lot of things that are not your truth. You get to decide your truth.**\n\nI cannot discount the narcolepsy medication that gave me my physical energy back or the antidepressants I still take. I couldn't have done it without those. But the self care, therapy, and mental/emotional processing/work made me whole. \n\nI have a story of hope and resilience. I can't count the number of times I wanted go to sleep and never wake up or the number of times I thought about actively taking my own life. Now I look forward to each new day and what it will bring for me. I have a renewed sense of purpose and find joy in hobbies that I haven't cared about for 7 years. I truly love myself, unconditionally and completely. This has allowed me to love my life, wake up with a (mostly) positive mind, and be present and grateful. I didn't think I would ever get here, but I did. And you can, too. Xoxo\n\nEdit- formatting and wording",

I'm busy with school and work, but I am checking my phone a million times a day waiting to see if he's messaged me and I'm constantly distracted waiting for him to reply. Also he takes days to reply, which is fair (I do too, and have not been very timely with my responses with other people I've matched with in the past). I don't feel as sharp and focused as I'd like to and I don't want this to affect my academic and professional performance, but I'm worried it will because I have been spending significantly less time studying the past few days. I am very ashamed about this.\n\nDoes this happen to other people too?? Or am I just obsessing because this is the first time I've ever felt like this is someone I could actually date?

            "content": "So I want to start by saying I'm a decently productive person. I work two jobs for a total of 45-50 hours per week. I have a lot of pets that require daily care and attention. I have hobbies such as hiking, reading, taking care of my pets, and riding horses. I have enough of a social life (I'm an introvert but enjoy hanging out with a few people one on one when I have time). I am going to grad school for a PhD in the fall. So my problem isn't really functional productivity in my career or anything, it's kind of personal productivity during my down time.\n\nThe problem is that I'm stuck in this weird cycle. On days off, I end up doing nothing. And while I'm doing nothing, I'm anxious because it doesn't feel good to do nothing. By nothing I mean I randomly browse the internet or watch TV or something. Today I had a list of things I wanted to do and I only did one of them. Every time I try to do something I enjoy but that requires effort, I just feel too tired/lazy to do it. I just feel tired and go back to my computer and say I'll do that other thing a bit later. Even if I do push myself out the door to say, ride my horse, I don't really feel like I'm enjoying it because it takes effort and time. And I come back inside feeling unsatisfied and go back to doing nothing. Or I'll go hiking and just feel stressed out the whole time.\n\nI really don't know why. I've thought maybe I'm just not getting enough sleep. But seems like no matter how hard I try I can't manage to get more than 7 hours of sleep a night because there is a lot to do. I have gotten more sleep some nights but it doesn't really seem to help. I'm tired anyways. I can't drink coffee because the caffeine makes me have anxiety attacks and feel horrible physically. Maybe I'm burnt out? But even if I am, there isn't much to be done about it. Every hour I work is necessary, and pets require what they require. There isn't really anything I can cut out.\n\nToday was a day off for me and the only thing I got done was I walked my dogs. The rest of the time I spent milling about my house or sitting on my computer. Because every time I tried to actually do something, I just didn't feel like it.\n\nThis is not how I want my days off to look. I would like to be doing my hobbies and getting exercise and spending time outside. Can anyone help me locate the problem, or do you have tips on how I can stop wasting my time? And since it comes up a lot on Reddit, I do not have depression. I'm thrilled to be alive and very happy. I just can't seem to defeat this laziness I feel on my days off. I want my life to be more enriched with worthwhile activities in my free time.",

            "content": "A good friend of mine died due to complications in her gastric bypass surgery. She was surrounded by people who loved her but when her weight and health spiraled out of control, they gave her what she wanted instead of what she needed.\n\nEnabling others to make bad decisions is not love, it\u2019s holding someone back because you\u2019re afraid of an uncomfortable conversation. \n\nLoving someone means being honest when they are making bad decisions. There\u2019s a time for emotional support and there\u2019s time for holding people accountable to their potential. I want to be a better friend to people in my life who are struggling. It\u2019s not my job to fix things for them, but I can\u2019t accept my friends hurting alone or dying because no one was there to give them sympathetic accountability.\n\nI wrote the letter below to my friend Emma after she died as a way to help me process emotions, maybe it can resonate with someone to reach out and offer loving but firm guidance to someone getting too close to thin ice.\n\n\\------------\n\nDear Emma,\n\nSo much has happened so quickly. 24 hours ago the last thing I had heard about you was that you had graduated and were excited for the next chapter in your life. Then I got a phone call and was rushing to the hospital, where I spent a long night of trying to comfort your sister as we watched your body losing its grip on life.\n\nThat was a very jarring sight. I had never really seen someone in an ICU with such critical health conditions. Massive swelling, respirator tubing, dialysis machines pumping blood, IV\u2019s and vacuums for the fluids and blood accumulating in your surgery cavity which refused to heal and stop bleeding.\n\nIt is chilling to me to think about how so much was taken from you in so short a timespan. On one day you were going to watch Star Wars show with your fiance and a few days later your family is having conversations about whether or not to pull the plug on the machines keeping you alive. That\u2019s how fragile life is. That\u2019s how thin the ice is that we\u2019re all standing on. The human body is incredible and it can survive and accomplish terrific things but there are some patches of ice so incredibly, unforgivingly, uncaringly thin.\n\nYou were so full of life, Emma. No one can argue that. Someone might say that you got caught up in the little things or you were shallow or impulsive. They could say your ego got the better of you, or that your goals were far too image based. But you were alive. You felt things and you built relationships with people and you loved people. You savored much of life and treasured pets and activities that meant a lot to you. \n\nYou lived your life consistently with your values. They were different values from mine, and sometimes that confused me. Sometimes I judged you. Many times decisions you made out of fear or insecurity made me resent you, but truthfully I don\u2019t know the many experiences you had that created the mind and spirit in that short 5 foot frame. I have to respect how you operated within the paradigms that you understood, and in many ways fought very hard for the things that were the most important to you.\n\nI\u2019m paralyzed by the thought of the time you had taken from you. You just turned 24 a month ago. You should have so much more time. You should have had the opportunity to learn from your mistakes. You should have had life experiences and met people and seen places and had a chance to become everything you could.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t guess at the life and experience that made you who you were when I knew you, I do know that there was a life full of experiences that you should have gotten to live. There were ten thousand lessons that you should have had the chance to grow through. The last page in your book shouldn\u2019t have been what you learned in 5 minutes of an 8 hour class.\n\nI truly believe that we can only grow into our full potential through experience. It\u2019s the relationships with other people, the setbacks, the lessons learned the hard way, these are the things that truly build us into our best selves. These are the classes in the school of life that turn you into the real you.\n\nAnd by the indiscriminate dice roll of fate your class was cut short. There were decisions you could have made differently in regards to your health, but still I can\u2019t accept that any of this is fair. I can\u2019t accept that whatever shortcomings you had made you deserve this. That\u2019s bullshit. You were not a bad person and you did not hurt other people. You cared about others and you brought joy into the world and you had so much promise. I believe that you could have become so much and turned your potential into incredible accomplishments and connections and experiences. I believe that the Emma I knew is only a fraction of the Emma that you could become. I believe that the world deserved more of you than you got to share.\n\nHow did you get so close to that thin ice, Emma? How did your situation get such that you weren\u2019t able to prioritize your health? What fears or pressures or stresses tore you apart that you didn\u2019t see the risk you were putting yourself at? I am not blaming you but I really feel like there was a darkness you were hiding from which pushed you to escape with overeating.\n\nWhat hand needed to be held out to you? Who should have been there to help you? What encouraging words did you need to hear that would have saved you? What true love, what love for you so strong that it would push you back from food and hold you accountable to making good decisions was missing? What compassionate, understanding, but firm love would have made the difference? Please tell me what we could have done to save you. Please tell me what we did wrong.\n\nThis is not your fault, this is not our fault. But it\u2019s not fair, not by a long shot. And I believe in you so much that my greatest pain is that you didn\u2019t have the support around you to make decisions that would have saved your life. No one can do the right thing every time. The pain you felt would have shattered many many people, and it is not a sign of weakness that you succumbed to it and lost first your health and later your life. But it is a sign that people need to be stronger points of support for each other. \n\nNo one can stand completely alone. No one can weather all the storms of life without getting washed upon the rocks and if there\u2019s no one to pick us up and keep us afloat then everyone will sink. I wish I could have reached you. I wish I could have given you the words you needed to make a change. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you and I will never blame you for what happened. But the fact that you and I are both humans means that I want the best for you and I wish I could have healed the emotional pain that manifested into poor health and cost you decades of life.\n\nYou deserved better. You deserved love around you that helped you. You deserved inner strength taught to you by others that could help you help yourself. And you deserved the chance to live a full life and discover everything that the world had to offer. Pain isolated you and fear chased you and gluttony poisoned you and by that point the thin ice broke before you knew you were standing on it at all.\n\nI can\u2019t believe this. Life has so much to offer and the world is such a big place and there\u2019s so much out there. How is it possible that your story is over now? How is it possible that you only got to read the first page of a story that should have been volumes and volumes of adventures and experiences and emotions and accomplishments? I can\u2019t understand. I realize many lives are lost at even younger ages, but you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve really known closely as an adult that I\u2019ve lost like this.\n\nYou\u2019re the first person that I saw such a bright light in your future and then suddenly the light went out. What would you say right now if you could speak? Would you be firey and pissed off at life? Would you be composed and regal, claiming that this was as it should be and you were taking the high road? No, I know exactly what you would be doing. You would take the soothing, compassionate, understanding voice you always take and be comforting your family. I know they are your absolute world and the only thing you would see is their pain and suffering, and you would take care of them however you could.\n\nYou would hold them and tell them you were okay. You would remind them of the memories they have and how close you\u2019ll always be. You would give them every loving word and caring caress you could. You would assure them that everything would be okay and you would be watching them from above and you would always be there when they needed you. That is the Emma that I wish I got to know more while you were here. The loving, compassionate, caring, best Emma. The one not running out of fear or fighting out of insecurity. The one who only saw other human beings and reached out to love them however you could. It\u2019s selfish of me, but if for no other reason I wish you had more time so I could get to know the best Emma. The one that I didn\u2019t give enough of a chance. The one that cared so much about people and who had the biggest heart anyone could ask for. The one who would fearlessly fight for people you loved and felt so much emotion over loyalty that nothing could stop you.\n\nYou were more than the behaviors that your fears created. You were more than the angry words you said to protect yourself. You were capable of so much love and joy and I\u2019m devastated we couldn\u2019t rescue you from the feelings which brought this house of cards crashing down. The world needed more of you. We wanted so much more for you. You deserved so much more.\n\nI can\u2019t change what happened. I can\u2019t give you more time or trade mine for yours. I can\u2019t go back in time and try to give you the words and caring and compassion that maybe could have saved you. But I can do my best to be a better lifeguard for the people I meet who wander near the thin ice. I can seek to understand them and try to guide them. I can make sure they aren\u2019t alone when the darkness starts to close in. I can firmly insist on them being the best they can be, not because I know what that is, but because I know they deserve the life that their best can give them.\n\nThis life is too hard to handle on our own. There is too much pain and too many things we can\u2019t control. There is a river of suffering and broken dreams that will always push us back. But we aren\u2019t alone. There are so many of us going through very similar things. There are so many other people fighting the current of this river and we can reach out to hold onto each other. They aren\u2019t far away, but if we don\u2019t reach out then we\u2019ll get washed away one by one.\n\nI will do everything I can to make sure people know they aren\u2019t alone. So they know there is help out there and people they can lean on. I will fight to help them work through the fears and emotions and darkness that causes decisions and mistakes that cost us so much.\n\nEmma, it will take a long time before I can truly accept that you\u2019re gone. It will take grieving and leaning on others and time. Lots of time. But your tragedy is changing me in a way that is hard to describe. No one should have to go through what you did. No one should lose so much when they are surrounded by people who care for them so much. I can\u2019t bring you back, but I will fight for everyone I can the way I should have fought for you. I will give everything I can to prevent people from slipping away just because no one was there.\n\nWords can never capture the pain and agony so many will feel in a world without you. No words of melancholy or remorse or regret can feel the back breaking weight of your loss. All I can say is that you deserved so much more, and I\u2019m torn apart at the future that was taken from you. I will never forget you and I\u2019ll be fighting for others in your memory for the rest of my life.\n\nYou are gone now, but our love for you will never change, and it will never fade.\n\nIn your memory,\n\nMatthew",

They couldn\u2019t even go to the gym consistently. They had no real drive or goal.       \n \nThis is why I decided to make them my business partners by starting to give them perspective, some motivation and tasks where they slowly could get in touch with working together with me. Like some kind of mentor - a bad one who had no education on real leadership. I didn\u2019t care about making more money, I wanted them to be happy. \n\nBut then I started to have expectations and didn\u2019t understand how they couldn\u2019t understand simple things and that they took longer than I expected them. It drove me crazy. Something that took me a few days to learn took them weeks. I tried many different ways trying to find a field where they fit in.

They didn\u2019t feel that much pressure anymore and developed their own abilities, self-awareness and discovered their passions and skills. \n\nToday I am working with my friends who have their own goals and stand their ground. We work together and inspire others to do the same. \nThat\u2019s how having perspective and being contextual and empathic changed my life. I am applying it on everything and it helped me to improve my whole life in every area.",

I used a **tongue brush** and some **mouth wash** to remove that white coat of bacteria from my tongue and it REALLY helped:\n\n* Freshen my breath, and\n* It wasn't as difficult to swallow anymore.\n\nHOWEVER, the white plaque forms AGAIN after a few hours, so the tongue brush and mouth wash only helps me **temporarily**.\n\nI want to know:\n\n1. What's causing the white coat on my tongue?\n2. How do I remove the white coat, **permanently**?\n\nThese are the symptoms that I think that I have:\n\n* White coat with large red bumps on the back of my tongue\n* Feels like a lump is stuck in my throat\n   * SLIGHTLY difficult to swallow\n* I always feel like I have to gargle and cough that lump out\n   * But then it forms again after a few hours\n\nI think my bad breath is one of the main reasons why I don't have a girlfriend.

I NEED to fix this once and for all.\n\n\\---------------------------\n\n**UPDATE (Jan. 27, 2019; 7:29 PM CST):** I just did a **very DEEP cleaning with mouthwash** today. I gargled the mouthwash as FAR back as I could - to where I nearly swallowed the mouth wash...\n\nMy throat felt COMPLETELY SMOOTH and EMPTY and my breath doesn't smell like ANYTHING!\n\n**This is the BEST FEELING EVER!!!** *(sorry for the caps, this was a very exciting moment for me)*\n\nAnyways, it's been 10-20 minutes since I did the deep mouth wash and I don't feel the lump anymore!\n\nI'm still a bit skeptical though... I'll keep you all updated in a few hours / few days and see if it forms again. If so, then I may have to visit an oral doctor.\n\nThanks so much for all of the help, everyone!  \ud83d\ude04\n\n\\---------------------------\n\n**UPDATE (Jan. 28, 2019; 3:35 PM CST):** I still don't feel the lump anymore.

Most twentysomethings have the roommate experience for at least a few years and make lifelong friends from it\n* Haven't made any new friends. Again, your 20s is meant to be the most sociable decade of your life; mine were spent mostly in isolation due to social anxiety and depression issues.\n* I am not a part of any WhatsApp chat groups.

Most people turning 30 are entering the point at which they'll begin to hit well over $50k. \n* My job is incredibly lonely. Due to the aforementioned anxiety issues, I only held down an office job for 12 months during my entire 20s. The last 4 years have been spent working as a freelance writer/editor. \n* I've not taken up one new social hobby in my 20s. I've wanted to try Muay Thai, join a table tennis club, and play soccer.

But any fertile male can be a Dad; it's not exactly an achievement. \n\nI am worried won't ever find the right job for me that pays well, I am too old to start a martial art, finding friends in my 30s will be impossible due to fact that I am a Dad, I am still shy, and people in their 30s don't look for new friends because they already have friends. \n\nThis probably sounds horribly pessimistic but that's where my mind is at.

            "content": "Let me explain,\n\nI am a 24 year old male virgin who has never had a girlfriend. \n\nI was a social failure in grade school, as well as academically. Everybody made fun of me and bullied me (literally nearly everyone).\n\nI am now in community college (just started), taking it seriously after realizing just how hard life really is, you DO need further education than just a high school diploma (even if you went through with straight As in everything). Sure, there are high school dropouts who become millionaire and billionaire entrepreneurs, but they are THE EXCEPTION, not the rule, they are a VERY SMALL MINORITY. I do not have the gift of being naturally successful completely on my own like that, my depression and hopelessness makes doing so even less possible too.\n\nAside from having so many girls tell me how \u201cugly as fuck\u201d (actual words) I was in school, I\u2019ve more recently, had hundreds more online tell me so, and it doesn\u2019t just make me feel unworthy of sex and love, it makes me feel subhuman.\n\nI can\u2019t assimilate with the incel community, because my desire to NOT become that, and my desire to still experience dating, love, and sex, is too strong. \n\nIncels aren\u2019t supportive, they just want more guys to join their circle jerk of misery, it\u2019s an echo chamber. Even incelswithouthate (the \u201cwithouthate\u201d is just false advertising).\n\nEven the anti-incel subreddit, IncelTears is toxic, just from another angle.\n\nSomebody calling themselves \u201cA Bad Chad\u201d (the men that incels claim every woman wants) literally told me to become content with being single and celibate for the rest of my life. That\u2019s just another extreme. That\u2019s giving up and wasting your life, not even pursuing what you desire.\n\nFinding someone \u201cone day\u201d isn\u2019t good enough either (assuming this means not even trying in the meantime. Naturally, many relationships just aren\u2019t compatible for the long-term, but that\u2019s ok, there\u2019s more fish in the sea), I don\u2019t even want to enter my 30s as a virgin who\u2019s never had a girlfriend, the original goal was by 25, but I\u2019m not sure I can change this within eleven months.\n\nIt hurts that I made the goal of by age 25 five years ago, and it\u2019s been four and it hasn\u2019t changed. I still remember an online friend tell me \"That's five years!\" when I expressed my hopelessness at it happening by then. And unfortunately, I was right, but I have not been functioning at the level I should be at my age.....\n\nIt's a catch 22, I'm depressed and hopeless about this ever changing (or not changing until I'm significantly older) which makes trying to improve myself hard af. The only reason I don't just completely shut down and do nothing at all, is because I HAVE done that, and that's WAY WORSE. But, I'm still unable to put in my best effort with this depression and hopelessness, my mind is consumed by it, 24/7.\n\nI believe that still being a virgin who's never had a girlfriend is more due to my insecurity, fears, anxiety, and mental traumas, because I have had SOME girls/women who found me ACTUALLY ATTRACTIVE (not just \u201cnot ugly\u201d but actually good looking, handsome, even sexy ). I also had one female friend who tried to get me to have sex with her, but I was too scared, of our parents, and that is a huge event to just be dropped on you. If I wasn't worried about our parents finding out, I would have been much more likely to do it, wouldn't have had protection though, and the only thing worse than me suffering in life is bringing a child in to suffer my same fate, as this would be my fault for not preventing conception (besides my genetics and personal issues, the world will most likely continue getting worse and worse). I don't want kids anyway, wouldn't fit into the life I dream of (the goal is to make it reality, and no, it's not ONLY a girlfriend and sex, that is definitely a big part of it though), and it's expensive enough just to support yourself.....\n\nI was going to kill myself by 25 if I was still a virgin who\u2019s never even had a girlfriend, but despite being not normal, and uncommon by this age, it\u2019s still too soon to completely give up and end my life, there\u2019s still the second half of my 20s and 30s (which many people argue our better than 20s anyway).\n\nFrom one POV, being a late virgin who\u2019s never been in a relationship during the teens and 20s means avoiding a lot of potential (and likely) cheating, immaturity, superficiality, shallowness, and heartbreak.\n\nFrom another POV, still having no experience means having no way of knowing what you like and want (since what we THINK we want is not always what we really want), in a relationship, but there is no way to go back in time, and I know there are others who start later and enjoy love and sex from then on.\n\nI'm not a traditionally masculine man, and I have no desire to be (I might maybe eventually consider working out, but I'm referring more to attitude and interests). I'm into femdom, gentlefemdo to be more specific. I want a woman who will shower me with tons of affection and nurturing, praise me for being a good boy, and punish me for being a bad boy. I want her to tie me up, tease me, edge me, deny me, maybe some chastity for SHORT PERIODS OF TIME, NO CUCKOLDING (that's crossing the line for me), but I still want raw PIV sex too, with her on top of course, riding me, laying on me, still being dominant and in control of me.\n\nI don't necessarily want to do this MDLB/gentlefemdom dynamic ALL THE TIME, but it is something I want, and need. It'd be good emotionally, and I'm just wired to be into it, even before puberty, I had interests in this kind of stuff (ABDL too, don't know if I'd want that to be a regular thing or not, but it'd certainly go great with MDLB femdom) they just had no sexual nature before puberty, now they're sexual.\n\nEven though the majority of women are not into what I'm into, I would not want to get rid of my kinks/fetishes, even if I could, I don't know how to explain it, I just wouldn't want to stop being into them.....\n\nI still want normal aspects in the relationship too, I want to make sure she's satisfied, pleased, and that I take care of her, sexually AND otherwise. While I'm really into this kinky stuff, I still want a full relationship with \"normal\" aspects to enjoy too.\n\nI'd also be willing (and even want to try) to occasionally \"switch\" and me sexually dominate her, like get on top of her and just F*ck her HARD, but I'm really submissive, so this wouldn't be a regular thing for me, I'm just not a traditional man.\n\nI just wanted to provide some more context on the kind of relationship I want, since I've had struggles with having ANY kind of relationship, although in the last 6 years, I've been shut in (completely for 2 years, but still socially after that) so it's not like I've made any real life efforts after high school (and the efforts I made IN high school were a trainwreck, hell, despite not really being a believer, it's as if fate actually saved me from telling a new girl that we were soulmates, that would have gotten me bullied worse than I EVER had been. Me believing that we were soulmates was based off of a prophecy I thought up in my head, that just so happened to seemingly pan out in real life, but it was obviously just a normal coincidence).\n\nI should probably also note, since it's so important in the VAST MAJORITY of the US, I don't have my driver license. This is actually related to me sitting in the house 24/7 for two years.\n\nToday, I am still living with my parents, but in a civilized area (but still no transit, but plenty of Ubers, and my parents are suddenly willing to drive me often now).\n\nI actually obtained my learners permit, the writing test was the easiest test I've ever taken in my life. I've now even made a lot of progress on actually physically driving, but I can not practice frequently, not even once a week. My mom is too scared, my dad lives 50 miles away and doesn't even want to drive here s often because he and my mom fight too much (yep, even after divorcing six years ago) and my step dad is gone 4 days a week for work, and when he is here, I'm not always able to, with school and work. Honestly, despite the significant progress I have made driving, my nerves still hold me back from driving a lot, and so I don't say I want to go driving as often as I should.\n\nI really don't want to have to drive EVERYWHERE,EVERYDAY for the rest of my life, but I do want the option to be able to. And I pay more for Uber than gas would cost, possibly even more than a car might cost? If my parents didn't drive me at all, it would cost me AT LEAST $110 a week to take Uber, and that's just to go to and from work and school.\n\nHonestly, I think the COST of taking Uber everywhere wouldn't really be that bad if I was financially sustainable, I mean it's still a lot, but I should strive to be able to afford things I both want and need in life, and if I could afford it, I would be just fine paying for it (I'm not conservative, only when it's out of NECESSITY, I did not inherit my parents sense of penny pinching, that just degrades life quality, like going without things that you enjoy and even living somewhere where you're miserable/less happy just because it's cheaper).\n\nI'm the kind of person who would pay $2,000+ for the newest iPhone as long as it's either in affordable monthlly payments or if I simply had plenty of savings in the bank where it wouldn't cause a huge chunk missing. I mean, I do have limits, like I'm not going to pay $5 for a bottle of water, or $50 for a sandwich (unless I'm extremely wealthy, and want it).\n\nI'm not going without things if I don't have to, and the cost isn't astronomically high (but chances are the entire economy would completely collapse if prices ever skyrocketed that high, like $10,000 for an iPhone, or $500,000 for the cheapest house price, actually I'm worried that one might actually happen....)\n\nAnyways, hopefully my attitude of \"How can I afford that?\" instead of \"I can't afford that.\" shows something positive about my character (I'd rather strive, at least try, than just accept and settle, like that dipshit in IncelTears told me to do, and he was telling me to accept completely going without something that is a HUGE part of life for the vast majority of people[sex and romance], unlike settling for cheaper material things, which are less important, but are still nice and worth trying to get.)\n\nI don't want to find myself old and never experienced and enjoyed what I want in life. Instead of \"it'll happen one day\", I want it NOW (or in the very near future), and don't see why I can't obtain that NOW (or very near future). Why can't I have a girlfriend while still in my 20s, why can't I have sex while still in my 20s? Why am I supposed to \"accept fate\" and not even try?\n\nThe idea of settling for less in life is unbearable, life's a complete waste if you don't at least try......\n\nAnd even lots of ugly weird dudes get girlfriends and get laid, and I'm not even HIDEOUS.\n\nAlso, what's with the idea of there being someONE for everyone? Why would there only be one person in the entire world for someone? That sounds like utter nonsense! Surely every person in this world has at least hundreds, if not thousands, if not millions even, of people in the world that would date them and have sex with them if they met.\n\nAnd surely, even poor physical looks aren't enough to prevent everyone from wanting/being willing to date and have sex with you, and surely the \"hundreds to thousands to millions\" rule still applies.\n\nI realize the way I'm speaking may sound abstract and not make logical sense, I am very inexperienced in life, and been isolated/sheltered for a long time, so I don't understand much about the world/society at large, just my own personal experience.\n\nOK, I hope some of you will be willing to read the entire thing, but I feel I owe a TL;DR, even if I'm not required to include one, just please mention TLDR if you didn't read the entire post, so I have context on whether you're answering in regards to all the details or just the TLDR.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nI don\u2019t want to let my faults/flaws/cards I was dealt in life, dictate my life, not in the future, not even in the IMMEDIATE FUTURE. How do I obtain what I want in life despite the flaws I have? I'm so sick of missing out on life, and my desires living in my dreams and not coming to life. How do I obtain what I want DESPITE the shitty cards I was dealt in life? Surely it's not just impossible for me to succeed now....\n\nSurely I can even get a girlfriend and have sex while still in my 20s, despite so many having told me that I'm \"ugly as fuck\". A few have found me attractive, that must mean I have appeal to some.....\n\nEven though I'm 24M and still a virgin who's never had a girlfriend......",

I was severely depressed not even a year ago and with no direction, sitting at home all day playing video games. Now I am a honors student, I have tons of hobbies, I have improved my social skills, and I have an ambition plan for the future. \n\nBut I am still depressed about the stuff I can't control, and it is preventing me from feeling confident about myself. The first few years of my life, I was very sick and it effected many things about me physically and mentally. The main thing I am concerned about right now is my height. I am obsessing over it to an unhealthy degree. I am just short (pun intended) of 5'8 and my family is full of very tall people. I am a 20 year old male and it is unlikely I will grow anymore. I know I am not the shortest and I am lucky compared to other people, but it hurts just going on the internet and reading about it. Like on the internet all I read is about how short men have it the worst, and how unattractive they are to women and how on average less successful they are. It's gotten to the point where I will literally not ask women out because I am afraid they will reject me because of my stature. \n\nDeep down I kind of know my worries are all bullshit, I've always been obsessed with one part of my body or another and my height is just the latest thing. I think I have body dysphoria of some kind, I used to think I was extremely ugly and would avoid people because of it. Part of the reason I was extremely depressed last year.

I work two jobs and don\u2019t make the most, it\u2019s more for the experience the jobs provide, but I focus on myself first and foremost before others, not that I don\u2019t care for anybody else, but I put myself and my work as my first priority. People and girls have taken notice, especially the one I\u2019m currently talking to. See I want to ask her on a date, but I\u2019ve been needing to take care of my car since it makes a horrendous noise when idle (motor mounts need replacement 600$+ job)  I\u2019ve been looking around for mechanic shops for that, and don\u2019t want to take her out on a shaky car. Now I know I should focus on myself and fixing that car before pursuing anything else, but I needed some advice on what seems to be the best route in such a situation. I can keep flirting and having conversations, but at one point that gets repetitive if I don\u2019t \u201cshoot my shot,\u201d and she\u2019ll move on. Not that I particularly care about that, but she seems like a great girl and at one point I have to say something about going that next level.

But the hardest thing I've been trying to deal with is aging, self image, self-worth and letting go of the past. \n\n1. I used to have very bad orthorexia because my mother was obese and narcissistic. I  still live with her, and want to move. She's been trying to make me cut off work and put everything aside for her, even though I grew up homeschooled and doing diy home projects for her. She was very verbal and called my siblings and I questionable insults, such as \"retarded.\" (Which was her favorite.) I really want to move away from her, but I am hoping it'll happen soon. (I've got 2 jobs, but I'm hoping to save money and move in with a friend someday.)\n\n2. I'm overcoming my ED, and have a more \"average\" appetite and can tolerate the cold. But now I've been binging alot of foods like PB, and edema and getting \"older\" (I'm reaching my late twenties) is not helping me and my self image. I'm really trying to get over that, but I've been feeling like a gross old person in a young womans' body.\n\n3. I destroyed two relationships... \"My first love\" and \"My first boyfriend\". I left my crush in the dust, because I was really immature towards them.  The guilt of how I acted around him has been festering inside of me for the last 3 years, and it's fucking me up.  I also had to cut off from my boyfriend recently because he was much older than me, and was emotionally& financially dependent on his mom. He also was more attracted to me when I was just thin/young, and lied about his age. These situations really damaged my mental health, and I just feel like a trashy person. I wish I handled my relationships better.\n\n4. The fear of being \"too old\", \"too stupid because of how other people think of me\", and \"too poor\". I realized that no one is 100% happy with their lives, so I really need to find a way to live life gracefully. I really want to be good to my friends, move out, and become confident. I'm sick of my fears and past bothering me so much. I know that I am not perfect, but I don't want to be conceded or too insecure about my life.",

Still shy around people, somewhat depressed, and have low self-esteem. The motif of my 20s so far has been finding what is deficient about me and improving them one by one whether it be my physique, degrees, earnings, etc. All I can say is, ultimately, my achievements certainly did not make me \"feel great\". I am afraid that, despite what I have achieved and will achieve in the future, my low self-esteem is here to stay. Life is about improving yourself over time and that's why we are on this sub, but how do you exactly improve self-esteem? Is it a trait we are born with? I moved countries a lot and had socially stressful childhood. Is that why? or maybe like a lot of us on this sub, is nothing good enough for me?",

A very big problem is that i don\u2019t have a passion or something to fight for and cant\u2019t see what i want to do in the futute. Probably this is one of the reasons why i feel So down and bored. Another one is that i don\u2019t have Any friends.\nThe good part is that i managed to take social media marketing course ( in special Instagram) and i really feel that this is an option to start over.  I feel a big energy inside of me and i feel i can do big things. I wrote this because i needed to Tell somewone whats happening inside of me. In the end i want to ask you if you have Any tips or informations about social media marketing (pages to like, webinars, good books) or Any life tips. Thank you reddit Bros for making my days better.

Have also been learning alot in other avenues of the subject.\n\nI don't drink soda. I don't smoke. I barely drink (occasional wine or beer). \n\nI'm enjoying hanging out with friends again and me and my fiance's relationship is beautiful. I figured she would leave because of my past issues but she stuck through it and we are getting married soon. \n\nBut... \n\nI still feel like I just, like, suck. I feel like I'm failing. I feel like I'm not doing my job right and that I'll get talked to and fired soon. I barely exercise which really brings me down because isn't that what everyone is supposed to do to stay healthy? I don't read as much as I know I should, and I feel like I'm still not hitting that \"bar\" that's supposed to be hit. \n\nShouldn't I be extremely happy that I'm way better off than I used to be? Doesn't really feel like a happy ending.

However I do know what it is that I want, I am just very stuck in getting there. \n\nMy current situation is me being full time employed in a job which is the easiest thing going, pay could be better but at the same time could be worse compared to doing the same role with other companies in the area. I rent my home and bar the pets live by myself albeit I am seeing someone and we are looking to live together. \n\nI struggle to do anything, even getting out of bed most days. I have no motivation, energy and spark to do anything. So when I feel well enough, I go to work, do the basics for housekeeping and sorting food for myself and pets. In the warmer months I do enjoy my gardening and try to do some even in the colder months, even if it means just a quick tidy up. \n\nYes, I do suffer from anxiety and depression but have recently gone through CBT which has helped greatly for calming down my worries and reminding myself that doing something is better then doing nothing. I am also on two lots of Anti Ds, one for the despression itself and the other to regulate my sleep, so I sleep less but get a better quality of sleep if that makes sense. \n\nMy dream is to live in an modern eco friendly home that I have designed myself. I want the professionals to build it though as this is a bit too much for me. I know the career I want and looking at possibly doing a masters degree in the subject to help with my emplyability. It is quite a niche role though. \n\nI want to learn sales skills as well as investing to help build my wealth so I can live a more comfortable life and build a good nest egg. This will also go toward building my home and so I can hopefully work part time. \n\nI dream if writing a blog, which is also run on social media platflorms such as Instagram. However the subject I fear is already too saturated but could still carve a niche or write about something completely different but still really interests me. \n\nI would love to take up sewing as a hobby so I can design and make my own clothes and I collect artists bears so would love to start making my own. I do already grow plants, mainly roses which I absolutely adore, and really want to develop this too. \n\nWhilst I know what it is that I want, I have very low confidence in myself in being able to do anything along with low self esteem. I am very much the 'yes' girl and have been conditioned to be this way for as long as I can remember. The zone I live in currently is not a good or healthy one but I dont know how to break the cycle so I do have confidence and can work toward what I want and dream of. \n\nI want to be confident, in control, telling others what to do and on occasion be the centre of attention and looked up to. As an example the way femme dommes are in their roles but I want this on a day to day level, not just an erotic level. I hope that makes sense. \n\nWhere would you start in breaking this cycle and taking action? What has helped you with some of these habits etc? \n\nTIA.",

I felt like a burden.\n\nIn Addition i discovered that i'm gay because i learned that it was a thing. i always looked the boys in my class and not the girls, but i didn't realize \"being gay\" was an actual thing. but instead of embracing who i am, i decided to suppress it, i was acting like a straight guy and made jokes of gays just so people will like me. it didn't really help, i still felt like this outsider that nobody wants anything to do with.\n\nOn high school a good friend of mine invited me in the new year's eve with him and his girlfriend to a restaurant, i didn't really want to join, he told me that another friend is coming so it will be fun. I agreed just because i didn't want to disappoint. apparently the other friend didn't came, so it was just me, my friend and his girlfriend. I felt so bad this whole evening, they were making out and it felt like they are going to mate or something sooner or later in the middle of the restaurant.. It made me feel even more useless and unwanted, like a third wheel to everyone. it haunts me till this day and it was i think 6-7 years ago. I always fear of being left alone, of people thinking i'm useless and unwanted.\n\nAnyway, on the age of 18 everyone in Israel join the army for 2.8 years (males, females join for 2 years) But you can also continue study, the army pays for the study but you have to work wherever the army need you in this subject. so i joined the army in the age of 20. \n\nI took it like a challenge, an opportunity for myself to start over, it was a great opportunity because i knew no one there, new people, new experience... I was wrong. I was in an open base (An army base that you come home every day) because 1 year before i joined the army, my dad had a heart-attack (he is ok now) and 1 year before that my mom had skin cancer (Melanoma)\\[she's also ok now\\], so i asked to stay close to my parents so i could be with them also (as usual, i want to cheer others instead of cheering myself up)\n\nAfter 1.5 years in the army, i started feeling numb and depressed. It felt like it finally happened, i have no more emotions, needs, decisions or anything i want to do anymore, i felt like i'm just existing without any meaning. I started taking a psychologist. we were doing a shooting range every 6 months, i told my commander that i'm really scared going there and that i feel like if i'm going to hold this gun, i might just shoot myself. after half a year of going to a psychologist (2 years into the army service) they let me out of the army. i was back at home with my parents. they were going to the US to travel for a month, so i told them that i will take this month to stay home, without work. just to relax after the army to free myself a bit.\n\nafter this month i came out of the closet to my close family (parents and siblings), to some of my friends and i finally thought its over and finally i know myself and i can live however i want.\n\nNow i realize that **I HAVE NO IDEA** how i want to live? what i want to do with myself? who am i? why i'm here? who am i living for? just.... why?\n\nI feel like i have no decisions, opinions, preferences or anything that usually differs someone from someone else. I feel like i'm always trying to cheer others, do things for other people but never to myself. i realized **I HAVE NEVER** done something just for myself, to cheer ME up. it's always for someone else, always to help others, always to not disappoint, always stay cool, strong and not to show any negative emotion just so people will like me and want to stay with me...\n\nWhen i was a kid, people always made fun of me and i made fun of myself just so they won't beat me up... it made me so deep inside myself, i cant even know what i'm feeling anymore, i feel lost inside myself... i don't know what i like or dislike, i always need someone to guide me because i cant decide things for myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really want to change it and i need help to do that, because as i already said, i cant do stuff alone because i cant decide stuff myself, i'm too insecure of my own judgment skills and in myself in general.",

I'm usually a couch potato in winter and right now I don't have a job, so I really have no good reason of going out. I have a fit bracelet since 2018 and the last few months of 2019 were really the worst, some weeks I didn't even walk more than 5kms...\n\nSo I've been walking since day 1 of 2020. Trying to reach at least 2kms per day. Granted, some days there is no motivation. Some days it's raining or the ground is slippery. In those days I allow myself to rest and to do something else instead, like an extra hour of studying for example. But every night I would write the distance walked that day, even if it was only half a kilometer, just to keep track of everything.\n\nWeek 1 was 24.8 kms. Week 2 was 22.3 kms. Week 3 was 12.6 kms (I was pretty depressed during that week for other reasons). Week 4 was 21.38 kms. And week 5 is 29.10 kms.\n\nI was kind of sad and depressed at my lower streak in the middle of the month. I was thinking no problem, I should juste give it up and begin again in February because I wanted a clean streak, no low days, but instead I just kept going, kept trying to go farther. I took longer roads instead of short paths, big detours go get somewhere...\n\nAnd I reached 110 kms! I'm so happy, that's a huge number for me. The first month of commitment was the most difficult I think. Now I know I can do better. I can do worst also, and it's okay. Sometimes after doing 12kms a day, my butt should be allowed to rest at home haha.",

I'm having a relationship with a girl I love a lot, we study together at high school. She respects me and she knows that I love her. Everything is greatly fine because we talk at school normally and I always try to help her at her study, and when I need a service from her she helps too, and there are manythings make me sureshe feels comfortable of me, but I didn't tell her yet that I want to make  a serious relation in the future and want to get married of her later, so we may be separated and never meet because I didn't tell her yet and we didn't talk about that yet, and this is the last year we study together (next year is at the university) and I or she may move far (perhaps). Her mother was my teacher in the first year at the same school. I was her favorite because I'm well studying, I became literallty her son and she became my mother, she is amazing and everyone remarked the special relation between us. She really really trust me, she belives I'm good person, and after she knews about my feelings. I want to tell her (the teacher) about what I think, and I planned to talk after passing the my BAC exam, so I decided to live my present as it is and enjoy every moment. The problem is that I'm confused if I'm thinking in a right way or not, my feelings say: \"Is it right to keep the relation until you can marry her(6 years at least), or should I end everything here and another chance will come in the future?\" Sometimes I think that keeping the relation is a limitaion for both of my and her choices and freedom, and both we can find better chance, so I had  better to end this and everyone will follow his own path , But the other side doesn't accept to leave my love and want to fight for her and never give up, and says that yes! I can keep it and I can have what I want. This point blows my mind, I can't make a decesion, but I'm ready to accept the right thing to do whatever will happen. The resume is: should I keep this? or should I end it because it's not a good idea to keep the relation for years till marrying?\n\n(I didn't say that my relationship is weak or annoys me or... but maybe it's wrong to a teenager make a relation)",

But he went to better university than mine(study was the main issue when comparing), he is tall maybe over185, there isn't a big gap but more handsome than me and have a good personality too. I am 170, ugly and stupid. I know this isn't right but I can't stop thinking about that he will get a better job, earn more money, leaving happier and being positive. I even think if we apply to same company they will choose him, if we are in the same social group they will like him more and don't even notice about me, in relationships all girls will like him and he will living happier than me cuz he has no defect. Compared to him, all I have is defect. I can't fall asleep at night cuz of think about that. It makes me to depressed and hurt myself. Sometimes I wanna die maybe always, if I have only one better thing at least I wouldn't do this. But face to these fact I can't be better than him never. We are not even in the same place and I've thought about the worst things, I'm a bad person..\n\nAdditionaly even I went to travel, I really loved it but after came back home I couldn't stop thinking that he will travel more than me and enjoy, local people will like him but hate me.

In reality I am a good looking person, I have a master degree, I have always had jobs that pay better than most people have, I have a hobby that I enjoy and that brings income too, I have a husband who would die for me... But still, if someone is more successful than me I become deeply depressed and today I cannot even get out of my bed... Namely, I heard my best friend after 4 years of studying a foreign language and making so many sacrifices has finally managed to legally obtain a doctor's job in Germany and in stead of being happy for her (because she has always been happy for me and treated me like a sister) I am deeply depressed because I feel like a failure since I am not able to obtain such a job... Should I mention I would never ever want to work as a doctor?! And that I would never ever want to move to Germany?! Yes, I am fucked up to this extent and I don't know what to do anymore. Maybe it is me being depressed for not having some fancy title like doctor and the respect such job brings... I don't know... Maybe it is me wishing to climb corporate ladders or smth like that... But when I think realistically about these things I never wanted them. It is as if I am concerned that other people will compare me to my friend and say she is \"better\" than me...

            "content": "I've always been happy and confident in myself and my choices, but these past couple of years have been tough on me. I lost both of my parents suddenly and was forced to take on their debts and obligations at 24 years old. I'm also an only child and had no help from any other family, so its been pretty difficult...\n\nI live with my partner, and he works 40+ hours a week, as do I. We share a house with 3 other people, another couple (my partners brother and his GF) and a close friend. EVERYONE in the house works at the same sports bar, doing different jobs in the building. But our 3 other roommates only have to work maybe 12-20 hours a week and are able to make rent, bills, and still have enough to go out and eat, party, etc. My partner and I are super introverted and quiet, and our 3 roommates are more extroverted. My partner and I arent jealous of them going out and drinking. But there are some days out of the month that we literally have nothing to eat. We live paycheck to paycheck and still have to sometimes ask my partners brother for $40 for gas and food (we ALWAYS pay it back inmediately, but we feel so  embarrassed asking so we've only done it twice).\n\nAnyway, this is the real \"story\" I guess. The company we all work for recently had a major settlement in court about something or another, and it was stated that anyone who worked there before (I cant remember so let's make it up) March of 2016 is entitled to receive monetary compensation. The entire building was buzzing with excitement when this news broke, but my partner and I were heartbroken because wed both started working with the company 2 or 3 months AFTER the cut off date. So we wont be getting any check in the mail, when we could really really use it.\n\nMy roommates have all gotten their checks, and they have been celebrating by having parties, buying new computers, planning vacations, etc. And they keep doing things like knocking on our door and shoving their new TVs at us and saying \"Just wanted to show you what I got!!\" And my partner and I have to just smile and say \"wow that's great! Good for you!\" When inside we're seething.\n\nWe work so hard. We dont live outside our means at all. We wear tattered clothes and havent gotten haircuts in years. I dont wear makeup anymore. We share deodorant and shampoo. We eat once a day. Sometimes we cant eat at all. We share a car that barely runs and has trouble turning. Everyone else in the house is able to afford to live better AND have multiple days to veg out and relax. My partner and I are exhausted all the time and sometimes it really effects our relationship. And I feel like so much of it is all my fault because my parents died and now I have thousands of dollars of debts to pay. My partner doesn't deserve that but hes been supportive and kind. I can tell hes just as exhausted as I am though and I just wish we could get a break. Getting a check for $100 would change our lives, yet our roommates all got $10,000 for literally doing NOTHING.\n\nI want to stop being so jealous and envious of their blessings. I know I should just think about what I have and not what I dont. But why do my roommates have to rub it in our faces? They HAVE to see that we only eat once a day and look like homeless people. Why would you do that to someone? I was raised to never talk about money under any circumstances, and I've always been that way. So when others openly talk about buying new gaming computers to me while my stomach is grumbling I dont even know what to say.\n\n\nTLDR; Roommates who never have to work basically won the lottery while my partner and I are close to being homeless every month and go to bed hungry often. How can I stop being jealous and envious of their fortunes?\n\n\nThank you, sorry if this was a total mess, I'm on mobile and I'm still very new to reddit.",

I hate saying to myself that I failed which makes me sad (but I definitely feel like it) because my discipline and life situations happened at the wrong time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to change the country (living in the EU), tired of living in the same city for 26 years, embrace new experiences and surroundings, enrol the university again with CS course (even though I studied the same course 4 years and failed), lose a bit more weight and strengthen myself. I messed up too much playing videogames, even though I heavily lost motivation playing it as I used to tons of hours. Instead, I play for an hour or two maximum and that's it. I realized there are so many things to do in my life, social events, outdoors activities which actually can make me happy if everything is in some sort of balance. \n\nMy question is actually how to make my last portion of a text alive, avoid being distracted, stay focused on the right things when things go bad, not to become demotivated again and returning back to the shelter playing videogames for 8+ hrs?\n\nAlso, I definitely want to enrol uni this or by the end of next year and I'll be 27 or 28 by the time I enrol.  I hope that's not too late because my friends have something on their back and working pretty much which saddens me also. I want to make myself worthy and being happy at the end of the day with my career. Also, I want to become independent and living on my own without parents, going out often because I feel that I missed that part when I was younger. I believe it's doable and these are TRUE values what I desire. How to achieve that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",

She is very loving and supportive to me.  Something she has been dealing with is my insecurities. The the past few months i have been struggling with my life and my outlook. Recently, my wife and i have been trying to have sex and i am now struggling with premature ejaculation. This is something i have not really had issues with. It was normal for me to have sex with her for thirty minutes to an hour easy. But, this with many issues have been happening to me. I honestly don't know why. I'm depressed with my outlook on life in general. It all feels meaningless to me. I'm extremely insecure and i know it. If i don't go to the gym i'm upset. I want to look good. I always feel fat and out of shape. I'm so hard on myself that i can't stop but to feel this way all the time. Part of this goes back to childhood and how much i hated that child. I hated myself. Not matter how much i work out i still feel like that ugly, skinny guy from the past. I'm currently going back to school with a plan. i work two jobs. I have goals, but i just can't seem to be happy. My moods tend to shift, but they are mostly negative. I can't help to feel undeserving of anything even my wife. She's says she loves me everyday and hugs me. All she does is support, but i can't get over it. I just can't fricking stop these thoughts. Earlier today we tried to engage in sex and yet again i came in three minutes. My wife looked at me and said \"it's Ok\". I cried and walked away. I told her\"i think we need some time away from each other\". My wife is so damn beautiful. I'm tired of ruining her like this. In no way am i dumb. I speak two languages. i self teach myself things. i have done some amazing things in life. But despite all of that, i feel less than a man. I feel worthless. I feel incapable of success. I look back and feel like i wasted time and energy on trying to be something that i ended up as nothing. \n\nI know i need help. because these thoughts need to stop. I just want to feel the light. I no longer want to feel darkness and sadness. I need help and advice to overcome this.",

            "title": "What you do most days is what matters. Choose yourself over and over again",
            "content": "I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot. What we do most days matters, because in the end, our habits dictate how our lives will turn out. We can\u2019t control outer circumstances but we can control what we do in every situation, and that is a really really big deal. \n\nI\u2019ve struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time. And I would do nothing because I didn\u2019t feel well enough to do anything. This is natural when in that kind of mental state. But just because it\u2019s natural doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t have a part in adding to my depression and anxiety. I didn\u2019t eat well, I didn\u2019t move my body, I didn\u2019t do anything to get me out, and i stayed there for a really long time. What i was doing most days was feeding my depression and anxiety instead of working to heal myself. \n\nEventually, over time, I spent everyday doing something to heal. The actions changed, but there were a few i made myself do consistently. I had to get up out of bed by 9AM. I had to make my bed. I had to brush my teeth in morning and night. I had to drink at least 8 glasses of water. I started small and I held myself accountable. I needed to do these things, which meant forcing myself during a time when I didn\u2019t want to do anything. \n\nOvertime, these habits stayed and other healthy habits crept in. I quit adderall. I quit smoking. I left a toxic relationship. I chose me. Over and over and over again. And that turned into me being someone who loved herself enough to take care of her. The daily habits just kept building up and I realized I was doing things out of a want to be better because I loved me and deserved it, instead of because I hated myself and needed to get myself out of depression. Something changed within me by taking small steps. And now, my life is entirely different than it was and it\u2019s truly amazing. \n\nI still have my days where I feel not that great. I\u2019ve been sick on and off since November and my energy hasn\u2019t been where it once was because of daily habits I\u2019ve let go of because I thought I was \u201ccured\u201d. Habitual patterns and self-sabotaging thoughts and beliefs from my early life started to creep up again. But I know that the choice is up to me, I can chose to stick to negative patterns, and watch life unfold one way, or I can choose me again and watch it unfold another way. It really is a daily choice to choose yourself, even when you\u2019re tired and don\u2019t feel like it, we all have a choice- and it\u2019s important we focus on the ones that make us feel good and lead to health and vitality, instead of ones that are quick fixes and hurt us in the not-so long run. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, we don\u2019t have to be OBSESSED with doing too much at once. That is turning one unhealthy habit into another. I remember i got SO upset because I ruined my 100+ day meditation streak. I stopped meditating for over a month after and then I totally \u2018lost\u2019 the habit and it took a while to build it back up. Just because we don\u2019t do something perfectly, doesn\u2019t mean we stop forever. Just pick it back up again. It\u2019s what you do most days, not what you do every single day perfectly. Habits are important but things happen, life happens, and missing a day or two isn\u2019t the end of the world. But letting that healthy habit completely fall away is silly. Just get back up and try again. It\u2019s a journey, and we\u2019ll always have times when we fumble- but how we react to those times is super important, and we can always begin again. \n\nToday, I invite you to join me in choosing yourself. Make a list of a few easy small habits that you know will help. As the saying goes, \u201cdo something today your future self will thank you for.\u201d Build up those healthy habits. It\u2019s possible and so necessary for our own wellbeing.",

I've always been the type of person with big ambitions but I've never been able to be consistent or carry through with them, as hard as I try. 2018+2019 was very rough for me, i was away from family and a lot of factors played a role but i became super depressed and lost all  motivation and hope, i became numb to everything and couldn't do anything right, like nothing mattered to me.

I will stress out about deadlines and upcoming exams, but proceed to do nothing about it, wasting my time away doing stupid things to get some instant gratification and i cant seem to manage to discipline myself and get myself in line as hard as i try.\n\nI just feel very lost and hopeless right now, as i'm writing this post i have a big test i should have been preparing for but instead i procrastinated my weekend away, same goes for other goals like going to the gym or meditation.

I'm 18 years old, in my A-Levels and I can't keep living like I do. Socially, I'm in a somewhat unstable group, comprised mostly of the unstable and depressed people. I don't have anything against anyone, but I feel like we're unhealthy as a group as we don't often share feelings, and sometimes I feel isolated except when I fight to be amusing. I suppose I always play the clown because if not, I worry I have no value to anyone and I would quickly be overshadowed and forgotten by my friends. I, despite being told that I'm attractive, also haven't really wanted a girlfriend in years because I feel that I would only let her down and hurt her.\n\n This, I suppose, is where I mention my ADHD. I have always been disorganised and distracted, and I really end up struggling with basic tasks which causes intense stress to my parents. I also used to lie about how well I was doing in primary school, and this would last a couple of months before it was found out, and my parents became intensely angry and sad for the next few months, and I would get hit (This was always sincerely apologised about) . I know it isn't major compared to other people's households, but I've always lived in an angry environment, because it's a perpetual cycle between my parents being angry at me or eachother, to the point where I'm either shouted at for everything I do, or I listen to my mother cry to me about my father for upwards of 45 minutes. I feel like if I was capable of organising myself, the the stress I cause would be reduced and my entire family would be happier.\n\n I also find that college is difficult, as I can't focus easily (despite my medication for ADHD). I end up distracting myself with useless entertainment instead of working when I should be.\n\n  I thought about challenging this stuff when I hit 2020, because that's the prime decade of my life; 18 to 28 years old, so the purpose of this is for me to work on myself and be peer pressured into updating.\n\n The main areas in which I need to work on are:\n\n**Work & Routines**: I need to function as a human being, in my college work and daily life. \n\n**Confidence**: I'm not an introvert, however I struggle to always say what I feel, or believe that I'm a good enough person.\n\n**Relationships**: Despite my fears, maybe I do need to give some love to someone who gives it back. \n\n**Personal Composure**: I'd like to develop my own comfortable clothing style and make progress at the gym (despite going there for about a year, I still appear quite skinny).\n\n**Mental Composure**: I'd like to break out the competetive mindset that I need to be always funny, and become calmer. I also hope to meditate and process things more logically and slowly\n\n\n Hey, you scrolled to the bottom, well done, that means the post didn't get removed for violation of several rules.\n\n I'm gonna finish with this note. I just want you [me] to actually pay attention. It's now February 2020, and my first New Decade's resolution hasn't been something that I've paid enough attention to. Oh yeah, by the way, that New Year's / New Decade's resolution for the prime of my life is just to \"Do it\" and not hold back and shy away from what I know I need to do.\n\nGoodbye, Me, and maybe make some progress this week.",

            "content": "Hello. First time posting to Reddit and finding this sub, though I've followed some other subreddits from Google for about a year. \n\nI seem to be stuck in life. Some background as it relates to my problems listed below: I'm 30(m) have obtained 2 BAs (1 economics. 1 history) and have some decent work experience in higher education. I'm able bodied. I have a low credit score. I've been in films and shows and commercials and modelling campaigns. I'm signed to a few agencies across the Midwest and South.\n\nSome things I'd like to improve are: 1) buying a car as I've never owned one. I did have one until 2013, but it was a gift from my parents, so for the past 7 years I've either taken the bus, walked, or rode a bike. I have no idea how to buy one. \n\n2) Getting more money. I have some retirement from a higher education job I worked for 13 months as a janitor, but otherwise have no savings or retirement. My passion is to work in film and TV. For the last 4 years or so, I have a huge problem with staying motivated and thus remaining at jobs that aren't related to this. Also, none of the acting/modeling jobs I've gotten have offered 'big break' money. So, the paychecks go towards bills and food and whatnot.\n\n3) Getting more skills related to production and content creation behind the camera as well as more acting opportunities. I've tried to gather some knowledge online, but as I don't have a computer/laptop a lot of the practice one needs for say video editing is hard to do. I've tried to learn from various people on sets I've been on, but there's only so much one can learn via osmosis. I have become decent with lighting setup though. I'd like to attend a community college to get such skills, but I owe my previous university a lot of money, thus, can't get my transcripts for my admission. Also, no money.\n\n4) Fixing my image of myself. I've been in crazy shape in the past and still thought I was fat which caused me to miss some potentially big roles. Now, I've been broke for the last year so can't afford a gym or boxing and have legit gotten a bit soft. How can I feel better about my body and end this battle in my head about if I'm too fat? I legit convince myself I can't do certain things or meet people or submit for roles because I'm not fit enough. Idk. I know it sounds weird. \n\nHow can I improve these things? Thanks",

You will wish you worked harder, made more money, spent less time with your family, less time with your friends. You will reminisce fondly about all the evenings you stayed home alone. On your deathbed, you will be grateful for many things, Thank God you stayed in that job you hated for fear of rocking the boat. Thank God you settled for a toxic friendship instead of making the effort to meet people who were on your wavelength. Thank God you ignored your dream career so you wouldn\u2019t upset your family. On your deathbed, you will be glad you didn\u2019t tell those humans you loved that you loved them before they were gone forever, you will be glad you spent years taking passive aggressive comments personally from people who are probably just miserable dicks themselves. You will be glad you were too cautious to pursue your actual passion in life. On your deathbed, you certainly won\u2019t think back on whatever it is you worried about constantly, and laugh at how utterly insignificant it was compared to what a fucking amazing time you could have been having with a body that hadn\u2019t started falling apart yet, in an age more enlightened than any that had come before while the people you loved were still alive.\n\nYou were young back then. Life was fleeting, and luckily you wasted the entire thing. When you were young, you wanted a million things, on your deathbed you want only one, and that was to be young again. On your deathbed, you certainly won\u2019t start having awful realizations, like how the point of making money probably wasn\u2019t to make money - but to do cool stuff with it for yourself and others. That the point of long life probably wasn\u2019t to put off your real plans until tomorrow, but rather to give you more time to pursue them today. Now. Literally fucking now. That the point of being a talking monkey in space probably wasn\u2019t to sit reading Reddit comments but to have a good time, with what little time there was, and to make other talking monkeys feel good too.\n\nYou were born into an age Science Fiction couldn\u2019t even imagine. When your species had access to clean drinking water through magic pipes, to practically infinite information through magic wires, to devices that can materialize pizza in magic boxes at your door within 1 hour or less. Despite being surrounded by miracles on daily basis, despite being matter that has woken up, despite the universe contriving to create you, you still convinced yourself that the odds were stacked against you. Somehow. That the good ideas had been had, apparently, and everything is shit for some reason. So. Great!However you saw it at the time, the future was a branching network of opportunities and adventure. At any moment you could have begun the project of refashioning your life into what you actually you wanted it to look like. There would be risks, there would be bad days, there would be stress. But that was nothing compared to the misery of realizing that your entire lifetime had been wasted on doubts and self sabotage.\n\nThe hard road was easy. The easy road was hard. It took 14 billions years to make you and only 90 to fuck it up. And with self-doubt and apathy, you did fuck it up.\n\nBut that is irrelevant now, at the end, all things considered, all beds made, all I\u2019s dotted and T\u2019s crossed. Because on your deathbed you will think back on your life, and you may have regrets. You\u2019ll wish you\u2019d worked harder, made more money, spent less time with your family, less time with your friends. \n\nAnd maybe you began to take steps towards going off to your actual passion, back when you still had your entire life ahead of you and really only yourself in your way.\n\n- Exurb1a on YouTube",

            "content": "I\u2019ve always been a procrastinator. When I was a student, I would constantly make up excuses to push my tasks to a later time so I could enjoy more video games and TV shows.\n\nThen, when I started working as a software engineer at IBM and then as a freelancer, I started enjoying being the guy that gets things done quickly. I did this to impress colleagues but also to keep moving forward and tackle other new challenges. As a result of that, I started learning techniques to improve my productivity. I tried different methods taught by authors, coaches and entrepreneurs: for a year I tried meditation, did a lot of physical training, ate healthier, went to bed early, woke up way too early, etc. I finally understood what my productivity magic recipe was.\n\nThis post expresses what I understood so far, what works for myself and what does not.\n\n# The Superman Routine\n\nI tried to follow what most of the lifestyle coaches will advise you to do: have a strict morning routine. So, each morning, for about 2 months, I didn\u2019t snooze, I straight got out from the bed, drank a glass of water, exercised for 10 minutes, meditated 20 minutes and ate a complete breakfast (eggs, toasts, a fruit, a fruit juice, a coffee at least). I honestly started to feel proud and strong. But in reality, it only drained more of my available energy at the given day. These types of routines are hard to follow in the long term, you need to be disciplined about it. Unfortunately, without much surprise, I started to drop those habits one by one until I finally stopped completely. I feel like a strict morning routine is good for your mindset but it doesn\u2019t make you more productive in the end.\n\nThen, I found the \u201cBecoming the man of action\u201d series by Mark Queppet. It blew my mind. The main idea is that we have a certain amount of dopamine and you decide when and how to release it. Some activities release a peak of dopamine instantly. For example, taking a drug and masturbating are activities that make your brain release a big amount of dopamine in no time. Other activities make us release dopamine quite easily such as watching Netflix, browsing social media, etc. On the other hand, creating things and undertake a life project will not release dopamine immediately but only at certain milestones. Unfortunately, In the social media era, lots of content makers and journalists seek to make our brain addicted to their content with bait-click titles and controversial topics. It makes your brain release too much dopamine and leaves no space for the energy you need to reach your life goals. Thus, you need to reprogram our brain to avoid instantaneous dopamine release while trying to fall in love with the discipline.\n\nWith this concept in mind, I crafted a guide that improved my discipline and productivity.\n\n# 1. Sleep \ud83d\ude34\n\nIn our modern society, sleep is considered to be a lazy activity. The less you sleep, the more you\u2019ll have time to work. Thus, the more you will be successful. I strongly think that it is a misconception. Sleep deprivation is the cause of diseases, inattention, lack of creativity, grumpiness and much more.\n\nYou need to obtain the recommended 8 hours of nightly sleep. With better sleep quantity and quality, you\u2019ll be able to make better decisions, better control your emotion and manage problems/obstacles with boosted creativity.\n\nI highly recommend you to read \u201cWhy we sleep\u201d by Matthey Walker. He explains perfectly what science discovered about sleep in the last decade. Then, by understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d, you could probably understand the \u201chow-to\u201d. Here is an excerpt of what good sleep hygiene looks like:\n\n* Reduce caffeine and alcohol intake.\n* Remove screen technology before sleeping\n* Establish a regular bedtime and wake-up time (even on weekends)\n* Avoid sleeping on the couch early/mid evenings\n* Reduce anxiety-provoking thoughts and worries (I talk about a way to help this further in this post)\n\n# 2. Remove bad habits \ud83d\udcf5\n\nBad habits are activities that make you release too much dopamine and don\u2019t help you build the life you want. They act like escapes hatches. Here are some examples :\n\n* Watching pornography. Masturbating. Taking psychoactive drugs. Binge drinking.\n* Browsing social media: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat \\[\u2026\\].\n* Watching Netflix. Going down the YouTube rabbit hole.\n* Playing video games.\n\nIf you\u2019re addicted to pornography or/and you take drugs regularly and you want to build the life you have always dreamt about then you need to do a brain rehab. Mark Queppet helps you understand why and how to remove these type of habits in his Sexual Self-Mastery series\n\nSocial media browsing also doesn\u2019t help you. You need to cut these habits. Completely removing every social media platform that makes you over-consume is the best way to reprogram your brain to stop being addicted to these products. Go easy on yourself, try to cut your habits gradually.\n\nRegarding movies, tv shows, and video games, try to reduce your consumption as much as you can while keeping enough to inspire your creativity. You could allow yourself one movie and 2 hours of video games per week for example.\n\n# 3. Prepare \ud83d\udcd5\n\nYou can\u2019t be productive if you don\u2019t know what you have to do. You can have the greatest ambitions now, but if you don\u2019t know what you have to do to progress toward your goals, you won\u2019t do anything.\n\nYou need a system you can refer to when you\u2019re \u201cready\u201d to produce. This system must be maintained frequently and be up-to-date at any time. A simple todo list could suffice but my personal experience revealed that it is lacking in many aspects. I had a daily todo list before and I discovered that it stressed me out because of due dates. Because my priorities changed all the time in a single day due to particular events, I always had to postpone tasks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to find a tool that matches the modern man lifestyle. David Alley explains this perfectly in his book: \u201cGetting Things Done\u201d. He is the inventor of a great framework that allows you to:\n\n* Capture your thoughts: you need to capture all of the material that\u2019s floating around in your head, your abandoned todos, incomplete projects, any nagging issues that might keep you awake at night.\n* Clarify and organize: add related information to your items, knowing that you\u2019ll be able to refer to these details when you need them.\n* Reflect and engage: choose the right thing to do at the right time (example: you might be at work and only have 30 minutes, you might be at home but your energy level is low, you might be at school with access to special resources).\n\nI found a tool called NirvanaHQ which is a complete todo list system powered by the Getting Things Done framework.\n\nMy preparation workflow with this tool is:\n\n1. When I have something in my mind or when I have to remember something important, I open up Nirvana and add an incomplete item in the \u201cInbox\u201d section. For example: \u201csell old laptop\u201d, \u201cdrink friends\u201d, \u201cbuild shelf\u201d. I have an idea, I write it down in my inbox and maybe destroy it later but I try to collect everything.\n2. Every evening, I open my Inbox and try to organize and clarify every item. If I can complete it in less than 2 minutes, I will do it now. Otherwise, I translate it into an actionable task with specific tags. Examples: sell my old laptop \u21d2 publish my laptop on Craigslist (tags: at home, computer, low energy, 10min), drink friends \u21d2 Invite my friends for a drink (tags: anywhere, low energy, 5min, scheduled to a specific day). Then, I move these tasks to a \u201cNext\u201d list (I could also move them to a \u201cScheduled\u201d, \u201cWaiting\u201d or a \u201cSomeday\u201d list)\n3. Review & organize every item once a week.\n\nNow that I have a \u201cNext\u201d list with **actionable** tasks. I know what to do when I want to be productive.\n\n# 4. Cultivate boredom \ud83e\uddd8\n\nYou sleep enough, you removed bad habits and you know what to do to be productive and work toward your life's goal. Now, you have a choice: to work on your tasks or do nothing. And it is, in fact, the cool side of these guidelines. You are not obligated to work. And if you don\u2019t work on your tasks, you will feel bored and you will want to go watch Netflix again, but you can\u2019t, you removed this habit. You need to stay strong, and I assure you, you will be so bored that you won\u2019t have the choice, you will have to work at a given time.\n\nAlso, boredom allows you to reflect on yourself and your projects, take a break, feel present and meditate in a way, save energy for when you need to work. You need to cultivate and embrace boredom.\n\n# 5. Act \ud83e\udd1c\n\nNow comes the most difficult part of being productive: to produce. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a magic tool for this part of the guide. What is important to understand is that the biggest obstacle in this part is the **trigger**. The trigger is where it all starts. It is the most critical part of the productive mind. The trigger can decide either to be in your better self favor or to go completely the other way. So the idea is to influence this trigger on going the way you\u2019d like.\n\n\\-----------\n\nTo conclude, there is no perfect recipe to make everyone more productive. A morning routine will help you to have the right mindset but won\u2019t make you more productive. What worked for me so far was to get enough sleep, remove bad habits, prepare and make sure everything I think about is written down and to finally enjoy doing nothing and embrace that boredom. The result is me, working harder, making better decisions, not forgetting important stuff and being proud of myself.\n\nI hope these insights can help you be more productive and work toward your life goals. Maybe it can make you realize all the great projects you can achieve and all the time you can unlock for more important tasks.\n\nLet me know in the comments what is your thought on this guide \ud83d\ude00.\n\n# EDIT:\n\nThank you all for your feedback. I'm glad we can exchange experience on this topic. Some of you also asked me to go deeper on certain points of this guide. So here we go:\n\nFirst of all, I think it's very important to know **why** we need to be productive. You probably need to make sure you can answer these 3 questions:\n\n1. Where do you want to be in 3 years?\n2. Where do you want to be in 8 years?\n3. What\u2019s your life's goal?\n\nIf you struggle to answer these questions, it\u2019s alright, it can take some time to figure it out. Here are some examples to help you:\n\n* John is working as a recruiter in a big consulting company. In 3 years, he'd like to start the coaching activities that he has always dreamed about. In 8 years, he'd like to be settled with a family and to spend some time with them. His life's goal is to have enough money to be able to travel all around the world with his family and discover many cultures.\n* Claire is a Data Scientist in a startup. In 3 years, she'd like to be a confirmed Data Scientist and to have a higher position. In 8 years, she hopes to have had the chance to write several renowned papers, to have a top job position and a high salary. Her life's goal is to make discoveries in medical research to help people. She would also like to inspire others with her work.\n\nWhenever you do something, it's important to think if it helps you achieve your life's goal (on every scale possible). Nowadays, it is known that our society mostly consumes. And, don't get me wrong, it's important to consume. But it needs to fit your goals. For example, if you dream to become a writer, of course, you need to consume lots of books. If you dream to become an esport famous player (do you, really?), of course, you need to play and practice video games most of your time. But it all comes down to if your current activity is helping you to achieve one of your goals.\n\nSome of you are wondering how you can be happy by \"working\" most of the time and have little \"playtime\". This entire idea is to suggest to reprogram our brain in order to enjoy working, enjoy becoming a man of action. You can make \"work time\" **your** \"playtime\", you can fall in love with being active and productive. To sum up, you can do so by replacing your escape loops with productivity loops.\n\n* Escape loops are triggered by discomfort (boredom, pain, sadness) and produce instant pleasure. Pleasure first, pain later. It doesn't solve the core problem: Why are you being sad? Why does it hurt so much?\n* Productivity loops are triggered by motivation and ambition. These are activities that produce pain first but reward you at the end. These loops are fulfilling.\n\nThere are \"short\" escape loops that provide a big spike of pleasure in no time: hard drug and masturbation/pornography for example. You won't be able to replace these kinds of loops with a unique productivity loop. You need to make one to many replacements. For example, replace compulsive masturbation with healthy habits: exercise, meditate, eat healthily. Your choice.\n\nThere are \"medium\" escape loops that provide pleasure on several days, but doesn't make you move forward: playing a long video game solo campaign, binge watch multiple series seasons. You can replace these loops with a good book on the topic you're interested in and which contributes to improving your skills in a particular domain. You can also work on a personal project for several days.\n\nAlso, some of you are wondering what dopamine has to do with all of this and how boredom can help you be more productive. For example, imagine that you fast for 2 days and you're presented a piece of perfectly seasoned broccoli. This will be the most delightful broccoli you ever have eaten. Now, what if you eat junk food every day, you won't even bother to eat broccoli that helps you being healthier, your brain doesn't want it. This fast period corresponds to the boredom culture I'm suggesting. Think about this, if you don't have escape loops anymore, you'll have so much energy to do meaningful activities that don't reward you right away.",

As NoFap is the keystone habit, almost all of my other routines are gone.\n\nI currently want to \n- meditate (this is extremely important)\n- excercise \n- work on some IT Projects, as I've been neglecting my passion for quite a few years\n- study more for final exams, I've been doing 10 difficult math problems every day which is quite a lot, but I've been neglecting other important subjects because of it.\n- fix my sleep schedule\n- reduce my phone usage (this is the only thing I engage in, as anything else requires excessive effort to do)\n\nHowever, I'm getting overwhelmed by life right now.\nI find it very hard to get out of bed and do anything. It's like I have no reason for that except maybe not getting in trouble at school. Whenever I have a holiday or a weekend, I sleep until 12 AM, lacking energy and drive to do anything with my life besides wasting time on the internet and taking care of the most important responsibilities. \n\nI have to literally force myself to do things almost every time, and if it wasn't for Concerta, I would have quit anything I started doing after 2 minutes.\n\nAlmost all of my friends have recently incorporated some sort of excercise in their routine. My cousin works his butt off studying and although I pick up subjects way quickier than him, he spends hours and hours every day working. I can't fucking believe in that superhuman ability as I've lost my passion fir almost anything since 3 years ago and haven't been working that hard on anything ever since. Let's be honest right now - i fucking hate it. Whenever he tells me about his work I get really mad inside of my own head, for the comparison machinery is constantly running. I'm envious of his ability to pull of such feats. I can't help but quit after 10 or 20 minutes of starting something. I get overwhelmed easily by the breadth and depth of unfamiliar subjects, which makes me  think \"i'm too stupid/too weak for that\".\n\n\nI'm stuck in a comparison trap trying to one-up him at every time, despite me being the person he has usually looked up to. \n\nI'm fucking tired of all this shit - I procrastinate on anything important, all I do is sit on my phone. Concerta was supposed to help me with motivation and focus (i have an adhd diagnosis), but it doesn't work and makes it even harder to stop using the phone.\n\nI have no idea what to do now. If something doesn't change soon, I will end up on the street as a FUCKING METH ADDICT. \n\nIt's like I technically could do it but the effort required to pull something off seems so enormous, that the mere act of starting is a success for me. Not to mention that I often give up at the first sight of an obstacle. \n\nHelp",

            "content": "I\u2019d like you to imagine a garden.\n\nIn this garden, the soil is always rich with nutrients and what you plant, it will grow. There is rain and sun so you don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\n\nYou can plant anything. There are no restrictions.\n\nYou can plant roses or you can plant poison ivy. You can plant tomatoes or you can plant nightshade, a deadly poison. What you put in, as a seed, will eventually grow into something much bigger.\n\nThis garden is your mind and the seeds you can plant are your thoughts.\n\nYour mind is a fertile place where the thoughts you plant, will grow and make up for what your life is.\n\nOr as the old passage from the Bible goes, from the book of proverbs, chapter 23, verse 7:\n\n**\u201cAs a man thinketh in his heart, so is he,\".**\n\nYour thoughts, your convictions, manifest the surrounding reality.\n\nYour life, good or bad, is nothing more than a reflection of the thoughts you\u2019ve planted in your mind and nourished. These thoughts became behaviors. Behaviors became results.\n\nYou are where you are right now because deep down in your heart, this is where you wanted to be, no matter how sad or unfair this may sound.\n\nThis principle is one of the oldest spiritual laws in existence. It\u2019s also one of the best known. You may know it under a different term.\n\nThis is \u201cyou become what you think about\u201d.\n\nAnd you can find this in all of the world\u2019s religions.\n\nSome variations of this exists in Hinduism, in Christianity and in basically every other major religion. It\u2019s found in all belief systems, as the one used by the Chinese. It\u2019s as much of a universal law as gravity. Long before books existed, wise people understood that our thoughts manifest our reality.\n\nIt works on two levels.\n\nFirst, your beliefs are connected to the universe on a quantum level. We manifest what we really believe.\n\nLet me make this clear though.\n\nYou don\u2019t manifest what you think you believe. You manifest what\u2019s in your heart. If you believe you deserve unhappiness and pain, then no matter what you say, this you\u2019ll get.\n\nA great deal of people believe they have positive thoughts when their inner voice is always negative and destructive.\n\nThat voice will always win. Maybe this is why LoA fails for so many people - they\u2019re trying to grow trees of prosperity and success while planting seeds of doubt and pain and suffering.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t work this way.\n\nYou get what\u2019s in your heart. The universe will manifest it. But what\u2019s in your heart is the truth and we may not always know of this truth.\n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you what you intended.\n\nLife gives you what you ask.\n\nAnd while many people intend for wealth and joy and health, their thoughts are of poverty and sadness and despair. Since this is what they\u2019re planting, this is what the universe is manifesting.\n\nSecond, your thoughts lead to beliefs.\n\nYour beliefs lead to actions.\n\nYour actions lead to outcomes.\n\nYour outcomes leads to your destiny.\n\nThe thoughts you plant in your mind will determine how you act, on a level that\u2019s so subtle that you can\u2019t even perceive it. Who you are, is the consequence of the thoughts you\u2019ve adopted.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to realize this.\n\nIt\u2019s on the same level of breathing.\n\nYou realize your breath only if you pay attention. You realize your behavior and where it comes from only if you analyze it. But everything you are comes from the thoughts you\u2019ve once planted in your mind and then let them become a part of you.\n\nSo when you plant positive thoughts, you get positive results.\n\nWhen you plant love and happiness, your behavior will reflect love and it will create happiness for yourself and for others.\n\nWhen you plant thoughts of prosperity and wealth, your behavior will create wealth and prosperity in the world.\n\nThink of this like the captain of an airplane. An airplane is huge, carries hundreds of passengers and weighs tens of tons. Yet, you will find just one or two pilots in the cockpit, controlling this huge machine.\n\nSo is with your life.\n\nEven if your behavior is infinitely complex, there are just a few thoughts that control all of it and if you replace those thoughts, everything will change for you too.\n\nThe thoughts you plant in it will both manifest reality as in creating reality itself and shape your behavior to create the results you want.\n\nBoth are important.\n\nThis world is a 50 - 50 place.\n\nThe universe can manifest the opportunities you require at this moment but you must act to take advantage. If luck knocks at your door, you still need to open the door.\n\nIt\u2019s like in this old joke.\n\nA fisherman is caught up in a storm. His boat is sinking. Desperate, he prays to God.\n\n\u201cGod, please save me, I\u2019ll be good, I\u2019ll repent, just save me\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, a boat shows up.\n\n\u201cHi there, do you need any help?\u201d, the good Samaritan asks him.\n\n\u201cNo, no, God will save me\u201d, the fisherman answers.\n\nPerplexed, the savior leaves.\n\nTen minutes later, the same things happen. Another boat shows up. They offer to help him. The fisherman refuses saying that God will help him.\n\nEventually, the boat sinks, he dies and goes to heaven. There, face to face with God, he asks \u2026\n\n\u201cGod, why did you left me to die? I prayed to you and I promised I\u2019ll repent for my sins\u201d.\n\nGod looks at him and says \u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019ve sent you two boats\u201d.\n\nThis is a joke, but this is how life works too.\n\nWe manifest opportunities but you must take advantage of these opportunities. If you are a real estate agent and you want to close a huge deal, your thoughts will manifest this opportunity. The universe will align the people, places and circumstances for this to happen.\n\nBut these people, places and circumstances won\u2019t come to you in your living room. You must still act and do something.\n\nOr maybe you want to find the love of your life.\n\nThoughts of love and appreciation will manifest your ideal partner but your partner won\u2019t knock at the door and ask you for a date.\n\nThe universe is like a tree that offers you the fruits you need, in infinite abundance, but you still must grab those fruits from the tree.\n\nAnd it all starts with your thoughts, with your beliefs.\n\nMake a commitment now to fill your mind with positive thoughts. Make a commitment to think only thoughts of love and joy and wealth.\n\nAt first, it will be hard.\n\nIf you\u2019re used to plant only poison in your mind, it will take a while until you take it all out. But once you do, you\u2019ll notice something incredible happening. You\u2019ll see how you\u2019ll walk into the right circumstances. You\u2019ll find yourself in the right places, at the right time, to get what you want.\n\n**How can I help you do this?**\n\nManifestation Magic contains hidden NLP commands which act as seeds to plant in your subconscious mind.\n\nNLP is a powerful technology built around the best schools of psychotherapy and hypnosis. It allows you to \u201cprogram\u201d your subconscious mind - planting seeds into the fertile ground of your mind and heart.\n\nThis means you can listen to these tracks before going to sleep and change what you think, putting no effort at all.\n\nManifestation Magic always contains the best of brainwave entrainment, which trains the brain to operate at a higher frequency and is built around the Solfeggio scales, tones that will heal you and help you manifest miracles in your life.\n\nFeel free to inbox me for your free numerology readings......",

I feel like I just don't have the confidence of other people my age. \n\nJust a few examples off the top of my head:\n\nI can never tell anyone elses age. I'll look at a man who is muscular and has a full face of facial hair and I'll subconsciously put myself below him, then later on I'll find out that he's just a college kid or something. \nOr for example with women, I'll see a woman and think \"oh wow she's completely out of my league and so 'grown' [whatever the fuck that means lol], and then I'll find out again that she's just like a 21 year old or something. \n\nIdk. Typing this all out makes me feel kind of pathetic. I've got a degree, I've lived in foreign countries, I think I've got a good head on my shoulders... I just can't seem to shake this curse of looking like a child and the mental effects that come with it. The blushing easily, stammering, not speaking up for myself, letting other people have the final say, etc. I just can't help but feel like all these and more are symptoms of this pathology related to my appearance.",

I was minding my own business and didn't really try; probably because there were people who like to pick on me during elementary school, middle school, and high school. I never joined any clubs (until college) or participated in social activities (except summer camp). For most of my life, I had more acquaintances and little to no friends. I never had friends who hangs out on a daily basis and who contacts me first.\n\nI feel like the only way to make friends and get people to like me is by seeking approval, which is the last thing I would want to do. Does anyone know what exactly does it mean to seek approval? What are some examples (can be from your experiences) and how can I avoid them? Sorry if all of this sounds confusing.\n\nOne thing I would like to add that in recent years, I have joined professional groups and meetup groups and have met lots of people.

I was always an overachiever in school, honor student, perfect attendance, all that jazz. Then, when I got to college, I got REALLY into smoking pot. I had already been doing it for years at that point, but it was in college that I started to develop an addiction to it. I ended up finishing college just barely scraping by, doing the minimum, and ultimately not making the most of my opportunities, because all I cared about doing was getting high.\n\nNow, I've been out of college for about nine months and my life has basically been completely stagnant for that entire time. I haven't found a job, I'm living back at home with no income, no prospects, and starting to suffer from depression again. I'm about $60,000 in debt from student loans and feeling frankly overwhelmed at the prospect of trying to start a real life.\n\nI'm 23 days sober, waiting to be able to pass a drug test, and then hoping to find a job and start doing something I can be proud of. I've got a partner who wants to move in together, and the idea of finally being able to be independent and start a family with her is the motivation that keeps me going.\n\nI'm really looking for advice on finding a first job (I'm open to any job, not limiting myself to a job in my field, because I'm desperate), getting a first apartment or house, and starting to pay down my loans and become financially independent. My family aren't doing very well financially and I can tell it's becoming a burden on them to support me, so I'd like to stop expecting that. They're also all retired and getting older, and we don't get along very well, so I don't expect much help or support from them. My partner tells me how proud she is of the progress I've been making, specifically with sobriety, and I'd really like to keep this forward momentum going! Thanks in advance for any advice!",

My main after school hobby is gaming, and I'm really passionate about it, and have gotten some attention posting gaming content online. But I have two conflicting ideas about it. One being what my dad says \"it's a waste of time\" and one being \"people just don't like it because it's new.\" But I dislike putting it that way because I hate thinking of myself as a victim when I truly don't believe I am. I am a hard worker, I have a job already lined up for when I get a license, and I pick up work from someone in town who can't do hard work on their own. So I'm not the lazy stereotypical gamer. But I can't seem to grasp what exactly it is that I'm starving for. I also can't imagine getting a girlfriend would just magically fix it, because that just makes no sense. I have to imagine that it would help, but not be the whole equation. I don't think I'd be happy if I just dropped gaming and got a girlfriend, it would just be too artificial, if that makes sense. Has anybody had this experience and been able to find that extra something while continuing gaming, or is my dad right?",

I want to hike the pacific crest trail. \n\nMy friends on the other hand are not really like me. They are homebodies and pretty much scared/not confident enough to do any of these things.

I put in so much effort every week to go to their city using the metro whereas they rarely ever make the effort to come out to me. I understand their position though, they\u2019re still in school and another has a company that he\u2019s been nurturing. I see their perspectives.

It is the same old same old every time. I also feel like I put more effort into the friendship than they do.

No stable income as of yet. However, that's not what I'm too concerned about at the moment.\n\nI've been down in the rumps for a few months and I've noticed I'm in a cycle of extreme motivation for about a month or so, and then depressed for the next two or so months. The motivation comes at random; whether that be from watching an inspirational film, talking to someone, or a random idea pops into my head. I know discipline is more important than motivation, but my discipline comes in waves too. I go to the gym occasionally, hike, swim, read, hang out with friends once in a long while, work on creative projects, and spend time with family, but a lot of my time is usually spent in bed, thinking about all the things I should be doing. I know what I should be doing. But the tough part is getting up and doing it. I'm able to slowly start doing one task at a time until I'm being productive most of the day, sure, until that wave kicks in again and I'm back to where I started. I also notice I want to hang out with friends while at the same time I don't. If I'm invited somewhere, usually I'll lie and say I'm busy. But later on, I'll be saying to myself that I should hang out with some friends. I also believe I have anxiety. Extreme anxiety in crowds sometimes. But I've learned to ignore it most of the time, meaning that whenever I feel my anxiety overwhelming me I just say, \"fuck it, if I embarrass myself, so be it. I'm here already and I'll do the best I can in this situation but I'm not running away from it.\" However, the anxiety is still exhausting. \n\nMaybe someone has an idea of what I'm going through?

I'll try to keep this as simple as possible without overloading on details.\n\nHow do I get out of this hole I feel I'm in? In elementary, middle, and high school I was told I was gifted and that I was gonna cure cancer or some shit, and at the time it felt amazing. I never struggled grade wise and I truly thought I had it all figured out. My personal life was pretty dismal (I was molested, my grandpa who raised me died, literally was homeless because a house fire - high school was a shit show socially and mentally) I've always struggled with anxiety and depression pretty hardcore (been in therapy since I was 16, 20 now) but at least when I felt like I had nothing going for me, I had my grades. I had dreams of moving out of state, getting a degree, having an interesting job, and overall just proving that I could make something of my self. Then college hit. I moved out as soon as I graduated high school (I hated my home life) and started a local community college to get my basics done so I could transfer but things really really went wrong. All my self worth came from my grades so when I fell into a deep depression/got diagnosed with bipolar and I couldn't keep up with grades, it made me spiral even more. I got a job at a really shitty place to pay rent but it made my situation feel more hopeless. That winter break I barely even remember because all I did was work, drink, sleep with random people, repeat. I absolutely bombed that semester, failed almost everything. I tried to keep my head up and have a comeback the following one but I ultimately failed it too. I honest to god don't know what I want with my life. I fucked up. I feel so worthless, and it's not even logical to me why. I'm only 20 and I know things can/will get better but I'm scared that I'll never genuinely find something I'm passionate about - that I'll just be stuck floating job to job unhappy for the rest of my life or that I'll just end it all. It upsets me horribly that I \"didn't live up to my potential\". I just want to prove to myself that this isn't what life will be forever. Currently, I'm suspended for a semester but I think I really needed a break. I have no clue what I need/should do.

            "content": "Okay, so this is my first post in this community, and I'm not sure if this is the best way to let out what I got bottled up.  But if you guys are willing to bother looking at this I appreciate it.\n\nSo my backstory: I'm an only child born to a family of Mexican farmers. Born in America, first to graduate High School, going to be the first to graduate from a university.  I was kind of the weird kid, I was never really into many sports aside from MMA or Motorsports, and to top it off, I was more of a nerd than anything. And I suppose I was socially awkward as well. I was able to make friends and some fond memories, however. \n\nIn middle school, I was going in there hoping that things would go as smoothly as elementary. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before I was the target of a bully who was more a fan of belittling and verbally scathing insults that may have gotten me labeled as the \"loser\". Nonetheless, I made the best out of it and was still able to make friends. Although, that bully did leave me with an inferiority complex that has had me thinking that I'm not good enough for people, which unfortunately went on into high school.\n\nFreshman year of High School was nightmare fuel for me as I barely fit in and two other bullies had no trouble making my general existence feel insignificant. To make things worse, people who I thought were my friends had no trouble piling on. I did transfer to another school before sophomore year which was way smaller but with nicer people and was immediately magnitudes better than the previous one. One of the teachers even got me into Photoshop in one of his classes, which led to me studying a Graphic Design degree. So, not all that bad!\n\nAnyways, it was mainly due to these bullies that I've had this sense of self-loathing, non-existent confidence & disgust with myself, which led to me being a self-indulgent, overeating, lazy, pathetic slob of a human being as a consequence. \n\nEver since Senior year, I had the horrible realization about this which hit me like a semi T-boning me at 90 mph. I've been trying to lose weight, mainly by lowering my portions on my plates and cardio, mainly jogging. So far, gone from 230 to 205 lbs. (as of the time of this post). Though, I still have a lot of belly fat and practically no arm muscles. It doesn't help the fact that one of those 3 bullies had no trouble calling me a \"weakass\" when I was struggling moving an old gum vending machine (the type with the stand) to prop a classroom door which has led to me having an obsession to getting more physically fit ever since. \n\nAlso, the hometown that I was born and raised in: not the best place to live your entire life in. So my family has helped me find a place 40 minutes north of where I used to live and it's much better than where I was. If anything, I'm willing to do anything to not move back to my hometown. Hell, I've stayed in little contact with people from there as possible. Not all of them are bad, but I'm sure they're all trying to grow up or are still the same type of people. I do stay in contact with people who have done well for themselves since high school though and I tend to be on good terms with them.\n\nSo, I recently turned 22, last semester of college (thankfully), and trying to finish my time there on a high note. However, I can't seem to get the motivation to do an amazing job in what I'm studying, which is Web Development.  I seem to be better at digital and graphic design, despite trying to improve myself in programming.  Also, I've been trying to get over my horrible attitude as I also realized that I've had little to show for my time in college, despite having some good projects under my portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, I'm even struggling to get my overall act together in order to prove to my family that I can hold my own and live independently. With my mother who has retired a long time ago (due to reasons I won't go into) and my father going into retirement soon after working in construction for so long, it's time that I got myself together. They do have faith in me, as I've usually been a smart kid academic-wise. It just seems to be my attitude that's holding me back as well as fear of the future. \n\nI've seen videos by people like Dean Graziosi, Gary Vee, Jim Kwik, Stefan Arnio and others like them, but I can't seem to get into the habit of using the advice that they give. \n\nSo TLDR: first-generation pressure, inferiority complex, low-self esteem in my skills, & toxic lifestyle due to bullies, desperately trying to improve myself in more ways than one, and fearful of my future post-graduation. \n\nSo, if anyone bothered to go through that ordeal of a post: What do you think and what should I do?",

We didn't make a lot of money and I didn't have an opportunity to experience many new things in life.  I decided when I turned 30, and life was more stable, that I would try the new things! It was a wild ride\u2026\n\n1. Zip-lining tree-top obstacle course. It\u2019s call Tree-Top Adventure Park in Tahoe if anyone was close enough to check that out. It was wildly exhilarating, horrifying, and super fun!\n\n2. Dancing at a nightclub in the city. \n\n3. Drag show!\n\n4. Explored my bisexuality on a weekend trip with a girl crush. \n\n5. Drove a jet-ski!\n\n6. Camped out without toilets or running water. \n\n7. Joined a hiking group and explored with new friends. \n\n8. Hiked to the top of Mt. Lassen\n\n9. Floated in a tube down a river in Montana. \n\n10. Hiked to the top of Castle Crags! \n\n11. Checked out a Renaissance faire. \n\n12. Applied to and got accepted to nursing school. \n\n13. Ended a very toxic longterm friendship for my own mental health. \n\n14. Saw my favorite artist in concert and cried the whole time. \n\n15. Pierced my nipples. OUCH!\n\n16. Went from blonde to the silver/grey hair I always wanted but everyone advised me against\u2026 and loved it!\n\n17. Walked on a frozen lake. \n\n18. Drank and danced on a rooftop bar in San Francisco. \n\n19. Took my daughter to see her idol, Jojo Siwa in concert. \n\n20. Tattooed on my eyebrows! (5 years of wanting to and finally having the courage to do it!)\n\n21. Dyed my hair electric purple! Another long term hair goal of mine that I never did because of work\u2026 Finally said eff it! \n\n22. SHAVED my head because my hair was fried! Love that bald feeling! \n\n23. Ate at an authentic French-Creole restaurant, live street style music and amazing beignets! \n\n24. Marched in my first Women\u2019s March.\n\n25. Stopped eating meat. \n\n26. Lip Synched and danced on stage with some girl-friends. \n\n27. Visited a Buddhist monastery. \n\n28. Finally made the call to start going to therapy in order to heal from my past.\n\n29. Stopped drinking alcohol because I realized I had a problem with binging. \n\n30. Started an anxiety medication at the suggestion of my therapist so that therapy is more effective.\n\nIn short- I spent way too much money, I drank way too much, I learned a lot about myself but at the same time I was still using all of this as a way to not deal with painful parts of my past. I am much happier now that the partying has died down but I am happy that I made lots of memories. I\u2019ve made it my 2020 goal to heal as much as I can before I embark on my nursing school journey.",

I guess I do want this, I would love to contribute to the second space race and become an aerospace engineer working on rockets, it is one of my biggest dreams, or at least I think it is. I find a lot of times that I lose all motivation to do anything. Maybe I have these dreams just because I've been told all my life that I am destined to become an engineer? Or maybe I don't have any motivation because of a lack of self commitment and discipline? I'm not really sure, and it really confuses me.\n\nI am part of a high school robotics team, and I love it, but outside of it I have trouble getting anything done, even stuff that I am interested in. I would love to do so many things, but weeks go by and I am no closer to accomplishing anything.\n\nI recognize that I have these problems, and every once in a while I will try and come up with a plan to become better, to solve my problems, but nothing ever seems to work. Nothing I do puts me out of this self misery. No matter how hard I try, nothing breaks this loop. The most successful I have been was at the beginning of this year when I decided that the new decade would be like the ultimate new year's resolution time, and my robotics team had a competition soon. We had a meeting every day of the week, and I ended up being very productive for two whole weeks before the weekend of the competition. It felt amazing, probably the best I've ever felt for that long a period. But then, as always, it all fell apart. I have tried all sorts of things in the past, like meditation, bullet journaling, to do list apps, reading daily, getting more sleep, etc.\n\nI am tired of trying over and over again, with nothing ever working. I feel powerless, like there is literally no way for me to get better. I don't know what to do anymore. I need to try something different, but I don't know what that is. I want this to stop. I can't stand it any more. If I can't figure out a solution soon, I fear I may just give up, and embrace the failure that I feel I am headed towards.\n\nPlease help me, I beg you. I am willing to try most anything. I realize that there are hundreds of people on this sub with their own issues seeking answers too, so any help is extremely appreciated.\n\nTl;Dr: I have a huge amount of trouble with motivation and self discipline, nothing I try seems to fix my problem, I need to try something different. Anything helps.",

            "content": "Hi All,\n\nI'm just looking for some advice on my situation. I graduated from college a few months ago. Been working freelance on and off in the entertainment industry. No stable income as of yet. However, that's not what I'm too concerned about at the moment.\n\nI've been down in the rumps for a few months and I've noticed I'm in a cycle of extreme motivation for about a month or so, and then depressed for the next two or so months. The motivation comes at random; whether that be from watching an inspirational film, talking to someone, or a random idea pops into my head. I know discipline is more important than motivation, but my discipline comes in waves too. I go to the gym occasionally, hike, swim, read, hang out with friends once in a long while, work on creative projects, and spend time with family, but a lot of my time is usually spent in bed, thinking about all the things I should be doing. I know what I should be doing. But the tough part is getting up and doing it. I'm able to slowly start doing one task at a time until I'm being productive most of the day, sure, until that wave kicks in again and I'm back to where I started. I also notice I want to hang out with friends while at the same time I don't. If I'm invited somewhere, usually I'll lie and say I'm busy. But later on, I'll be saying to myself that I should hang out with some friends. I also believe I have anxiety. Extreme anxiety in crowds sometimes. But I've learned to ignore it most of the time, meaning that whenever I feel my anxiety overwhelming me I just say, \"fuck it, if I embarrass myself, so be it. I'm here already and I'll do the best I can in this situation but I'm not running away from it.\" However, the anxiety is still exhausting.\n\nMaybe someone has an idea of what I'm going through? Any advice would be much appreciated.",

            "content": "so, last year the apartment I lived got sold, in the middle of my semester at the university and with one month tops to find another place. it was very difficult to get by, and by the time I had to deliver the apartment I still had no place to go. I lived with my best friend for a while and it was the first time I actually had to do all by my own - no money and no car, so I moved all my stuff by hand. I had to find and get the necessary to rent a place. with no help from my family, while working and studying.\nit was tough but I got passed this. I moved to a nice apartment with two colleagues from the university whom I just kinda knew but were friends of all my friends.\nfinding this place was the most stressful thing I ever had to face, but I feel like I've never been more stressed to have to deal with one of my roomates.\ndespite the mysogyny he thinks is normal (even tho he is an organized leftist) by doing NONE of his domestic duties, he has the most disfunctional relationship I have ever seen and it's just impossible to have a single conversation about house responsabilities. \nfirst of all, his girlfriend is on our wpp group about daily house stuff. and no, she doesn't live here. but she surely thinks she does, because everyday she needs to be a total asshole on her opinions about our house. \nshe is the kind of person who has never received truths to her face because everytime you say 'no' to her, she goes on twitter to say she's killing herself and it's all *someones* fault. so, she has a free pass on life to be a total jerk because she lives on mind games and narcissism. \nI could go on all day about how they are driving me insane, but the thing I'd really like to get an insight on is: I'm a f$cking empath medium, and even though at this moment I have a much bigger control on how I feel things, I still feel a deep effect based on my environment. \nI'm a very direct and down-to-earth person and dialogues have always bern my basis for healthy human interactions, but having people around who absolutely takes a defensive approach and transforms every. single. thing. into a thunderstorm has really affected me. I am constantly stressed, even though I'm in a self improvement journey and returning to good habits like meditation, getting out of social media, slow cooking, eating healthy and back to running, they grew on me and I just keep accepting when they run away from talking because I'm too annoyed and it wouldn't be productive. \nI just want a way to block them enough so I can think straight about how to talk to them, because the more I talk to our mutual friends the more I know they really live on mind games and manipulating people because they are very spoiled by their parents, and I just really want these people away from me but not by being too agressive.",

            "content": "***How to make yourself better?***\n\nHave you ever thought why; We often feel depressed and confused why? We don\u2019t know what we should do or what we want to achieve why? We often give control of our life and allow others to make decisions for us and make ourselves dependent on others why? Why we usually make mistakes in choosing our profession or line of our study? All of these things happen to us because we don\u2019t know who we are what we are capable of and what we want to become. What are our strengths and weaknesses we don\u2019t know? We live a long life for almost 60 years and we don\u2019t know what we want, what want to become and in the last days of our lives we have regrets that if I had not listened to him I would have achieved this or that. How we can deal with all these common problems of our lives, there is a simple one-line answer \u201cLOVE YOURSELF\u201d.***How self-love will make us appease and contented***\n\nIf a person wants to be loved he should start loving himself because if he doesn\u2019t love himself how could he expect from others that they are going to love him. A person should love himself to make himself better.\n\n* **First of all, to love yoursel**f you should know about yourself. He should spend some time thinking about what he wants and want he wants to become instead of thinking what others want him to become. If you listen to yourself and do what you want to do or choose the profession according to your abilities instead of other's expectations; it will make you appease and content because you are making decisions for yourself. We have only one life and we should not waste it in regrets and unfulfilled wishes. We should do in which we are best and should know about what we want. We should start thinking about ourselves what we could do best and what we can\u2019t do.\n* **Secondly, you should star**t thinking about how you could turn your weaknesses into your strengths. You will do that because when we love someone we only want best for him/her. So you should love yourself to be proud of yourself. You should make yourself better to make your loved ones proud of you.\n* **The third and most importan**t thing you should love yourself to make yourself better and not a self-conceited, self -obsessed and arrogant person. You should be aware when you are doing wrong so that you could turn your wrongdoings in the right ones.\n\nHave you ever thought why mothers in our community are mostly depressed, angry and dissatisfied? Do you know the reason? The reason is a lack of self-love and self-importance. Our mothers spend their whole lives in making their family happy. No doubt it is satisfactory for them to see their family happy and appease but the reason for depression and anger is their unfulfilled desires and dreams that they had sacrificed to make others happy. Their sacrifices make them happy but also fill them with bitterness because deep down in their heart they still have desires and dreams that they want to achieve. How they can deal with this situation without becoming selfish? There is a simple and one-word answer \u201cBALANCE\u201d. The beauty of life is the name of balance. if our mothers create balance and stop avoiding themselves and try to make themselves happy with their family or also add themselves in the list of people which they want to happy than their depression reduces to a great extent and they will not think they have wasted their life and do nothing for themselves. \n\n***How a person can love himself? And turn his wrongs in the rightness*** Now the question is how a person can love himself? A person should think about how much he is blessed. If he has a complete and healthy body he should thankful to Allah and love himself. He should love himself for the people they are attached to him or dependent on him he should think that how much importance my God has me and bless me with a family that loves me and should love himself. He should think about the abilities or specialties that he is blessed with and love himself. if he thinks he is an average or useless person than he should think even though he is average or useless how important he is for his family and starting to love himself so that he could make himself better for his loved ones. If a person thinks he is imperfect he should think how imperfectly perfect he is for his parents, children, and friends and love himself. \n\nIf a person think he is useless and is depressed for the fact that he can\u2019t provide a perfect and luxurious life for his family than he should think about the parents that can\u2019t provide two ends meal to their children\u2019s and be thankful to Allah for his blessings on him and love himself and try to work harder for his family. Sometimes you hate yourself because of your wrongdoings you think that the sin you have committed is not forgiven able and you are too ashamed to face the person to whom you have hurt and started to punish yourself by ignoring yourself or by bearing unnecessary pain or doing things that you don\u2019t like you do all these things to satisfy your conscious and think you deserve this pain is this pattern of thinking is right? No, this is not the right way to think to satisfy your're conscious. Because your pain can\u2019t provide relief to the person whom you have hurt it will only bring misery to your family who loves you a lot. So first you have to forgive yourself and then try hard to earn the forgiveness from the person how is hurt. It might take time but if you are **sincere then it will surely work.**\n\nSometimes we are insecure and jealous of others, these others can be our siblings, cousins, college\u2019s and classmates who are performing better than us and when we think we can\u2019t be successful like them we try to drag them down from their position by using wrong or immoral practices. Instead of being a wrong and jealous person we can make them or their success our source of motivation and inspiration, we can think like that if he can perform good I can also do the same. But if you don\u2019t succeed in spite of your hard work than you should accept that you are not as good as him in this field and think about the tasks that you can perform better than him and try to flourish that abilities and work hard so that we can also achieve success. So what it is not in the same field but success is success and it makes you confident and happy especially when it is achieved through the right decisions and own abilities instead of despicable ways and manipulation of others.\n\n **We can turn our wrongs in rightness only if we know we are wrong.** for that we have to make our self our judge, we should think clearly in an unbiased manner and we should be honest with ourselves and accept our faults and failures instead of blaming our failure on others in the same way we accept and took credit of our successes only than we can be a better human being who have the guts to accept failure to turn it into a success. \n\n**A person should love himself because he also has a right on himself as others have right on him. It is his right to think about himself and try to fulfill his dreams. If he knows about himself he will be more confident and successful because he is well aware of his capabilities. People who love and took care of themselves and do their best to realize their dreams live a happy and contented life.**",

            "content": "26m on LI, NY...Long read but TL:DR things were going well, psychiatry knocked me into a state of PTSD where I\u2019m more lost & confused than ever before. Trying to figure out how to move forward with life after I feel like the ground collapsed underneath me.\n\nThrough high school and college I dealt with intense anxiety/depression (primarily social anxiety and consequential depression) then the panic attacks started, so I intervened. I went to a psychiatrist, who after an hour meeting threw me on Zoloft and Klonopin (the tranquilizer that\u2019s knocked Jordan Peterson off his feet). Things subjectively began improving- I kept my grades up, and for the first time I was actively engaging my tiny social life and trying to take advantage, things were looking up, had my first mini relationship. I kept my grades up (graduated with a 3.5). \n\nUpon graduating gave myself a little bit of a break after years of hard work because I was starting to feel burnt out. However with my newfound numbed social anxiety and newly prescribed adhd meds I decided to start a business (drone photography). I had little success in the beginning but concurrently got my MBA so I figured if I fail I have that to fall back on.\n\nAbout a year out of school had a bit of success networking at least, though any money I made with the business went right back into it as I tried to scale with no real concrete direction. I would just fly drones for whoever wanted to pay me. This continues as I finished my MBA program, I figured I\u2019d finally figure out the direction of my business and scale from there. \n\nBy about the spring of 2018 had an investor/mentor lined up who wanted to help me a bit. I still wasn\u2019t making any real money with the business (nothing I could save- don\u2019t come from money so I was working on a shoestring budget). Around this time I started having really negative cognitive side effects kicking in, I first suspected it was the adhd med, but turns out it may have been much more menacing. This continued to get worse and I was beginning to get really confused, anxiety was actually growing despite me increasing dose of Klonopin (as that was the psychiatrists first move...). I had to put the brakes on the business a little and figure out what was going on. But just as I had done that the Long Island railroad had reached out looking for me to do mapping for their ongoing construction project, something that I could\u2019ve built the rest of the business around. I was having meetings with the LIRR, making plans for this huge project that would ultimately make my previous years efforts a success and be able to grow off of that one big contract..\n\nBy about the summer of 2018 that original psychiatrist had left and I had to find a new one. Joined a local university hopistals inpatient psych program and was given a psych pretty fresh out of school. She dismissed most of my concerns in a slightly condescending way, but then decided it was the Dexedrine that was making me more anxious and that the klonopin was causing issues as well. I then did a bit of a rapid taper (she told me to go at what was comfortable, I didn\u2019t really feel much so I just went ahead) and 2 weeks later I was off the klonopin and Dexedrine. \n\nThings began to slow down immensely and my anxiety, depression and existential angst multiplied in an unfathomable manner. I had the shakes, what they call akathesia, endless suicidal rumination, self loathing, and despair for what seemed like an eternity. I had to put hard brakes on the business because I couldn\u2019t answer the phone or even a text or email without having a panic attack or gut wrenching anxiety. I couldn\u2019t even leave the house. The psychiatrist had the gall to claim benzo withdrawal should only last two weeks, so she put me on a higher dose of Zoloft. My opinion of her practice continued to deteriorate just as my condition had hit rock bottom. I could\u2019ve gone back on to Klonopin yes, but I figured it wouldn\u2019t last too long right? Wrong, 6 months later I had still made little progress even getting out of the house, struggling doing anything but watching television, reading audiobooks, playing video games and toking weed just to help keep my mind out of the endless pain. Oh and hitting the gym constantly thankfully helped...\n\nThis point in my life became a crater I haven\u2019t been able to claw my way out of. I was conflicted and wanted to continue my business but anxiety-wise things were *slowly* getting better but nowhere near fast enough. The depression has all but returned in full as I hit the one year mark. I had some progress in the spring and summer of 2019 as I learned to meditate and center myself a bit. I went back on adhd med in July \u201819 and got myself a local, pretty low paying IT job. \n\nNow 26, living with my parents, job I don\u2019t want a career in... 16 months post acute Klonopin withdrawal, tapering off Zoloft now for 8 months because I think that\u2019s had side effects I haven\u2019t fully been aware of. Yes things are maybe slightly better than a year ago but not much has changed. I still have not much saved to leave the house (oh and I didn\u2019t mention the $60k in student fucking loans my parents let me take out when I had no sense of money.). The suicidality has kinda increased, mostly as I got off my adhd med again as it was exhausting but will prob go back on just to stabilize.\n\nI\u2019m now confused, memory issues, planning issues, a whole host of problems I hadn\u2019t had back in college when everything felt simple. I\u2019m  struggling to find direction, fighting crippling depression most days, spend WAY too much time thinking the same thoughts over and over and over again it\u2019s like a nightmare version of Groundhog Day. I\u2019ve been going to CBT since mid\u201918 when the shit hit the fan but I feel like the depression continues to win me over. I still workout every day but now my existence is mundane IT work, gym, eat, sleep repeat. \n\nI\u2019m hoping as I get back on my adhd med, continue meditating every day, I\u2019ll summon the energy to apply for jobs in NYC doing some sort of business analyst/product analyst/marketing analyst kind of thing where I can at least feel my years of kicking my ass at school we\u2019re worth it because right now it seems like 5 years and 100k worth of debt complete waste and the worst mistake of my life. \n\nWriting this here is a little cathartic, and I hate to paint such a bleak picture, I\u2019m becoming more aware of my negative patterns of thought but it feels so much slower than the general population. I again feel like an outsider looking in, the world goes on without me and I continue to wallow in an infinite stasis.",

            "content": "I see a lot of posts on here about people trying to avoid the 9-5. They want to only work a few hours a day and still make ok money in order to live. Well, I'm the opposite of this. I'll preface by saying that I used to work a 9-5 for a long time so I get the rat-race and feeling chained to something you're not passionate about. About 3 years ago I broke off and decided to pursue art full time. I love my job and while I love the freedom of a flexible schedule, I also feel inadequate a lot of the time.\n\nI go to therapy and we've discussed a lot of my upbringing and how it shapes my current mental state. My family is very \"successful\" on paper. Two lawyers, two doctors, big time number analysts, basically just overachievers to the max and all have had to go through extensive secondary education programs and accrue debt in order to work in their fields. Therefore, the idea that there is nobility in suffering is a huge theme in my family and I'm aware of how that definitely affects me in my day to day. All of my friends and family work a \"9-5\" and are able to connect with each other on a level that I cant (ie complaining about their bosses/coworkers, requesting time off, etc) and ultimately I end up feeling lazy and isolated. I should be proud of the fact that I'm able to live comfortably on my skills AND not work all day every day, but ultimately it just feels like I'm not doing enough because I haven't suffered through anything to get here.\n\nMy job involves large-scale projects with installations ranging from 2-4 weeks at a time, and then I dont work for a few weeks in between projects while I gear up for the next one (prepping during these weeks, but only for a few hours a day). Because of this, theres a lot of days where I sleep in, work whenever I want to, stay in my PJs until noon, and spend time with my hobbies. I know that some people will probably read this as me complaining about my \"first world problems\" but it's not as glamorous as it sounds. I'm stressed about money a lot of the time and the entirety of my business falls on me and is my responsibility.  When I used to work a 9-5 I would dream about this life but now that I'm here, it fucks with my head even more. So I guess I just wanted to post on here and see if anyone else not working the traditional 9-5 has problems with this mindset as well and see if anyone has any advice for how to deal with it?",

I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019ve spent a big part of my life living unconsciously, letting it simply pass. My biggest issues are that I\u2019m lonely and I don\u2019t feel like doing anything.\n\nI\u2019m a loner since my parents divorced, when I was 14. I\u2019ve gotten along with most of my classmates back in school, but I\u2019ve never managed to make friends, which is still the case now. I started to do nothing except of learning in my free time. It distracted me from being alone and I became one of the best students (at least on paper). It was like a game in which I was rewarded with good grades, so overall, I wasn\u2019t unhappy or dissatisfied at the time. But I felt lost and got depressed, after school ended.\n\nThis similarly went on at university. I got along with a couple of my colleagues, but after a while everyone has noticed that I basically had nothing to offer. I had nothing to talk about, as I\u2019ve had no real experiences in the past and I also didn\u2019t have an interesting character. My mental well-being got gradually worse, so I had to quit my studies about three months ago, in November. I simply couldn\u2019t concentrate anymore, because of my state.\n\nI\u2019m feeling like this for a couple of years now and don\u2019t know what to do. I feel numb, down and empty, and I\u2019m scared by the fact, that my life might be just beginning, at the age of 26. I can\u2019t get a job because in my condition I can\u2019t convince someone to hire me. I\u2019ve got no one to talk, to hang out with etc. No skills, no hobbies, no personality, nothing.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m not very enthusiastic about changing. I don\u2019t feel like going out or doing anything. It also seems to be too much for me to handle and at the end all the effort might be pointless as nothing might change. But there is this very subtle feeling deep inside, that I have to do something.\n\nWhat can I do? Where do I start?\n\nYou might suggest that I should obviously finish my studies and I'm planning to do so eventually, but it seems like there is a lot more to do, maybe even before that.",

However, I'm kind of lacking vision and direction.\nI got into pick-up about six month ago or so, which I actually enjoyed the process off. but can't really keep doing it right now, because I just don't want to have sex. (This is most likely a psychological thing, or just normal fluctuation in libido, but this is a topic for another post really)\n\nRight now the main thing I'm doing is studying to get to med-school, with the entrance exam in about 3 months. I also have a band going on, and am trying to work on my social skills, as there is some nonsense going on with this for sure. \n\nThe problem I have is that I'm not really sure about this med-school thing. I know I'd be able to get there if I just properly set my mind to it, but I just don't know if I should. The reason I'd want to be a doctor is basically for the paycheck tbh. I don't really have much interest in the job itself, but neither does it repel me. I have a vague interest in nutrition, however.\nBut I can't think of anything better for me either. I'm pretty good at guitar, and that's something I really like to do, but can't see a way to make it into an occupation, nor do I know if I'd want to either.\nOne thing I'd like to achieve is a lot of money, and of course being a doctor is a certain way to have some, but probably not something to make me properly rich. \nI'd love to have a clear life vision, and am trying to keep my eyes open for inspiration, but right now inspiration is exactly what I'm lacking.\nIf I believe something is just a positive thing to do in my life, that's basically enough for me to do it consistently, and this works with things like meditation, eating healthy and hitting the gym. \nWhere I struggle however, is making an exclusive choice like picking a profession.\nWhat I'd really love to do at some point would be being a life coach of some sort, maybe spiritual, maybe financial or whatever I could offer, but obviously I'll have to go get a few decades of life experience first before I'm in any position to do this. \n\nSo in essence I'm asking, should I just push it and go to med school regardless of my uncertainty, or does someone have some other idea?\n\nAny other kind of insight on my life situation from an outside perspective will be appreciated as well.

            "content": "I'm in a bit of a sticky situation right now that I have put myself in. A little background I was living with my parents until I was 18, when living there I was severely depressed and wanted a change in my life as I felt I wasn't really experiencing much as I would just stay in my room all day most of the time. So when I turned 19 I packed up and moved to Oregon where my friend was living and going to school for. The original plan was I would get a job immediately and then enroll in school as soon as possible. Our first mistake was getting an apartment that was WAY out of our budget. It was a downtown apartment charging 1600 a month for rent. I look back and simply have no idea how we thought we would make that work out but I suppose it was just the excitement of living in downtown that made us make this terrible decision. So there we were, both unemployed living in an apartment we couldn't possibly afford. We did manage to both get jobs as dishwashers within the first month and we did manage to make it work (literally ALL of our money went to rent and as much groceries as we could afford). This apartment was super nice but the entire time we were staying there the only furniture we had were 2 secondhand couches and our floor mattresses. Anyways, in this time my depression subsided a bit as even though I was super poor I was making new friends and experiencing fun new things. This would last until I met a girl that I thought I really liked but would actually turn out to be a very negative person in my life. When me and my friends lease was up we could have found a new place in a less expensive part of town and we could have made it work. Instead, I decided to rent an apartment with this girl that I had known for maybe 2 months (I was super alone and desperate for female companionship at the time) in a super remote part of town that was a good 40 minute drive from everyone I had come to known in my previous year of being in Oregon. Long story short, the girl moved out after 2 months because she was fired and wasn't able to afford rent anymore. Now I am living with a random roommate who is a cool guy but I don't really hang out with him or anything. My area is a very low income neighborhood with not many people I would like to associate myself with (lots of drug addicts and I myself am dealing with my own addictions) so I find it extremely hard to even leave the house. I have stopped talking to a lot of my friends and I have gone back to a very dark state of depression. I have been in this apartment for close to a year now and I just want to get the fuck out but I have no idea how. My lease doesn't end for another couple months and I don't even have anyone I can move in with afterwards. I am finding it increasingly hard to motivate myself to do anything and have found myself back in my room and on the computer for most of my time. I am still working as a dishwasher and even though I really like my coworkers I am finding myself extremely unhappy with my actual job. I thought I wanted to move up into being a cook eventually but seeing some of the shit they have to put up with has kind of dissuaded me. I'm planning on attending community college (both to try and get a sense of what I want my future to be as well as to meet new people) soon but I have to reteach myself math and cannot find the motivation to do so. So my main problem is an overwhelming sense of isolation and mundanity. I'm 20 now and constantly have thought about how I'm wasting my life. If anyone has been in a similar situation or believes they can offer me some advice it would be much appreciated.",

I've done mock interviews, got my resume and cover letter help with professionals, talking with a therapist, and I've even looked into going back to school to see what exactly I'd like to get into but...\n\nAll it's done is making me want to curl into a ball and scream into the void.

Now I work and I'm finding the skillset doesn't transfer.  I have some big brain process improvements and can understand how to do the most difficult of the tasks on my team, but I struggle with focus.  I'll split an hour between my phone and my work.  And while I get more than enough work done (we are monitored for productivty), I know I have the potential to rise above and be exceptional and get a promotion to my career job.  I also find myself making careless errors and being forgetful.  How can I develop my focus at work so I can apply my academic potential and be more accurate? \n\nProblem 2: I get anxiety about work at home.  Quite a bit.  Too the point where I'm up late at night because the worry is making me restless.  I'm worried I'm doing something wrong and no one has told me and I'm going to get fired.  I'm worried the my lack of focus has been noticed and I could get in trouble.  I'm worried I'm not learning new tasks as much as I'm wanted to and that'll get me in trouble.  This anxiety is harming my social life and my hobbies, as I actively try to avoid weeknight commitments past 8 PM so I don't fuck up at work the next day (this was a contributing factor in my last relationship falling apart, as she wanted me to spend time with her on weeknights super late and I was too afraid to). How do I leave the workplace anxiety at workplace?",

I've been using taking care of my grandmother as an excuse not to get a job, but I'm not even there all the time since my aunt and uncle come over when I'm not there. I keep seeing on social media how a lot of my highschool friends have their lives put together, they either have a good job, or are doing well in college and I keep looking at that and saying, \"Why can't that be me?\" I even compare myself to my brother who had a job at 16, and bought his own car. I want/need to get a job, but I have no clue how to go about it. I was the leader of my high school drumline but that's pretty much the extent of things I could put on my application. I have not next to skills, besides probably being able to work my way around a computer. I've applied to a few places online, but haven't gotten a reply.

About 5 months ago, I finally moved to New York with the opportunity to go after my goals, however I'm REALLY struggling with a particular fear that is eating me alive: that I'm \"too late\" or starting off disadvantaged. thinking about these three past years during which my peers have had all of this time to progress in their lives, while I've been home, has me feeling paralyzed. Like I'm behind, or have insurmountable ground to cover to catch up. Or more specifically, that all of my comedy idols began THEIR careers around 22-23, and here I am 4 years later not having started, despite thinking about it for years. I recognize that this is probably irrational. I know there's nothing I can do to change the past, but for some reason I can't get over this crippling idea that because I'm starting \"later\", I'll never achieve the type of success that the people who started earlier in their lives have achieved. It absolutely consumes me and I desperately need to get over it, and move on. I'm just wondering if you guys have any advice or thoughts you'd like to provide. Thanks!",

            "content": "I have always known that I am a little selfish, naturally since I was an infant. Always putting my needs first before anyone else's. I don't know if it helps to mention that I am a Leo (if you are into Astrology, you would know that's our biggest flaw, although most of my chart is Virgo)... Anyway, I am 28 and in the last couple of years I have come to a lot of self-realizations, which the vast majority are very negative. And in the past few days, I realized about two things:1. We have to work hard to achieve happiness, 2. I am more selfish than I thought. These two were very important because they are both connected, just like everything in life is (I watched a video called the Antidote to Dissatisfaction) that made me connect those two points). The fact that I am so selfish, is making me worried that perhaps I will never be happy, or that happiness is going to be 10x harder for me to achieve than the average person. Here's why I am saying this:\n\nI am lazy, I do have a job but I do not move at the speed of my other coworkers (I think about things too much before taking action), and I am always wishing everything was easier. I am partly unsatisfied with my job because I do not make as much money as I want, we have a short staff, and we have way too much to do... Although I am grateful that I have a very small commute in the same city I live in.\n\nI mention gratitude because this is something that I am trying to practice. It is easy to forget when I am too busy worrying, complaining about how I always want or wish for things to be BETTER. I am trying to see the good side of things, although there's moments in which I get too involved with angry or sad thoughts and it's tough for me to see clear... I'm also full of fear.\n\nFor the longest time, I was a very judgmental person and now I am trying to see the good on people, because we all have flaws... Yet I sometimes catch myself wishing for people to fail, particularly those who hurt me and who seem to not care about me. I am wondering if this is envy? Or more like a projection about the fact that I myself feel like a failure? I have a degree that I am honestly not using and I always wished I had actually pursued my interests, because all my energetic passion went to waste during my early twenties in bad relationships... Heck, I wished I had spent more time cultivating my friendships.\n\nGoing back to the selfish issue: I guess I am not a giving person. Today this thought crossed my mind: I don't like people to give me things because then that means I am going to have to give them back.\" Wow, right?!? How can I think like this? Supposedly I value my time more than anything in the world, but where is my time even going?\n\nI am kind, but even the other day someone said that I am \"fake nice.\" Am I trying too hard? There are a lot of moments in which I do not even know how should a person be. I hang out with diverse peers to see how they behave, since I am different in depending on the environment I am in, and I do not like that! It makes me feel I am not genuine... I want to be equanimous regardless the people, day, or situation.\n\nI have a few close friendships who I really appreciate and who care about me, I am able to pay my bills, I practice hobbies here and there, recently decided to take an evening class to keep me even busier... But here I go again: what I have is not enough, I feel I am not grateful for the opportunities I have, that. things. could. always. be. BETTER. I do not like playing the comparison game, but I feel so frustrated... Sometimes I feel there's not a lot I am skilled at.\n\nI recently broke off a romantic relationship with a great guy because I got turned off by his neediness and clinginess... I consider myself to be a little more independent, like I need my space, although to be honest I had my doubts because I felt he wasn't my type of attractive... I feel like I am a horrible person at times.\n\nI have practiced meditation, I have started waking up earlier... Some things help. But I feel like I have commitment issues.\n\nSomeone please help. Are there any older adults who are now successful (not necessarily rich, but happy, healthy, loved and doing good) who felt this way when they were my age and were able to grow out of it or had an actual awakening or something? I am worried about myself. How can I feel motivated or actually have willpower? To feel legitimately GRATEFUL without always thinking things could be better and without keeping it to the binary that things could be worse too? I need comforting, but realistic advice.",

The healthy eating part is easier as my diet is great and I have followed the keto way of eating for a few years on and off so can get back into it pretty easily. But the fitness part is hard. I HATE exercise! I don't mind walking but not a fan of anything beyond that. My local gym does fitness classes and as much as I'm trying to tell myself that I will attend every day, based on past experience, I'm not sure if I will. I just don't enjoy it.\nI'd love to learn to love exercise and a 4 week paid break is just the right time to do it. I'd hate to feel like I have squandered it.\n\nMy question is, has anyone else hated exercise but ended up loving it ( or at least not hating it) and setting a good habits around it? I don't mind spending some money but it needs to be things that are on during the week day as I have a husband and a tween daughter that need me in the evenings and that's probably what has prevented me joining some Zumba type session, which is probably where my comfort levels lie. \n\nJust keen to hear how others have approached it. I guess as a slightly related topic, I live in NZ and it's a very hot summer here at the moment. So walks are only pleasant first thing in the morning or late evening. I have considered learning how to surf which will provide some exercise and can be done on a hot day outside but still deciding if that's what I want to do.\n\nI don't need to lose loads of weight, maybe only 5 kgs.

I had gone down the block with my wife and him, they - going on a stroll, me - just to buy eggs from the nearby shop. \n\nWhen he figured out I was going on a walk with them, and when I heard myself say \"daddy's gotta go back to work\" - words I say by habit nowadays - he burst out in tears, refusing to let go. And I almost did the same. \n\nWifey is very supportive, he hugged him and said \"leave daddy alone, he really needs to go baby...\" while I released myself from his grip and turned around as quickly as I possibly can.

You finish college, you search for some \"temporary\" job, and become an admin in some corporation. I don't know if it's common, but by the time I finished my masters' (tourism) I hated the industry so much, I had decide I never want to work in it (ironic, isn't it? spending 5 years studying just to realize how much you hate it).\n\nThen this happens, 7 years later, you've grown into a middle-level manager at your \"temporary\" job, and now wake up with thoughts of it, have developed a habit of checking your mail while you and wifey watch \"TLC\" together in the evening, and scan tomorrow's meetings while playing with the baby and his building blocks. And you know it's wrong, and family time should be only family time, but you are stressed, you are waiting for an urgent report from someone 5 timezones after you, and are making up excuses like \"well, I AM spending time with them... otherwise I would have just sat at the PC, so just checking is good.... Isn't it...?\"\n\nWell it isn't and you know it. Your family needs to spend time with 100% you. Even 10 minutes 100% you is better than this.

You ask wifey \"how was your day\" but by the time you say it out, your stressed mind has switched 4 topics and is no longer listening...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now let's be fair**. I probably have what many would call a dream job. I get a decent pay (far from the luxurious lifestyles, but pays the bills), I have a cool supervisor, I am a low-level decision maker, I get to negotiate with customers whilst working from home, somewhat flexible hours. I built a small working corner in one bedroom while the family plays in the living room. On the not-so-hectic days I can even make my family some breakfast (i love cooking) before I go lock myself up in my working cave. So I am nearby, I can go see them at any point in the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that isn't enough. Not anymore. I am perplexed how many people would look at the description above and tell me how good I have it, and it is true - I do realize it. But why do we live like this? Why is our job so important to us that we are willing to sacrifice the little time we have on this planet with our loved ones?\n\nThinking about my son. He's 2 now. In 2 more years, he will be in pre-school, he will start having his own duties and worries, and there will never again be a time for simple joy. 2 years is nothing! 2 more Christmases  before he goes to life version 1.1 and the world loses a chunk of magic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And so I took a decision. This is my confession. I will find a niche to fill up in my local district (I'm from Bulgaria) and start a family business. Something we can all do and enjoy. I am sick and tired of this 9-to-5 job, and the stress it gives me. Before you start with the \"but\"'s - I know being a business owner is even MORE stressful. But it's a meaningful stress, something to look forward to, to know what you are doing.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFun fact, and an exercise you might consider yourself, if you are in a similar to my situation. Open up your \"sent\" mails. Filter out on high importance, or urgent mails only. Now scroll back, to half a year ago, or one year ago. See how much \"high importance\" stuff you probably already forgot.We had an audit 5 months ago, and that was stressful. 2 days I worked 16 hrs per day in calls and discussions. Surprisingly I found out, I had forgotten it. Worse, the urgent stuff I did back then has almost NO footprint today. Right after, I jumped on the next urgent thing.\n\nWho the hell said having a \"proper\" job pays off? \n\nWorking for oneself is risking money to earn liveliness... \n\nWorking 9/5 (for me) is the opposite - risking liveliness to earn money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~ \n\nI wrote this post for 3 reasons. \n\n1. Look for support & like-minded people\n2. look for ideas and tips from anyone willing to offer. Book and other resources suggestions are welcome\n3. Are you sleeping? Are you in a coma? This is a wakeup call, stop procrastinating and take care of your life!",

            "content": "If you\u2019re going to comment, please read the whole thing, I would very much appreciate it.\n\nI severely procrastinate, feel as if life is bland/boring, and have no idea where to go in life. I have terrible insomnia that keeps me awake for days, I have a therapist I see regularly and take medications for ptsd, adhd, depression & anxiety. I believe most of this is caused by the various substances I abuse/abused. Im a sophomore in high school. I\u2019ve smoked weed every single day for the past 8 months (legal state so it\u2019s easy to acquire high quality at little cost). Though the first time I smoked weed was in 6th grade and continued to every weekend until high school it became an everyday thing. I also smoked meth for around 6 months everyday staying up for 5-6 days at a time eating barely anything. I also had a terrible fentanyl addiction for just over 3 months. Then when I started acting out and behaving completely out of character I stopped all hard drugs and relied fully on weed for the past 8 months. Then today I gave in... an old \u201cfriend\u201d I ran into when I was walking to the store asked me: \u201cyou need any ice?\u201d I said \u201cnah I\u2019m good man\u201d he said \u201cIght man but here take this and let me know how good it is\u201d. It was a 20 sac. I mistakenly accepted. Although I haven\u2019t used any yet, I know I will at some point but it will only prolong my mental problems and ruin all the progress I\u2019ve made. Little backstory, freshman year was using meth and coke regularly so I didn\u2019t attend school much at ALL. Failed all classes etc. keep in mind I was a straight A student my parents raised well... you can only imagine how much that must\u2019ve destroyed them and I have cried myself to sleep many night because of it. My mom used meth for 7 years and quit when she found out she was pregnant with me and never looked back, she\u2019s got a job, house, and a family now and moved away from her hometown so I wouldn\u2019t follow her steps. Dad and uncles made/sold/used meth starting when they were 14-15 and he couldn\u2019t get out of the fast life for a long time.. in and out of prison for a good chunk of my life... he always had money and several motorcycles and cars and although I knew what he was doing was wrong, I still in way wanted what he had. He has been clean for 6 years now. He moved across the state to change his ways for me after his brother was shot & killed doing a multiple kilo deal while he was in prison. He new he couldn\u2019t do what he was doing forever and didn\u2019t want me to grow up without a dad. He\u2019s built a great family, very good job, and a nice house aswell. Grandpas on both sides used meth since they were kids and still do to this day. I don\u2019t know if family or genetics can play a role in addiction potential that\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you this. Please someone advise me on the corrects steps to continue moving forward. Since I started smoking weed and nothing else, I\u2019ve had amazing grades and attendance again but still more fucked then ever mentally. I\u2019m worried relapsing will ruin the only good thing I have in life at the moment, grades.",

I made it my New Years Resolution to live 2020 with \u201cno ragrets\u201d so I\u2019ve done things for self improvement like buying a car to end my god awful 2 hour commute.\n\nHowever, at the busiest train station of my commute there\u2019s this cute, short haired, tattooed girl who I\u2019ve noticed for months. I\u2019ve always wanted to at least express to her that I liked her style, even if nothing came of it. Since I\u2019m getting my car this weekend I figured it was my last chance to do it this week, so after metaphorically slapping myself a couple times I finally got the courage to do it today. \n\nI waited till my train was boarding (so I could have an easy escape route) and for a slower stream of people traffic so I could approach her. I came up to her while she was sitting on a bench but she was really honed in on her phone so kinda had to wave to get her attention. When she took off her headphones I said: \u201cHey, just wanted to say I think you\u2019re really cute and I like your aesthetic\u201d. She smiled and laughing nervously said \u201cOh thanks, have a nice day\u201d and I took the cue, smiled and said \u201cYou too\u201d while turning to go to my train gate. \n\nThis is my first time doing this, but I know there\u2019s a million variables like how I\u2019m interrupting her \u201croutine\u201d, or how she could\u2019ve been introverted or intimidated (I\u2019m kinda imposing) or had a boyfriend. Hell, its busy stations so she could\u2019ve thought I was about to ask for money or sell her Valentines shit. When I got on the train I was like \u201cShit i fucked that up like a pro\u201d but after a bit of retrospect, I\u2019m genuinely happy that I was able to get that off my chest because I would\u2019ve regretted it otherwise. There\u2019s probably a ton of ways I could\u2019ve played it better but also worse ways too so I\u2019m taking a lot of mental notes of the interaction. I might just invest in those business cards that say \u201cI think you\u2019re attractive, please pass this on\u201d. Just wanted to share that story lol.",

            "content": "Hello there, and thank you for visiting this post. I'll try to keep this brief, as I'm experiencing what I think is an unfortunately common problem in our modern age, but for a long time I've been struggling to find some practical advice. I'm hoping I can zero in on some here.\n\n**TL;DR**: I grew up privileged and haven't had to *really* work for anything, which has led to a stunted sense of motivation and inability to accomplish goals and self-actualize. I'm looking for practical advice to get off my metaphorical ass and into the world.\n\n**The Longer Explanation:**\n\nI'm a 30 year-old man who had a pretty privileged upbringing. I wasn't, like, unreasonably wealthy growing up, but I did grow up in one of the most affluent areas of the USA, and have never really had to work for anything. For example, parents paid for my expensive, top-tier college, paid for rent for a while, and have helped me get my videography business off the ground (paying for some of my equipment). Other forms of support have permeated my life.\n\nIn essence, I've never really been 'hungry.' I've never had to survive on my own. Don't get me wrong, I'm by no means lazy or ungrateful. I'm fortunate enough to both emotionally and intellectually intelligent. I'm not a rich kid who's content to sit on his ass. I want to be better. I want to accomplish dreams. I want to excel. On the whole, I know that I have a good head on my shoulders.\n\n*The problem?* I have nearly impossible time motivating myself to do anything in life. I have interests galore, but when it comes time to actually take action, I freeze. Now, I know that there are \\*many\\* factors that have contributed to this. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for my whole life, and certainly exhibit signs of ADHD. For all intents and purposes, I'm an addict/alcoholic, in the sense that I frequently use and abuse substances to an unhealthy and extremely counterproductive degree in order to make myself feel okay.\n\nThat aside, right now I'm really zeroing in on how much my upbringing interacts with all of my issues, and how much could be alleviated if I can find away to address this fundamental issue of having no hunger.\n\nAt my core, I'm a writer/artist/creator. I want to write and make films. I'm also a passionate gardener and propagate plants. All of these things represent inklings of the independent, entrepreneurial lifestyle that I know I want to embrace but, again, I feel perpetually held back and unmotivated because none of the work really seems necessary.\n\nI'm essentially broke and in a lot of credit card debt. I really can't afford to be this paralyzed all the time, and want to get my act together. There's loads of inspirational content out there that can help me feel better about the idea of doing things, but what I'm lacking is some practical advice to help me structure my mind and my time in such away that I can unlearn my upbringing and be the man I know I can be.\n\nThere's plenty more I could ramble about, but I'll leave it at that for now.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience? If so, how did you pull yourself out of it? I welcome any and all input, insight, or advice that anyone can offer. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this, and for any help you can offer me.",

I'd kind of like to see what people might think, and perhaps I'd like to give some useful insight to the one other guy or gal who happens to be at the same position in life as me.\n\n**TLDR;** I learned three things while taking a cold shower this morning:\n\n* It's always beneficial to put yourself in a position where you're forced to take action. I think this is a great remedy for egregious overthinkers like myself.\n* When starting anything, it's usually better to start, not having a completely thought-out plan about what you're going to do, but rather, learn the best way to do something as you're doing it (Also a great remedy for overthinkers).\n* Consistency is a skill. It can and must be practised.\n\nIt's around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, an hour before my brother is dropped off from school. I'm at home by myself, something that I always try to appreciate but I think I'll get better without having to be. It will be a long while before I'm able to comfortably afford my own place. I haven't done any work yet. That's because there are a lot of things wrong with me, a lot of things that I'm getting better at.\n\nLast night, I dreamt that I was in this same room, the one that I'm writing this. The same room that brings me so much anxiety and angst about not knowing what it is that I'm going to do for life, and how I'm not able to deal with my mother's difficult personality. I dreamt that I had a keyboard (an electric piano) in this room, one that I had thought of getting for only moments yesterday. My sister was back from university, and I remember her telling me about something, I'm not quite sure what it was.\n\nFor some reason though, I decided to play on the keyboard. I played a few riffs, and when I did, it sounded beautiful, like I had been playing for a long time. When I continued to play, those beautiful pieces were mixed in with chords that I barely remembered, chords that sounded like someone who hadn't been playing the piano for a long time. With that, came a feeling that I found all too familiar: \"If I had more practice with this, this would sound beautiful\". It's a thought that I would get a lot when I was younger. I was naturally talented with music, but I never took myself all that seriously. I didn't really believe that I could hone my talent into something special, so I contented myself with \"Oh wow, that's pretty nice\" comments from my peers and elders.\n\nLooking into the future of my life, I find it entirely depressing that I might look back and have the same feeling after looking at an instrument. I take this as a clear indication that I should believe that I'm able to make something of myself as a musician despite my late age. Perhaps my late age is something intended by the universe to give me the respectable trait of humility. Going into my mid-twenties, I like to think of it as more of a skill.\n\nWhen I woke up this morning, it took me a long time to get into the shower. I hadn't showered for two days. I realised that, as easily as it always is, I had slipped into another state of depression, something that I've always been adamant about dealing with without any use of drugs (including alcohol, although that and cigarettes were the two things that I hadn't always been as successful avoiding). One of the things that really did help in overcoming depression is cold showers. Cold showers are all I take, partly because, after consistent use, it truly does help to regulate my mood, but also partly because if I take a shower anything over luke-warm temperature, I have to deal with around 30 minutes of unbearable itching.\n\nI realised that it took a long time for me to get into the shower, partly because I'm a bitch, and I knew that it was going to be cold (despite me doing this for a few months now. Wim Hof was right, it really doesn't get easier), but partly because I hadn't done so in two days, so I had lost a bit of my \"Just do it\" conditioning. When I finally grew the balls to get in, I stood there for some moments (about 15 minutes) asking myself why it is that I'm like this, going through all the things in my head to find the reasons why it's so easy to let myself go from a productive lifestyle. When I had my finger on the \"on\" button, I started to think of my anxieties regarding my venture as a freelance content writer. It was the same, my finger was hovering over the \"on\" button, fearing the cold water that I know would be good for me.\n\nI landed on two helpful thoughts that I promised myself I would write down after I had succeeded with this basic morning task. The first was when I had realised that I wasn't going to get out of the shower; there was nowhere else that I could go, I wasn't very well just going not have a shower after not showering for two days, and I sure as hell wasn't about to suffer for 30 minutes from a warm shower. I had already put myself in a position where I had no choice but to just do what I intended to do. I have done this a few times in my life already, I had just never reflected on them. It was those times that I had forced myself into situations where I simply had to take action, that I'm even mildly comfortable today (Comfortable meaning that I have a roof over my head, warm food every day and some form of income). I made a mental note of this: It's beneficial for one to put themselves in a position where they have no choice but to take action.\n\nThe second thing I took note of, after hesitating to push the button for the fifth time, was how I was preparing myself. I kept imagining how I would deal with the cold water on my back, despite having done it basically every day for months. I kept trying to imagine myself under the cold water, how I would keep calm, how I would try to control my mind, before realising that there was no way that I could substitute imagining how I would act for actually turning it on and knowing. I keep repeating that I've been taking cold showers for months, so one would think that I would have learned this by now, but I suppose that's the benefit of doing something quasi-consistently; you eventually learn something important no matter how stupid you are.\n\nI realised, like my chosen career, that if you spend time overthinking on how you're going to do what you want to do, you spend a significant amount of time not actually doing it. It's a much more effective strategy to simply start *doing* and then just figure things out along the way. The lessons that you learn while committing to anything are a lot more valuable than what you would learn by imagining yourself doing it.\n\nEventually, I pressed the the \"on\" button, and (Suprise, surprise!) it wasn't nearly as tasking as I made it out to be in my head. I took the shower the same way I took it every other morning and will take it every other morning from today.\n\nI actually wrote one last thing down after I got out of the shower. It was that consistency, like everything else, can and must be practised. There are many times that I've become disheartened by my own awful inability to do things consistently for a long period of time. This is due to a number of things that are wrong with me that, again, I'm getting a lot better at. I realise though, that the gaps between the days that I am consistent are decreasing, and the valuable things that I'm learning are a by-product of that.\n\nI hope that I'll always appreciate lessons like these. I'll always be looking for them. Moreso, I'll always be applying them.\n\n\\~Friendly note, if you actually read this through, thank you! I hope you've had a great day! If you haven't had a great day, I wish you the best. Things truly do get better if you just keep pushing, at least that's what they tell me.",

Although I'm nowhere near completely \"over it\", I've been taking antidepressants and going through therapy for the past few months, meaning that I am slowly starting to realise that life doesn't have to be as miserable as it has been for me. \n\nThat being said, leaving my depression behind feels really scary. I feel that I am losing a part of myself, so to speak. When people normally talk about recovering from depression, they mention returning to their old self; regaining interest in things they once loved and reconnecting with those who care about them. I, however, feel like I have no \"old self\" to go back to. \n\nWithout my depression, I feel like I have no identity. For the past few years I feel like I have done nothing but sleep, eat, drag my way through school, and desperately try to gain approval from people. I have no real passions or interests and I genuinely have no friends. I feel like I don't really know myself at all. I have nobody outside my family who cares for me. I have never had real friends or romantic relationships, and frankly, I am terrified of them. I don't know how to be the \"real\" me, because all I have ever known is depression. \n\nHas anyone else gone through something similar? Right now I am trying to get into a few things that I find even a little bit interesting, exercising, and generally trying to taking care of myself. In some ways it feels like staying depressed is the easier option - when everything in life is pointless and boring, life doesn't feel so overwhelming, as weird as it sounds. I feel like the world has opened up and there are lots of possibilities because I am still young, but instead of being hopeful, I am terrified. Depression has been safety blanket and the lens through which I have viewed the world for so long, and without it, I feel lost. \n\n If anyone has any suggestions for me, I'd be so grateful. Thank you.",

Now i get stressed over(sometimes genuinely scared) anything that could go bad.

What makes it even worse is how i connect things to one another and thinking how one bad thing can ruin another and another... just a endless loop of misery and bad things happening and it is getting worse. \n\nAny advice is appreciated.

It may sound like a childish thing to do, still relaying on her, but I'm clueless about what type of professionals we have in the area we live in, and if we can somehow have free or low-cost sessions (because of the national health service, which I'm vaguely familiar with).  \nThe problem is, I always get teary eyes when I think about bringing this topic up (specially today, not sure why), and I really wouldn't like to start a serious conversation crying... and, overall, I'm not sure how to approach this subject at all.  \nAlso, my mom is a religious person, and I'm not (at least not currently) so I'm kinda afraid that when I bring this up, she'll turn everything into a \"you should've prayed more\" type of chat, and I don't want that...  \nSo, I thought maybe I could do it all by myself, but I dunno where to start looking.  \nAny advice on the matter?

            "content": "Up front - I always had a great GPA in HS, college, and have been a high performer in any sort of job-related training.\n\nAll, I\u2019m a guy in my mid-30\u2019s who is wondering \u2018what is wrong\u2019...I often feel like, mentally, I\u2019m able to conceptualize what I SHOULD be doing, firmly grasp concepts that are definitely intellectually within my reach, but unable to really capitalize on anything.   I just feel like I get easily overwhelmed and sometimes fail to see the structures behind what's going on.\n\n1. Although most people would agree I\u2019m well spoken, I often find **difficulty in articulating** the nuances of my opinions. Sometimes I find it difficult to get past the surface level of what I\u2019m explaining, and often lose track of my arguments while I\u2019m making them, unless they\u2019re pre-planned out.\n2. I do the \u2018interrupt you while you\u2019re talking to show you I know what you\u2019re talking about\u2019 thing. A lot. I actually have to stop myself from doing it\u2026which I\u2019m pretty good at most of the time.\n3. **INATTENTION. BAD MEMORY.** Oh my God\u2026I\u2019m all over the place when it comes to paying attention. During classes I receive, I have so many thoughts running through my head that I\u2019ll often miss critical information because something the presenter said triggered a memory or me to visualize something. Add to that my poor memory, and I can get overwhelmed pretty quickly.\n4. **Lack of discipline**. I am very into self-improvement, fitness, eating healthy, etc. The only problem is that I can\u2019t stick to anything. I either get bored or fall out of the habit very, very quickly. Especially if there are no consequences for failure to complete it. For example: I recognize that I should wake up early every day and work out, but when it comes to it, I NEVER do it. Or will very, very, rarely do it. Same with eating healthy or working on some sort of skill on the side. It always, always falls by the wayside. I had one period of time where I was tracking my daily results on an Excel spreadsheet to great results, but really one or two missed days, and I'm completely off it.\n5. **Not Detail Oriented.** When it comes to fine details, like reading some kind of policy, or turning something in, I am often **impatient** and skim what I\u2019m going to do, instead of taking the time to turn polished products in. I have often found myself finding small errors after the fact, because of my rush to do things.\n6. Anxiety!  I often am worried about screwing up.  Most others don't recognize it as I usually volunteer to be the public guinea pig in many ways for whatever is happening, but I have a great deal of anxiety about work performance.  I think it honestly affects a lot of what I do as well.\n\nThis stuff really bothers me. Somehow I have failed upwards into having a great job in spite of myself, but it\u2019s tough. It makes it so I really don\u2019t feel **very confident in myself** and my ability to do things well, or often feel like I have more of an uphill battle than others do.\n\nWhat does this sound like to you? And what should I do? I\u2019ve tried things such as meditation, etc., but didn\u2019t notice much of an effect. I want to get to the \u2018next level\u2019 performance-wise, personally and professionally, and I feel like whatever this is, is holding me back.\n\nPlease help!  This is killing my self-confidence.  And I notice too many times where I have a bad recollection of events, or am not attentive enough.  I want to be useful.\n\nThank you all in advance!\n\nEDIT - Added a paragraph about anxiety.\n\nEDIT2 - Woah...lots and lots of great suggestions.  I in no way thought this post would get anywhere near the traction it did, and wish I could respond to everybody, but probably best I do it here.\n\n I think there are lots of good ideas to pursue here.  Seems to me like a few general themes:\n\nMindfulness (I've tried, but will have an opportunity to try again)\n\nDiet (mine is pretty terrible)\n\nTherapy\n\nIt's really encouraging to see that I'm not alone in here.  I've been around high performers my whole life and definitely have a bit of impostor syndrome...but I also feel like there definitely is an edge I'm missing!",

I discussed it with him and he suddenly said he just wanted to be friends and that he thought about it two months back but wanted to avoid conflict and that he wants just friendship because he \u201cruins things\u201d. He just said whatever seemed like I wanted to hear. I was beyond confused because the night before he had been hugging and kissing me goodbye. He had even said a few days prior that he couldn\u2019t sleep without me there. He wasn\u2019t even that interested in sex. I wasn\u2019t trying to be involved with anyone in the first place, but I thought he really did like me.

My name is Andrew, and I am a 15 year old entrepreneur that runs 3 business. 6 month ago I decided to change my life and to get out of my predicament I was in (laziness, bad habits, doing nothing). So I started going to the gym and I educated myself on the fundamentals of workouts and eating habits. Long and behold I have gained tremendous results over the past 6 months. Lets flash back to 4 months ago, where I decided to launch my own online dropshiping business. I gained skills from my successful brother who does the same business, and I was averaging a order value of $78 a day, or $2,340 a month. As a 15 year old with little to no expenses, this was tremendous. My life was shaping, I completely stopped master bating, I was going to the gym 6 days a week with a efficient push pull routine, and I was connected to the most high spiritually. And recently things have just been falling off, and I hate it. I fell back into my old habits due to stress from the business, breakage, ect. Then I started to deteriorate mentally and productivity wise. I stopped putting in the work for my business due to some failures I experienced, I started to miss a day or two from the gym a week, and I had little to no motivation to go to school, to the point where I miss almost 2 days a week, every week. I stopped focusing on my religion and I was becoming disconnected from every good aspect of my life. I wasnt getting any any sales because of my major slacking off. A failure in my business (a money shortage) caused all of this and is creating a domino effect. I want your input on how I can change my situation as many of you have different experiences.

I am about to graduate and I am still a kissless virgin)despite being very good looking and friendly), made no friends in my classes, and did not do more to grow as a programmer(as in I did not join any clubs, projects, etc... though mostly out of ignorance). I have spent almost all day regreting this and it really shows every time this happens. In my energy mood, etc... it happens very often still despite having improved a lot.\n\n\nI now have a resume that I am decently proud of, have learned how top use springboot, databases, etc..., I am in a group developing an API for an iOS app that will actually be released in the app store, have started to go to the gym more consistently now that I have time and I love every second of it since I am now doing a lot of weights and bulking up. I have made efforts to get a date, but nothing as of yet. I have approached many random girls in the gym and in my school, but got very few numbers and the ones that I did get eventually flaked. I tried tinder, but I dont have the time to find pictures for a perfect profile nor time to take them. I have a bunch from my recent trip to Japan, but I look very iffy in all of them. Not to mention that in tinder, I have 1 like only in my profile. I have talked to 10x more women this past month than matches that ive had this whole year. Rejection doesnt hurt me that much unless the conversration is super awkward, which it isnt that bad most of the time.\n\nI also still have my friends from high school, but I have only been able to make plenty of acquaintances in college simply because it's really hard to make friends this late in the game(I'm in my last semester). Everyone seems to be busy and they seem to exclude me from their friendship circles by talking about things that only they understand. I have made some friends from work though, that happen to go to the same university, if that counts. I also met one guy who is working with me on the IOS app who is really cool.\n\nI think that honestly, I still regret not knowing design patterns in software(apparently a basic skill in programming), not going to parties(I've only been to 2 salsa socials), or not developing the social skills to talk to women before or not trying to get my shit together so that I can have a job straight out of college and move out of my mom's house before(right now it's just the 2 of us) . I feel so inferior to others that have already have had these experiences and know more about anything in any area of my life.

I've been working on self improvement over the last couple of months and my journey has been up and down so far, but I do feel very happy in progress that I've made especially with resolutions I made at the start of the year. I exercise regularly either by going to the gym, or pole dancing and have also picked up some new hobbies on occasion like aerial hoop and rock climbing which I love. Unfortunately I'm on a 60 hour week with work and university so I can't do those things as often as I like, but when I do have some downtime even for half an hour in the evening I end up just watching tv and I don't mind that sometimes, but I don't want to do it every day. \n\nOne of my resolutions was to pick up more of a creative hobby so I'm wondering what you guys like to get up to in your downtime!

I really just don't see a point to life or anything really in general. I'm struggling to find things to enjoy, losing interest in things I did enjoy, & I have no motivation to do new things I could potentially enjoy.\n\nI can't see a future for myself at all. I'm working a dead end job, I believe I'm useless as hell, & when I check out other jobs, I ALWAYS feel like I have no shot at them. My social life is shit. I rarely leave the house for reasons other than work or going to the store. I've never had a girlfriend and I've developed a forever alone mentality. My anxiety cripples me during any remotely stressful event. My depression makes me exhausted and unable to get the energy to do most things.\n\nI know it's easy for someone to tell me to put on the work to change these things, but I really just don't have the motivation or discipline to. I have absolutely no hope that anything will change for the better. I've watched plenty of motivational videos and posts, but none of them have sparked me to put in the work. \n\nI read about how people manage to pull themselves out of their holes and I feel so overwhelmed. I don't understand how people put on so much work and not absolutely lose their minds. I don't think I'm capable of doing it and I'm sure I'd fail anyway. For example, I've been thinking about joining a gym lately  to help with my body issues, but then I think of all the work that goes with being in the gym and dieting properly and it feels like so much to take care of & I decide it's not worth it to even try.\n\nSo how can someone like me who doesn't see a point in trying and isn't willing to put in the work supposed to pull myself out of this hole?",

I\u2019ve had a very broken childhood.   It looked really nice when you were looking in from the outside, but my dad was a traveling salesman and my mom was from California.  They are complete opposites and my dad lost all of our money when the mortgage crisis hit.  (They worked in the industry). My dad got hooked up with a con artist and lost the business my biological dad left to my mom when he died, I was 2.  My step dad who I consider my father did some reckless  things with money, like buying four houses in Hawaii right before the bubble popped.   My parents had to move from California to the Midwest and rebuild.  My mom never got over that and always looked at my dad in a different light.   They had a baby together and I spent most of my homeschool teen years making sure to take my baby brother into rooms that they were not fighting in for essential 6 years,  I finally pulled the trigger when I was 21 to just move in with friends and distance myself from them.  I have a girlfriend now if 3 years who I tell everything to.  I watched my parents throw away 15 years of their lives on each other, just because they couldn\u2019t tell each other how much they did not get along and should have been divorced.

Luckily with a friend\u2019s referral, I got a decent job (one that I surprisingly like!) \nWith a steady income my fianc\u00e9 and I have finally had a much happier and less stressful relationship. \n\nIn the first few weeks working, I noticed there was a lot of down time and standing by so I would use my phone and feel unproductive. After dealing with people face to face at work, I soon realized how much I forgot how to interact with others so I bought the book \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u201d by Dale Carnegie. I had never made the time to read it and I\u2019m glad I finally did. I realized that reading really helps to calm me, relieve stress and it makes the time go by faster. I finished that book and just got \u201cThe Power of Now\u201d by Eckhart Tolle and I am just really happy that I found such a powerful book. I truly feel improvement in my self and my mental health. Next I need to make time to start working out again so I can feel more confident in my appearance (I\u2019m currently really skinny) \n\nAnyways,\nI really wanted to share my recent successes and hope to inspire someone.

In fact! she's an author. So obviously I'm just like her. Or on the flipside. I'm not as charismatic as my middle sister so I'll get the \"why aren't you like CC?\" comments. I honestly never even had real friends all of them were my older brother's friends or people trying to get into good graces with him cause he sold weed and provided the beer at all the parties (he's only 3 years older).\n\nI'm 24 now and I honestly have no idea who I am.

When I was in University, my days were constantly filled with a mix of my part time job at Starbucks, being a full time physics student, and working in a research lab. I didn't have a good work/life balance at all during University and was the most depressed I've ever been during my senior year. I didn't have time for friends, hobbies, lacked self confidence, ya da ya da, and just general life outside of University and I feel like I lost sense of who I was as an individual. \n\nFast forward a year to now, I have completely turned myself around. I lost 45lbs (healthily) that I gained senior year due to poor eating habits, reconnected with close friends that I neglected through uni, started revisiting old hobbies (guitar, surfing, and gym), dating an awesome partner, and just all around started loving myself and am finally happy. BUT....\n\nNow that I have essentially a 9-5 M-F job, I am left with A LOT of free time that I am not use to considering I've been basically doing 60-80 hour work weeks during all 5 years of uni. I can fill some of it up with social outings or working on my hobbies, but I am still left with a lot of free time. Recently I've been wasting it on Netflix and phone apps (I've gone through 100+ levels of candy crush in ~3 days) and while I enjoy downtime, I am wasting too much of my time into these things and haven't had much of a fulfilling perpose because of it. I want to be able to focus my energy on something more impactful either to myself or to the community. \n\nSo my question for you recent grads/adults of Reddit, how do you all spend your free time? Is life suppose to just be this mundane all the time now? \n\nTldr; I feel like I waste a lot of my free time on mundane things and haven't been fulfilled.

I currently work a part time job at a movie theater that I only got last year as my first job. After a long time thinking that I am completely useless for any type of job. So, I was happy about that. But, approaching my 5th year of being out of high school, I feel like I haven't done a whole lot. My main interest has always been art and drawing. So, right out of school I went in and took a ton of drawing/animation classes. However, I've always been told I'll never make a career out of it and I should just do something else. I volunteered at an animal shelter helping the doctor with spays and neuters for a while and I didn't mind it. but, the other girls there didn't really talk to me much because I was just a volunteer I think. It was kind of disheartening. I had to get this part-time job in order to start making money of course and cut back on the volunteering. I've always been a shy person, so that's probably why I have trouble with building relationships. Another reason is that I'm at home a lot due to my mom having a disability (trouble getting up, standing, walking for long periods of time, etc). Also, we have a lot of pets that need to be taken care of. Most of time goes to that since I couldn't just leave them. As of now, I've put a little more work into my artistry. I've made money from my art but just not enough, of course. I knew that was to be expected. Plus, my mom makes me feel terrible about myself sometimes and that just makes me want to give up completely. She says things like \"you're going to be at this dumb job forever\" \"why can't you be like your cousin, she already moved out\" (my cousin is 35). :/ but other times she apologizes and says she will support me. it just makes me confused and frustrated. ever since I started working, I feel like it's helped my confidence even if its miniscule. \n\nmy main hobbies include drawing, writing and being with animals. but a major dilemma for me is that i'm absolutely horrible at math. I think I have a fear of it but i'm planning to take a class focusing on conquering that fear that starts soon. i'm nervous for that too. also the fact that I can't leave the house very much and that upsets me.. \n\nI guess what i'm hoping for if any of you could give me some advice. point me in the right direction? I am just so sad tonight. I've been thinking of getting my feet wet as a dog groomer, but my mom doesn't really consider that a career. she then tells me to try and be a vet tech, which i am not sure i'd be good at because of my difficulty with math. i understand what she means, but i just feel lost. I guess I just don't know much about the world because of how sheltered I've been... \n\nthanks for listening, all.",

            "title": "Can You Get Motivation for Success When You Have None?",
            "content": "Here's an example of how motivation leads to success. Read below what Tomas Svitorka has to say about motivation. Tomas is an inspirational life coach who overcame the lack of motivation early in his life.\n\n## I became independent and developed self-responsibility early on\n\nMoving out of my parents\u2019 home at 18 was a big lesson. (I'm originally from a small village in the Czech Republic, by the way.) Although I worked and contributed money to the household, I felt quite restricted. So, I thought that if I left and moved in with my girlfriend, I'd be better off.\n\nBut after I had done so and had lived with her for a year and a half, I realized life was expensive! I even apologized to my mother. I told her I hadn't been appreciative enough when I had moved out.\n\n*But it helped me become independent and develop self-responsibility.*\n\nOverall, it was a great experience: very challenging but exactly what I needed to grow.\n\n## I felt suffocated without options and opportunities\n\nMy village didn't offer much in terms of career opportunities. And I had my ambitions and also wanted to learn English. So, I went to Australia first. But it was so expensive to live and study that I moved to the UK soon. I wanted to move to a place where I'd have the opportunities to grow.\n\n*Without opportunities and options, I feel like I'm suffocating.*\n\nI always had this motivation but I still had a long way to go before it could lead me to success.\n\n## I pursued my opportunities despite having little money\n\nI didn't even have enough money to buy plane tickets to go to the UK from the Czech Republic! I took a bus and the trip was 24 hours long.\n\nI started as an au-pair in the family of a father and two boys. That was a safe start but the job wasn't too demanding and I was making just 50 pounds a week.\n\nThe next step for me was moving to London a year later. I printed a bunch of CVs and went to restaurants in Central London. This bold approach got me a job at the third restaurant already.\n\n## I realized I could be so much more\n\nAfter a while, I found a job with a catering company within an investment bank. And this is when things changed for me.\n\nI was a trolley boy, pushing a trolley with drinks and sandwiches through the floors. I sold them to bankers and analysts.\n\nIt was a very important experience for me:\n\n1. It was a kind of entrepreneurship.\n2. It forced me to interact with so many people.\n3. These interactions opened my mind to the world of success, wealth, and confidence.\n\nAt the time, I was making a thousand pounds a month. And I thought that this was what people made. But here's what happened around Christmas that blew my mind.\n\nOne of my clients was upset about his Christmas bonus. And when I asked him what he got, it wasn't too far from six figures. And he told me that a 6-figure bonus was nothing there.\n\nI said to myself:\n\n*What?!*\n\n*My Christmas bonus is 200 pounds.*\n\n*And people are getting hundreds of thousands here?*\n\nThat's what got me thinking:\n\n1. With some of the people there, I felt that my English was better than theirs.\n2. I was also pretty intelligent but why did I have this stupid job?\n\n## Here's what finally catapulted me out of my comfort zone\n\nI was sitting in a caf\u00e9 with a Polish friend. And she started talking to a waiter who was also Polish. It turned out he was 43 and shared a room with someone else.\n\nI sat there dumbfounded: I was 23 or 24 at the time and I was a bit of a party boy. I realized:\n\n*If I don't change now, I could easily end up being a waiter at 43 like him.*\n\n(And there's nothing wrong about waiters but it's just not for me, in terms of my ambitions.)\n\nI've got so terrified of the idea that I'd be financially struggling in 10 or 20 years. I feared what I call \"tolerable discomfort.\" It's like my life sucks but not enough to do something about it.\n\n## How motivation led me from a party boy to success quickly\n\nThis fear drove me to find out how I could improve myself\u2014I became obsessed with personal development. I read self-help books, went to workshops and seminars, and feasted on podcasts and videos.\n\nAnd it had a profound effect on my personal and professional life:\n\n1. I started to get promoted at work.\n2. My social skills and confidence improved massively.\n3. I started to be very intentional with how I spent my time. One of the first things that I did was throwing away my TV.\n\n## I can improve, and it's fascinating\n\nI had never thought I could improve.\n\nBut then and there, I realized I could, and it was so freeing. It sounds silly now but many people hold a belief that we're set in stone.\n\nI embraced the growth mindset instead. And I'm hungry to learn and improve to this day. I find it fascinating and fulfilling. It gives me the motivation that leads to success.\n\n## I can see beauty and opportunity in everything\n\nAnother crucial realization for me was that reality was subjective. We're in charge of how we interpret the world around us. You can look at a flower and say, \"Well, there's nothing special.\" Or you can say, \"Wow, it's beautiful!\"\n\nThat's a great reframing example:\n\n*If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.*\n\n*\u2014Wayne Dyer*\n\nI became intentional with what I focused on and how I saw things.\n\nWe can find beauty, opportunity, and lessons in everything. Just as we can find stress, sadness, and misery if we look for them.\n\n## Takeaways\n\n1. **Develop self-responsibility** as early as possible in life. Don't be an adult child who won't leave home.\n2. **Keep looking for opportunities**, and they will appear. That's how motivation leads to success.\n3. **You can improve**. You're not set in stone.\n4. **Embrace a self-growth mindset**. Feast on personal development content.\n5. **You can see beauty and opportunity in everything** just as you can see sadness. Train yourself to focus on what's good.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR;** : Here's how motivation leads to success. An inspirational life coach Tomas Svitorka shares how he motivated himself to go from a waiter to a massive success.",

            "content": "I have been going through a lot since I graduated from undergrad in May and it\u2019s been hard but I\u2019m so damn proud of myself.\n\nI\u2019ve always had issues with loving myself and forgiving myself when I make mistakes. College helped me become more confident in myself and my abilities, and I\u2019m so thankful for that. Even though I became more confident, I feel like college had so many distractions (seeing peers, hanging out with friends, assignments, etc) and they kept me from thinking about my other insecurities. Post-grad has been difficult because I don\u2019t have the amount of distractions I had in college, so I\u2019ve been having those insecurities reveal themselves. And as a result, I\u2019ve been incredibly hard on myself.\n\nI\u2019m also in my first serious relationship. I love my boyfriend very much and I\u2019m learning so much from our relationship, but I\u2019ve been unnecessarily hard on myself a handful of times. I know deep down, it\u2019s okay to make mistakes and to learn from them, but in those moments I do something wrong, it\u2019s hard for me to forgive myself and not dwell on my mistakes. Fortunately, my boyfriend is patient with me and I\u2019m doing my best to forgive myself and learn from my mistakes without beating myself up. We are both motivating each other to be the best versions of ourselves, and I\u2019m so thankful that he gets to be with me on this journey to love and improve myself.\n\nI picked up boxing last month and I absolutely love it. I was fit in high school but after achieving a figure I was content with, I stopped working out regularly. I wanted to get back into shape and after having my friend tell me about her boxing gym, I decided to try out a free class. Boxing has been doing wonders to both my physical and mental health, and I\u2019m so inspired by my trainers and everyone who I see at the gym.\n\nThose moments where I\u2019m hard on myself, I have to think about how far I\u2019ve come since high school and college. I was not confident in myself at all in high school. There are moments I wish I had done more in college even, but I did things that high school me wouldn\u2019t even do. For example, I\u2019m a pretty quiet person but I ended up being a first year orientation guide at my college. That required me stepping out of my comfort zone, and I don\u2019t regret it one bit.\n\nI thought I would be fine after college because I became more confident, but that\u2019s not true. There are so many things I need to work on, but that\u2019s okay! I\u2019m a work in progress and I\u2019m constantly striving to be the best version of myself everyday. Post-grad has been a huge learning experience, but I\u2019m so glad I have a job with amazing coworkers, a wonderful relationship, my boxing gym, and of course my wonderful friends and family!\n\nAnyways I know this was long but I just wanted to share my thoughts and progress on here. If you made it this far into my post, I hope you got something out of it!!",

            "content": "I'm a senior college student (M21) trying to address my shortcomings as a student.  I haven't been particularly healthy, nor have I been a good student.  I knew I wanted to find time to work out, and dedicate myself to my studies a bit more... intentionally.  I'm not overweight, but I'm not exactly fit either.  I'm just kinda flabby.  So I came to the conclusion that if I wanted to dedicate myself to working out, I had to do so at a time that won't be affected by my schedule, as things change, or people get in the way.  I determined that the only time that could work was early morning.  So I've been setting my alarm at 6:00am every morning.  Even on the days in between working out.  I know that a consistent sleep schedule is really important.  And today, I'm actually starting to feel the benefits.\n\nWhich brings me to the point I wanted to make in the title.  Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy.  Yeah that makes sense.  We're not supposed to stay up into the early hours of the morning.  Going to bed with the sun, and waking up with it is actually a really healthy thing.  It aligns you with the day.  It's the other points that don't make quite as much sense, but are actually, so far, true.\n\nEarly to bed, early to rise, makes a man wealthy.  Not exactly, but I think I know what it's getting at.  In just this morning, I have done more productive things than I normally do all week long.  I've had a list of lesser chores building up that I have not been able to take care of because all my other, more pressing things get in the way.  I feel energized, I feel motivated.  I can actually do the things that I need to do, but with vigor and the excellence that I've wanted to achieve for so long.  If this is a consistent thing, I can understand how it makes a man wealthy.\n\nEarly to bed, early to rise, makes a man wise.  Again, this isn't literal.  Waking up early isn't going to give you divine revelation or some sudden understanding of the universe.  But I'll tell you what it's doing for me.  It has eliminated a lot of mental fog.  My brain is sharp.  I am focused.  I can set my mind on something and complete it.  My words are working, in that I'm not fumbling around, stuttering, or repeating myself. \n\nThere's something about all this that I'm in awe about.  I don't remember the last time I felt like this.  I have energy, motivation, tangible passion.  I feel like everything's going to be okay.  I can actually do the things I want to do, be the things I want to be.  Maybe I'm just having a good day, but I can't explain it.   I feel great.\n\nTL;DR - I've been waking up early to work out, and I feel good, feel motivated, and can think clearly.  It's nice.",

I never told anyone as I didn't want people to worry so I sucked it up for my high school life. This really affected my confidence and self worth as I basically had none.\n\nI kept telling myself things will get better when I'm out of here. Once I finally left school, I decided to work on myself and went to college. I had made a good group of friends and I ended out finding I was somewhat attractive as girls would call me it and would hook up with a few of them, this helped my confidence but in the back of my mind there was still that ugly kid inside of me, nobody in college had called me ugly or the names I had received from getting bullied everyday. But a few years later I had stopped having that victim mentality and told myself it was only high school, people don't mean what they say and I have almost been fully cured from my past...It was funny, I received a message from a guy at school after a few years later who was like \"I never want associate myself with you!\" and it never affected me at all.\n\nThis has made me realize that I don't care of what other people think of me now if they were to say something mean about me I can ignore it knowing what I had been through in my past as it really is a them issue....Truly not giving a damn of what others think about me anymore.\n\nTLDR; I got bullied at school, on the verge of suicide and never told anyone about it, made a comeback by working on myself and am pretty much fully cured.",

            "content": "TL;DR: I\u2019ve been trying to improve my confidence for a few years and I\u2019ve made good progress. However, when people compliment me, or when things happen that should boost my confidence, I usually don\u2019t think much about it and move on with my day. But when one bad or embarrassing thing happens or if someone says something bad about me, I dwell on it and let it ruin my day. I really don\u2019t know how to fix this and I could really use some advice. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to build my confidence for the past few years. I\u2019ve made a lot of progress since sophomore year of high school, but I\u2019m not where I\u2019d like to be. \n\nA few years ago, I had trouble speaking to people that I wasn\u2019t good friends with. I also had trouble speaking to my friends about touchy subjects, and I just really wasn\u2019t comfortable with letting anyone close to me. I didn\u2019t really have anyone in my life that I cared about, and I just didn\u2019t really have any motivation or confidence to change that. \n\nI eventually decided to make a change, so I started talking to random people and forcing myself out of my comfort zone. I got a job in retail, started hanging out with my friends more, and got closer to my acquaintances. I never got in a relationship, but I was making steady improvements. \n\nIt\u2019s been pretty much the same ever since although there have been some plateaus. Now, I\u2019m a freshman in college and life is very different than how it was. I\u2019ve had some trouble finding people I can connect with, but I have a few decent friends. In terms of confidence, I don\u2019t feel nearly as much insecurity and I\u2019m usually able to talk to random people with no problems. However, I still have a bunch of insecurities (the main one being my lack of sexual experience) and I really want to improve myself. \n\nSo my main problem right now is girls. I overthink a lot, and I haven\u2019t really met many girls. I asked out one girl but got rejected. I got to know one girl decently, but I never got her contact info and I never saw her again. So I\u2019m starting to think I should just start cold approaching girls, but that\u2019s really hard, especially for someone like me who has struggles with confidence. \n\nBut the thing is, I don\u2019t know why I struggle with confidence. First of all, based on what I think and what other people say, I\u2019m smart, funny, athletic, nice, and sometimes even outgoing, so I shouldn\u2019t have much of a problem. Second, another one of my main insecurities is that I think I look very young and unattractive. But again, this really isn\u2019t the case. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten plenty of compliments and positive remarks on my appearance in high school, but in college, I\u2019ve gotten enough that I should be overconfident in my looks. I\u2019ve seen at least a dozen girls give me the look up and down, and even more have given me abnormally long eye contact. I\u2019ve gotten compliments on my eyes, my style, and the way I smell. I\u2019ve only really been to one party, but I got hit on by two girls and a few others seemed interested in me. Last week, two people mistook me for a junior or a sophomore in college, even though I\u2019m a freshman. And finally, my friends back home consider me to be very attractive, and one of them told me I should have way more confidence because I already have a higher chance with girls based on my looks. I\u2019m not trying to brag or anything, but based on all of these things plus more, I should have bulletproof confidence by now, but it\u2019s like these things just roll off my shoulder. \n\nBut when something bad happens to me, it usually ends up ruining my day. For example, I started going to the gym a couple months ago, which I was proud of for a little bit, but then that good feeling went away. Anyways, I was doing squats the other day and I was working in with someone I didn\u2019t know. He had the bar set low, and it sort of threw me off but I ended up dropping the weights off of the bar onto the floor. It was pretty embarrassing, and I tried to just forget about it, but it kept creeping up on me throughout the day, and the next day, and whenever I thought about it, it would just really hurt my mood and confidence. \n\nIt\u2019s like I could hear 100 things to boost my confidence and put my in a good mood, but then I\u2019d hear one bad thing and it\u2019d ruin my day. I obviously know that I shouldn\u2019t be thinking like this but I don\u2019t know how to avoid it. I could really use some advice.",

How did you keep up with it? Is there a way to be nice to everyone, all the time, and never do anyone wrong?

I barely leave the house, I have no friends (My only \"friends\" are people I used to know online but am now incredibly distanced from them, no interest in getting closer to them again.) \n\nWhenever I try to get a job one of two things happens, I get the job, putting on a front of cheeriness and tiring myself out from it, and end up quitting (Happened twice now), or I get no answer at all.\n\nAnd back to friends, I haven't had any for a long time now, I'm lonely. I almost completely stopped showing up to school in tenth grade, and I wasn't in any social circles. (Ended up going to court for my truancy twice) I'm trans, I already worry about people around me judging me constantly, and my anxiety and inability to hold conversations doesn't help in the slightest.\n\nBut I think my one redeeming point is that I want it to change. Everything wrong is my fault, and I want to change it, but I don't know where to start. How do I get better at conversing with people, and how do I learn the discipline to hold a job?\n\nThanks.",

Every time I try to give him advice, he either already tried it or it doesn\u2019t work on him for whatever reason. He mainly suffers because of my mom, then college, and financial reasons. 2 months ago I had kind of a breakthrough and went down the pant of self improvement. I\u2019ve been mediating, eating healthier, more mindful, I stopped vaping, and generally feeling a lot happier and content. \n\nMe and him have always been good brothers, we\u2019ve had our patches but we always pull through. Lately I\u2019ve been trying to help my brother. I want him to be happy and make him realize that it\u2019s a blessing to be alive, that suicide is not a option. And that he can find happiness in small things, things will get better. But he won\u2019t listen, at least he can\u2019t listen now. I need to change his perception on things. I tried asking him to take up mediation. Or read a book about cognitive behavioral therapy or self improvement. I just can\u2019t get to him. I don\u2019t know what I can do.",

I also want to experience this world in all it's glory while I'm still able to physically and thought I could go about this by travelling in an RV or staying in villages at these places as I visit temporarily. I could also document my journey whether it be through video, audio or text and share that with the world. I could delay the time between university and high school by a few months and maybe focus on this vision I have.\n\nSo I wanted to hear what other people thought about this.

January was the best  month I had in the last 2 years, I used to daily workout/count every  little aspect of my diet/nofap for 40 days/drinking lots of water and  being in a productive mood 247. After the 1st of February, I somehow  ended up doing nothing. After a 3 day break of my healthy life, I  literally fell into a pile of shit. I relapsed from my nofap(I am  masturbating 3-4 times per week), I no longer work out daily (3 times a  week is my thing now), I procrastinate studying so much and the only  thing I keep on working is my business because I love that thing so much  that I am willing to work on it even if I am going to die soon. I want  to be remembered for my work-ethic and do great stuff but I literally  cannot pick up my self (or can I and I am just bs talking to myself?).  So anyway I thought to myself if finding an accountability partner would  help me get over this fucking rut. Is anyone willing to be my  accountability partner/mentor? I am a very optimistic person and even  now writing this post I am sure things will get better I just need a  little boost. Thanks to everyone who read my story, I hope to hear from  someone soon.

            "content": "**TLDR's included in each section. It's definitely a long read, so if you go through it all and wish to help me out, thank you so much!**\n\n***\n###Section 1: Positive changes in the life of /u/TheNoshman13, courtesy of you guys!\n\n\nHello, /r/selfimprovement!\n\nSo, a little bit about me- I'm a 20 year old student in university. I'm Pakistani ethnically, but I consider myself Canadian since I've spent most of my life here. 5'8\", 140 lbs. \n\nFor starters, I want to give a quick shout out to you guys here at /r/selfimprovement. With your help, I've genuinely transformed my life in a way that I'm incredibly happy with. Let me elaborate!\n\nEver since I started browsing this sub nearly two years ago, I've:\n\n* Lost 35 pounds and gone from skinnyfat to skinny.\n\n* Began working out 4/5 days a week since January 2020 and I'm already seeing results- at my heaviest, I could do 1x5 of 225lbs on the deadlift. Now, I can do 3x5 + 2x4 of the same weight! Plus, the muscles are kinda showing on my physique.\n\n* Cleaned up my diet and eat super healthy. \n\n* Follow a sleep schedule where I wake up at 5-6am and sleep at 10-11pm on weekdays, and wake up at 8-9am and fall asleep at 11-12pm on weekends.\n\n* Have had an incredibly successful academic year- in fact, the best I've ever had since coming to university. Not only am I achieving 80+ marks in all my classes, but I've been studying 2 hours a day for the LSAT as well! \n\n* Begun actively taking care of my appearance. I use a face mask once every two weeks, regularly trim my eyebrow and nose hair, shave frequently, etc. on top of having recently done a lot of shopping to transform my winter wardrobe. I get haircuts as needed and I've not had unkempt hair in a very long time. \n\n* I've found a routine that works amazingly for me, and keeps me busy and productive in a good way. Everyday, I wake up early, do LSAT studying before class, fit in gym sometime in the day, and then spend the rest of the day working on projects, studying, etc. Two to three times a week, I play DnD with two different groups of awesome people, and I manage to hang out with friends as well.\n\n* I live off-campus, and I keep my unit looking clean and presentable all the time. My roommate and I clean the entire place once a week, do the dishes daily, pick up after ourselves, etc.\n\nAll in all, I've never been or felt better in my life. I feel like I've got an amazing mix of activities that manage to all complement each other. By making sure studies are my first priority, I've excelled academically; my hobbies all contribute to my enjoyment. Working out is a hobby that keeps me in shape, and DnD is a hobby that allows me to express my creativity. Waking up early lets me get a good start to the day and keep a solid schedule, and I always feel like I get a lot done everyday. My social circle, while small, is filled with friends that I genuinely care for a lot and really, truly enjoy being around. Better to have four quarters than a hundred pennies, right?\n\n**TLDR: Life is going great and I'm very happy with where I am. I'm grooming myself, pursuing hobbies I like, doing well academically, and more. When I look forward I still see a long road ahead of me, but when I look back, I see how far I've come, and the chance to improve even more excites me.**\n\n***\n###Section 2: My desire for external validation through a girlfriend, and how it's affecting my progress\n\nWith all this progress going on, though, I've felt that there is one place that has yet to improve, and this is something that's beginning to seep into other areas of my life and affect me again- the desire for external validation. Specifically, in the form of a girlfriend. \n\nThe problem is that when it comes to my love life, I've always done abysmally. I went to an all-boys school in Pakistan before coming to Canada, and I think that having spent most of my formative years in that space is a big reason as to why I struggle with girls. In high school, I had a thing with a girl who ended up being rather problematic, and we stopped before we even did anything. Another girl I asked out didn't work out as well. \n\nComing to university, I had a few hookups in first year, but I stopped for two reasons: one being that I just didn't enjoy them as much as I thought I would, and the second being that those opportunities no longer present themselves. Although the second reason is definitely the biggest one- after all, I can't *really* say I don't like doing hookups if I don't even have to deal with them in abundance, right?- I just..don't like them. I figured out early on that it was really the physical intimacy I wanted rather than the sex itself. I want to cuddle with someone, dang it! I can jerk off my dick, but I can't jerk off my *heart,* yo!\n\nThere were definitely a few girls I was interested in, but for one reason or another it all failed. I confessed to a girl I had a crush on in first year that I liked her, and she said she didn't feel the same way, but handled it really well; although I was bummed out afterwards, I was proud of myself for having told her, and I was happy that she was able to tell me the truth in a very mature manner. There was another girl as well that I really liked, and we went on a date in first year, but honestly, I fucked that one up pretty bad; she came over so we could pre and party on new years, but I didn't have any hard alcohol, and I just conducted myself in a cringey manner throughout the night..plus, the party we were supposed to go to turned out to be a total dud. Bad times, and one I look back on and accept responsibility for messing up. \n\nAlthough I'm still in contact with both girls, I think I've goofed again, and it's these goofs that have spurred me to make this post. With the ex-crush, we started hanging out since I was able to sort my feelings out and wanted her around as a friend, but I feel like the most recent development has taught me a key lesson about myself. In the interests of privacy I won't share too much, but basically we both agreed that we'd be there to talk to for each other, and when she hadn't been in contact for a bit, I reached out and told her that I was worried and if she was going through something, I'd like for her to talk to me about it. She replied that she felt like that wasn't the right way to go about it, and that while she appreciated it, she felt like this was pressuring her to speak. I, of course, apologised and asked her if she'd like for me to still check in on her. She hasn't replied or looked at the message now and it's been quite some time- she's not interacted with me on social media since, and since we don't have classes together, I don't see her on campus much.\n\nIt definitely stinks and while I want to fix that relationship- because she's genuinely a good person I want around- I learnt a pretty big lesson. I've always been someone who's kind, empathic and willing to listen (total mom-friend energy), but I realised that my problem was that I *extended it to people who I didn't know well.* The fact of the matter was that I just didn't know her well enough to pretend like I could *be* that person for her. I assumed that I could automatically slot myself into that position and that she'd 100% reciprocate, and that's on me. To put it another way, I tried to make the water boil without letting it simmer first.\n\nAs for the other girl, I want to still be friends with her as well, but we haven't had a chance to hang out lately and when I try to reach out, she says she's busy. It stinks, but it is what it is.\n\nOnly problem is..that this is starting to affect me negatively.\n\n**TLDR: Lady troubles. Goofed up with several and feeling suckish.**\n\n***\n\n###Section 3: How it's affecting me, and why I want help in fixing these in a positive way\n\nThe problem is that with these setbacks, I've begun to feel down and sad. My mental health hasn't been the greatest usually- I suffer from ADHD, depression and a minor case of generalized anxiety that stems from the latter- but with all my positive changes going on and some medication, I've been dealing with all of it super well. The only problem is that those last two buggers are always around in some shape or form, and they exacerbate the negativity I feel when it comes to things like this.\n\nRight now, my negative emotions make me feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me, or that there's some fundamental piece of the puzzle I'm missing that's making me fail on one big, human thing- the desire to have someone else in your life. The desire to have someone around who loves you unconditionally. That little voice is telling me that all the improvements in my life and all the good things that are going on simply don't matter, because what's the point of doing them if there's no one else around to appreciate it? That what's the point of having come so far if you're just going to keep going down that road alone? That if you're doing everything right, why haven't you gotten the girl yet? Obviously, this really stinks!\n\nBut I'm not here to vent, /r/selfimprovement: I'm here to do just what the subreddit is for, and *fix this problem and make myself the better man I know I can be.* Two years ago, I was a skinnyfat, depressed kid with bad grades and an awful lifestyle. Now, I'm so much better, and I refuse to give up now! The king inside me exists, and nothing's gonna stop me from manifesting myself! As a result, I've been introspecting, and come across some problems that I've faced:\n\n* I don't put myself in places where I can meet girls. DnD is fun, but it's a closed-group activity, and being the DM, it's an abuse of my power to even *consider* hitting on the girls in my groups.\n\n* Only problem is that I don't know where to *meet* girls. Clubs? Classes? Bars? \n\n* When I meet a girl I like, I automatically start shutting myself down by making mental walls. I start thinking about how it's never gonna work out, the repercussions of asking her out, etc. etc. In other words, I've yet to master *the subtle art of not giving a fuck.*\n\n* When I meet a girl I'm interested in, I develop feelings way too quickly and get crushed when I don't act on them or I do and they refuse! This feeds a negative cycle of doubt and bad energy.\n\n* I've always enjoyed having a close-knit social circle, but what that means is that I don't have the opportunities or chances to have a larger social web that brings plenty of opportunities to be social with it! \n\nSo, as a result, this is what I wish to have addressed, /r/selfimprovement. This, I feel, is the final piece that I'm missing- the final piece that will make me feel like I've gotten everything going right. I've always divided my self-improvement path into three routes: mental, physical, and social. I've got mental and physical down pat, but it's the **social** part that needs fixing. So, these are my questions!\n\n* How do I *build* that larger social web, with only two months left in my third year and one year of university to go? \n\n* How do I *build* genuine self-confidence? One that comes from *true* internal validation without that niggling thought in the back of my mind that says that *internal validation doesn't matter because you're simply RATIONALIZING your failures in your social life?* \n\n* Where can I meet girls, and more importantly, how can I get over these mental hurdles I create and just ask them out? *Most* importantly, assuming they turn me down, how can I keep things chill and normal so I can still have them around in my life? After all, if I liked someone enough to ask them out, it means that they have to be a person who's genuinely a good figure to have in my life!\n\n* In general, *how do I make my social life amazing?* How do I get my end goals fulfilled- those goals being always having people messaging me on snapchat and instagram, knowing that I have people to hang out with every night should I so desire, and knowing that I have plenty of girls in my social circles? \n\n* How do I tailor my personality to continue being the empathic, kind and caring person that I am *without* attempting to force it, whether consciously or unconsciously, onto someone else?\n\n* How can I fix things with the girls I goofed with?\n\n* What other advice, thoughts, or constructive criticisms do you guys have? \n\n***\n\nIf you've gone through the trouble of reading all of this, thank you so much. I have no intention of making this a pity party and I absolutely refuse to do that- I've come too far and done way too much to fall back into that mire of *oh, woe is me, my life is suck, bleh blah bleh.* I've done my best to keep this a post where I'm cognizant of my shortcomings and where I want to succeed, while maintaining the positive energy that's fueled me to such success and such a wonderfully busy life. At the same time, I've done my best to be honest and make it clear that yes, I do want to have a wonderful woman in my life, and I do want a larger web of friends and acquaintances. I've also done my best to be introspective and realise where *I* failed and where *my* shortcomings stemmed from. \n\nSo, there it is, /r/selfimprovement! You've helped me out so much already and I'm incredibly thankful for that. So please help me out again, and perhaps by the time 2021 comes around, I'll be the king that I *know* I can be!",

            "content": "So I've had a rough few months, because I gradually realized that I don't have the ability to tell people what bothers me or to express my opinions on things. Sometimes I don't even have an opinion or notice that I'm bothered by things, because my brain just automatically goes to \"your feelings aren't valid, there's nothing to say\". \n\nGrowing up, I've (f21) was the younger of two siblings and my brother became extremely aggressive towards me and my parents in his teens, which later turned out to be caused by severe depression he was fighting by himself. During that time, I was told to shut up and not talk back to him whenever he got offensive or even violent against me or my parents, so I usually sat in my room crying while my brother was throwing tantrums. This still haunts me now, even though I've moved out (best decision of my life). I've also always been talked over by the adults in my family, so that didn't help build my confidence either. The country I live in doesn't really see mental health as an important thing either, so I never thought about getting therapy.\n\nNow, this didn't affect my success in life I believe. I am studying in university and doing great overall, but as I've been interacting with more people from all kinds of different places (I went to Japan for 2 months by myself when I was 20) I realized how hard it is for me to express when I'm bothered. I usually don't realize until long after the fact that I wasn't okay with something someone said or did to me. And I really don't want to live that way. Same goes with opinions, the opinions I give are usually very adapted to what other people say and my brain sometimes doesn't even go that far to actively think about an opinion of my own.\n\nSo how can I gain the confidence to not just suppress all the feelings and opinions I have? Any advice is greatly appreciated.\n\n\nAlso: I am planning on seeing a therapist about this.",

My parents have always done so much to take care of me to the point of being helicopter parents and it has crippled me. I went through some highly traumatic things a couple years ago that caused me to have to move home and get help and my parents took too much care of me and enabled more bad behavior because they felt bad for me (I could have done more for myself to prevent this, but at the time I was extremely depressed and suicidal) I have since moved out on my own again this December and I\u2019m attending University. I am now a 24 year old woman who is struggling to keep up with basic discipline (cooking, exercise, not procrastinating) I was never a disciplined person and just always made it work and leaned on my family, friends, and relationship. I know that I am very close to becoming who I want to be and I have every opportunity at my footsteps it\u2019s just I always seem to get in my way. I\u2019ll start out at the beginning of the week highly motivated and following through with my good habits, but after about 3 days I begin to slack off to give myself a break which becomes 2 days of doing nothing followed by another two days of scrambling to get everything together and doing the bare minimum. Any tips for changing my mindset? I understand I am in full control and I am not blaming my parents for my situation; it is up to me to improve things. I just need advice to trust myself better and to believe I can stick to my habits and accomplish my goals on my own.",

I started taking Ritalin, but it messed me up (lost lots of weight, became underweight, bad social anxiety, depressive episodes). \n\nI went to college to start studying engineering but didn't even make it through the first semester. I got kicked out. Started studying Media Design afterwards, but the same thing happened.\n\nI now study business and I did make it through the first year. Mainly because it is easier and more interesting, but god, it was hard. \n\nI suck at time management, I never get anything done. It is ruining my life. I have so many dreams of starting/leading a business, making a mostly passive income and traveling all over the world, but I feel like I will never get there. I tried everything.\n\nSetting smart goals (never stuck to them, lost motivation)\n\nWaking up earlier (I just can't get out of bed!!!)\n\nPlanning (I spend more time planning than actually doing)\n\nTaking meds (I took Ritalin for several years and it messed me up. Honestly too scared shitless to take any other psychoactive prescription drug ever again)\n\nMy parents are Indian. Mental health is underfunded in India and not really acknowledged.  My parents weren't raised with the concept of mental health and mental disorders. They see it as an excuse, often call me lazy, dumb, sometimes useless. When I was diagnosed my mother legit thought I was retarded and couldn't do anything on my own or get married. -\\_-\n\nLuckily I don't live with them anymore and my mental health is okay, I guess. \n\nI'm pretty much independent now. I can do the household, pay rent and cook for myself even though my mother thought I could never do that sh\\*t.\n\nI'm doing okay in college, but I always procrastinate and study last minute. I have to resit 50% of all my exams. I feel like I can do so much more than this. \n\nEvery day I feel tired and sluggish. I'm always tired. I daydream ALL THE TIME and have literally no control. I just can't get myself to study because I just know I'll get distracted anyway. Most of the time I just lay in bed and do nothing. \n\nI know what most of you are going to suggest: \n\nExercise/Meditate: I never stick to a habit!\n\nEat healthily: I'm trying!\n\nTry other psychoactive prescribed meds: HELL to the NOPE\n\nDiscipline yourself: How?\n\nI heard caffeine + L-theanine can be great for focus and to calm a racing mind. I ordered some. I hope they will help me focus and not daydream as much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice? What helped you become more disciplined? Do you have ADHD/ADD and how do you manage?",

If anything, I can take as much time as I need with my tasks.\n\nThat's not me saying, exercise for an hour and then do not exercise again for another month, because you have all the time to sort your health out.\n\nWhat I really mean is this :\n\nDue to having lots of tasks to accomplish, people confuse their busy schedule with a lack of time. Therefore they do not put their full potential into their current activity. Even in times where there are no strict deadlines, people will forget this and act as fast as they can, either for quick results or to lessen their busy schedule.\n\nHowever, realising that you have more time allows you to sit, think and put that extra effort into getting better results. Just because you do not get immediate results, it's not a reason to give up or feel bad about yourself.\n\nAs you work into the mindset of taking your time and not rushing, you'll have more time to notice even the smaller results, more time to think through the ways you are able to achieve your goals and eventually, you'll end up with more time getting to learn about yourself and love what you have achieved.\n\nDon't rush through your life because of your busy schedule. Take your time, even if accomplishing what you need means you take one baby step at a time, you'll get to the same place you wanted to, it may take a little longer, but the results you get will be stronger.\n\nI hope this helps even one person, someone who may be like me and not realising they were rushing even the most basic of tasks.\n\nSince I have started applying this over the past year, I have managed to accomplish the tasks I used to give up on, such as:\n\nEating regularly and healthier, giving up smoking, giving up weed, creating my own business, testing some crazy ideas and experiments... But most importantly loving myself more for the things I have achieved\n\n\nNow, I am not saying this ONE thing will change your life.\n\nBut if you start taking your time combined with a few other elements of productivity and self discipline, you'll be working at a steady pace to where you want to end up...\n\nMinus the stress which comes with it\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this\n\n(I suffer with Crohns disease and Arthritis, which many doctors believe stress can have a massive impact on)",

            "title": "Been fighting a very strong temptation and possible addiction. Need words of encouragement.",
            "content": "Hi all,\n\nI have been having a problem with fighting a temptation to see sex workers. I am from Canada. I had been a 25 year old dude who had been a virgin until last month when I couldn't stand not knowing what sex was like anymore and ended up going to a massage parlour and lost my virginity to a masseuse. The next day, I went to the same parlour and had sex with another masseuse. I vowed never to do it again. I also felt like absolute shit after it.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, I had the urge to see a sex worker again. I think it may have been a dangerous the fact that my brain now knew how easy it is to get sex by paying for it and was needing another fix (the reward system kicking in and discovering a new stimulus other than masturbation to porn). It is reasonable to think that this was the early stages of a possible addiction. The urges were, indeed, quite strong that I actually ended up booking an escort for an outcall to my residence. She ended up cancelling an hour before the session because she said she was feeling sick. I was so anticipating it and was so horny but I guess it was a good thing at the end of the day because this weakness (of hiring a sex worker) that I had failed to control ended up not happening altogether and now I could go on with my progress, feel great about it in the process, and at least won't spend the rest of week feeling like the shittiest person on the planet. However, the very next day, she emailed apologizing for what happened and asked me if I want to reschedule for the night. I can't describe how hard it was to fight the temptation to reschedule (it was just a few keyboard letters away) and my brain was trying to justify it (\"just do it; you will be a few hours away from sex and you waited so long yesterday and spent your entire day cleaning your whole place for this\"). What made it harder was the damn pictures which I should have never looked at. It was also the weekend. I was so alone and had nothing planned. But, I ended up not doing it thankfully.\n\nI thought to myself. You have been given another chance when she cancelled. And, it is going to be $400 for 1.5 hrs. That is incredibly expensive and totally not worth it. With $400, sooo many constructive things could be done instead (I could work on myself/buy books/ gain knowledge/work on self-improvement/ buy nice clothes/contribute to causes/ make difference in people's lives/travel/pay bills etc). $400 could be better used to do so much to my own self-improvement as opposed to be wasted on a few moments of pleasure that will not feel like they were worth it at the end of the day and fake/artificial assurances of being desired by someone who probably does not give a fuck about you. Not to mention, paying for sex is a crime in Canada (generally police don't care about adult prostitution but you never know what may happen). I told myself my urges are being exploited to make so much money and by doing this, I am increasingly succumbing to a possible addiction, nurturing it further, and increasingly entrenching in my brain a self-fulfilling prophecy that I will never be desired unless I pay copious amounts of money for it which may end up reducing my self-confidence and self-worth even further and, thus, hamper my abilities to find a relationship because I will keep telling myself I am not good enough and I am a worthless person who has to pay money to be made to feel loved in this very fake way. I thought to myself it is not too late to find someone who actually loves and who cares deeply about you if you even if you are 25 and have never been in a relationship before.\n\nThankfully, after much deliberation, I ended up not doing it. It was so so tough to fight it. Yet, all these thoughts as well as encouragements by users online not to do it thankfully prevented me from going down this path once more. I replied back yesterday, saying that I had decided against rebooking. Instead, I went to the gym, visited a library, bought some wonderful books to read, contacted some friends I had not reconnected with in a while, took a nice walk outside. And, I feel so great about myself and the fact I was able to exercise self-control in this respect. If I had gone with booking, I probably would have spent rest of week or month in disgust about myself, been $400 poorer, and would have enforced a further poor conception of my self-worth and self-esteem in the process.\n\nNow, I think I need to stop even thinking about the very idea of escorts. Even thinking about it wastes much of my time that I could spend doing so many other things. I think I am beginning to master the art of fighting this temptation. Last week, I also felt the urge to visit a massage parlour again but I averted it. The urge to do this sort of things decreases the further I learn how to block it.\n\nAlso, it helps me so much to ward off this temptation when more people encourage me not to do it or congratulate me on my progress. I have found people on reddit advising me not to do it to be one of the most helpful mechanisms of fighting it. So, if you have any words of encouragement or even more advice on how to fight this urge if it comes back, I would greatly appreciate it.",

            "title": "How do I just \"not care\"?",
            "content": "Yesterday I tried to commit suicide, but I couldn't physically withstand the pain of ending my life. I tried suffocating, then stood outside my porch to no avail.\u00a0 I can't control myself anymore. \n\n\nI want to learn how to become a husk, I don't want to feel emotions anymore. Boredom, envy, frustration, shame, terror, I don't want it anymore. If I can't change my circumstance, at least I want to be hollow.\n\n\nFor the longest time now, I worked out of fear alone. It's all anyone ever tells me. If I don't, my future will be in ruins and I'll die, I'll be worthless, I'll be humiliated. There's people in the world who have to do back breaking labor to save their lives, toughen up.\n\n\nTo manage I tried to keep a growth mindset so that I could approach things with curiosity, but it's been chipped away with the constant bullying I've faced. No one interacts with me, I constantly hear people describing me as \"slow, below average, mediocre, r*t*rded, talentless\" with no remorse. It's draining enough working hard, but to be seen as \"inferior\" to my peers when I'm just trying to do as I'm told makes me feel pathetic. Sometimes I wonder if I'm even a person but rather a caricature. If I died, or suggested dying, nobody would truly care besides guilt.\u00a0\n\n\nNobody cares about my feelings. I ask my parents and at best, they tell me to suck it up, at best. During breakdowns, I'm simply yelled at. \"Stop the tantrums, it's all in your mind.\"\n\nI'm not even allowed to go to therapy because they don't want any \"unnecessary blemishes\" on my record.\u00a0 I got sick once and the medicine didn't help me at all, and I was constantly vomiting food. My parents would tell at me to fight it, till they thought I was bulmic, after which they simply said it was a \"teenage thing\" and every time I vomited I would be scolded. I had to explain so that I could get new medication and finally get rid of the pain. But it hurt more that the sheer idea of a mental issue was completely ignored.\n\n\n\nI was constantly tense, doing as I was told, yet despite my efforts I'm constantly\u00a0 being mocked by others. Failure hits like a knife, envy suffocates me, feeling like I'm stuck in a box that I can't improve, and already feeling disappointed with my progress makes me truly feel empty. I ask myself; why, then?\n\n\nNothing is backing up my fear, as there's nothing about myself I truly want to defend. The world is unnecessarily cruel, forcing\u00a0 constant loop of labor no matter what in order to survive, but why do I stand it? Just because I'm too afraid of the pain of dying. I feel trapped.\u00a0 I feel like I'm stuck in a costume, I've never felt right looking at myself, being myself. Being addressed at all makes me uncomfortable. People I've talked to said I probably have gender dysphoria, but it doesn't even matter.\u00a0 I can't be the person I want to be with my family's values. There's nothing about me I like or value. I only do anything to avoid shame and being made to feel more worthless than I already do, yet fail constantly and fall into hopelessness.\n\n\n\nI wish I could live a truly apathetic life if it has to be like this and I have so little control. I don't want to feel anymore, I just want to drone about. No more fear and shame, no more gnawing boredom, questioning how long I can do things I hate based on fear when I don't have something I'm defending in the first place. I wish I could live on a blank slate, I don't need high self esteem, I need nothing at all; no ego, no esteem, nothing. I just want to be free of this constant shame.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'm afraid. I'm so afraid. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of living in this dictomy of smart= worthy human being and dumb = worthless. I'm tired of knowing my parents investment in my future is only because they believe that I'm \"smart\" despite pushing myself to the bone, and if I show I'm hurting they'll give up on me. I'm tired of having to have my efforts or others efforts constantly compared to one another. \"Sure, but he's smarter\" \"he's more talented\" \"he's talentless.\" I don't like the measures of talent and intelligence because it notates the fixed mindset; if someone is said to be more talented or smarter than me, what can I do if that's innate? It hurts so much, I feel so inferior\u00a0 and anxious hearing it. What can I do at that point? It's like a branding,like I'm stuck in a box where the said \"superior\" person sits on no matter how hard I push against it. Why do I work anymore? And to hear people call me slurs, that I'm \"mentally handicapped\", \"ret*rded\", I crawl even further into my hole of wanting to do nothing. I'm made to feel that my efforts are burdens. Why did I have to make that post, why did I have to talk to the teacher, I should've been able to do it on my own. Why did I need to reread the information from the book so much? I should be able to visualize the topic. I feel like a leech, that my growth mindset is just a sad excuse to keep on kicking and regain control despite knowing I'm incompetent and that clearly I'm not good enough to truly grasp any of this and that I'm just annoying everyone in my constant questions under the guise of \" curiosity and desire for a second opinion\", I'm completely wrong and too stupid to figure it out myself, which is why I have to ask.\n\n\u00a0I hate having to live with that thinking. I wish I could just do my own thing without any competition and constricting labels. Yet, everyone seems to accept this way of thinking so easily, like it doesn't even matter how hurtful it feels to have to work so hard and swallow my pride only to have someone tell me I'm fighting against fate, and to deal with their behavior towards me based on that, feeling like I'm nothing and having someone else actually say it. At least, I wish I could be a husk that didn't care. No feelings or ego, just constant work.\u00a0",

            "title": "Why can\u2019t I be happy?",
            "content": "\nNot really sure where to start this or what is wrong with me.\n\nGuess I\u2019ll start with a general overview of my life. I\u2019m in my early 30s, living alone, been dating the same guy for about 7 months, and just started a new job about 3 months ago. From the outside, this is everything I\u2019ve wanted. But I\u2019m not happy. \n\nEveryday I wake up I look at the clock to determine how much \u201cfree\u201d time I have. On the weekends, I\u2019ll wake up try to assess if I have any plans that day, then deduce how much time I\u2019ll have alone.  Work days are even worse. I wake up at 530, immediately feel anxious about work, and wish more than anything I didn\u2019t have to go to work. Once I\u2019m at work it\u2019s pretty much non stop watching the clock. \n\nI should explain a little more about the job. I\u2019ve recently made a huge move from working retail since I was teenager, to now working an office job. From the outside it is everything I thought I wanted. A Monday-Friday job working 7-4. But it\u2019s been overwhelming. It\u2019s scary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said that yet. I\u2019m really fucking scared I won\u2019t pick this stuff up. It\u2019s a small to mid sized company and it\u2019s a field I have 0 experience in. The guy I am seeing actually facilitated me getting the job.  Some days are okay but 3 months in I still feel scared, overwhelmed, lonely. Like I finally got what I wanted but I\u2019m scared I don\u2019t like it.  I\u2019m also scared it\u2019s too soon to tell.   Then I think I should go with my gut. An overall problem here is that I have pretty much 0 idea what i \u201cwant to do with my life\u201d\n\nWhen I leave work it\u2019s another race against the clock. Okay, if I leave right at 4 I can get home by 5, that gives me 4.5 hours to do whatever I want. The problem is all I ever want to do is nothing. Literally when I\u2019m at work I\u2019m counting down the time til I can go home, lay in bed or on my couch, and play on my tablet. If a friend asks me to hang out or go to dinner it almost feels like a burden because I\u2019d probably rather be doing nothing. Then inevitably that leads to loneliness. I don\u2019t know how to let go of \u201cmy time.\u201d  I\u2019m constantly anxious about getting my alone time. I also love to get a lot of sleep so I usually go to bed at 9:30.  \n\nI just feel lost. I thought I\u2019d feel so much better once I got over the hump of not working retail but I feel like I\u2019ve lost more than I\u2019ve gained. I don\u2019t want a job that requires me to work 10-12 hours a day. I just want to be comfortable and have a \u201cnormal\u201d job.  I\u2019ve lost my social circle retail provided. I just feel like even when I get what I wanted I can\u2019t be happy. \n\nI\u2019m not sure about the guy I\u2019m seeing either. I\u2019m at the age where I shouldn\u2019t be just dating to date, but if I want to have children I really need to be sure. And the element of us working together in a small environment adds to anxiety about both the job and the relationship. \n\nI have no motivation to pick up a hobby, and besides that would infringe on my \u201cdoing nothing time.\u201d  I don\u2019t think I know how to \u201clive in the moment\u201d or simply be satisfied with what I have. I want to be happy I just don\u2019t know how.  Sometimes I just hate everything about myself. Every decision I\u2019ve made that\u2019s has brought me here. All the wrong decisions I\u2019ve made. All the what if\u2019s. \n\nI feel so lost and overwhelmed and the idea of feeling this way for the rest of my life is terrifying. A lot of this probably didn\u2019t make sense and I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this.",

            "content": "Throwaway account. I am a 28 y/o female. When I was a teenager, my bipolar and alcoholic mother (that also did drugs) became physically and emotionally abusive towards me.\n\nIt's not super relevant to the primary issue beyond some context. She started with hitting, then graduated to dragging me up two flights of stairs by my hair (my scalp would be sore the next day), grabbing me and shoving me into walls and not letting go. Threatening to physically harm me. Any attempt at defense or fighting back resulted in her telling the whole family I attacked her and was crazy or pretending to call the police. I often did not fight back because I didn't want to hurt my mother, I loved her when she was sober. Later as a 17 y/o I attempted to push her back from my door so I could close it, so she threw me into a wall and choked me. I was arrested for making the initial contact and went jail/court.\n\nEmotionally; she started by telling me the family didn't want me, no one would take me when she asked. Said I'd be put up for adoption and she hoped I was raped there. Telling me I was ugly and fat. I was 105 pounds and 5'3. When cops were called she'd say they were only taking my side because I was young and pretty. \n\nI was occasionally kept from school as a punishment. Screamed at for hours, in college it went from 6 pm until 6 am, standing in my room while I attempted to do my homework and ignore her with music. I would hold my doorknob for hours because I didn't have a lock, so she couldn't get in. Accused of sleeping with her boyfriend, my door was tied shut with a rope attached to her door for one night. \n\nThe brainwashing came in when she would tell me consistently that I would never be able to leave. We were poor, section 8 housing, food stamps, SSI etc. She had me convinced that I could never afford school to get a better job, could never afford to move out or own a car. I was made to believe I needed her to survive. I did move in with my dad in my early 20's but got very sick and was hospitalized and my mom came in saying I needed to move back in because my dad couldn't care for me until I got better. I did and ended up staying. Funny because later when both of my legs became infected and I couldn't walk, I remember calling her for 20 minutes because I needed a drink until I gave up and went to get it myself, felt like I was walking on tiny knives and had to tip toe past her and she did not care or offer help. As much as she was abusive, she didn't want me to leave. I was 26 experiencing 6 months of unemployment and having achieved nothing more than a liberal arts associates degree and retail work experience. \n\nMy LDR boyfriend at the time then became my only way out. The only way I'd ever leave was when we got married and I moved to him. Didn't happen, he dumped me and was also extremely emotionally abusive and disgusting to me when over a year later I was hanging out with someone I'd been on one date with. Irrelevant story though.\n\nI finally found the strength, with actually some encouragement from my mom, to go to university for a bachelor's. She made it extremely stressful, but that is also not relevant to this issue \n\nI flew through the semesters as fast as I could, straight A's with an occasional B. I was on my way. That guy I was friends with became a huge support and inspiration. He encouraged me to move out and told me I COULD do it. So I did. I'd had savings that could help me until I graduated and could find a real full time job. Then I told my mom (I'd hid it for a while) that I was moving out and into a house with roommates.\n\nThe demands for money came (this was also a common theme, she wanted my money AND I had to lie about what I had to keep any of it). She had wracked up $500 in credit card debt on my card (which I ended up paying myself and she denied ever doing). She barracaded me in my room and I had to call the police to get out. She later called police on me because I was asleep and ingnoring her (for a \"wellness check).\n\nShe had spent years convincing me I was not capable of achieving anything more than section 8 and food stamps. But I moved out, bought her boyfriend's car in one payment, graduated with a 3.8 GPA and was working 7 days a week and was finally on my own.\n\nMy problem now: I can not let go of the fact that my life started so late. My life has begun at 28 when all my friends are starting at 22/23/24. I am on my way to owning a rental property, I still work 7 days a week to make a decent salary but it's my routine and I am okay with it for now. I am self sufficient but I am not happy.\n\nI am jealous and angry my boyfriend (the same guy that I dated back then) and my best friend/friends are all younger and achieving the same or more than me. I want to create a social media presence with a friend that is doing this for herself but feel I'm now too old. I am so jealous and mad and I don't know how to let go of the anger that I should have been doing all this at 24 not 28. \n\nI'm angry with myself for not doing all this sooner and waiting until 26. I'm angry at my mom. And worse, I know this anger is hindering me. Some things, like what I want for social medias for example, I feel I am too old for now. I have so many ideas and things I want to achieve, like traveling, but just feel it's too late or I'm just angry that I'm starting it so late. So, I don't do it or I put it off and then I get frustrated again because I'm only getting older.\n\nI have been to councelling for other issues, but have always been disappointed and did not find any help in it other than just talking about it and I'd rather not go to effort to make it to appointments if the only benefit is to verbalize my frustration. I can do that without copays.\n\nI can't let go of my anger and frustration and just be happy.\n\nTl;Dr my mom was abusive and convinced me my whole life that I could never be or have more than government assistance. At 26 I realized she was wrong and at 28 I have a good job, am self sufficient, looking at investing in real estate, have a positive relationship, but am unhappy and hindering myself because I am only now achieving this at 28 when friends and boyfriend all started this at 23/24. I am jealous and angry that I am not starting younger and stopping myself from moving ahead with some of my goals because I feel I am too old and only getting older.",

Looks wise I think I'm ok, I've gotten good remarks and recently had some girl gave me her phone number without saying or asking anything. She was like only a 6,5 though, never did anything with it though. I workout and although it could be better, I think I look ok. Two things that keep going on in my mind is the fact I am completely gray and I'm only 5\"8. It affects my mental well being a lot.  \n\n\nThe reason I post this is because I can not conquer my own mind. I tend to let external events affect my mood. For example: I've been texting this girl, she's very cute, when she texts me or says something nice, I feel on top of the world. This feeling only lasts for like 10-30 minutes. After that I start to feel worse again. Then she texts again and all is good for a while. If I see her in real life and see her talkin to another guy,  \nI feel like \\*\\*\\*\\*. If I caught her looking, it's good for a few minutes. If she doesn't text for a day, I tend to think I just suck and I've ruined it somehow, that she'll never want me. Other examples: when people are having a good time without me, I feel bad and sadly when people  \n(who I envy or hate) have some bad luck, I feel better as well.  \n\n\nI can not feel good just by myself.  \n\n\nI know I need to change my mindset, but I don't know how. I've recently started to do some extreme sports, drive with my car on circuits and workout even harder. Although I all love it, I still come home and feel the same useless loser. Then something happens, I feel good (or even much worse) for a while and it's all over again. I know it's impossible to keep riding \"a high\" constantly, but I'm fed up with my lows, I know it's not worth it to feel like this. Unfortunately so many external events have pushed me into this.",

But 4 years of math, and analytical thinking have seemingly destroyed what once was a big part of my personality. I struggle to come up with words and often cannot properly express ideas. I have struggled with depression and have assumed that this was just a symptom of that, however I have a litteral foggy numb feeling in my forehead (almost like being buzzed after a few beers) I've considered the possibility of a brain tumor, lymes disease, or fatty liver (which runs in my family) but got laughed at by a doctor who chocked it up to depression. \n\nI guess this is a long winded way of asking, what is the best way to regain my clarity, intuition, and persuasive/strategic abilities? Perhaps it's because I have stopped reading, writing, and drawing to focus on math, science, and calculations? \n\nI have considered forcing myself to do book reports, or to take a creative writing class (things that I didn't mind at all in highschool, and actually quite enjoyed).

I could tell you about being sectioned, sleeping rough with a knife and completely losing my head, i could tell you about lots of things that have happened but it doesn't matter now as i want to look FORWARD. I want to stop being such a waste of space.\n\nIn the past few years i found myself a girlfriend and shes great, we have a wonderful relationship. I have grown SO much emotionally the last 3 years. I deal with my emotions so much better, care much less about what  people think, i'm better with my word, i'm nicer, i'm no longer bitter, i'm more empathetic and overall just feel like i'm a hugely better person. I actually like myself now.\n\nI cut down massively on drinking.  I've gone from 30-35 pints a week to just 4 or 5 on a Saturday night. I've quit smoking. I even go to the gym 4 times a week and managed to keep that up for a whole year.\n\nI currently claim benefits and always pay equally in our household but she keeps up this lie that i work to everyone and it makes me feel ashamed.

Some days i have all the energy and other days i'm so short of breath and fatigued with it all, the foulest of tastes in my mouth and the feeling like my insides are bleeding. I'm currently going back to the GP trying to get things sorted again, or at least some sort of proper diagnosis. I'm more equipped to follow the doctors advice now my heads in a better place.\n\nThe next step for me seems to be getting a job but after 10 years out its so intimidating. I want to be a valuable part of the community for a change, i want to respect myself fully. There's still a LOT of days i don't feel well enough to work but can i really live like a waster for the rest of my life? I'm 30. I wish i could magic up some amazing online business but i'm all out of ideas. Coming off benefits scares the life out of me incase i just can't handle it and regress again.\n\nCan anyone give me any advice?",

            "content": "This is probably not the right place to post this but I don't know where else to post in terms of a subreddit.\n\nLengthy story so bare with me.\n\nAs the title says, I am in need of a roommate before the end of the week. (Trying to get my lease renewal due date extended) I am a recent college graduate, graduated May 2019, that is working part time on campus through a temp service part time as a Administrative Support. $13/hr, 20 hours/week. I have been building experience doing administrative support work since I was a work study student the year prior to graduation and has been working administrative support work part time ever since. My major is Information Systems Management and yes, it has been a difficult time finding employment full time with it. Probably due to my resume and cover letter which has since been revised many times recently to fit the position that I have been applying. Since I was living with my best friend for 6+ years, we don't usually want someone that we don't know as roommates which having strangers as roommates is typical but still. We live in a duplex for 3 so sometimes we have a friend who needs to stay for a year or so to reduce rent and utilities. With 3, rent is 300 per month with about 70-120 in utilities. With my roommate and I, it is 450 per month for rent with 110-150 in utilities.\n\nI had everything planned out for renewal. When I asked my roommate this week, he said he can't due to student loans he is paying back and the fact that his girlfriend's parents gave him a better deal- living in the spare room at her place for 450. That includes rent AND utilities. Mean way of saying overall is that, i got left on a boat without a paddle and i didn't bring a spare paddle. I tried persuading and negotiating with him but to no avail. I have asked friends if they can fill the spot to no avail. I am stuck to either pay the whole place to myself which is no more than 1200 per month, which my pay alone isn't going cover that let alone my student loans or move back to my parents. And yes, i do understand my roommate's situation. I have been dealing with something similar over the years.\n\nLiving with my parents is very toxic. My dad borrows money from everyone, even his own kids to help make up his pay as a cook on bills. He also makes tons of credit cards to help pay but that is just digging up a hole. My mom does nails and is too lazy to even look for a better pay job. I can't stand living with them again other than on holidays.\n\nI know what yall are asking. Why am I so invested on staying and working part time on campus? Because 1, I am close to getting some actual training needed to be better desired in positions that I applied for that wants those experience like Kronos and Banner and 2, I am invested on staying in my college town and finding full time employment there.\n\n3 as a bonus, losing months of investment I had just to throw it all away when moving back will hurt to the point of no return. I am a very sensitive emotional guy. It already hurts when I got the news about the lease and it still hurts.\n\nI am scrambling in finding another person or finding a 1 bedroom place that has close to the amount i am currently paying. I even asked the lease company for another extension. (Waiting on a response in the morning)\n\nSo my question is this: Should I stay or should i move back home where it is nothing but depression and toxicity? If I stay, how should I go by in staying? Continue to search for someone or find a 1 bedroom?\n\nWith how much i make now, it is better for me to find a roommate than to move in to a 1 bedroom, financially speaking.\n\nBut, I need guidance. This is the pivotal point of where my career should be heading.\n\nCurrent lease expires in July so that is when my roommate is moving out. New contract lease is due by the end of the week unless i get another extension.\n\nThank you all for reading. I will take any advice to heart but please be gentle.",

            "content": "A few years ago, I was a very driven person and achieving a lot. Solid routines, great physical shape, very healthy diet, working a lot and making good money, meditating rigorously, growing social circle, pulling girls, lots of creativity, and helping others a lot.\n\nBut something weird happened. The more progress I made, the less I cared. Whenever I reached a goal, it would just be like \"Ok. Is this it? Now what?\"\n\nAnd I realized more and more that when I asked myself WHY I was doing these things, I couldn't find a real answer. When I set my goals, it was never *\"YES! THIS! I MUST HAVE IT!\"* but rather just *\"Yeah, this sounds pretty cool.\"* But that gradually changed into *\"I guess I could do this\"* and then *\"Eh, whatever, I guess.\"*\n\nThe more progress I made, the more disillusioned I became. The rewards just didn't feel rewarding. It didn't excite me, and I didn't care. It felt like chasing my own tail, just trying to prove myself or something, rather than actually going after something I want. And it felt more and more like I don't want anything, or at least I don't know what anymore.\n\nSo my discipline and motivation slowly faded. I still kept making lots of money and creative stuff and staying in decent shape, but everything else just withered. I went into hermit mode and lost all my friends. And to be honest, I didn't care. I didn't feel a loss or a need to reconnect or find new ones. Trying to make new plans for anything, I just pulled a blank. *\"Eh, nah, not really worth it.\"*\n\nAt one point, I felt a strong urge to travel. At the same time, I met a girl who also had that urge, and we fell in love. It was exciting for a while, but it faded. We grew tired of the nomadic life and of each other. And I was more disillusioned than ever.\n\nOver time, I lost everything. Went from rich to broke, from strong to weak, from loved to lonely, and so on. And I really couldn't seem to give a fuck. Trying to rebuild life is hard when you can't seem to get excited or care about the goals you set. There's no fuel.\n\nThey say losing everything shows you what it is you want. That hasn't happened for me. All I know is that I don't want to be where I'm currently at.\n\nLetting go of everything hasn't changed it. Cutting out all vices and fasting for days while doing nothing hasn't given me any insight into what I need to do. Spending years in freefall didn't reveal my calling or passion.\n\nDelving in and facing my fears hasn't fixed me. It seems like even that \"fight or flight\" response doesn't trigger much. I've been close to dying a few times, and that supposedly shows people what they need to do, but I didn't feel compelled to do anything. Even going on spirit quests with absurd amounts of psychedelics didn't trigger any callings.\n\nI just want to feel alive and care about things, but it doesn't happen. Like something's missing in there or doesn't work.\n\nIt's weird. I have opportunities to pursue what I was once passionate about. I want to get away from where I am.  There are women showing interest in me. And so on. And yet, I can't seem to give a damn. It all feels meaningless. Pointless. None of it appeals to me anymore, not beyond that initial temporary surface spark. Like my cylinders just won't ignite, so to speak.\n\nWhenever I go for it, I end up at that point of *\"Is this all there's to it?\"* and *\"WHY am I doing this?\"*\n\nDoes anyone here have similar experiences and advice?",

It was scary, the thought of being the one to bring my husband and I into hard times. I felt so bad, worthless and embarrassed i didn't want to tell anyone what happened.\n\nI spent a few days feeling really bad for myself. Letting my depression get the better of me by applying for jobs on my phone while laying in bed and not doing anything for 3 days.\n\nEventually I let myself cry while my husband hugged me and he told me he wasn't upset, that we would make it through together, that we would be okay. I ended up finding a job in a little under a week. I reached out to my friends and told them what happened, they were all there for me and let me lean on them. Neither my parents or my in-laws made me feel bad or stupid. \n\nI guess I'm writing this because I wanted to tell someone that it's okay to let yourself be sad and depressed. You don't have to carry your burdens on your own, that's what friends are for. It's okay to be sad and to push yourself to keep going, acknowledge your sadness but don't let it control you. \n\nReading posts on here helped me feel like I wasn't alone. Reading comments on other people's posts somehow felt like they were also speaking to me. I never posted on here but still this community helped me without ever even directly speaking to me. So thank you. \n\nJust a little side note: My new job is in a field I've always dreamed of being in, with better company culture. I feel like I will fit in well and look forward to starting soon.

I'm popular at work and make lots of people laugh. People keep telling me how highly intelligent I am and how outspoken I am. I'm being tapped for leadership positions. I pick up musical instruments very quickly compared to the average student (what I've been told by teachers). I also used to compose very advanced pieces. I get to exercise my programming skills outside of work (modding games, creating gaming content that doesn't exist elsewhere). I've released edm tracks onto labels before and had some decent DJs play my music. I put on some incredible performances of Bach Fugues from WTC, AoF, Rach C# Minor Prelude. I have a ultra wide screen monitor and full sim racing setup + full flight sim setup. I lived in another country for a year. I've had great sex.\n\nMy friends and family envy what I have and looking back there are so many accomplishments in my life that made me go 'wow, i can't believe i did that'. Yet all of this is just cheap highs. Success feels meaningless to me. There's always more to do, more to reach for, more growth. But to be honest I'm tired of success. Success feels like the hedonic treadmill. I've achieved success financially, artistically, professionally, inter-personally, creatively - all different categories and areas of life, yet the emptiness never goes away.\n\nIt's not all sunshine and rainbows though - I'm terribly addicted to cigarettes (made over 16 serious quit attempts with various medications and techniques only to relapse). I think I might have a weed and porn addiction. I'm inactive and out of shape. I'm addicted to chocolate. I don't see beauty in nature nor beauty in the human experience. I feel like I have nothing left to prove or offer in this world. I feel all used up. I'm nihilistic. I have chronic depression and apathy (3rd time getting depression since I was 18 - i have been in therapy 3 times).\n\nI just wish I could speak to some sort of higher power that could tell me what I do next. There's nothing in this world I really want to do anymore. I've traveled enough for my own satisfaction, I've met enough people in my life and don't feel interested in other peoples struggles or inspirations.\n\nI honestly wondering if this is a sign that I'm going to die soon.\n\nWhat do I do?

            "title": "How I do things when I'm super lazy/unmotivated.",
            "content": "**Intro**\n\nA few days ago I posted a thread explaining how I managed to develop any habit I wanted to. A few people on Reddit dm'd me, and also in real life asking me what I do on days where ''I really feel discouraged and lack of motivation''. I'm making this thread to explain to you how I do it.\n\n**How to stay motivated**\n\nFirst I want to say that I do things despite my lack of motivation. Motivation isn't going to get me anywhere because it's almost never there. So here's a step by step guide on how I get myself to do things.\n\n1. Make a photo album of your current house, car, stuff you like, neighborhood and so on.\n2. Next to those photo's make an album of the house, car, stuff, neighborhood you want and hang it somewhere in your house. Make sure it confronts you everyday.\n3. Write down exactly what you need to do *every single day of your life* to accomplish this goal\n4. Develop your name + demon, a person you imagine in your head that does all this stuff and doesn't take a day off. And this demon is *guaranteed* to reach all the goals you want to reach.\n5. Every time you feel like taking a day off think of that self imposed demon ''well \\[yourname\\]demon is working out right now he or she IS getting the goals I want to reach. he or she IS getting the goals I Want because this person IS doing the work. and I WONT get it unless I do exactly what this demon does.  Never let this demon win, because only by mimicking this demon, you *will* reach your goals.\n6. Make sure to really envision this demon in your head running the exact track you're supposed to run. envision this demon to study the books you want to study. This makes it feel more real and triggering.\n\n**My example**\n\n(Make sure to add real images)!!!\n\n|*Current me*|*Future me*|What habit will I do daily?|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|A Gazelle Bicycle|A Tesla Model S P100D|Studying finance/economics 2+ hours a day / implementing in stock market.|\n|An old rusty appartement in Rotterdam|A beautiful house in Busan|Studying finance/economics 2+ hours a day / implementing in stock market.|\n|A round belly|A six pack|Work out 7 hours a week.|\n|A low income 9-5 job|Working from home, making \u20ac5k/month+|Studying finance/economics 2+ hours a day / implementing in stock market.|\n|Biting nails|Not biting nails|Polishing nails with anti nail biting polish|\n\nWhat your goals are doesn't matter. As long as thinking about it makes you drool. Make it so good that you're like. If this is what I have ''I am the happiest person alive. note: these aren't how I wrote it but just to give you an example. Don't be abstract with your own goals.\n\n**Why a ''demon''?**\n\nSo I imagine this demon as this annoying guy who will *definitely* reach all my goals. Man this demon is so annoying, I can't stand him. Because I know for a fact this demon will reach everything I ever dreamed of. And he never takes a day of. Only in case of sickness or injuries. So every time I think about this demon it kills me. I can't stand the demon working harder than me. So I work harder than this demon. I will never make this self-imposed demon out work me. PERIOD.\n\n**How to write a new habit**\n\nNever write in abstract form. Always write exactly what your 7 day a week plan is. Don't write ''I want to be healthy'' write instead: I will never drink sugared drinks again, and will work out x amount of hours a week with the exclusion of being sick. Then write down what it will make you feel like and how it will affect your life if you reached your goal.\n\n**Last but not least**\n\nDo not add more than one habit per (30-60) days. You will definitely burn out. First make sure your next goal is a habit before you move on to the next thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOwn your inner demon!",

I'm a cashier at a grocery store that pays very well, but I hate working there. It's not fulfilling, I've been with the company for nearly three years and haven't been promoted yet, and I feel...stagnant. \nI've considered online degrees, but I'd need the least expensive ones possible. In high school, I was what you'd consider an underachiever. My GPA *might* have been a 2.0.  Really, I had a hell of a time learning.  I never found school easy and it wasn't until I was several years out of high school that I realized that, despite loving to read, I have a hell of a time concentrating and learning anything unless it's in a kinesthetic way. The easiest jobs I've had have been muscle memory jobs.  I have a difficult time remembering auditory instructions but anything that requires me to use my hands gets solidified in my mind quickly.  And for most of my adult life (until I was diagnosed with T1 Diabetes) I had a lot of stamina and could work longer and harder than anyone (I was in a few different warehouse environments.)\nWith all that being said, I still want to feel...academic? I guess? Like I'm not stuck working physical labor my whole life. I don't want to live my entire life bad at math, or unable to conceptualize any scientific material. I want to learn languages, and have waaaaay more career opportunities than I have at the moment.\nThis post is mostly a vent, but I'm really interested in buying some adult learners textbooks and documenting my successes, while having a support system in place to share my experiences with.  Maybe by the time I can afford college tuition I could actually tackle all the math and science that scares the hell out of me.",

And he's demanding a lot of help on this topic, but most importantly: emotional involvement. And it looks like I'll have to live this way for at least 6 more months, if not more. This feels like it's finally my limit. Don't think I can live like this anymore.\n\nI enjoy programming, but my skills are quite weak, and I easily get dragged away from my goal (even if I write a plan first).

It's very hard to make myself to do anything as is, not to mention actually moving anywhere.\n\n**TL;DR:** My mental state is degrading and my father is one of the main catalysts for that.

Instead of making the most of my time I've squandered so much of it being at home, both unmotivated and afraid of everything (depression, anxiety, OCD). I feel like only in the past year or two I've started to really grow as a person even though I still am pretty isolated most of the time. I plan to get out more, pick up another job and apply to college in the near future, but it feels like I'm 10 years too late for everything and I'm filled with regret every day. It seems like I'll never fully get out of the pit of regretting and comparing myself to everyone else, or even what my ideal self could've been.\n\nI realize it hasn't been all bad though. As an introverted kid I had a decent childhood with a decent amount of friends I hung out with, and still have some now although most are online friends now. I have a good home and a loving/supportive family who understand my situation and struggles. I'm still relatively young enough to make a real change to my life.\n\nFor the most part it's been the recent years of isolation that have gotten to me the most. I feel like I missed out a lot on experiences that \"could've been\" by keeping to myself so much, especially the college thing. I know for a lot of people the traditional college experience plays a big role of shaping people in their youth, something I won't get even if I make the best of the time I do go. Other than that I think about parties and \"adventures\" and other hangouts I'm sure I missed out on, even though I'm not really the party kind of person anyways. It's hard to really connect with anyone when I feel like I have to hide parts of myself so I'm not seen as boring or a loser.\n\nLately I've been thinking some of those experiences weren't that big of a deal anyway. Maybe I wouldn't have enjoyed them as much as I imagine them all rose-colored and stuff, maybe thngs could've been just as bad or worse if I did these things when I wasn't ready, maybe I'm being too dramatic about all this. But I still feel somewhat hollow after all the time that's seemed to go by so quickly, and I don't have much to show for any of it.  I'm really hoping that I won't feel so bad once I make my new start in life.

It is not the field I earned my Bachelor\u2019s degree in, but I had some trouble finding something that wasn\u2019t a sales position. (My degree is Marketing.) My job now is going to look great on my resume, so I am okay with this. This is also temporary because I am planning to move across the country next year. \n\nSo a little about my job- it\u2019s a new position, so my roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined. I have very few responsibilities, but I have taken on quite a lot more since starting since I kept asking for more work to do and showed that I was capable of more complex projects. Overall, it still is not too much for me and I find myself bored quite a lot. I am used to spreading myself very thin. In high school and college I was taking classes, working whenever I could, and was an athlete. I have been trying to enjoy this free time, but I am starting to feel like I am just wasting my life away.\n\nI digress, I almost feel like an assistant sometimes because I do some odd jobs for my boss. I\u2019ll research companies, book his flights and hotels for conferences, designed his business card and presentations, etc. I do enjoy when I get given those tasks, especially designing things, but it is not a daily occurrence and definitely isn\u2019t something that takes a full work day to do. \n\nSo I guess what I\u2019m asking is some advice on what to do. Like I mentioned before, this job is going to be a resume booster and I am planning to move at the end of the year, so I am not looking to leave and there really isn\u2019t anymore responsibilities that I can take on at the moment. It sounds bad, but I feel like I should take advantage of my current situation as I feel I will not have such an easy gig as I progress into my career. I read the news, browse social media, and even sometimes play computer games. I really want something more fulfilling. I have even debated on getting my Master\u2019s, but I do not have the money for that, nor do I know that I will end up needing it in the future. I do, however, really miss learning, researching, and writing.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or suggestions on what to do with some of the free time I get some days at work? \n\nI do want to say I am not bored and looking for things to do because of slacking off at this job. There has actually already been mention of promotion a few times already since taking on this complex project. (I have helped the company save $250,000 annually so far.)

I want to relax, but a part of me just cannot stop, and I feel so lazy and guilty. I do personal projects and my job instead of schoolwork. I've continued to work out, but substituted intensity for volume because I don't have the energy. I get out of my \"comfort zone\" as much as I can, doing taking cold showers almost every day, walking up the stairs, even holding my piss, I'm compelled by anything which is a challenge.\n\nBut at the same time, since I've graduated (a little before actually, but not enough to mess up my grades) I feel like my willpower has faded away. I've gotten slow and lethargic, to the point where it takes me hours to do anything. I can barely focus on work anymore, this week I probably worked like 3 hours total (I don't think anyone cares, right now my boss is more concerned with my mental health). I wake up every day anxious and overwhelmed. Even as I'm cutting down on what I get done, I feel like I'm only getting weaker, every day is only getting harder. Low-intensity running has been my last outlet, and now I'm so burnt out I'm losing the willpower and motivation to even do that.\n\n---\n\nI honestly want to eat as much as I can and never deal with any stress again. In a way, I don't even want the control I had / once had, because I've just used it to make my life miserable. I have no motivation because I feel like if I push myself, that only gives me reason to push myself harder next time. Like as an example, if I get stronger weightlifting, then I will only increase the weights. But at the same time, I want to be extremely productive, I know if I keep up my current habits I'll become lazy and fat, and I'm worried about that.\n\nI want to get my willpower, motivation, and energy back, but in a way where I'm \"in control\". **Has anyone experienced something similar to this, or have any advice? Has anyone truly recovered from burnout?** I'm worried I've wrecked my motivation, convincing my mind that pushing myself will only lead to me pushing harder, and \"giving up\" will make me back off (I haven't been too hard on myself because I understand it's natural I would burn out with my current habits, I try to \"let\" myself relax right before I truly lose control, so I feel like I still have it). **If I just let myself relax and eat, am I going to get better before it starts messing up my career / health / future?**",

            "content": "Specifically relationships.  As much as I hate to bore you with details, I feel it may be relevent:  \n\n\nI got out of the Army and got into a semi-long term relationship.  It lasted 5 years and in the end I felt like she didn't want to make any effort and I was doing all the work (she wouldn't even get her license renewed and relied on me and her friends to drive her to work every day, etc).  About 2-3 days after we broke up, I got a slightly drunk hysterical call from one of her friends (who I will call Sam) who is best friends with my Sister and fairly good friends with me.  She told me that my Ex-Girlfriend had actually cheated on me weeks after we started going out and some other things such as my Ex-Girlfriend only staying with me because she wanted to use what was left of my MGIB (which, isn't even how it works).  Sam valued our friendship and apparently the moment she found out about me leaving my Ex she called me to spill everything.  It had apparently been killing her to not tell these things to me (and my sister) as she is typically fairly honest, but she didn't want to betray anyone and was in an awful position (which was actually leading to some self destructive behavior which has since cease).   \nAnyway, as a result, I am very... wary... of new relationships.  In the Army I didn't engage in as many one-night stands as others, but I never had a committed relationship.  My pretty much only relationship was the 5 year long one.  And way ended 7 years ago.  I ended it right after I got out of College with my B.A. but learning about the cheating really hurt and I couldn't really pull myself together enough to try again. I always found an excuse to put it off, but I've run out of excuses.  I've been promoted at work and make a fair bit, I own my Condo, I have paid off all the debt I had (outside my mortgage) and I realized today there's really nothing stopping me now, other than my hang-ups and difficulty with romance.  \n\n\nSo, I've tried PoF but I feel very awkward talking with people on it, and I'm always concerned either my picture is creepy, or I'm being creepy.  I just don't fully know what to do.  I was a SUPREME nerd in high school (and I'm still a giant Nerd) so I didn't have much romantic aspirations back then.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-social.  I'm a College and high-school teacher and I have a great rapport with my students and their parents, so it's not communicating with people more of communicating interest.  I feel like I've just been out of the game so long I'm totally lost, and I don't want a repeat of my last relationship where I put in all the effort (including frequently driving 90 minutes to and from her house).  Looking back, I felt like I was more of an art piece or decoration for her than anything else.  Like, a safe thing that she knew she had as a backup and didn't need to put effort into.  I think during my 2 years at college after transferring to a university, she visited me like once.  It was always me going out to see her.  \n\n\nAnyway, I feel like I'm \"A Crazy\" so I won't keep rambling.  But if anyone has any advice, know that I would appreciate it greatly.  I want to get out of this rut and move on with my life.  I've always wanted to have kids (which is partly why I got into education), but I just can't seem to get myself moving forward.    \n\n\nI'd appreciate any advice anyone can give me.",

My family claims that I have good art skills ever since I was a child and that I should pursue it, but all my art was always traced so that's not going to happen. I don't have any hobbies except surfing the web if that counts. Everything I try I just don't find anything enjoyable. I don't have any life goals I want to pursue either.

I still live at home because video games took the time out of career focused goals. I'm a new real estate agent now, and have gotten a second job serving to support my real estate job, but I can't shake the feeling that if I quit gaming, that time could be put at accelerating my life to better quality. I go to the gym 4 days a week, and spend the time cooking meals when im supposed to, but, instead of playing games on my downtime, what if I spent that learning a new language? Or maybe even a new hobby that's actually productive?\n\nI feel that literally anything besides drugs is more productive than videogames. This short term gratification does absolutely nothing for my life, or many lives for that matter. Going to seeing a movie at a movie theater is more productive than videogames.\n\nI know that leasure is healthy, but I'd rather hang out with friends or practice a hobby that isn't gaming.

I've faced quite a few challenges in my life, and I have been with my family (mom) when we were facing difficulties as well. I was in a poor mental state a few years, but I am doing better now, I am practicing positive self-talk and acceptance to build up a positive mindset. I used to be super shy, but I am becoming more confident in making my voice heard, and I embrace all parts of me. I am gaining my own friendship and trust, and I am slowly, *slowly,* becoming the person I needed when I was younger.\n\nWhat I cannot get rid of so easily sometimes, is the feeling of getting overwhelmed by thinking about how many problems there are in my life all troubling me at the same time. It feels like so many things are going wrong, and this makes it seem like the solutions are going to be very far. My family's financial situation is not very good, and there is no form of savings or indulgence at all. My father is unpredictable in his nature, and his approach towards religion and similar matters is sometimes strict and causes conflicts in the house. My mother is facing unemployment, and has health issues. I have social anxiety and I worry about things a loooot. I dislike the city I'm in. We have faced difficulties in my family so much that I have learnt to tiptoe around things, and we are convinced that we have to adjust with whatever we have/whatever happens. We have had to fabricate elaborate lies to avoid unnecessary problems, due to trivial things. This made me an anxious person. You could tell me that 99 things will go right, and my mind will focus on the 1 thing whose outcome it does not know. It feels like tasting a strand of hair in cake. I often see people having the things I do not have, and that makes me bring up the list of all the things I don't have. I have not let this affect the kind of person I am, I speak a lot less, and I express even less than that, but I still value kindness, I am honest, and I establish good relations and friendship with people. I don't want this to change.\n\nThis comes and goes in waves. There are peaks when this shuts me down completely, but then it fades away. I want it to stay gone. How I can stop feeling like this, and develop a strong mindset, and hold on to the hope that things will become better?",

If so, oh golly! How fun!\n\nSure, I'm on the autism spectrum, but that doesn't ever seem to make a difference in how well I function socially, save for my tendency to quote shit at inopportune times, my rumored lacking of empathy (though not entirely; I still hate this), and, worst of all, my inability to make what I would consider *good* friends. It's almost as if each time I attempt to connect with others, someone else catches their social magnetism more so, and just silently phase me out. It's preventing me from forming any meaningful bonds or relationships, leaving me lonely and spiteful. Not to mention that I feel like a piece of trash whenever I see joyous people having fun with their lives and sharing stories they can look back on with substance, *especially* if it happens to be at school. Why can't I just be more like them? I should just be tossed in a lesser branch of the school and thrive there, instead.\n\nI once thought at I was at the head of my league - and, well, back in elementary school, and perhaps part of middle school, I might have been. But now? **Not a fucking chance**. So many others have work experience, AP credits, numerous volunteer efforts, extracurricular talents such as hockey or music, and leadership skills that qualify them for the most pricey of scholarships. Me? I'm just some abrasive, atheistic, and lowly, sexually confused kid with a horridly suppressed dialect and a semi-developed vocabulary, whom also likes to write, roleplay on the Internet, attempt to code, listen to music, burn time on YouTube, play video games, play with Nerf, jerk off, and sleep. I've certainly volunteered a few times in the past, yet I'm not wholly in financial need and great standing despite my 90s average - my parents are trying to make ends meet, even with dad's slew of income, because they have to provide for 4 people, a baby, 3 pets, and the enormous taxes on our equally enormous residence. How could I appear so prestigious and destined for greatness on the outside when I've never been honest with myself on the inside? I also always thought that I had half a mind to be a competent coder, yet when I walk into my new programming class' Discord, there'd be some brosters who had several years of experience on Python or something that can be equated to learning Vietnamese when you barely have a grasp on English.

            "content": "I\u2019m 26 and recently I\u2019ve come to the realisation that I\u2019m not very happy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m depressed, it\u2019s more so a lack of motivation and energy. Even though I know I\u2019m still young, I feel stuck and that my life is slipping me by. My nightmare is to wake up in my 50s and realise that I haven\u2019t done half the things that I want to do in life. \n\nI work as a graphic designer at a small but very respected local company. The salary is decent, but definitely not what I want to be earning for the rest of my life. While it's a great company, sometimes it's stressful, and sometimes due to projects, overtime at night and weekends is required/expected, but we don\u2019t get overtime pay. Sometimes clients are very demanding and difficult. There are times where I can\u2019t tell where to draw boundaries as I want to show that I\u2019m dedicated, but I don\u2019t want to be taken advantage of seeing as we don\u2019t get overtime pay. \n\nSeeing as my salary isn\u2019t the greatest, I waitress on weekends and nights at a local restaurant when they\u2019re short staffed. I also do graphic design work for private clients. It helps me get some extra money, but as a result I often end up not having personal time or time to work on my own projects - for example, I love doing the Inktober drawing challenge but I didn\u2019t get to finish it last year due to my workload at work. \n\nI think a major reason for me feeling like this is that I don\u2019t dedicate time to hobbies or things that I like to do. I love to draw, paint, read and crochet but haven\u2019t done any of those in months. I made a resolution this year to spend at least one hour a day doing something I enjoy as a means to relax after work, but I haven\u2019t done very well on that. When I get home I\u2019m so tired, all I want to do is eat, watch Netflix and then go to bed early. It\u2019s like a never ending cycle. I haven\u2019t had chance to flex my creative muscles in months and sometimes I feel like crying because if it. \n\nI also have not been looking the best recently physically as I currently have a bad case of liver spots, acne and my hair is more frizzy and unruly than usual. This really hasn\u2019t helped my self confidence so I don\u2019t feel motivated to dress up and look \u201ccute\u201d for work. I go out with girlfriends every Friday after work for drinks and I always feel like the homely one. My fianc\u00e9 constantly tells me that he thinks I\u2019m beautiful no matter what and while I know he means it, I don\u2019t feel so myself. \n\nI feel like I'm just going through life without really enjoying myself. Sitting at a desk looking at a screen for multiple hours doing monotonous tasks. I feel like I spend all of my energy and creativity at work, and when I get home, I have nothing left for MY own projects. \n\nMy goal is to eventually work for myself, and work for my own clients both in my area and online. However I'm nowhere near ready to do it as yet. My plan is to keep working here for a few more years, while gradually building my own business on the side, and then leave to do it full time. \n\nI feel stuck in a rut and I know it's affecting my performance at work. I'm scared that my lack of motivation is showing and could result in me losing my job. However I just can\u2019t seem to get myself motivated to do more and be better. \n\nHow can I motivate myself? I feel so lost. \nAny advice would be greatly appreciated",

            "content": "I'm so scared of taking the first step to change. I am a 26 y/o M who is fickle, tends to overwork and do things inefficiently due to lack of direction/purpose, indecisiveness, and commitment issues. These commitment issues involve pretty much everything- from problems with relationships (both romantic and non-romantic), career choices, political views, to basic morals and philosophies in life. \n\n All my life I have struggled with self confidence issues and used self deprecating humor to build relationships with bitterness and resentment building up whenever people would start to laugh AT me instead of WITH me. Even though I was always a hardworking, academically inclined student who was involved in clubs/sports in high school, I always acted like a \"mr. nice guy\" and shyed away from asserting myself, stating my opinions, and showing my real self in public. I befriended friends who I felt comfortable with, but now looking back, I did so thinking in the back of my mind that I was better than them- I viewed them as \"nerdy\" and not so popular but kind. Hanging out with them, I felt more like myself, and wasn't afraid to be a dick. But outside of that circle, I kept quiet and played the mr nice guy role. \n\nIt it didnt hit me back then, but I realized that I am not the angel that a lot of people labeled me as. In college, I made \"strong\" bonds with different friend groups but was never able to choose which were the most important to me especially when I tried to combine social events with the different groups- they sometimes clashed and did not like each other. This led me to try to be everyone's fake best friend. A lot of people would initially become engaged and cool with me because I was \"chill\" and tended to go with the flow- even though, a lot of times I did not want to but forced myself to please them.\n\nIn terms of romantic relationships, I lost my virginity to a girl who my roommate had just fallen out of a relationship with during freshman year of college. I had been friends with her while they dated and developed feelings I couldn't resist and act upon when they broke up. This devastated my roommate, as he viewed me as his only close friend in college. But truthfully, I did not view him as the same... because I didn't feel comfortable to be myself around him and had built a relationship playing \"mr.nice guy\" and therefore had built up resentment and bitterness towards him for being more assertive than me. \n\nSo, I justified breaking bro-code by saying how much I liked the girl, how he wasn't my best friend, and that the relationship between him and her was over and I was technically allowed to date her. Then I went to apologize to him for breaking the bro code, and VOWING to break up with her even though everything was already was done and fucked up. When I went to break up with her, she convinced me not to do so, so I kept dating her. This infuriated my roommate who told me that he could no longer trust me. 3 months go by, and I lose interest in the girl and we break up (she breaks up with me first of course, and I slyly pretended to be sad).\n\nThis was one of the big moments that I feel like cursed me to make a habit of passionately declaring or vowing to do something, but backing out of it whenever I was scared. It eventually became a habit thats spilled over to everything. From changing my mind about career paths a million times after declaring I would pursue, to my other romantic relationships where I would lead girls on to thinking we would date although I had the intentions of just fucking. \n\nI finished college 4 years ago and just completed all my pre reqs for grad school- which i'm having cold feet about. I just recently got out of an on and off relationship with a girl that I led on from the start and indecisive about (wanted to just fuck from the start, then developed feelings, then lost interest, girl wanted a relationship, so i decided to try building an actual relationship, then I changed my mind and backed out of it- it was multiple cycles of this)    \n\nNot to mention, I also struggle with my sexuality and gender identity which is a whole different story and something I cannot find out because again, I'm indecisive about how I feel about it- I tried forcing myself to make out with a stranger at a gay bar, but didn't like it. Maybe I was attracted to men more romantically than sexually? not sure. \n\nI'm writing this at my entry level job where I have very minimal workload, and somewhere I don't open up and keep to myself and play the \"mr. nice guy\" who never asserts himself. I'm comfortable because there's no pressure- my parents think I am all set to go to grad school and that this is a temporarily job. But I no longer have the motivation to do it anymore. The committment issue is hitting me again and i am backing out. \n\nThese days, I go home after work and browse the \"selfimprovement\" sub and \"depressed\" subs and read about other people who are struggling. It makes me feel better when I can relate to other people's struggles. \n\nI no longer have passions for things I cared about. I lost my passion for music, rapping, and body building- all things I started deeply due make up for my lack of personality. Nowadays I don't the attention span or desire to engage in anything.\n\nI'm so fucking depressed, ashamed, lazy, and feel extremely dead inside.  \n\nI'm scared that I will never be able to commit myself to anything and I'll just be stuck in this place forever. \n\nI'm scared I will never grow  professional or personally- and that I will be too scared to raise a family and become a leader. \n\nEvery time I try to take the step to change by trying to get out of my comfort zone, I retreat back to my comfort zone. \n\nI feel like all the hard work I put in to getting a bachelors, finishing up grad school apps and pre reqs, time spent on passions, have ALL came to a waste. \n\nI feel like a failure.\n\nI feel like i'm incapable...\n\nI'm so depressed and can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. But i'm scared of suicide because I feel like I only lived a quarter of my life, and REFUSE to leave without being happy. \n\nI just want to be happy man.\n\nI realized at this point, to make an attempt at change, I have to accept that i am NOT a good person. But I have to change or I'm going to wither away like this and live the most unfulfilling life and become a disappointment to my family and friends. \n\nAny advice?\n\nTLDR; I am a 26 y/o M who has low self esteem, superficial relationships, commitment issues, fickle, overworking, fake, mr nice guy, who feels completely lost in life and wants to change or improve.",

I have so many things I am good at, but I haven't allowed myself to practice them, and my skills are wasting away because of it.\n\nI just don't have enough energy to get up and do what I know I'm capable of, then I call myself a piece of shit when I don't pick myself up and do something.

Most importantly, has it helped you?\n\nI have a lot of childhood experiences that have damaged the way I view myself and success, and I think in a large way that has influenced my shortcomings now. There wasn't any serious trauma, just a lot of bad parenting decisions that led to me being unable to compare myself to my peers in a positive way or recognize anything good about myself. I have a constant, subtle fear that I am doing something wrong, and it is detrimental to my relationships with others and with myself. It hasn't been anything too terrible, but it is enough that I am going to seek help from a counselor or therapist (also for context I am 21M going throught a harsh breakup with a work environment that isn't very condusive to seeking mental help).",

If it stayed there, it would drive me mad.\n\nI needed to rip off my clothes, hit someone, or drive my head through the concrete wall like the goddamn Kool-Aid man.\n\nI was in 4th grade playing a basketball game, and I'd just missed an easy layup. That was enough to send me to the Red Place, where the fire of anger was so hot that it made me murderous.\n\nI hated basketball. I hated it so much that I wanted hurt myself and the people around me just so I could stop playing. I got ejected from games, I fought kids on other teams, I fought kids on my team, I cried, I walked off the court in the middle of plays\u2013\u2013\n\nI did everything except actually quit the team.\n\nIn my mind, quitting was a bad thing...always. Something quitters do. Part of that assumption was programming from society. Some my parents. And some my natural personality.\n\nBut all of it was destructive.\n\nAs I've gotten older, I've seen the negative impact of people refusing to quit.\n\nBecause of our identity as \"a person who never gives up,\" we stay in jobs we hate, relationships we don't want, and creative projects that no longer serve us.\n\nAll for what? So we don't have to look like a quitter?\n\nIs it really worth wasting your life just so you don't have to hear your passive-aggressive aunt ask you if you're ever gonna get a real job?\n\nJust so you don't have to explain to your friends that you're getting divorced at 45.\n\nSo you don't have to imagine your old coworkers calling you a quitter behind your back because you stopped writing your book and moved to another creative endeavor?\n\nBecause that's what we hide from when we refuse to give up: the remotest possibility that someone somewhere might think us a quitter.\n\nA life without quitting is an increasingly-diluting life. You spread yourself thin on activities and people you don't actually care about, all while neglecting the only things that matter.\n\nYou fantasize about escaping on vacations. Escaping through sex. Escaping by going off the grid and never coming back. All extreme forms of \"quitting\" without ever doing the real deed. You spend your whole life distracting yourself from the fact that you're not living a life that's yours at all.\n\nYou're living a life just to reinforce an identity to yourself:\n\n\"I never give up,\" you say as you kiss the husband you no longer love.\n\n\"I'm determined,\" as you walk into the office, miserable.\n\n\"I'm not a quitter,\" as the years pass you by in blinks.\n\n\"I stick to my word,\" as you die with regret.\n\nQuitting is a superpower.\n\nIt allows you to wash away the people, projects, and practices that no longer serve you. In that way, quitting allows you to focus intense energy on the things that do matter.\n\nI started a podcast last summer and only did 12 episodes. Did I give up because I'm a quitter? That's one way of looking at it. The way I see it, though, that podcast got me back into video and audio production, which led to me creating a lucrative video course.\n\nI stopped doing comedy after I graduated college. Does that mean I'm not determined? Maybe. Or maybe I needed to hone my writing skills in my 20s so I could come back to comedy in my 30s as a better artist.\n\nI finally quit basketball in high school so I could focus on baseball. Baseball turned into a passion which turned into a book that's coming out next year.\n\nThe point is: fortitude and devotion have their place. But we are far more likely to stick with something because of how it reinforces our identity rather than sticking with it because of how it serves the world.",

            "content": "Hi, I have a beloved Aunt, who has suffered a great deal in her life, and she has terrible self-esteem as a result.  She reads a lot of self-improvement, and metaphysical books, attends seminars, even tried to be a life coach at one point, but it seems she has an inability to internalize those lessons.  She feeds her intense sense of lack by giving advice, correcting people, talking over people, and generally trying to pump up her value by speaking about her own knowledge.  I have multiple degrees and certifications, and she will lecture me on something I have had a career in, developed processes for, and did NOT ask advice about.  I am 47 and have good accomplishments.  She is not formally educated but is amazing, has been very successful, but suffered financially and not recovered, but her life is comfortable.  \n\nI've asked her to stop, in the most recent episode she responded to an email in a cruel and vicious manner and said she would never speak of it again.  This was after she had encouraged me to talk to her about these things, I had her on a pedestal for most of my life, I felt safe with her, and thought we would work through this stuff together.  \n\nThat email, essentially slamming the door on me, and any willingness I had to communicate with her, was a year and a half ago.  In that time I have gotten therapy, this hurt me deeper than any experience I have had until now.  I have gotten over wanting to hurt her back as badly as she hurt me (that took 6 months), and I am really trying to put it in the past.  I have manifested a conversation, in which she inadvertently (thinking she was in a private text to her brother, my Dad, but it was a family text) said she reached out to me, but all she texted me was \"I love you\", so I called her, thinking if this was what she could come up with for reaching out, I would call her, I had done a similar \"reaching out\" for Thanksgiving, Christmas and Valentines Day.  \n\nIn this conversation, she admitted that she had been feeling rejected on many levels, including with me, and that she had \"let me have it\", as a cascade of all her negative emotions, scapegoating everything onto me, and that she was \"sorry for her part in it\", and that she had poured all her awful feelings into the \"iron wall\" she had put up with the nasty email.  \n\nSo here is my problem, and thank you for reading this far, and TL;DR, how do I get past the fact that someone who I had a deeply loving relationship with, would go that far to hurt me as badly as she could, then infect the wound by leaving it for a year and a half?  I want to fix my part of the problem, but can't find a way out of still wanting the original boundary, and needing many more since this has happened, and desperately not wanting this to happen again, so I'm worried that my boundaries will set her off.  And just wanting to get over it, let her be her without taking her personally, an admittedly life long pursuit I will probably never learn all the way, but I am grateful for this experience to help me with this lesson.

Negative thought patterns were an endless cycle of torment for me, and they often affected my work, relationships, as well as my physical and mental health. Even when I meditated for a whole entire year, it curved the negative thought patterns but I still would overthink and it ultimately made me lazy without the proper tools alongside it. \n\nI found out this past year that this life is a life of ACTION. It is not a place made out of things, and objects but a wonderful life where even the most minuscule tasks or tid bits of self improvement are part of your great story. Over the past couple of months whenever I catch myself slipping into a pattern of negativity or thoughts I think to myself \u201cwell fuck it, what are you going to do about it?\u201d and I literally go do something about it. Worried about my weight? I go run, I eat cleaner. I\u2019ve dropped 20 pounds so far. Worried about school? I study, very hard for hours until I\u2019m calm. Worried about my future? I plan it out, I attack it from all angles. Worried about my relationships? I go tend to them like a Gardner watering his plants. \n\nAnxiety, and fear of the unknown are not there to cripple you, they make you move, but instead of focusing on the negative aspects think to yourself \u201cwhat can I do to make the situation better?\u201d.

I dont know how to \"live\" anymore and i know that this might build up later in future so i ask for advice or someone who can relate because i dont want to feel resentment towards myself for not doing anything about it. \n\nI was always a dreamer. I could never be completely present and cope with reality. Ofc on some instances i was enjoying living, but it never lasted for long. The dreaming was holding me back since i was a teen and it was all due to my social anxiety to expose and express myself to people, things or places i dont know. Now at 25 i live in another country. Its been couple of years since i live here, went to school and now work at job i learned to do. I have some family here, but no one i can conform to completely to push or motivate me further. My family i grew up with are back home and living the normal life that i would probably have if i stayed. I moved just for the money at beginning, but now i wonder whats the point. Currently not depressed, stopped daydreaming because i see it as a problem and dont indulge into it for a long time if at all like i used to. The thing is that life feels like its passing by and i dont mind. I tried to make good friends here, but people live their life, have more responsibilities in this age so we are not in touch. Making good friend or someone you click with is totally different here considering that i am born in other place, grew up there and now in my 20s live among people that didn't went trough those changes. Back in school few years ago i had few friends, but we were only on same wavelength because we smoked weed. I dont smoke anymore because this was the exact reason i started to smoke. I also quit drinking on weekends. Those were the things i did to cope with loneliness, not relating to others and just to enjoy some time i have for myself. Fitness was my passion at one point in life, but because i work at job that needs me to move and use energy i dont see it as something necessary. I still train my core and stretch my back to prevent injuries. Have a fit body and dont feel good at more weight, be it just muscle or fat. I dont have a girlfriend and dont feel like putting effort in it. I used to hook up with girls just for one time thing and there were some dates, but never really connected to any girl here (same with friends). I dont mind being like that, because i understand that some people have relationships just to escape loneliness or boredom. I dont want to cling to someone that i dont want to share my life with just to escape from something. Now hobbies...i never really had any hobbies i would do in my free time besides playing games or watching something. Dont know if people call it hobbies. Some see it just as a waste of time, but i dont mind because i dont always escape in them to cope with reality. I used to play football, but i dont feel passionate about it anymore so i dont even try to make time for something i dont want to do. Same with many other things i started. I would always burn out at some point and never go back to it even though i was good at it.\n\nAt this point in life i always expected that i would have my own family, good few friends or family members i click with, basically the things i would call home or just feel like i am there. I dont feel this anymore, even when i come back home to my family. It feels like it for few hours when i arrive because i dont call often so we talk about a lot of stuff, but from there its nothing new anymore. When i arrive back here where i currently live i feel such a weight on my heart and it happens every time i arrive in my apartment after holiday spent back home. But the thing that bothers me and the reason i write this is because i dont know anymore. I feel at peace, but its not enough. Its like my ego prevents my mind to feel completely ignorant and blissful and wants me to do more. At this point in my life i only want to feel present and at peace, but this is just not possible. In back of my mind i also want changes to happen, but i dont do anything about it and the time just flies by, even faster as i get older because the time i spend most is at work and not \"living the life\". I dont want to end up at 35 and still be like this. I dont want to compere to others, but it doesn't feel like normal life if i do the comparison. The comparison will just fuel my mind and tell me i am no good. Thats it. If you have any advice or you currently experience something like this than please share it with me. Is there anything new you started to do? Did some new thing make a difference for you? Was it a place? A person? Does it last or is it just short term life enjoyment? \n\nThank you for reading this",

            "content": "My (F22) mother (F58) was emotionally (and rarely physically) abusive towards me growing up (also abusive towards my father, but never abusive towards my older brother). I knew I was scared of her, I knew hiding in my bedroom closet was a bit odd, I noticed how nice my friend's moms were, I noticed my mom shifted her behavior around friends/peers. But I never knew I was being abused until around age 22.\n\nI only noticed me mirroring some of her behaviors once I found myself in a serious, committed relationship. My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half, and we've been living together since last summer. When my boyfriend and I first started dating, I was resistant to his kindness, patience, thoughtfulness, and love. I had never experienced a love so kind. I genuinely thought my mother loved me, and that's what love was supposed to look like. So I was very confused by his actions.\n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago. My boyfriend (M23) broke down after a few weeks of distance to tell me I had been exhibiting signs of gaslighting. I immediately broke down, and fully agreed with everything he was saying. I criticized him often and made him second guess himself. This moment was probably the most guilt-ridden, heart-broken, and selfish I've ever felt in my whole life. I was doing to him what my mom did to me, and I couldn't believe I'd inflict pain knowing how terrible it is from first-hand experience. He explained to me he did research on gaslighting, and read somewhere that people exhibiting minor symptoms of gaslighting sometimes don't know they're doing it because someone else did it to them... but when I say that out loud, it sounds like I'm just gaslighting. I don't know how to express my regret and guilt without sounding like I'm gaslighting because I feel like that label will stick with me forever. I can't believe I had been blindly doing this to someone to kind and loving to me.\n\nI in no way deserved forgiveness... We talked over the next few days about how to proceed, and we both decided that we will continue to be in a relationship, as long as I change. I am fully committed to changing my behavior. I've **never** cared about my behavior until I realized it's effecting someone I love and care for more than anything else. I've bought books to understand the trauma I experienced, reached out to countless therapists, started anxiety medication to relieve thoughtless anger. Things have genuinely been really great the past few weeks. I feel how I felt when we first started dating. I'm full of butterflies, I can't keep my hands off him, I feel as though I've been more supportive and slow to react. I actively tell myself to *think* before I speak. I pick my battles, letting things go now that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, things I would have commented on before. We haven't had a fight in weeks.\n\nHowever, lately, I've been overwhelmingly anxious with the thought of returning to my old behaviors. I was reading a forum about gaslighting, and if there's hope for the gaslighter to honestly change as a person. It was about 50/50, but there was one comment that threw me off... it said something along the lines of \"if a gaslighter tells you they're sorry and they'll change, *that's just them gaslighting you again.\"* I felt so defeated and discouraged after reading that comment. I HAVE to change from the inside out, or the love of my life is going to slip through my fingers.\n\nI need help, guys. I feel like I'm going insane. Is there hope for me? Can a person really change? Do I have to go back in my deep subconscious, work through the childhood abuse, to deeply change? Or am I a lost cause? Please help. I can't lose him, but I can't live with myself knowing I'm causing him pain.",

            "content": "I\u2019m a high school student (16) and 40h of volunteer work is mandatory for me to graduate. Currently I\u2019ve done 3 hours at a senior home, but I find myself hating it. I don\u2019t feel any connection with the people I\u2019m working with and I always feel awkward and confused because I can\u2019t tell how people are feeling, so I worry that I am doing something wrong and will get in trouble. In my everyday life people will often get upset with me for using the wrong tone of voice or implying something I didn\u2019t mean to imply. So this work has been unsuitable for me because it\u2019s very high empathy and that\u2019s just so hard for me.\n\nI\u2019ve been abused a lot throughout my life and I find it really hard to care about others because I\u2019ve been alone and had to fend for myself for a long time. I have had severe depression for as long as I can remember because I was bullied since I was 3 and never got a chance to make a friend until I was 14. I\u2019m currently not able to get a therapist for multiple personal reasons (I will when I\u2019m an adult). I know I\u2019m really young and haven\u2019t hit the struggles of adulthood, but it\u2019s just really hard to be deprived of friendships for so long. I used to not even understand that friendship in the sense of people having your back and wanting to spend time with you was a real concept, I used to think it was a fantasy ideal invented by the media, like those portrayals of always perfect romantic relationships where the couple never has any conflict.\n\n I\u2019m always friendly to people and I\u2019m told that I\u2019m exceptionally polite but I don\u2019t feel sympathy/connections on the inside, I just think it\u2019s pointless to be rude. I try to see things from other people\u2019s perspectives but I can\u2019t \u201cget myself out of my own head\u201d and I don\u2019t feel other peoples emotions. If someone is upset I can recognize that they are unhappy but it has no change in my own emotions. I don\u2019t feel a need to help them and forcing myself to do so feels like a waste if I don\u2019t get any tangible benefit from it, since I don\u2019t feel any better for helping. I try to tell myself that it\u2019s good, that the other person must appreciate it, etc. but it doesn\u2019t impact how I feel at all. I get no positive feelings from interacting with other people and it just makes me feel tired. Whenever I\u2019m talking to someone or volunteering my mind defaults to \u201cI could be playing a game/reading about geometry/etc. at home and it\u2019d be more fun\u201d\n\nWhat are some things I can do for volunteer work that require minimal social/empathy skills? Ideally I would really like to get better at empathy but I just don\u2019t know how to evoke empathetic feelings, I just don\u2019t feel any gratification unless I think \u201cthis may benefit me eventually.\u201d How do I get an \u201cI feel good because I was helpful\u201d feeling if it doesn\u2019t come naturally? \n\nUnfortunately I live in a small town where volunteer work is mostly limited to sports and healthcare, neither of which are interesting at all for me, or even things I can do because I don\u2019t have the skills/knowledge. I like video games and I have been getting into photography but I\u2019m not good enough at it yet to be able to shoot photos for someone else, especially since I shoot objects and have no interest/skill in shooting people. I like 3D geometry (polyhedra) but it\u2019s not very practical? I wouldn\u2019t mind working at a library/animal shelter but I think those are really competitive for hours and they tend to select the most socially energetic students. Private errands for people like relatives and friends count as work, but I don\u2019t have friends and I have poor relations with my family.\n\nSomewhat unrelated, but I have been desperately trying to find a job for months so I can move out when I\u2019m an adult, but nobody is willing to hire me.",

I had recently broken up with a long term GF and was addicted to weed (literally smoked 2-5 blunts a day) i was also selling small amounts of it to keep up. I binge drank alcohol at least 1-2 times a week and watched pornography regularly. I was working in a fast food place and was in danger of failing out of school, I also didn\u2019t know what it was that I wanted to study. I didn\u2019t really have any real friends mostly stuck around people I partied with and such\n\nOne day I was home at my apartment and it really just hit me. If I didn\u2019t change I was going to be in a lot of trouble in the future, some sort of drug addict pervert. It didn\u2019t happen over night but I made a serious commitment to getting my shit together. I also became obsessed with the content of Jordan Peterson. I started with doing just the small things. I developed a vision. My vision was that I wanted to be the kind of guy that ran big businesses and competed at a high level in sports in my free time. I started to really change. I\u2019ll spare the details but one foot at a time over the last few years I changed so dramatically that it\u2019s unbelievable. \n\nOver the course of the last three years i developed an insane work schedule. \n\nIt consisted of the following as a college student \n\nRise at 6 AM read journal meditate \n\nGo to class\n\nCold call in between class \n\nGo to class \n\nWork on business \n\nGo to class \n\nGym work on business \n\nRead and meditate \n\nI read nearly a book a week, was getting a\u2019s and b\u2019s and had a side hustle that supported me in school. I was eating clean as fuck only Whole Foods. And I was working out and meditating daily. It was incredible. I was no longer smoking weed, drinking, or fapping at all.  As i write this it\u2019s hard to fathom how much has changed. It almost doesn\u2019t seem real to me. \n\nNow here\u2019s the part where for me growth has to change. As you can imagine after developing this hard core work ethic I became very isolated. I was a one trick pony I left behind my fake friends and focused solely on developing myself. I also got really confident and was hooking up with random girls regularly. This is where this story turns a little sour. \n\nAbout 6 months ago I ended up hooking up with a random girl and got mono from her and it has absolutely devastated my health. I have been exhausted ever since. I can\u2019t help but think that the way I was working contributed to my sickness and being sick has made me reflect on how lonely I\u2019ve become with this hardcore work ethic. So going forward for me personal growth is going to mean going out more and building more relationships. It can\u2019t just be work all the time. I did what I had to do and I\u2019m super proud of myself\nFor it. I\u2019ve got most of this productivity stuff down but for me growth is going to mean taking a step back and focusing on relationships and happiness \n\nIt\u2019s been a wild journey",

I tried going to bed right after work but end up super tired at the end of my work shifts so that didnt work.\n\nI have also had no motivation to grocery shop, do laundry on a regular basis, cook healthy meals, or get out and do social activities since working overnights has really drained me mentally I feel exhausted all the time even though I work at a desk all night and dont do any hard labor. My job pays so well though that it would really be tough justifying changing jobs, I'm also thinking about getting my own house soon as well but if I switched jobs I would make less money and probably couldnt afford it.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!

I've been lucky enough to have been supported by grants, a college fund, and some part-time jobs throughout school. I am now living at home with my mom and younger sister and looking for a full-time job. Until now I've been only applying to jobs relevant to my degree but now I've broadened my search to anything full time that I'm qualified for. Luckily I'm not financially desperate since my mother has been kind enough to allow me to stay until I make enough to support myself. I hear it takes on average 6 months after graduation to get something, but it's been about 2.5 and I'm already going crazy!\n\nAnyway, I've fallen into quite a rut. The weather has been shit (Canadian winter lol) so I've stayed inside mostly. I spend some time each day browsing job boards and applying, and doing laundry/dishes/tidying/errands for the family. Other than that, I've just been pissing away my time on netflix, youtube, reddit, etc. \n\nI am an incredibly extroverted and social person usually, but not only are many of my friends living far away now that school is done, when I visit the friends I have a) I don't have a lot of money and can't afford to go shopping/out for food very often and b) since my life is so boring right now I truly feel like I have nothing to talk about! We end up watching netflix just like I would when alone. \n\nWhen I think about all the things I told myself I would do when I had the time, the list is long: practice music, learn coding, read, start a cooking channel on yt, keep things tidy, work out, do yoga, etc. But somehow when I think about these things everything seems just as boring and I can't convince myself to put some of my brainpower to use. I keep feeling like, \"whats the point\"? \n\nDo y'all have any advice for staying sane when you're unemployed? How do I keep my self esteem up when I feel lost like this, facing constant rejection? How do I get myself to use this time wisely instead of feeling like a lump on a log! Thanks so much!",

I\u2019m in a great relationship, I have a decent job, I\u2019m in OK shape, and I have good friends. I\u2019m lucky enough to afford to be able to go on vacation, and just returned from Iceland last week.

That\u2019s pretty much where I\u2019ve been all year- struggling internally. \n\nBut today, I woke up extremely determined to turn towards a new direction. Yesterday I was really upset because of how I\u2019ve been feeling. I haven\u2019t been eating well or moving my body AT all, so I\u2019ve gained some weight, but the most concerning thing is my energy. I\u2019ve had none. And I\u2019ve been sick consistently for six months. It\u2019s all tied together- my physical health and mental health. I\u2019ve been grieving because my dad passed away right before my 28th birthday last year. A lot of things have been coming up emotionally from that loss and others in my life. The other losses really shaped me and for most of my life I\u2019ve viewed myself as a victim. It took a lot of inner work to undo that story but it came up again recently. \n\nToday, I\u2019m rewriting my experience. I have control over how i choose to live. I can either contribute to my wellbeing or to illness. I\u2019ve been choosing the latter lately but today I took a huge step towards wellbeing. I feel the shift. \n\nI meditated, cleaned my whole apartment and did my laundry, practiced yoga, drank lots of water, and meal prepped for the WHOLE week. I also did my morning celery juice which I\u2019ve been slacking with. Today, I set myself up for success. and I feel so great about myself and what lies ahead. I really feel like this is the first day of the rest of my life and I can accomplish the things I want to. I can handle whatever life throws my way. I can do the hard things and it\u2019s not always going to be hard! \n\nI just wanted to send this message out there: you are doing the best you can, always. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Everything changes- life changes. And moods aren\u2019t the end all be all, they\u2019re just the ups and downs of life. Sometimes we feel great and sometimes we don\u2019t. But we can do so much to help ourselves out. We can choose to take actions that are aligned with wellbeing instead of dis-ease. We have a lot more power than we give ourselves credit for. You can do this! And so can I!",

A lot of this stress comes from his job.

I was heavily suicidal for about 4 years around that time, and the teachers knew this; I genuinely believe that the only reason they didn't kick me out of the school was because they were worried they'd have a suicide on their heads.

So I want to share you a bit of my story and my plan.  \n\n\nBack in 2018 I had a successful business with my former best friend. We decided to move to a foreign country, because taxes in our home country are immensly high. It turned out to be a fatal choice.  \n\n\nTime has shown that my friend is a narcisst. This is especially hard when you are being an introvert, which I am. All the things happended there lead to the moment where I was thinking I'm the most worthless piece of crap in the world. I was too weak to separate myself from him for a long time.   \n\n\nI compensated my depression with things that caused even more problems, not giving a fuck about anything. I lost most of my money to online casinos and other senseless stuff. Short time later the business broke down aswell, because I wasn't able to do anything under my mental condition.  \n\n\nAt September 2019 I had to move back to my home country, living now at my parents house by the age of 24. I don't have to tell that I was feeling ashamed of myself. I couldn't talk to anyone about my mental issues. Neither did I have any friends.  \n\n\nThe following months were really hard for me. I was basically sitting around at home, letting all the negative thoughts consume me. But one day I decided that everything has to stop. I can't just waste my life thinking how useless I am, when I actually have a pretty good knowledge to establish a successful business. I realized how much I have achieved in the past. I deserve to be happy aswell.  \n\n\nI started to meet friends from my childhood, doing fun stuff during the day, spend meaningful time with my family and structure my week as good as possible. I still want to run my own business, as I can never imagine myself to work for someone else. Thus, success is my only motherf\\*\\*\\*ing option - failures not!  \n\n\nThe last 2 months I focused mainly on personal things. My brain was filled with negativity before and that's changing. Now it's time to get back to work.  \n\n\nI'm curious if anyone else has going through something similar? Let me know how you are handling it.  \n\n\nCheers",
