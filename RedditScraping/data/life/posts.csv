1j4p63h,"Thinking a little too hard, I think","End of January I moved from Tennessee to Kentucky, maybe 3 hours away from home, to come to a university up here. Made a few friends while I was working up here over the summer so I know a couple people, but the isolation has really whipped me. Campus events are sparse since it’s spring and folks are just trying to get through not the summer, and there’s not a ton going on. One of those friends I made the mistake of starting something in the direction of romance with, but it didn’t work out and I think a big part of why is that I come on too strong, almost always. I stepped back to think on it and try to untangle the web of feelings that were confusing me so badly and realized that independent of whether my caring for people is platonic or romantic or any of that I just care really intensely and I have next to no skill with self-regulating. I could go into the details of why I think I’m like this but it wouldn’t do any good. The bottom line is that I feel really isolated. My roommate moved dorms to be in an apartment-style room so I don’t have anyone in my room, and likely won’t for the rest of the semester. I am wary about engaging too much with the friends I do have and the friends I’ve made since being here because most of them already have their own stuff going on and I don’t want to be too much and scare anyone off. I’m involved in things when I can be, but work and classes tend to block off a lot of the more interesting social events that are happening. It was gonna be like this no matter where I went, honestly. I am 21, turning 22 this fall, and I just started my freshman year after a really rocky community college stretch to try to be an English teacher. I’m older than most of the folks in my classes, or else way younger than the older folks. I don’t really enjoy the frat environment, I’m much more comfortable in quiet and relaxed environments and that’s been hard to figure out. It’s only been a little over a month, which is wild. Especially when my roommate moved dorms I felt myself start to slip into a depression, and lately I’ve been getting into dangerous territory with procrastination and darker depressive thoughts which really isn’t fun. I’m not wanting to be self-pitying, because things are going relatively well, I’m just feeling rough and trying to figure out life on my own in a place where I know almost no one and feel pretty alone.",I'm feeling really isolated and slipping into a depression after moving to a new place for university.

1j4nd4o,How to deal with overbearing and overstimulating family while you're trying to come into your womanhood? F/24,"I will try to keep this as short and concise as possible. I'm a 24 year old woman living at home with my parents while I pursue a law degree full time. Although I am not exactly sure yet what I want to do with my JD, I am sure that I want to obtain a JD, so I'm set on that. The issue is all the other aspects of my life -- dating, hanging out with friends, going out, and just being a normal 20-something-year-old woman. Both of my parents have a lot of trauma that leads them to be very overprotective as far as my comings-and-goings, as well as my life in general. My mom especially tends to have the general underlying idea that if I stick to the ""family plan"" (go to law school, buy a house right out of school, marry a man with money and have kids by 30) then I will be happy and set up for life. There are some issues with that: the conversation with dating is *very* tense and fraught with emotion in my house because of my mom's trauma (losing many women in her side of the family to violence), and also because of issues in the past where I haven't been honest with her about my dating life (withheld past relationships, went on dating apps without her knowledge). She also thinks that premarital sex = bad (even though she did it). 

It's just causing me a lot of internal conflict that I've kind of been taking out on my parents, and it's not a healthy or helpful dynamic for any of us. I'm not as joyful or open when I'm around them; I feel very overstimulated by their energy and both the spoken and unspoken requests and requirements they have of me so that I can still be a ""good daughter"" in their eyes. They are always contradicting their statements and it's extremely frustrating because I genuinely don't know what they want from me at this point. 

The bottom line is, yes I still very much (and always have/will) want to get my JD. And I do one day want to get married and have kids. But I want to be given the freedom to do those things when, how, and with whom I want. I don't want to get into arguments about whether or not dating apps are full of ""killers"", or why it's bad to be out past 9:00 PM with your friends, or why I shouldn't move to a new state after getting my degree. Also, I was raised with a purity culture mindset, and I'm a scared yet horny 24 year old virgin as a result. I want to do it within a relationship or at least with someone I have intense chemistry with and respect for, but I *reallllllyyyyyy* want to get laid. And **soon**. And right now it's hard to see how the freedom I want can fit in with the life my parents have crafted for me. Right now, I'm not really in a place financially where I can move out (even with savings + I don't have a summer job yet but I'm working on it), but I just applied to some scholarships through school so I'm always working my options. I'm considering taking out loans but I'm unsure. 

Moving out/$$$ aside, what are some ways I can establish boundaries with my parents about living my life how I want to live it, letting their craziness go in one ear and out the other, and making my own choices regardless of whatever they say? Please help!! ",What are some ways I can establish boundaries with my parents about living my life how I want to live it?,"The individual in the Reddit post is a 24-year-old woman pursuing a full-time law degree (JD) while living at home with her parents. She is uncertain about her future career path but is committed to obtaining her law degree. Her family has significant trauma, particularly her mother, which contributes to their overprotective behavior regarding her personal life and independence. The mother has a rigid vision for her daughter's future, which includes following a ""family plan"" that involves going to law school, buying a house after graduation, marrying a financially stable man, and having children by age 30. 

The individual is experiencing conflicts around dating and social life due to her parents' expectations and the family's history, which makes conversations about dating tense. She has a history of withholding information from her parents about her dating experiences, contributing to the friction at home.

During my first year of uni i met person A & B, we had gotten very close in a short time, would hang out often and got very emotionally bonded over time. We were there for each other during some difficult times, found comfort in each other, went through so many things, but mostly i have never felt so happy and comfortable!! I've had some incredible memories with these girls and i still want to experience so much more life with them, but unfortunately life happens, and after that first year of uni me and person B changed to the same majors while person A went to do something else which made it a bit more difficult to see each other often, but we still had our groupchat and would plan fun activities like sleepovers, beach days etc. I have never had any problems with those girls, i was as comfortable and equally close to them 1 on 1 as in group. We share so many similarities and interests, but our contact started to become less, not that it was abnormal but it did affect our friendship as we started out so close to suddenly more and more apart. We had this conversation a few times and seemed clear that we all still very much wanted this friendship and cared for each other. In the meantime person A & B have gotten in serious relationships too and im just hanging around, chilling. But now person B has letten me know that she feels her dynamic with person A doesn't work anymore, she feels often uneasy and not completely herself as they don't match entirely in personality, and after some years it has become more clear how different she feels from her, she has absolutely nothing against her, it's just a case of ""I'm outgrowing her"" and i absolutely respect her feelings.

1j4l29q,Reality vs. Expectation – Adulthood from a childhood perspective is a massive lie,"


I'm almost 30. I'm single, I have no kids, and I don't own a house. I pay rent to my landlord. Although I completed higher education and have a degree, I live like a rat.  

Now that I'm an adult, I still don’t have my own place. I studied for so long, yet I don't feel respected at work. I feel like a replaceable resource, and I don't feel secure about my future.  

I'm terrified and feel horrible about it.  

I have done everything I was supposed to do to be successful in life. I finished higher education, I had good grades, and I studied very hard for almost my entire life and I still continue to do so.  

But what have I achieved? I'm just another rat among other rats. Replaceable. My knowledge and skills aren't valued. Even though I'm 30, I should have a house and a family, but I have nothing.  

My life still revolves around upskilling, constantly trying to be better than everyone else just to earn more.  

My life is a constant race, constant studying.  

I barely have time for myself. I go to work, and I have little time left for my hobbies or even spending time with friends. This time is limited. A great amount of my time is spent reading books to upskill, hoping for a better future.  

So, my life as an adult is a constant cycle of studying and working, but the gain is nothing. Even though I have devoted my entire life to work, I have ended up with nothing, achieving nothing special.  

And imagine I’m someone who put effort into college and education. But what about people who didn’t study and have even worse prospects? It’s horrifying that grown adults live in an economy where nothing is accessible to them. They work their entire lives and have nothing. They live with the hope that in five or ten years, they will finally achieve something.  

But if, at 30 years old, my standard of living is still like that of a student, and my daily routine consists of spending more than half of my day working, how can I have any hope?  


But so far, I’ve been given nothing. Nothing has paid off. I actually feel like a loser because all my effort, all my sacrifices, have led to nothing. I’m 30, and I’ve ended up a failure.  

As a kid, I watched TV shows and ads that depicted 25- or 30-year-olds as married people with families and their own houses.  

Meanwhile, I rent a flat, haven’t found a life partner, and don’t earn enough to afford a car or an apartment. Where is the life I saw in soap operas and TV ads the one with a happy family inside a big house with kids?  

Will I achieve this when I’m 40 or 50?  

I'm part of a lost generation. Everything I was told in childhood all the fantasies that pop culture fed me was a lie. The reality of the current economy is that 30- and 35-year-olds live like rats, enslaved by corporations.

My mother and I had a horrible fight in October because of a broken car, she gave me and that I decided to go none contact with her and changed my phone number because of it. Plus blaming me for everything Ive done etc, especially with narcissist abuse I've been through.

I am trying to apply for an apartment in a different state and now either my state thinks someone took my personal information from me or my mother (62) me(32) has decided to be a horrible narcissist to me. Please I need help. I have never had this happen before and I'm a very private person!

However, based on the context of applying for an apartment, the person might be engaged in gainful employment. Given they are 32, it can be inferred they likely have some form of employment but no specific profession is mentioned. 

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific profession with certainty. However, if the context implies they are employed but does not specify what they do, the best guess would be that the person may have a job or occupation. Since a specific job is not identifiable, I will default to not being able to state a profession accurately.

In cases where a clearer identification of a profession is not given, it is suggested to hone in on other aspects. In this situation, the profession remains undetermined due to lack of specifics. 

Though we strive for clearer traits whenever possible, this case exemplifies the challenge when the information is too ambiguous regarding professional context. As a result, it exists in a gray area. 

My final answer is: ""not specified"".

1j4fzj5,Being abandoned by people and how to deal with it ?,"Throughout the years, I've had health issues which have lead to my unemployment and social exclusion. Generally, men who don't provide value, are shunned my society. Most of my friends knew I was having problems but nobody really made an effort to help. So I did what I was recommended to do : make it more obvious ask for help. Because men are afraid to ask for help, that's the problem, right ? Patriarchy and emotional suppression are beloved buzz words today. But here's the problem : Nobody really cared. Nobody took me seriously. So, i continued to suffer. At some point I told a friend that I was really disappointed that I hadn't receive help over the years. The result : He removed me out of a whatsapp group. I was no longer valuable to the group.

Similarly, my brother whom I've helped move multiple times did not care to help me move when I was in need of it. Despite bad-mouthing our sister to me and telling me that he liked me more, he resumed contact with her. Because something had changed : My brother had a kid and I believe he realized that having an auntie for his kid who lived nea him in the same city ( I lived far away) was useful. More useful than me, somebody who wasn't able to provide value. All my three siblings reunited and stopped caring about me.

I'm always to open to understand what I'm doing wrong so any answers are welcome. But I have a very unpleasant suspicion. Which is : If you cannot provide value in this world : People will abandon you.

Also, the idea that men are emotionally crippled and don't ask for help is incorrect. It's not that they don't ask for help, it's that when they do, most people won't care. It's precisely this reason why men stop asking for help. Help for men which resouces to get their life back together, not to ""talk it out"".

I recently read a comment which described western societies. The gist of it was basically that western cultures are work-based and if someone is keeping you beind, you should lose them. Socializing in the west is an event, not just part of life. It's all about your own happiness, your own happiness, your own happiness. Socializing in the west has also been synonymous with ""performing"" as well - we feel like we need to be entertaining or worth the fun in order to socialize. Whereas in developing countries, people are often not work-based (economic reasons).

So, I need you guys to tell me : Am I an asshole ? If am, I willing to improve myself. Or is just the harsh reality that I currently don't fulfill the conditions to be valuable in the eyes of society ?","Am I an asshole for feeling abandoned when I don't provide value, or is it just the harsh reality that I currently don't fulfill the conditions to be valuable in the eyes of society?","The individual describing their crisis mentions a history of health issues that have led to their unemployment and social exclusion.

1j4foz7,"17, M - Need advice and perspectives","I don't know if this post for this subreddit, but I just need some advice. This gonna be a bit of a ramble and looks like ai, but i just like to organize sonits better to read. This may or may not be my main account or a throwaway account, and might be posted in different subreddits for different perspectives and advice.

Background:
I (17, M) has a lot of problems and most of them are mental and/or caused by myself. This is my first time putting my problems and myself out there, so they may be some inconsistencies, repetitiness, and just may be overall confusing. This will be a bit of a ramble so maybe these ""categories"" will be helpful for people who want to help or just give their thoughts/opinions.

1st problem - Addictions:
Although I don't have the more widely known addictions like drugs and alcohol, but they ruined my life just as much. Although its embarrassing i do have pornography, masturbation, and basically anything that high dopamine endicing and numbing (gladly not drugs or alcohol). First the masterbation, i don't want to seem like my probelm with it us above anyone else but I started 7-8 years ago just to explore and wonder how it felt. I didn't know how much it was a problem until i tried to first stop 5-ish years ago from watching a video of no-fap. But i suppose it was too late, now my daily average is around 7-10 times a day (I don't know if its that much), but the worst days (when i had nothing to do for the entire day) is at least 20. Most of these done in around 2-3 sessions. Im a bit scared of how it will affect my ""member"" later in life and if I'm damaging it too much (I know it stupid...but i dont use any type of ""lube"" and just rub it without any type of ""slippery stuff"" - since I can almost never finsh it it's slippery). Next is the pornography, which is probably my worst addiction. I stared it right before i began masturbating; again out of curiosity and exploration. I think about sex 24/7 and have multiple things that i see it on (porn webstites, nsfw ai, nsfw subreddits, nsfw art, etc). I had a major change in how i see and respect women, although i dont downright stare or try to touch them (hopefully), I do objectify them and imagine sex with them; even if i try to force myself not to. The thing is tagt i used to only see women as what they are - people. I used to treat them pretty much without any type of labels or judgement as a child, i did had crushes but i just still treated them like i did everyone in school - like regular people. But now i have to avoid most females, so i dont have the risk.of objectifying them and making them uncomfortable. Last is my ""numbing activities"". When i talk about this, the two main culprits are social media (mostly doom scrolling and just overall ""bad"" content) and just my horrible diet (consists of junk food and snacks). I barely watch anything on the Internet that actually helpful (even though i playlists and subscribed channels full of them) and just look at content like cheating stories, gender wars (just the negatives about each gender), depressice content, etc (I hope yall fet the idea of it). And with my diet, i kwo how to cook and used to look to, but i just dont know since it's not enjoyable anymore mainly because of the deregulation of my dopamine levels - I do still watch a little of helpful/good things if I suddenly gets the sliver of motivation to. I just mainly go to dollar tree or my job at Sonic, just buying anything to make me feel pleasure even if i dont have the tatse or stomach space for it.

2nd Probelm - Identity:
*i just realized this looking more and more like a Ai prompt but i swear it's not*
Back as a child, i was...""the popular, hyperactive, charismatic, 'everyone in the area's friend"" tyep of guy, now I'm lonely, extremely anxious, no confidence, and basically have like 15 different ""masks"" I wear to interact with my family and the very few acquaintances I have (I know its sounds liek a reverse typical cliché plot, but i swear its true) As i decend deeper and deeper into this pit of my problems and insecurities, I see more of the problems i never know i had. Now i wonder..if i ever was that child, what i mean is that i dont know if that child was the ""true me"". I always putted all my need and wats for others because it made them happy - which made me happy. But now that i really dont have anyone know, i dont who i am anymore. When i mean i dont know who i am, i really mean that - from my passions, interests, dreams, ideology, everything that makes someone..an individual. It feels like im a hollow shell most of the time with really only 3 real things that i know anout myself, i love to create art (but i barely do it know since i numb my emotions), i love helping people (I feel like it just hurts me in the end, and i even starting to hate it when i used to love it), and I'm an extrovert (which i cant really even get energy from social groups from my, maybe porn induced, social anxiety). I honestly forget how even look like (my own reflection) and my own voice, its like if everything i knwo about myself was in a book (excluding my history and problems) it probably be full of blank paper with only those 3 things from earlier.

3rd problem - Emotions:
*I forgot to text that it's ok for yall (who do wnat to give advice) that you don't have to answer each problem, you can do one at a time*
Just like my identity, i barley can understand let alone acknowledge most emotions. Im not a sociopath and can still feel basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger) but only when its really strong - like REALLY STRONG. I understand complex things like love, it just I can't compute any complex feelings or emotion (yes i know love is not a emotion, but used it as an example). The only emotions i can actually feel without it being strong is anxiety and emptiness/dullness (i dont know if that an actual emotion since it's a lack of emotons but whatever). I also forgot to say form the first problem that i really dont really have that much motivation for pornography or masterbation (unless my body starts having with withdrawals) and it more of a habit that consumes every one of my good habits (even brushing my teeth). Basically almost everytime i smile or cry or get mad..it just feels like i put on a mask to somewhat ""act"" the emotion.

4th problem - Problem with Fixing My Life:
I had tried (and not tried) to change my life and i literally have notebooks (like at least 10) and hundreds of papers with research of trying to fix my life and problems. Although i learn more about my problems and discover more hidden ones each time, i also just end up getting worse. I also not a patient person at all (unless its for someone else; how I asked my dad for therapy or a brain scan for years) and i always try to do everything as quick as possible. My main motivation was just to go back to helping people without anything still holding me back, but now it feels like if I don't fix my life... I'll end up ""unalive"" or alone. Even with that realization, at first it was like my body wouldn't let me...but now its like i just dont do it, like i dont want to change (maybe it's a conflict between my cons ious and subconscious mind, ir really don't know), it just feels like im lazy which maybe i am. I have gotten so exhausted physically and mentally. Physically i went from easily vetaing anyone in the neighborhood in a multitude of sports and excersies (Im talking doing 50 pushups with medium difficulty) to getting exhausted from a walk (I ahve lost over 20 lbs from not eating and just changed dramatically from that to just laying down all day - no activity). And mentally, i just feel done with having to be ""the rug over the mud for everyone to step on"" (if that makes sense) and just wants to feel pleasure to drown out the pain. Im not gonna act like im innocent as i caused a lot of these problems myself, i just want advice and different perspectives. Back to the main topic, I feel like I have everything from scieficigal an philosophical data from reliable sources to help to every self-help youtube video notes, to help me recover - and i just wont do it.

5th problem - Social Life
Like i said ealier, i was ""the guy"" (as cringey as it sounds). I was basically the middle of the spotlight wherever i went, not just school, when it be a park,  home, or just a restaurant - i was always there to be in the middle of it. It wasn't like i was obnoxious (i was probably a little desperate for attention, i do have 7 younger siblings and 5 grown siblings - yes most are half siblings, don't judge my father) but i was always included everyone, even the kids that just was secluded from everyone. Back in middle school, i even gave every single perosn candy for Valentine's Day as they walk through the door - no matter what their relationship to me was. But now I basically have no social life and barely even have a relationship with my family (They're a bit worried, but have too much on their own plates - at least what i think), i can barely even ask smeone for a pencil or just small talk. I can't talk to women out of fear of objectifying them, and I can't talk to men...to be honest, I really dont know why i cant. Maybe it's because of my inadequacy i feel compared to my past self. I want to at leats have friends, but i feel like I can't even do anything to socialize 

6th problem - No passions
I love art and creation, well i used to. I have a on and off relationship with art and just comapre myself to other's constantly. Everything i used to do (art, explore, very, VERY active, etc) i just dot wnat to do them anymore. I barely even listen to music anymore in my fre time. I miss being able to just take leaps of faith like how i used to constantly do in the past. 

Other problems:
Just problems I forgot to add or dont have category-
- Have no confidence as a young man or big brother (i usually get ""step over"" all my little siblings like a doormat)
- I might be scared of change now, when i used to not to
- I do want to change into a person i want to specifically become, but im scared of losing my past self in pursuit in it
- I literally have around 2 months before graduation but i have two online credit recovery courses to take and i barely doing them (able to complete them in 2 months, but..i just not doing it)
- Im definitely desperate for a relationship and love or basically any form of connection at this point (luckily I'm still sane enough to not pursue so i won't hurt anyone)
- im trying to multitask trying to heal myself, take care if my health (emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual), trying to find who exactly am i, trying to learn new things, to quit my addiction, and so many other things (i cnat do some things one at a time)

I know not all of the comments will be helping me, but even if they're not - im still gonna read them. I hope I can actually get better, heal, and grow...because i dont know what will happen if I can't. I will update if i get better and/or if i find more problems i need assistance with.

1j4f83b,Have you ever sat down with your budget and just thought “Am I REALLY that stupid with my money???”,"My husband makes $4000 a month. I stay home to cut back on daycare costs. All our bills add up to $2500-3000 a month. That includes electric, rent, groceries/gas for the month, small bills like streaming services, my husbands bud, phones, etc. 
yet at the end of every month, we have been SO broke that we have just... man it's been so hard.
So today, it took me two hours, but I planned out our budget for the next two months by the week. I have it down to a T and it's really made me realize that it's all about just splitting payments up (instead of paying $360 a month for our phones in one week, split that in two, same with energy and rent) that way we're not dumping a huge majority of the check into one payment and leaving us stranded or on a huge time crunch for our other bills cause we couldn't handle it when we should have. 
It also made me realize that we spend ALOT on extra things that we don't need or even remember getting so much of (snacks, books, coffee), and I'm like man some of what we have for the month of march is just one time things too and we're supposed to have $700 at the end of the month if we do this right! 

Anyway it was a huge wake up call. Thankfully we're at that point in our lives where you know.. we're not going out all the time, we don't drink, we don't do expensive date nights, we hang out at family's house, have the occasional bbq or outing, and that's it... so my husband is also on board which will make this so much better.

1j4f0je,How do I stand up for myself?,"The company I work for pushed me for a promotion last year that I didn't get.

1j4bkql,Is this normal? Or is this raising red flags?,"I met this guy here on Reddit. He posted about how his aunt sexually abused him as a teen. He said the women he dated turned him down once he told them he was raped. They all didn't believe him and left. 

I heard his story and something clicked. I'm not a sexual assault survivor by any means, but I had plenty of nightmares about it and met creepy, strange men in real life. 

I honestly felt bad, hoping we could become friends on the internet. But he wants a relationship. I never been on a date before. I never fell in love. I never lost my virginity or even kissed a guy. 

The conversation started off innocent, but it just got really weird. I'm starting to wonder if the entire thing is a lie. He says he lives in a European country, but will absolutely move to be with me. My main concern is his age. He is 33M. I'm 23F. I'm 10 years younger than him. 

His convo ended up turning very sexual saying things how he wanted a ""stern mom"" and ""how much breast feed would I do to console him"" and ""I need to lick and eat your pussy at least once a day."" And ""that doesn't stop you from disciplining me and making me a good boy.""

I'm creeped the fuck out. I wonder if his story is even true. This doesn't seem like something a teenager that was sexually abused by his aunt would say, right? I thought we had something. But he only seems interested in sex, not a genuine relationship.

1j4bip4,My focus and attention span is getting worse,"32m and my focus has been out of the window for quite a while now

I used to take edible THC for 3 years daily, but has since stopped completely almost a year ago

I mention this because I'm not sure if this is what is causing my loss of focus or simply because I am getting older.

I have absolutely no drive to do anything at all, I loathe going to work even if my job is dirt easy, I have a hard time staying on task because I just disassociate alot and try to distract myself with doom scrolling through reddit (which is how I stumbled on here) or reading some manga or something

This lack of drive is making me hate myself more and more each day, I have personal projects to work on, things I know I want to do, but the motivation to do so is hard to find.

I have a wife and a son who was born last year that brings me great joy, I've changed my diet completely over two years to no take out whatso ever and eating only home cooked meals, switching primarily to chicken instead of beef and ONLY DRINKING WATER with a very rare occasional sweet here and there, (I could use more greens in my diet)  I take vitamins daily, and I've been going to the gym recently...

All in an attempt to get out of this rut I seem to be in.

I have depression, I don't know how serious or anything but thats another story to unfold that I won't get too much into

I'm the kind of person who never lets his emotions show and dismisses everything and just says ""it is what it is"" while logically thinking ""It doesn't matter how I feel, shits gotta get done"" and push through it or simply understand that the past is the past and we can't change it

I've tried changing my sleep schedule as well from sleeping from 10pm - 7AM to see if that fixes anything but so far it hasnt

Working full time, Gym 3x a week, caring for my family, and making sure I spend time with friends and my wife doesn't leave me with enough time for myself going to bed at 10PM so I've been sometimes just going to bed at 12AM - 1AM, with the weekends being an all nighter (These hurt sometimes lol) gaming on what little free time I can make for myself.

I apologize if this all seems confusing, I'm simply trying to build a mental profile here

But anyway...

I'm not sure what happened, I feel no joy in anything I do anymore, back when I was younger and I created video content (Been video editing and other stuff on youtube since its inception) I always felt great joy and excitement doing it, but now I feel nothing even though I know its what I want to do.

I have a video people have been asking me about 2 years ago and I can't bring myself to even finish it despite knowing I want to do so

I'm working on a movie project that has garnered alot of attention that I am basically almost done with, but I can't bring myself to sit down and finally put in the finishing touches

I know I'm letting everyone down, but fuck, I don't know why I can't find the energy or drive to just sit there and do it without losing focus

This kills me so much and I don't know how to fix it

Is this just because I've gotten older or something?

Do I have some untreated ADHD or need some medicine to treat depression?

I'm really lost here and I don't know what else to do","How can I regain my motivation and focus, and is it possible that I have untreated ADHD or need medication for depression?","The individual is a 32-year-old male who has been struggling with focus and drive for an extended period.

1j4b3kn,Does anyone else’s social battery drain this fast??,"I think a made a huge mistake…..

A couple months ago, my cousin was in the middle of a divorce and he asked us if he could stay on our couch for a couple months. He stayed with us for about three months and then there was a vacant apartment next to ours and I told him he should move in there and he did. 

Well, once he moved out of my place, he never returned the key back from my apartment and he literally lives about 10 feet away. He’s constantly coming in unannounced and anytime he sees me outside he runs out to come and talk to me. Like LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE time I’m outside and he hears me, he rushes to his door, swings it open & talks to me. Now all of this was fine in the beginning I didn’t mind because I really am close with my cousin but now it’s starting to become a bit excessive.. 

Every morning he texts me around 7 AM when he knows that I’m awake and he’s just fishing to see if I’m gonna be busy or not because if I tell him that it’s a slow day at work he will literally come over unannounced and talk to me for hours. I work full time from home & my son has severe autism. I feel like I’m constantly burnt out. My husband has advised me to spend more time relaxing. I’m able to do that since 90% of the time my job is laid back and there isn’t anything to do. But now I’m starting to feel burnt out because I’m constantly paranoid that my cousin will show up unannounced or start texting me. Lately I’m trying to set boundaries with him by telling him that no I am not busy, but I am going to try to take a nap or sometimes I don’t even open his text messages.. 

Am I being rude??? I understand that he’s my neighbor now, but that doesn’t mean that it’s an automatic invitation to come over whenever you want and hang out for hours.. I’m currently locked inside my bedroom, pretending to be asleep because he’s  in my living room playing a video game.. he said he wanted to come over to use the Wi-Fi real quick because he had a virtual doctors appointment and that was about three hours ago…..ughhhh!!!! I feel bad because I know my cousin means well and he’s super family oriented. But Im not the type of person who wants company EVERY day. Am I being dramatic? Is my social battery too low???",Am I being rude for trying to set boundaries with my cousin who keeps coming over unannounced?,"The individual expressing their concerns in the Reddit post has several background details that contribute to their current crisis:

- They are married, as mentioned in the post, and their husband is aware of the situation and has advised them to spend more time relaxing, indicating a supportive family environment.

We all make mistakes and take lessons from it.

Learning to go with the flow and keep life afloat even in turbulent times. We learn to heal and become whole with ourselves to master ourselves and help somewhat guide others through life as well.

1j46182,Overcoming sheltered upbringing as an autistic 30M soon to be PhD?,"Edit: TL;DR at the bottom

I'm a 5th year PhD student with an accepted Master's in my same field who should be graduated by this May assuming the dissertation defense and whatnot goes well for me. I'm also ASD level 1, have ADHD-I, dysgraphia, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, major depressive disorder - moderate - recurrent, PTSD, and 3rd percentile processing speed. I also have noticeable motor issues, such as the delay between when I plan and execute and an action. I'm also going through autistic burnout right now, which is incrementally improving too. I do want to open up and say that I realize I'm posting this from a place where I've had an immense amount of privileges. I'm bringing that up since I've had that called out enough times by other autistic adults to the point that I'm no longer oblivious to it and that I've been fairly sheltered too.

Here's a bit of my background to give an idea of what led up to this point. All of my life, I've had a ton of external support. Therapists, life coaches, tutors, etc. I grew up in an upper middle class neighborhood in a state that's low cost of living so my parents could afford me and my brothers a lot of helpful services, most of which I received in my case. I was in a large, crowded, overestimating middle school that was well funded thanks to property taxes. However, I eventually transitioned to a high school that accommodated disabled adults and graduated with only 7 other students in my class. I went to undergrad with the assistance of a life coach my parents paid for to teach me study habits and navigate the social parts of college (this helped a ton when I eventually dated someone for the first time). I should note that they did NOT help me with my work directly since that would he unethical. I did all of the work myself. I also took minimum full time course loads to keep my scholarships and struggled overall in undergrad to the point I ended up with a 3.25 overall GPA and 3.52 major GPA for a BS in Psychology (I took more lab courses and math up to Calc II compared to a BA). I should note that I never worked during undergrad either.

I got into a Master's and eventually a PhD program, but I did it with the assistance of another coach who specialized in graduate applications, how to write professional emails, etc. I didn't work until the end of my gap year and took the GREs at the time as well (my parents also hired a tutor to help me with them too but we cut them off when it didn't help me at all). I got into a Master's program in my field (Experimental Psychology. Ironic, but I specialized in cognition and Experimental Psychologists don't do therapy at all) and despite not capitalizing on every opportunity, getting a C+ in a core graduate school course, and a 3.48 overall Master's GPA, I got into a PhD program in my field. I am also an active fellow for a fellowship through the state where I'm doing my PhD as well.

Despite all of my academic achievements and how things are seemingly OK as an adult, it's not true and I've performed poorly. Outside of the low undergrad and Master's GPAs, my first real work experience was a part time retail job stocking during my gap year, which was a position I then transfered to a store close to where I did my Master's for some extra income on the side. I had bad performance reviews constantly where I scored 2/5 on all but one category when they were looking for 3/5 on all of them. I also passed up the opportunity to TA my second year of my Master's program since I had to take a 1 credit hour course on how to teach and I thought it was to become a full blown instructor of record. Turns out my assumption wasn't true at all and most did a once a week lecture for a lab component of a course, which I'm confident I could've handled too. Most of my cohort also worked on 3-4 research projects outside of class at a time when I only did one at a time and they were all the ""milestone projects"" (thesis, qualifier project, dissertation) too. I've also had extremely low teaching reviews, even when I was a visiting instructor last academic year. I had ratings that were mostly 2s out of 5 on most categories and my last semester I was in the 1s out of 5 range.

Now, I'm looking for jobs post PhD that all involve juggling multiple priorities, working more hours daily than I've generally worked at all (I work 3 to 3.5 hours a day at most), and more that I just don't know if I'm ready for at all. My emotion control is also super poor and I'm not exactly a resilient person when it comes to setbacks feeling like the end of things for me. My most recent setback example includes the thousands of dollars I spent of my savings and fellowship money on therapy and ketamine infusions not covered by insurance at all (I'm down to $7500 in savings as of recent) to the point my parents intervened and demanded I cut back a ton even though it's my own money.

Am I just a late bloomer? I'm thinking I'm actually sheltered and need to overcome it. How can I do so?

TL;DR - Despite graduating with a PhD in May, I've underperformed as an adult partially due to how sheltered I was in high school and all of my 20s. I want to overcome being sheltered as much as possible and get my mental health, work, and finances under control. I've consistently not met expectations in real world work as well, including teaching where I get 2s out of 5 on most categories and got in the 1s range of 5 during my last year of teaching too.","How can I overcome feeling sheltered and improve my mental health, work performance, and finances as I prepare to graduate with a PhD?","The individual is a 5th year PhD student nearing graduation, having also completed a Master's in Experimental Psychology. They have faced various mental health challenges, including ASD level 1, ADHD-I, dysgraphia, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, major depressive disorder, PTSD, and low processing speed. Throughout their life, they have had extensive external support, including therapists and life coaches, largely funded by their upper middle class family. They attended a well-funded middle school and later transitioned to a high school designed for accommodating disabled adults, graduating with only seven peers.

During their undergraduate studies, they struggled academically, achieving a 3.25 overall GPA and a 3.52 major GPA while balancing the need for accommodations and attending college with the help of a life coach. They did not work during this time. They later pursued a gap year, took the GRE with tutor assistance, and eventually progressed to a Master’s program and then a PhD program in Psychology. Despite some academic achievements, they have faced challenges in work performance, receiving low ratings in part-time retail jobs and teaching reviews. They have also expressed concerns over their emotional control and resilience, and they have experienced financial strain from therapy and medical expenses, prompting their parents to intervene. Overall, the individual has recognized the impact of being sheltered during their academic journey and is looking for ways to gain independence and manage their mental health and work obligations more effectively.","The person is struggling with underperformance in their academic and work life despite achievements, facing challenges related to mental health, emotional regulation, and transitioning into post-PhD job responsibilities.",25,female,single,PhD student in Experimental Psychology,upper middle class,"ASD level 1, ADHD-I, dysgraphia, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, major depressive disorder - moderate - recurrent, PTSD, low processing speed, noticeable motor issues",PhD,"major depressive disorder - moderate - recurrent, PTSD, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, ASD level 1, ADHD-I, dysgraphia",yes,overwhelmed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1j46182/overcoming_sheltered_upbringing_as_an_autistic/,Adulting

1j44sym,I'm so overwhelmed and I have no idea where to start,"I'm 26F with a first class degree (4.0 GPA) and I make £300 a month.

I tried to look for jobs for years, and it was just rejection after rejection. I've paid for CV writers, I have 4 years of experience in marketing, and I can't get anywhere.

I'm now looking into freelancing, but there's such little money there.

I have a terrible problem with wanting to live a ""high-flying"" life. This is why I wanted to be a lawyer as a child, so I would have the money to do so. Life got in the way however, and due to physical and mental problems, it became impossible, and even when I did try to get a law conversion, I realised it wasn't for me.

Unfortunately, criminal law does not pay in the UK. In fact, very few careers in the UK pay even decent salaries, and this is only getting worse due to cost of living. I soon realised that I would have to go into commercial law where I would be working 60+ hours a week. This would allow for next to no time for anything outside of work, and I knew I would be utterly miserable doing this. I still can't help but think I made a mistake.

This has now left me in an awful situation economically where I have no prospects as my degree (sociology) which is pretty worthless in the world of work.

I know a lot of this is down to my own mistakes and I simply need to lower my expectations and desires in life, but it's so hard. I like nice things and I want to have the money to live out the life I wanted as a child, and that requires work. The issue is I don't know where to start to get that.

America is the best option. I qualify for a visa, but I won't be able to go until Trump is out. I'm not white and I refuse to live there due to the political climate. I already have been told by friends and family out there that, yes, it is as bad as I feared. My mother thinks I'm being ridiculous as I'm running out of time and I'll be 30 by then, but this is something I'm putting my foot down on.

In addition to all of this, I'm being priced out of my city. London has become uninhabitable for anyone who doesn't have a spare £2m to spare. Sure, my boyfriend will have this (and possibly more) when his mother dies but I REALLY do not want his mother to die, and it's not my money. I refuse to even acknowledge any potential money he would get in the future.

We could afford a place on the outskirts of London, but I don't drive. I also hate the suburbs due to it being so quiet and I'm not at that stage in my life yet (white picket fence, kids, in bed by 10, etc). I currently live in the city and ideally I'd like to stay here but we just do not have the money. Living in the suburbs would force me to be able to drive but I'm epileptic (this is the only reason I don't), so it's another hurdle and risk I need to choose whether I'm willing to take.

My friendship group also isn't exactly strong here. I do have a good group back home, but I'm not moving back. I love cities, and even everyone back home would like to get out.

I'm beyond overwhelmed. Trying to achieve my dreams, find a career to enable that, be able to live where I'd like, and ensure I'm not relying on my boyfriend for my sole source of social interaction is so fucking hard. I know I sound spoilt and delusional, but I really want to change and have a life I'm proud of. It's all so fucking hard and always feels like I'm moving 1 step forward and 20 steps back.",How can I find a fulfilling career and improve my financial situation while managing my expectations and desires in life?,"The individual is a 26-year-old female with a first-class degree in sociology, achieving a 4.0 GPA.

And apparently all my other friends r freaking out abt it bc it’s illegal in their countries or whatever like I thought that was normal? lol)

Something that really bothers me is that they’re always scolding us saying we need to be nicer to customers but idk how much nicer i can get? I smile so much my cheeks hurt and i do anything i can to accommodate them. If customers have any complaints abt us it’s bc they blame the cashiers for the food taking so long to  come out, what do they expect me to do?

1j43vqs,Am I wrong? Should I change my thought process? as a Man what would be your priority?,"My boyfriend and I are expecting our first child together. Right now, I have the flexibility to work from home and go into the office about two days a week. Once the baby arrives, I plan to move back home to be near my family for support. Where I currently live, I don’t think I’d have a comfortable living situation. My dad owns a few houses and has offered to let me stay in one for a very low cost—basically pennies on the dollar. Right now, I’m living in a two-bedroom place in Frisco, TX, and paying around $2,100 in rent and bills. Moving back home would not only help me financially but also give me the support I need from my family.

My boyfriend lost his job about six months ago and only recently found work in December. I understand how difficult the job market can be, which is why I told him that it wouldn’t make sense to quit the job he just got to follow me—especially since we’re not married. He’s currently working two part-time jobs, one paying $19 per hour and the other $29 per hour. He says that work at the second job is starting to pick up, but from what I can tell, he only works there once or twice a week.

For the most part, I’ve been handling the bigger expenses while he’s been covering the smaller ones. He is contributing, just not on a 50/50 basis, which doesn’t really bother me. However, I’ve told my parents that I don’t want to live with him if he can’t secure stable employment. To make things more complicated, his academic advisor misled him about which program he should be in, which has delayed his goal of becoming a physical therapy assistant. In my hometown, aside from experience (which he already has), he also needs a license, which he doesn’t have yet.

My dad thinks my boyfriend should make a sacrifice and find a job where I’ll be moving so that we can both contribute financially under the same roof. My boyfriend, on the other hand, has suggested keeping his belongings at the house my dad is offering and just visiting on the weekends. But to me, that doesn’t seem like a realistic arrangement.

Am I wrong for preparing myself to co-parent instead of continuing this relationship? He’s a grown man, and I don’t feel like it’s my place to tell him what sacrifices he should make for his family. If he doesn’t want to take just any job where I’ll be living, then who am I to force him? At the same time, I don’t want to push him into something that could lead to resentment.

Back home in Fort Hood/Killeen, things move at a much slower pace compared to the DFW area in terms of job opportunities and social life.

1j41hgm,Navigating Marriage After Infidelity: How Do Adults Handle This?,"Howdy,  
  
I'm looking for some mature perspective on a difficult situation I'm facing in my marriage.

My wife (36F) and I (34M) have been married since 2014 with two children (born 2014, 2017). Last August, I discovered she had been having an affair for over a year. When confronted, she agreed to reconciliation, but has only genuinely apologized once and maintains she's ""not guilty,"" suggesting our marriage was ""already dead"" before her infidelity.

After months of attempted reconciliation, she recently told me she wants a ""more mature partner"" and is only staying because she hopes I'll ""grow as a man"" (referencing my lack of a father figure growing up). She says she can't fully open up emotionally because she's afraid of getting hurt again.

We're in therapy, but progress feels minimal. I'm stuck in limbo - not moving forward but not ready to end things either. Our intimacy is nearly non-existent.

From what I understand, affair recovery typically takes six months to two years and requires humility, compassion, and tenacity from both partners. Experts say the unfaithful partner must show sincere remorse and take ownership of their decision to cheat. Without this accountability, rebuilding trust becomes nearly impossible.

The betrayed partner often develops symptoms similar to PTSD, including intrusive thoughts, irritability, and flashbacks. I've definitely experienced this.

For those who've navigated infidelity as adults: How did you know whether to keep working on the relationship or when to accept it was time to move on? Is rebuilding trust possible when your partner won't take accountability?",How did you know whether to keep working on the relationship or when to accept it was time to move on?

1iyu4zn,Disillusionment after graduating?,"When I started my study of criminology, I was hoping to find answers to some questions.

I was at university for 5 years, yea FIVE years. So essentially my entire adult life all I have ever known was my own independence, living in my university city which I love, hanging out with friends and going to classes etc.

I moved back home last august and for first few months it was ok because I was seeing lots of friends from uni and it was the summer so lots of plans. But now that I have a full time job that I hate I feel like I have become a shell of my former self. I have never felt so lonely in my entire life.

I was never social in high school and in my home town mainly due to distance and where I lived but I felt on top on the world when I was at uni. I was incredibly sociable I was always known to be the person to be up to do literally anything. I would plan things, ask people to do things spontaneously. I was on the committee for a few university societies and would host socials. I was decently well known around campus. I LOVED living with other people and the community/family aspect of it whilst also having my independence.

I loved the fact i lived in a large student city where I could step outside and do whatever I wanted. If I wanted to canoe there’s a club for that. Sing? There’s a club for that. Just go partying? There’s 10 places within 5 minutes of my house and all my friends are down to go in the next 10 minutes.

Now that I live at home in small town where the average age is like 60, I feel so lost. All my hometown friends live a minimum of 30 mins away and I have no car. My friends from university live in cities that are hours away or are travelling across the world. I have looked on insta and google and there are no social hobby  clubs near me at all especially not for any with people in my age group. The closest city to me is still 30/40 mins on a train away from me. My new job that I have is almost entirely remote and is terrible 0 work culture, no one talks to each other unless I start the conversation. 

I have started dance classes in hopes to ignite my social spark again but I’m really really struggling. These classes is 2 cities away from me so about 1hour on a train away. I find that I’m a very spontaneous guy, so if I want to do something it must be done in the next 1 hour. I’m not the best planner which is why I think I’m struggling so much as I can’t just ask my friends that I would have lived with if they wanted to do something. Now people have jobs and commitments and we have to plan everything in advanced.

Even the small things,for example in the summer at university I loved having a bbq in the park when it was hot. I could ask my friends to come and we would all be there within 5 minutes surrounded by other students and people like me too. Now if I wanted to do that I would have check when my 3 friends that live near me are available. How we would get there, who’s paying what, what time we are going home. 

IDK anymore I’m truly truly struggling, living at home is draining all the energy out of my body and I am slowly losing motivation to go out and do things.

He has experienced a significant lifestyle shift after moving back to his hometown, which he describes as a small town with an average age of around 60, contrasting sharply with his vibrant university life in a large student city. 

During his time at university, he was socially active and well-known on campus, involved in various activities and societies, and enjoyed a sense of community and independence. However, he was not sociable during high school, largely due to distance and location. 

Since returning home, he has secured a full-time remote job that he finds unfulfilling, and he struggles with feelings of loneliness as he is distanced from both university friends and local friends who live far away. He does not have a car, which limits his ability to connect with others easily. Currently, he is trying to reignite his social life by attending dance classes, but these are also located a significant distance away. His spontaneity and desire for immediate social engagement conflict with the need to plan gatherings with friends, leading to further feelings of isolation.","The person is feeling lonely and lost after moving back home post-graduation, struggling to adjust to a full-time job they hate, and finding it difficult to maintain social connections in a small town.",23,male,single,full-time job,middle class,The person is struggling with emotional health.,master's degree,struggling,not mentioned,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterSchool/comments/1ikduv0/late_night_rant_post_graduation_loneliness/,LifeAfterSchool
1ijd9pu,"I Never Took School Seriously, But Now I Want to Lock In—Need Advice on College, Military & Trade Options","Hey everyone,

I’m a high school senior, and I’ve never really taken school seriously until now. I know it’s not fair that I suddenly want to turn things around, but here I am. I’ve been making up my credits, and I only have 10 left to graduate. A couple of years ago, college was the last thing on my mind, but now it seems like a real option. That said, I have no clue how any of this works. I also have a few Ds on my transcript, so I don’t know how much that will affect my chances.

The thing is, I don’t even know what I really want to major in or what career I’d want in the future. I don’t know if this is just a motivational surge, but being a lawyer seems cool. I’ve also been interested in psychology and philosophy for a while, but I have no idea what careers come from that. At the same time, I know I don’t have to do college—I’ve been open to trade school for a while. That was actually my original plan before I started thinking about college, but growing up around people who did hard labor, I’ve always heard how exhausting it is. Still, becoming an electrician is really appealing to me, and I don’t think anyone in my family has done it yet.

On top of that, I’m also considering the military, mainly the Marines, since I know they can help with college.

I guess my main questions are:
	•	With my current situation, how do I even start looking into colleges?
	•	Will my Ds and past mistakes completely ruin my chances?
	•	What careers actually come from psychology or philosophy?
	•	How does the military help with college, and would it be a good route?
	•	Would trade school be a better move for someone like me?
	•	Any advice on staying disciplined now that I actually care about my future?

I know I should’ve been thinking about this earlier, but I really want to make the best decision for myself moving forward. Any advice would be appreciated.",How do I start looking into colleges with my current situation?,"The individual is a high school senior who has not previously taken school seriously but is now making an effort to turn things around.

They have received a few Ds on their transcript, which contributes to their concerns about college admissions.

1ick64u,Will university be the best years of my life?,"TL;DR: Life in university was perfect. Friends, walkable campus, amenities, physical activity. Since graduating, struggling to achieve same level of happiness as I had. Life is good, but good will never beat perfect. How to move on, try to achieve happier years?



Graduated University in June of 2024 and still struggling to live up to the happiness that I once had. I've heard so many people say ""college will be the best years of your life"" and I truly hope that it's not true, but more and more I've been scared that they will be.

In the 5 years I was in school, I lived with my best friends, and a 10 minute walk away from the rest of my best friends. I was physically active multiple times a week, going to the gym, playing intramural sports, etc. I went to a campus everyday that was walkable, had great food, constant social events, and every amenity I could ever need within a 10 minute walk. I was hanging out with my friends and girlfriend every single day. I enjoyed learning new things, putting new skills to use, and having structure and purpose in my life. All in all, it was literally the perfect life for me. I was really really happy during those years.

Since graduating, I've moved back into my parents' house. Some friends live nearby that I see maybe once or twice a week. I see my girlfriend most weekends as she's still in school. I know that what I miss most about uni life is spending time with my friends, so I've been making a big effort to see them. Trying to plan big get togethers once a month, etc. But going from seeing friends every day to once/twice a week has still been a difficult change.

Objectively, my life is great right now. I have a cool job involving travel lined up for this summer, I'm in a happy relationship, I've picked up some hobbies that I dropped due to school being too busy, I'm seeing friends atleast once a week. Nevertheless, I'm still struggling with comparing my life to how it used to be. Life right now is good, but it's hard to beat how it was when it was literally perfect. I'm grateful that I had such an amazing time in school, but now that shift is making me really miss how life used to be.

1ib0kyf,How did you deal with moving back to your (isolated) home town after university only to be completely alone?,"Last year I finished my undergrad in biology and social science. It was truly the best years of my life, and I believe my social identity was closely tied to that experience.   
  
After a pretty serious break-up and having drained my savings due to the cost of living while studying, I've moved back in with my family in the countryside. It's near-rural and 5 hours away from the closest city. The population isn't terribly small but it's demographic is retirees or families. The only work here is in aged care, health and youth education. Once you turn 18, you basically pack up and leave. Even the local McDonalds is run by people in their 60s.   
  
I was fortunate enough to finally find a casual job at a bank after two months of job searching. Even the local supermarket wouldn't hire me. The job is low hours but living rent-free with your grandparents means I can save every penny. To fill in the extra time, I've enrolled in a teaching support course at the local community education centre.   
  
My plan is to buy a car and save through 2025 so I can cover the insane cost of finding and securing accomodation in the city. There, I will hopefully find work in high schools and then pursue a masters in teaching which, alongside my undergrad, will qualify me to teach in upper high school levels. After a decade of that, I would like to try my hand at education roles in universities since I love everything about universities - the phsyical space, community, impressive people etc.   
  
My only problem right now is dealing with post-grad depression, getting over my ex, and insane lonliness. I'm not lying when I say there is no one remotely close to my age over 18 in this town, except for the occasional tradesman who'd rather talk about beer and sport than science and art. I've lost contact with the majority of my friends due to moving away, the break-up and physical distance (Australia is massive, especially without cheap transport and free time). I still have friends I can talk to online, but nothing compares to in-person friendships.

I'm studying accounting with a minor in business analytics in the middle east. I'm a canadian citizen so I plan on going back to Canada to get my CPA and masters and was just wondering if anyone can give me advice on a few things. For further context I would ideally like to work in Ontario or Alberta but if you think there are better places to work as a new grad please let me know.
1. Which city is the best with regards to opportunities and salary for new grads
2. Does GPA really matter for accounting new grads
3. Public vs private accounting firms which do I have a better chance of getting hired
4. Should I get a car? Do you feel like it's necessary? Or should I wait to be earning a certain amount before I get one
5. Is it realistic for me to expect to be living without a roommate? Because in all honesty the main reason I'm rushing to leave my house is because I would really like to live alone and not deal with anyone or their problems because having to deal with my family has taken a huge toll on me. I feel like even if I'm struggling in other regards, knowing I'm coming home to an empty house is worth every bit of it.
6. Should I be saving money in my early career? Like is it realistic for me to expect to be able to put money into my savings?
7. Since quite a few companies cover the cost of getting your CPA, should I find a job first before registering or I should begin the registration process now? If I start it now will I be reimbursed if I find a job later?
I know this is a lot, but I'm feeling so anxious about the future because I realized I have nooo cluuee on what I'm supposed to be doing or how to really function completely on my own.

1i1nzb0,Dealing with post grad depression,"Hello, I F 23 recently graduated in May and have been in the one of my worst periods of depression I’ve had since being in highschool. College was never really that great for me, I struggle with general anxiety and social anxiety and to be frank the first 3 years of undergrad sucked. I could say I’m fairly smart in that I never struggled academically. I was a mathematics major and while yes I had hard classes I never really had to study and my concern was never not passing but wheather I’d get an A or an AB in the class. I didn’t have many friends I was too afraid to do anything alone including eating.

Just to give an idea of how bad my anxiety is, I started seeing a therapist my first semester of freshman year to help with my anxiety but mostly in a desperate state of need because I lost nearly 20 lbs in my first semester simply because I had too much anxiety to go get food, even off campus, and lived off of a case of coke and the few frozen meals my dad bought for me when I came home on the weekends. 

This therapist wasn’t my first one I ever saw but she’s been the best and I still see her till this day. After 3 years she finally convinced me to try anxiety meds going into my senior year(I was very against it because my parents forced me to be on them when I was in middle/highschool for obvious reasons). Anyways I got prescribed Cymbalta and it was the greatest thing that happened to me. My energy was through the roof, I wasn’t sad any more, I was working out and starting out my senior year of college I even made (somewhat they were my roomates friends) 4 friends. This made my senior year an absolute blast. I was going out Thursday-Saturday the weekdays were filled with hangouts late night study sessions I even met a guy and was going on all sorts of dates. All things that my anxiety filled self could never have dreamed about when she spent the first 3 years crying herself to sleep. 

However second semester came and while things were still great 1 friend dropped out, another (my roommate) started a fight with my boyfriend over me and stopped talking to me altogether(a story for another time), and the other was in a hell of a semester in nursing school. While I still had my 1 friend and my boyfriend I was having to practically beg for my friend to do anything bc she was so busy studying and my and my boyfriend and I pretty much agreed that it was a fwb situation because we couldn’t commit to the long distance after graduation (well he couldn’t I could). And so while my senior year was still great I started to dread the end more and more because for the first time ever I was loving life. 

Every day was still roughly a great day. Until graduation came. Due to a miscommunication I had a horrible anxiety attack on my graduation day. My makeup was ruined I was crying when I grabbed my diploma, I don’t have a single picture I liked and didn’t even post that I graduated anywhere. I hate this day so much, what I spent 4 years working for ruined by my stupid anxiety. My 1 friend moved back home and a few weeks later my boyfriend ended things.

I applied for jobs hoping to do something related to math, and I got a job within two weeks of graduating as a software engineer and I was ecstatic they told me my job would involve math . I’m making more money than I ever dreamed I’d start out at as a new grad. Except I’ve spent every day since graduating in tears. I thought I was hiding it well but one of my coworkers pulled me aside and told me he was there for me to talk to if I ever thought about doing something stupid to myself. And my dad who would never ever let me quit a job without another lined up told me to quit because the stress was going to kill me. But I’ve been stick it out for the pay, bullheaded like my dad. Everyday I leave work exhausted mentally drained that this is my new reality. It’s not that my job is hard per se but just draining. I stare at a computer for 9 hours and have maybe 20 minutes of social conversation a day. There’s not even a full 9 hours of work so 6-7 of these hours are with NOTHING to do. And the other 2-3 hours is being asked to do stuff that I don’t know how to do that isn’t related to math that I struggle to figure out. The social isolation and lack of work is not great for someone with the level of anxiety that I do. 

I’ve tried a handful of new meds but nothings helped and I’m back to what I was on before when I was happy. I’m back in my hometown with no friends. My mom always tells me to reach out to people from highschool or go on a dating app, but I was bullied all throughout highschool and I’m still not over my ex enough to start dating again. When I can I go back up to college to see my one friend who’s taking a fifth year, but I always end up an emotional mess reminiscing on what I once had. 

I get so angry at myself and the world that my first three years of college were spent alone in my dorm. And that when I had finally made friends and had better control of my anxiety I had less that a year to enjoy it. I mean hell even my ex who was 31 has friends from highschool he hangout with weekly. It’s been 7 months since graduating and I’m still sad. 

I truly do have a passion for studying mathematics and have long considered pursuing a PhD in mathematics. Although I was discouraged by my advisor to apply as she said our school isn’t good enough for me to get into a grad program let alone any of the schools I wanted to apply to. This was despite me having a 3.9 gpa and spending 2 years working as a math instructor in undergrad. I talked with my therapist and I figured I’d take a gap year save money and reapply. I was dead set on it too, wrote my personal statement got the information in order except I never got my letters of recommendation to send everything in. Because I realized that I couldn’t live off the stipend a PhD program provides and wouldn’t be able to have a well enough job to afford living. So for now my gap year has turned into a two year gap. 

I spend all my free time stuck in near debilitating and existential dread of where I belong and what I should be using my life for. I’ve been trying to chase the high that was my last year of college and nothing compares. I’m left with just memories as a painful reminder of what was and what will never again be. 

I’ve been really trying to push myself to do self care, I’ve bought some books some math some non fiction and have been reading a little each week. I try and do skincare and makeup to make me feel better about myself. Perhaps spending a little too much here and there in hopes that the material items will help me feel something. But it’s not enough to pull me out of my depression.

I guess I’m looking for advice of how to deal with the post grad blues? I thought things would get easier as time moved on but it’s just gotten worse.

During her time in college, she experienced significant anxiety and social anxiety, leading to struggles with social interaction and friendships. Though she excelled academically, she faced emotional challenges, particularly during the first three years of her undergraduate experience, which she described as ""sucking."" To address her anxiety, she began seeing a therapist during her freshman year and was eventually prescribed medication, which initially helped improve her mental health during her senior year.

After graduation, she began working as a software engineer, a position she secured shortly after completing her degree. Despite the initial excitement about her job and salary, she has been experiencing a deep sense of depression and isolation since starting. She feels mentally drained and struggles with the social aspects of her work environment.

She is back in her hometown, feeling disconnected and without a social support network, as her friends have moved away or are preoccupied with their own lives.

1hwvtfc,"Adjusting to life after high school, as a college commuter living at home (who didn't want to commute)","Sorry I know this is really long but it's hard to explain everything in a short way. 😭

**tldr: I'm disappointed because my college experience isn’t what I wanted. forced to commute tough, haven’t moved on from high school. feel too undeveloped for a college freshman**

I'm not sure if this is the right community to post because I'm still in school, however I feel like my problems fit the most in this group

I recently graduated high school last spring and started my freshman year of college during the fall. My college experience is not going the way I wanted it to. I commute to a school thats 25 minutes away from where I live. I only have my permit so I get dropped off by my parents. It makes me feel miserable.

*Throughout high school (and even before then) I would over-romanticize college. Don't get me wrong I was nervous to grow up, i've always been, but at the same time I was so excited for a new start. For freedom, for a new environment, for a life thats mine and not anyone elses anymore. I remember when my sister first started college when I was a preteen, I saw her life change and how much she grew.*

*In high school, I had similar feelings. I used to look up colleges during class and look at everything that colleges had to offer. I would tour colleges and have the feeling of excitement. Whenever I would have a mental breakdown in high school or feel disappointment, I immediately thought of college and the new start I would have. It was scary, but exciting.*

But at the same time, I grew so much in high school. The pandemic hit when I was in 8th grade and my entire freshman year of hs was online, so when I went inperson sophomore year I felt like I was in a whole new world despite being in the same district. I became friends with people I never was friends with before, I went through moments I never went through as a kid, I found interests and connections I never had. High School was not perfect, I had a lot of lows and moments that I'm glad are over, but at the same time I had a lot of good and transformative moments that made me grow a lot as a person.

Why am I not feeling so much the same about college? Months ago when college decision due dates were coming up, I still didn't know where to go. I wanted to go on college tours but my parents were like ""No, I'm busy"" or ""Why don't you settle in with this school?"" or ""No that school is too far."" I don't understand. My sister was allowed to dorm for her first year, but my parents were so against it for mine. I had to settle in commuting to the school I currently go. (me and my parents had a bunch of arguments during senior year about college, they kept stressing me about college)

*I don't hate my current school. I like the school, I like the campus, the class sizes, the friends, some memories. But I don't feel like I'm growing. I plan on transferring for sophomore and this was something I knew for a long time. I always wanted to go at least away from home, for new experiences, for new freedoms, for a new version of myself. I feel miserable, I've been seeing the counseling center and my school.*

I don't feel like I'm moving on from high school. Theres always the saying of ""peaked in high school!"" and it's making me feel worse about my problems. I feel like I can't talk about this without people saying ""you peaked in high school."" I do miss high school, and I did grow a lot and have good moments, but it wasn't perfect. I had a lot of lows and parts of my life I wanted to change (and some parts that I'm still going through now unfortunately)

*I feel like my life was better months ago when I was still in high school, which I feel sad. I always saw college as an opportunity to grow and be a better version. However being forced to commute under my parents rules and having no ""college-aged"" life is making me feel worse. I did not peak in high school, I just think I'm not living the college way I want.*

Another crisis I'm having is just growing up. I don't know how to act. As a kid I over romanticized high school and not being in it anymore feels so weird. I don't think my problems are that different from a high schoolers, I mean when I see high school media I'm like ""that was my life recently, it's not that different from now"" (i mean i'm still a teenager going through teen problems) However I'm scared that I might me immature. Am I supposed to have the same maturity as an upperclassmen?

It also really makes me upset when I see people talk about their college experiences and maturity. I hate when people expect me to fit into those boxes of maturity. ""Oh but you live alone freedom"" ""You have parental freedom"" ""You dorm"" I'm a commuter with no freedom and I hate it. 

I plan on transferring for my sophomore year, maybe then I'll get the college life and growth I always wanted.

1hw0s4s,How to deal with lack of social life after university?,"TLDR: I will be working from home. I am moving towns with my partner who can financially support me, but I don't feel ready to leave my social life I have here. I only just got one.

Hello! 


I graduate from college this semester. Tomorrow is my last first day of school for the rest of my life. I'm getting a Bachelor of Fine Arts with a focus in Illustration and Ceramics. 

I know I will be fine financially. My partner and I have long term plans together, and he already has a job lined up for post graduation. We will live comfortably if we budget ourselves. No plans for kids, just two cats. We have plans to get me an at home ceramics studio sorted out. 

I know I will physically and financially be fine. 

What scares me is the social aspect. We are moving to a dying town one state over. He will only be working at this plant for a year or two before the company moves him, but the town is dying with little to no art scene. 

I was in marching band my first three years of college, and a music fraternity for the last few years. I left both of those early to focus on getting my degree (getting an art degree is hard, believe it or not). In both groups, I never really felt like I belonged. They were fun and I loved them, but it was more of a family thing than a friend thing, if that makes sense. I'm on the spectrum and have always struggled a bit with making friends, and even being able to tell if someone is my friend.

 This past semester I was able to focus on making connections with my classmates for once, and now have a good friend group. We play DND, most of us are illustrators. But I only just now got the social part of college I've been waiting for, and I'll be losing it in just a few months. 

I'll have them as online friends, but I need in person interaction outside of my partner. Working most service jobs while I build up my art career is almost out of the question due to my autism (I had panic attacks and meltdowns frequently while working food jobs before). 

Have any of you guys managed a social life while working remotely?

1hq6bot,Unsure of what to do after Master's ,"I really don't know how to start this but im hoping for some advice on what to do im at my wits end

I'm a masters grad from FIU in psychology. Psychology was something I was truly passionate in and after I graduated with a Bachelor's I went into the Masters programs, but I had no idea which one. Im an only child and the first in my family to attend college, so after speaking with a counselor and going back and forth a bit, I went into the Applied Behavior Analysis masters program, I did my research on the field, saw that it was about helping children with autism and related conditions and thought the field might be a good fit for me.

It was a *mistake*

ABA was absolutely NOT what I expected it to be: the field was super abusive to the kids (i once saw a supervisor yelling at a kid for being a little hyper), the supervisors and coworkers were massively disorganized for my practicum, they were rude and dissmissve and played favorites, and maybe i just had a bad site but I did more searching about the field and found it was INCREDIBLY sketchy and a lot of it just wasn't good.

The thing was that I couldn't back out or switch masters once practicum started in the 2nd semester because that's only when you learn the truth after the first semester, so I was pretty much stuck with this until I graduated in May, and ever since I've been job hunting with no luck. I don't want to stay with ABA even though I have the RBT certification (did the actual exam not the 40 hour site thing) because it's such a terrible field both science wise and working wise, but I don't know what to do and have been fruitlessly applying to all types of jobs I can think of

I have no idea who to ask or who to turn to since I'm sure as hell not trusting the FIU counselors again and my parents, even though they've been housing me, are somewhat boomerish and don't understand that todays job market is incredibly terrible. 

TLDR: Im a masters graduate with a MS psychology degree on its own with basically no valid credentialling for actual legitimate fields and have no idea where to go with it

1hldm3u,I'm miserable after moving home after graduating university.,"I spent two years living in another state from my family to do my university degree. Sure, there were tough times, but they were actually the happiest years of my life as an adult. After graduating, I didn't have a job lined up, so I moved states to live with my parents and save on rent. However, I really underestimated the toll it would have on my mental health. My parents still treat me like a child and my whole family is just so dysfunctional. The house is constantly filthy/messy and people are always arguing.

I really regret moving home, and now realize that some things aren't worth saving money for. I plan to move out and rent with other people, but I know my parents are against it because they want me to save money. I also know that this city is more expensive to rent than my previous one.

I just can't help but feel like I made a massive mistake moving here and hate myself for it. I wish I could go back in time and stay in my uni city - I didn't realize how good it was until I left.

I was wondering if anyone has gone through a similar experience or has some advice? I feel like everyone hypes up graduation to be this amazing thing, but no one ever talks about the tough times afterwards.

1hj26vx,Reflection on life 3 years after College.,"Hi guys,

I graduated from college with my MBA in accounting in December 2021. It’s been roughly three years since then. I thought I would give my reflections on how life has been since then.

The first two years 2022-2024 were absolutely horrible. I applied to over 1000 companies and no one wanted to hire me. I was absolutely depressed and felt worthless. I went through a terrible surgery that left me half deaf and everyone looked at me as a failure. (Or at least it felt like it.) I had no money and the aftermath of Covid left everything beyond expensive. I had to float myself using credit cards and racked up over 8k worth of debt on top of my student loans. I went through 20 interviews and couldn’t get past the third one. I tried applying for disability because but didn’t have enough work credits to qualify. I tried applying for supplemental security income but didn’t qualify because I wasn’t disabled enough. I had no friends anymore after my best friends girlfriend tried cheating on him with me and dipped. My dog passed away, uncle passed away, grandfather passed away, friends passed away. My car shit out on me (a few weeks after starting my first job.)

It was really just a terrible time altogether.

I just wanted to say that everything got better for me after I started my first finance job in 2024. The first job I got was absolutely horrible and was a 100 mile commute but I knew I needed the experience and the pay was decent. I put up with some terrible coworkers. That company is getting sued now but I job hopped to my current company and now make almost 6 figures with a 15 minute commute. (One way.) Since starting my new job I have paid off all my credit card debt, invested in physical therapy to improve my health, attended over 8 concerts, paid off my student loans, and finally broke 10k+ in savings for the first time in my life.

I still struggle. I still have not recovered from the surgery. My health is bad. My heart is still broken from losing my best friends, my family, my pet.  I am lonely and can’t believe my mid 20s have passed by so quickly. I am bitter from things that have happened in my past that I don’t think I deserved from the people who are supposed to support me most. (Family and friends.)

However I struggled so fucking much to get where I’m at and I’m so proud of myself for finally have a good year after what seemed like a perpetual black hole. It’s incredible how many of my problems came from lack of money. However, money has not solved my loneliness. It has made it easier to treat the one friend I do have left as well as my sister who is a single mother. 

Life after college has been very lonely and maybe I’m only writing this because I wish I had a friend I could share my thoughts with. But don’t give up hope because getting that first job is the hardest and life will absolutely improve once you get that.",I'm feeling lonely after going through significant losses and changes in my life. How can I cope with this loneliness and connect with others again?,"The individual graduated with an MBA in accounting in December 2021. After graduation, they struggled significantly over the next two years, applying to over 1000 companies without receiving any job offers, which led to feelings of depression and worthlessness. They underwent a surgery that resulted in half deafness, compounding their challenges. Financially, they faced hardships, racking up over $8,000 in credit card debt on top of their student loans, primarily due to the high costs of living post-Covid. 

Socially, they experienced a loss of friendships, particularly following a fallout involving their best friend's girlfriend. They also faced personal losses, including the deaths of their dog, uncle, grandfather, and friends. Their vehicle broke down shortly after they started their first job. They eventually started a finance job in 2024, which required a 100-mile commute, but they felt it was necessary for gaining experience. 

Throughout these struggles, they noted that they had no support system, feeling isolated and lonely, particularly after losing important relationships and struggling with their health. Despite later achieving financial stability, they mentioned ongoing feelings of loneliness and a sense of bitterness regarding the support (or lack thereof) from friends and family.","The person is reflecting on their difficult life experiences after graduating college, including struggles with job hunting, health issues from surgery, financial debt, loneliness, and the loss of loved ones.",mid 20s,male,single,finance,middle class,bad,MBA,"depressed, struggling, lonely",No,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterSchool/comments/1hj26vx/reflection_on_life_3_years_after_college/,LifeAfterSchool
1hh49ql,"Finally got job offers, yet not excited about either","So I have been interviewing non-stop for jobs this semester. I interviewed with a lot of really good companies where I would’ve liked the work I was doing and the company I was doing it for, but I just couldn’t get offers from any of them.

The one company is even in a location I really like and is meeting my target wage before even trying to negotiate with them. I feel like a lot less companies will be recruiting in the spring for something I genuinely enjoy and I also don’t even know what companies would be left. 

Even though I’m not a fan of either company, I’m leaning towards saying yes to at least one of them and then keep looking if I like something better, but I feel like I would feel really bad for potentially reneging the offer.

1hfi0jj,i dont know what i wanna do in life?,"Growing up, I was always fascinated by science and dreamed of becoming an engineer or scientist. My hobby was building robots and working with electronics—it was something I truly enjoyed. At the same time, I was a massive foodie and loved cooking. Being in the kitchen gave me a sense of peace, and I cherished every moment I spent experimenting with food.  

Eventually, I decided to follow my passion for cooking and pursue a career as a chef. It felt like the perfect choice, even though I knew it would be a tough path. I was excited about the journey ahead and worked hard to get into one of the top culinary colleges. Once there, I thrived in the classes and became one of the top students.  

When the time came for my internship, I was thrilled to work at one of the best restaurants. It was an incredible learning experience, and the people I worked with were fantastic. But as the months went by, the harsh reality of the profession started to sink in. I was working 12–16 hours a day, barely getting 5 hours of sleep, and living like this for months on end. The compensation for such grueling work was, frankly, disheartening—just enough to scrape by, with no room to save.  

Even when I looked ahead, the prospect of climbing the ranks didn’t seem much better. I know not every kitchen or workplace is the same, but I realized I couldn’t see myself doing this for the rest of my life.  

Now, as I’m about to start my last semester at university, I feel lost. I’m sure I don’t want to work in a professional kitchen, but I also don’t know what I want to do instead. My goal has always been to make a big, meaningful impact in the world, and I feel like I need to explore something new.

So I’m not going to get paid to sing any big roles.

What I need is a life style where I can get my voice/body where I need. School gave me the refinement and now I need to put it to work in actual life before getting my DMA/moving abroad.

1h5zdkl,How common is it for people to move somewhere completely new and far away right after college?,"I apologize if this might be a little naive for me to ask but I've been thinking about where I want to be after graduation and this got me thinking.

I know some people who live elsewhere for a job after graduation but they (1) live in or near where they went to college, (2) live somewhere else that's still somewhat close by (e.g. Sac, LA, OC, SD, Portland, Seattle), and/or (3) live in a place they have family or friends. I know one or two people who probably don't fulfill any of those criteria and moved to NYC for a job, but it's NYC and I know people from all over the place who did summer internships in NYC anyways, so I could see the appeal. This person definitely does not fulfill (1) or (2). I'm pretty sure he/she doesn't fulfill (3) either and that he/she lives alone in Philly. The company he/she works for isn't headquartered anywhere near Philly either. By the way, this person is in the architecture field. It's interesting how this person literally moved across the country all by themselves to a completely new place right out of college for their first job. I'd guess that he/she just really wanted to get out of his/her parent's house and really wanted to be in Philly or the northeast and maybe start a whole new life there. I'm not that close with him, so I'm a little uncomfortable about asking him directly. I'm curious how common it is for new college graduates to make this kind of move. Is it more common than I'm imagining?

Personally, I don't know if I would make that kind of move right outside of college. I feel like it would make me uncomfortable considering I don't know anybody outside the west coast and have very little familiarity with the northeast or east coast. I haven't done an internship outside the west coast. But it sounds like all of that is true for this person as well. I think after I graduate, I'll probably stay in my parent's house if possible, but I think other areas are still worth looking into. I think I'm pretty likely going to go to graduate school, but it won't be right away.

I'm sorry if someone knows who I'm referring to in this post. I don't have any negative intentions. All it boils down to is that I'm curious about how common it is to make the type of move that this person did right after graduation.

For the most part, there are so many factors that cause us to be unhappy with our work… and often, we can’t precisely identify why.

* Motivators: Markers of job satisfaction
* Hygiene Factors: Markers of job dissatisfaction

Very often, we can never find the motivation needed if our basic work ‘hygiene factors’ are not met. This was extremely interesting for me to learn about and I wanted to break it down for you here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le5Wfk4zWd8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le5Wfk4zWd8)

i’m currently a junior at university and i overall just feel like i had higher expectations for it. i’m not enjoying my time as much as i anticipated when i graduated high school. during high school, i didn’t like my time there that much either as i felt lonely and isolated sometimes, and wanted to go far away for college. i did just that but in college, i feel the same way as i did in high school. i haven’t really made any meaningful connections here. i don’t have a significant other, or a close tight knit group of friends. i have people i can hang out with and talk to and stuff but i don’t have like,,, a core friend group and all of my relationships here feel surface level. i’m such a floater friend, just like i was in high school. and also a lot of these friends have kind of done me dirty and were lowkey not good friends to me, but i can’t do anything bc i feel like they’re all i have. i feel like a loner, even tho i know i’m not lonely, but also, i don’t really see any of these bonds lasting after graduation. it just always feels like everyone else has other people, and i’m kind of an afterthought friend who people will try to make plans with once every few months. i spend 99% of my time alone, and it feels so lonely. i’ve joined clubs, tried initiating things with people in my classes, but it’s so draining and my energy is never matched so i’m kind of just counting down the days til i graduate. however, at the same time, i’m nervous that even tho i want to leave right now, i’m gonna look back at these years and miss them. (i’m a very nostalgic person). i did the same in high school- i wanted to get out so bad but now i look back and miss those years- even tho i enjoy college much better than high school. 

i feel like i just placed these expectations of me in college having an S/O and a nice tight knit group of friends in college and not having that makes me really upset. maybe at the same time, everything is just all in my head. i don’t know. i just wonder, did anyone also feel this way in college, and has post grad been better for y’all? i’m so scared my social life is gonna be even worse after college because you’re not constantly seeing people and you have to go even more out of your way to make friends and meet people. is it even possible to meet an S/O after college??? everyone says it’s so much harder. i just don’t know and i’m kind of anxious about the future. i really don’t like where i am at life right now but i feel like i’m gonna look back in a few years and miss these years, so i also want to make the most of it without my negative mindset impacting me. i really don’t know, i’d appreciate any insight. i’m really betting on post grad life being much better.

1gperww,Does anyone else kinda miss college...?,"I recently graduated from a public university in california back in June and I oddly miss being in school. I recently moved back home in the Bay Area with my parents and absolutely dislike it. I feel pretty lonely because most of my friends are in socal while im in the Bay Area. I dont really talk to my friends from high school or a lot of them have moved out of our hometown. I'm currently working retail part time while spending my weekdays looking for a full time corporate job/interviewing.

But socially, this feels very similar to my time in community college. Very lonely, just going to work and then going home. Parents aren't much help because they still treat me like a child and they're pretty controlling/over protective (if you have asian parents iykyk). 

When I was at UCSD I felt like I had a very social structure of spending my week day going to class/studying with friends and then my Fridays + weekends going out to the club/raves or simply getting food with friends (yes I balanced going out and studying dont worry lol). I feel like alot of  the social time that I have had was stripped away from me in a way. Even though I only graduated college a few months ago, I often times look back at the pictures and memories I had on my phone.

It was so unbelievably nice to see people who know me and understand me. I know that things just take time but I’m just so over meeting new people here. I just want to see people everyday who understand me. Again, I know this just takes time but it honestly just sucks and I’m sick of forcing myself to go out and meet new people it feels exhausting. 

Something else I am struggling with is living by myself. In college I lived with the same roommate for 5 years and we had the best relationship. I really miss having someone to come home and talk to that understood me and held me accountable. It was so much easier to go to the gym, do the dishes, etc. living with a friend. I am struggling so hard to do things for myself. 

All I want to do is run back to the same city I went to college in. Realistically I know this won’t help because things are just different now but it sucks.

1gkt0m8,"After going through college depressed, I’m so confused/uneasy after college","I’m seeing a therapist now, but also wanted to just rant here.

I went through college quite severely depressed. I dealt with a chronic health conditions that really mentally affected me right before freshman year.

It made me unbelievably distressed, insecure, and just a shell of who I was. Secondarily, I felt bitter because I was watching everyone around me have fun and develop, whereas I was stuck in my own problems.

I was somewhat high functioning though. Fear of regret was almost solely what pushed me to do things. It was really difficult, and often joyless, but I still passed classes, went out, and dated a little bit. 

Graduated, moved to a major city, making good money. It was just like everything came crashing down. I was bottling up everything for so long just pushing myself, and I felt so depressed I didn’t even know it was possible to feel worse. My first few months in this new city, consisted of me isolating myself, neglecting my life, and just so hopeless and down that I could barely focus on the job that I had once dreamed of.

Whatever I was hanging onto in college was just gone. And I couldn’t run away from my problems forever. Yet didn’t know how to cope with them either.

Also I realized - I felt like I just don’t know who I am. In college I played the role of a confident, chill, too cool guy, and hid my depression always. But I also hated this acting game I played. 

Idk… for me college was indescribably rough and I always hoped it would miraculously get better afterward. But now I just feel like I don’t even know myself and my own life. I can act and keep acting but it’s not the life I want to live. And in reality, I’m just a severely depressed dude who can somewhat maintain the appearance of a decent life. And still incredibly bitter/sad that my personal development and zest for life has just dissipated ever since highschool",How can I cope with feelings of depression and a loss of identity after graduating from college?,"The individual experienced a significant mental health challenge, specifically severe depression, throughout their college years, which was triggered by a chronic health condition that affected them just before their freshman year. This condition led to feelings of distress and insecurity, contributing to a sense of bitterness as they observed their peers enjoying life and making progress while feeling trapped in their own struggles. 

Despite these challenges, they managed to function at a somewhat high level, motivated by a fear of regret. They completed their college education, passing classes, engaging socially, and dating, albeit in a joyless manner. 

After graduating, they relocated to a major city and began making good money, but this move coincided with a deterioration in their mental health. They found themselves isolating and neglecting various aspects of their life during the initial months in the new city, feeling hopeless and unable to concentrate at work. This decline marked a stark contrast from their college experience, where they had maintained a façade of confidence and coolness while masking their depression.

1g678dv,"Anxious and Feeling like a Failure in my ""Gap Year""","I graduated college a couple of months ago and things feel like it has been stuck at the same place. After Graduation, I decided I would go on a little trip with my friends to have some fun after college since the whole journey in college was chaotic. After I came back from this trip, I decided to take a month off to have the summer vacation that I missed since high school. It was a time for me to have some more fun with my friends back home.

Now, I have been constantly sending out job applications and looking for jobs but this whole process has been so dehumanizing for me. The constant ghosting, rejections, and getting to the last stage to be dropped. For context, I am taking this gap year to get some experience in the Legal industry in some type of way as an intern, legal assistant, or receptionist at a law firm. I am also gonna be studying for the LSAT but the whole studying that I started weeks ago has been making me a little sad. My family is constantly asking me what I am going to do and I am starting to feel the pressure from them.

I used to be able to use college as an excuse to figure out things. But now that I graduated, I feel like a failure and I hate going on Linkedin to see people post about getting new jobs and grad schools. I know I should not compare myself to others but it is honestly so hard not to. I also apply for part-time jobs at retail stores and restaurants, since I need the extra money for something in the meantime as I look for jobs in the Legal industry. However, nothing appears to be working out and I feel rather stuck and lost at home. It doesn't help that my family just thinks I am some lazy person who is not trying hard enough to find a job.

I do have somewhat of a support system. However, this whole post-grad life has made me realize how burnout I have been and this constant feeling of anxiety and stress is not helping. I know I should not feel defeated after rejection since there will be jobs. It's not the one singular rejection that hurts but rather the pile of rejections that keeps adding up that is starting to affect me. How does one find a way to feel more positive after graduation?

1fxgzua,emptiness after college ,"I graduated in May. I landed a job this summer and have been working there since. I grateful to be able to live at home rent free while working but for some reason I can’t shake this feeling of nothingness. 

I came out of graduation very self assured about my future. I didn’t exceed in college, no where near to that, but I told myself every morning ritualistically I’d get a job. And just like that I began a new chapter. 

My job is not bad by any means. It pays well, I work with friendly people, and it’s a good mix of ages. But every morning, like clockwork, I wake up with this unbearable dreadful feeling in my chest. I have this sense of longing for when life felt more real and unpredictable. 

My college experience to most would seem like a nightmare. And in some ways it was. There was a lot of isolation, loneliness, and soul crushing experiences. It was not your typical college experience, but man did I learn a lot. There was fun and wild nights. There were nights in. It was such a bizzare mix of experiences. Regardless of that, what I miss more than anything, is the freedom and energy. I cannot seem to rekindle that sense of adventure. I had such a zest for life even when I got lost down a few darkened paths. 

Something about the work week zaps me of the ability to see a vision forward. I miss the awe I had for what was next. I miss being surrounded by the chaos and passionate peers. Now I feel restricted and stuck. I know I don’t have to stay at this job forever, but eventually I need to sustain myself financially. And the only way to do that is to make money. It just feels meaningless. What is my purpose if I’m just here to make money?

1ftdcec,"God this is 100x worse than I thought it would be, I'm seriously struggling","To preface - I am seeing a therapist so I'm trying my best to help myself.

Where do I begin. College was difficult for me, I struggled with my mental health, times when I was deeply unhappy. I didn't have the resources/clarity to seek help. But there was also a sort of safety net, you know? It's just college, nothing seemed that serious. There were many distractions, friends, sports, activities, that kept me somewhat grounded.

After grad, I moved to a major city in the US. Full of activities, people, fun. I was excited. I didn't fear what a lot of people worry about in terms of boredom or loneliness. Well, clearly my existing mental health issues were not solved. They came back even stronger once I lost the distractions in college. Furthermore, because I was a real working ""adult"" now, I felt like that safety net of college was removed. This was my life now, less distractions, no more putting off my deepest problems saying ""oh maybe it'll fix itself"". That realization in itself made me more depressed.

On top of that, i'm dealing with a potential relationship ending. The most amazing girl I could ever ask for. The type of girl that you fall for when you first see her, and the more time you spend together, the more you realize how special she is and you feel like she is truly one of a kind. I love this girl and she loves me. But after college, she moved across the world for work, no telling when she might come back. We're deciding whether or not to continue this. All signs are pointing to ending the relationship, the distance, the fact that we're both working, the unknown of whether or not we will be physically closer - and then add on my own mental health struggles. 

But my heart is in so much pain right now - all I want is to be with her, I don't know what to think, and I feel like there is no good decision to make here. So I'm struggling like crazy. Feel incredibly depressed/anxious, trouble sleeping, brain is foggy, can't focus at work, isolating myself - the whole shebang. Never did I imagine my life would look like this after graduation, but add on all the responsibilities of being a working adult while dealing with this... I don't know. It's so incredibly tough.",How can I cope with the pain of a potential relationship ending while managing my mental health struggles?,"The individual in crisis has a background that includes significant challenges during their college years, particularly with mental health issues. They found college difficult, experiencing periods of deep unhappiness and lacking the resources or clarity to seek help for these struggles.

After graduating from college, they moved to a major city in the US, where they initially felt excited due to the vibrant environment full of activities and people. However, their existing mental health issues resurfaced more intensely in this new setting, exacerbated by the removal of the safety net that college provided.

1fs6zz1,I wasted my gap year before grad school ,"I contemplated whether I should posy this or not, so here we go:

I graduated in January. I am unemployed and so I am free to do anything with my time before my MA starts in October. I did not do anything during that time. I was initially planning to fix my phone ""addiction"", and subsequently replace it with books and the gym. 

But I didn't do any of that. I'm still spending 7-9 hours on my phone everyday. Obviously, I feel regret. Sometimes I will feel better about this because of advice I read online when it comes to wasting time. But the regret keeps coming back. Its a cycle.

 I think the biggest thing I regret about this is that I will probably never get 9 months of completely free time ever again. I'll do my MA and then probably get a job (if I'm able to get one lol). So this was the perfect opportunity to change my lifestyle a bit to the better. I could have done so much. I had a few reading and learning projects in mind that I wanted to do.

 Now, if I want to do those projects, I have to do them in spite of other stuff, like studying or working, not freely and with as much time as I want. I could have treated it like a job, learn for 8 hours or something. I can't imagine how different I would have become by now.

1fho1eq,did anyone ever find the same sense of community in their post grad town as they did in their student town? where?,"im f23 and graduated from my bachelors april of 2023. since then i've been saving up to complete my masters abroad which means living at home with my parents in the suburbs.

I've noticed when I get sad and miss my 'student life' a lot of the aspects I miss have to do with the town I was living in. I was always in proximity with like minded people my age and getting to and from friends houses was easy. since I lived so close to the school there was always events and gym classes on campus to stay busy. even outside of campus the town I lived in was super walkable and you could easily spend a day taking transit or heading on foot out to little boutiques, markets, and cafes. there was a lot of nature, bars where people loved to talk, and art events/live music nights which I enjoy a lot.

Obviously, the suburbs has none of this and it's definitely affecting my social life and mental health. I know I can't live in a student town forever, but I want to start thinking about where I hope to plant my roots one day and id love if whatever city it was shared some of these qualities that allowed me to connect with people and partake in my hobbies the way I did in undergrad. has anyone found any similarities elsewhere? 

for context I am canadian moving to the uk so im giving this a lot of thought bc at the end of my masters I will hopefully have options to where i can work and have always wanted to move away!
