2025-02-27 22:23:06,1izs9vt,Do I stay in hometown with friends and family or move?,"I’ve lived in my hometown my whole life. I don’t have many friends but a couple that I hangout with.

I don’t want to move 30+ min from them while being in the same city we currently are in because at that point I’d rather just live in my dream state since I wouldn’t see my parents as much anyways.

I just turned 23 last month and didn’t care about my birthday really.  I feel like i’ve been on autopilot for the last decade of my life.

In the past few years all i’ve done is work and go to school because i’m trying to make a better living for myself in this goddamn fucked economy with no safety net. I’m not a negative person at all and my friends know me as the funny, outgoing one but I struggle every single day. 

Okay so this is my last semester of college and it’s been the biggest struggle. My dad passed recently and i’m not even sure how to feel considering the abuse. My externship is draining me but we need 165 hours by May and i’m just doing my best to keep at it, I leave work early Tuesdays and then work a full 8 hours Sundays which only means i’m doing 12 hours a week and I have until May 17th… not to mention the site is an hour away and it was a nightmare trying to find something more local. I work M-F and only have Saturdays and Sundays off to accommodate this.

My car has catalytic issues which my mechanic (bless his heart) is willing to make a payment plan with me since my tags are due next month. I’m still paying off some debt I have but frustrated because I end up using that for other expenses. I’m envious of people who don’t have to live through this, i’d kill to be able to just focus on my studies and school without having to worry about so much on my own.

2025-02-27 20:37:22,1izptj5,how do you work on confidence?,"hi reddit. thank you in advance if you read this post

i (26f) am struggling with confidence. i have 0 self-esteem, despite loving the world, life, and other people. i have struggled with depression for most of my life. my parents are generally absent. over the last few years, i have lost a lot of close friends (10+ year friendship fall out and 2 deaths) and am struggling to make new friends.

despite this, i have an amazing boyfriend who is very confident and did a lot of work to become confident. he is a light, and the fear of losing him is almost paralyzing. my self-esteem issue has developed into extreme anxiety and this has become a strain on my relationship (ex: my bf will have an off day and i incorrectly believe something is wrong within the relationship. despite knowing this is incorrect, my body starts to vibrate with looping thoughts and i can’t relax. the thought pattern is literally “something is wrong. he doesn’t like you. you need to relax or else this will be taken away from you.) it’s a compulsion that spirals out of control, despite recognizing how unhelpful it is. it is also a self-fulfilling prophecy

this happens in most social situations, not just with my boyfriend. the looping thoughts can last hours, even days. i don’t want my emotions to depend on other people’s happiness. my boyfriend is allowed to have bad days without me flying off the handle. however, this doesn’t stop the anxious feeling from accumulating inside my body

this is exhausting all around, and i have been in therapy for about a month now. through therapy, i’ve realized most of my self-esteem issues come from my parents. however, i don’t believe i will ever receive true closure from them and need to move forward on my own. so, how do you work on building confidence? what are your healthy coping mechanisms? how do you manage not receiving closure from people you really want it from? i’d like to live a happy life and i know i am capable. i also want to properly appreciate the love my partner and i share. with my current anxious mindset, i get so stuck on losing our love, that i’m not fully cherishing it for what it is. this is not fair to him

bonus: i have been thinking about going on an anti-anxiety medication. do any of you recommend/have experience with that? i also plan to start going to the gym and have never consistently worked out before. does this help with your emotional regulation as well?

2025-02-27 20:04:06,1izp19r,"Should I seriously do anything about my fiancé's ""gear"" obsession?","My fiancé and I have been together for 5 years. He's worked really hard to get to where he is in his career, he makes a lot more than I do, so I don't want to overstep when it comes to how he spends money. But I'm solely worried from the standpoint of space and waste. 

He has always spent money pretty frivolously, but nothing that adds up to much in relation to his income. 

He's always getting random tech things. Often ""work related"" so it can't be argued. He often tells me he just bought something then found another one because he had bought it before. 

His office area, which is in the living room, is overflowing with bins and boxes. It makes it extremely uncomfortable for him to get work done, he complains a lot. I can't give him more room or storage, he's used it all. 

So many small things that he's never used have filled up large storage totes, which we had to put in our rented outdoor storage area (which was supposed to be temporary while we were moving years ago).

Also has a few things in the entryway behind the curtains, in the pantry, by the sofa, so so much under the bed...  

He keeps every box for every electronic. He keeps every electronic. Lots and lots of seasonal sporting equipment (in his defense, he used to be very active but not the last couple of years, he's gotten too busy with work). 

A couple winters back, he bought us each a pair of snowshoes, and we had fun. So he decided he needed to upgrade his, so he bought another. And new poles too. But he won't let go of the old ones. He also needed special boots.

In fact, for anything he acquires, new shoes are probably also needed. And maybe a backpack. And oh my god a thousand jackets. 

He admits he loves ""gear."" He scrolls eBay, Woot and Backcountry every single day. 

I've definitely picked on him about it (at times less jokingly than others). 

It's a weird line between he seemingly doesn't want to spend that much money for some reason, so he buys all these cheaper things, only to end up buying the big/good thing...

Like last week, he bought a used Samsung watch for $300. And three days later, because it's what he really wanted to begin with, he bought the Apple Ultra 2. I was glad he did — but now that Samsung watch he will just keep and not use. He won't sell it. He won't give it away.

I guess I'm asking...

* Is this a problem? Or am I too sensitive because I grew up in a house where no penny was ever wasted, and items were donated the second they sat on the floor too long? 
* Should I just accept my house will always be cluttered for a happy marriage? He's an amazing guy. 

My big fear is, we're house hunting next year, and he keeps talking about how much space we need. I know enough to know that we cannot ever have enough space if his selling/donation habits don't change. He will always fill everything up and keep everything he can. ","Is his clutter and spending on unnecessary items a problem, or am I too sensitive because of my upbringing? Should I just accept that our house may always be cluttered for the sake of a happy marriage?","The individual writing the Reddit post has been in a relationship with their fiancé for 5 years. They express concern about their fiancé's spending habits, particularly in regard to technology and equipment, which seem to contribute to clutter and a lack of space in their shared living area. 

The poster describes their fiancé as someone who has worked hard to achieve a successful career and earns significantly more than they do. This income disparity causes the poster to feel hesitant about intervening in their fiancé’s spending choices. The fiancé has a tendency to buy multiple items related to hobbies and work, often leading to redundancy, such as purchasing new tech that replaces items he already owns but does not sell or discard. 

The poster's upbringing is also discussed; they grew up in a household where frugality was prioritized, and waste was not tolerated. This background influences their perspective on their fiancé's habits and creates a conflict regarding what is considered acceptable in their living space. 

Additionally, the couple appears to be in a transitional phase, as they are considering house hunting in the following year. The poster is worried that their fiancé's habits of accumulating items will lead to ongoing clutter regardless of living space, indicating a concern about future compatibility in lifestyle preferences.",1,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1izp19r/should_i_seriously_do_anything_about_my_fiancés/,Adulting

While some of them are nice, I feel like I can’t really connect with any of them since I come from a vastly different socioeconomic background. I’ve tried to find other weekly or somewhat regular events to meet new people outside of work, but it feels almost impossible to find ANYTHING.

Is this the reality of adulthood now? If you miss your shots in high school and college, you’re just screwed socially? I’ve had the exact same friend group since freaking elementary school. Most of them are toxic, bad influences on my life. Thus, I desperately want to branch out. I also work in a heavily right wing, religious environment which makes me feel incredibly alienated as someone who isn’t political and rabidly Christian. 

I try meeting people online. 90% of the time they’re shady, fake, flakey people only interested in getting more social media clout than actually making new friends. It’s so hard to trust anyone. Everyone’s willing to abandon you completely the moment someone better comes around.

2025-02-27 18:38:31,1izmz21,How did you know it was time to put your dog down?,"My yorkipoo is almost 15 years old. He has absolutely no bowel control anymore. He wears diapers at all times and no matter how many times he's been out, the diapers have pee in them. He will come back in from a walk, get a diaper on, and 5 minutes later I will watch him pee in the diaper multiple times. I find poop all over my house daily, so we have had to remove all the rugs. Needless to say, when you walk in my house it smells like pee. Since he can't get upstairs into my room anymore, his favorite place to rest is on my couch. Even my 3 year old is disgusted by our couch because it reeks of urine. I clean it constantly and we leave the cushions outside every so often, but I can't get rid of the smell. Even if I bring in a professional service, our dog will go back on the couch right afterwards and it will smell again. We will have to get a new couch but if I do that while he's still with us it will also get ruined, so we're waiting... I'm embarrassed to have guests even walk into my house.

He can't hear anything and his eye sight is poor. He has arthritis and can no longer walk up or down stairs on his own. He needs help getting on and off even little steps. He loves being on the couch so much that even though its difficult for him to get on it, he will bark incessantly and if no one helps him, he'll get himself up.

He can walk and eat, so my husband and I feel that putting him down is not ethical. At the same time, it's not sanitary nor is it fair to our children to live like this.

How did you know it was time to put your dog down? He is my first dog and I never imagined I would consider putting him down until he was truly suffering too much to live. I feel disgusting even considering putting him down before he's suffering, but given his age and his condition... along with the fact that my kids are suffering and we all hate living like this...

2025-02-27 17:52:10,1izludv,"20, NEET, and have pretty much messed up everything thus far. Any help?","Hi! So I don't really know how to start this so i'll just get right in. Up until high school, life was easy (Side note im in the uk so I finished high school around 15/16) I didn't really have to study, and I did alright. Then I started to suffer heavily with Anxiety and depression, I won't get into the weeds of it but I'll just say I was a young carer who's mother passed when I was 12 and have had a history of physical and verbal abuse and bullying all throughout my early years (The abuse wasn't extreme mind you, but still beyond the point of acceptable); Sometime after my mothers death (around 14/15) I turned to alcohol so as to numb myself, and things escalated until I was a full blown poly addict by the time I was 18; I was trying to still function as an addict, and got pretty deep into it as well. By this time I was drinking and drugging as much as I could, doing drugs (mainly LSD, Weed, Ketamine, Codeine, Cocaine, and especially MDMA)

  
Now obviously with this cocktail of drugs, grief, unaddressed trauma, and alcoholism I struggled a lot. I couldn't hold down a job as I struggled to keep up physically due to dyspraxia (If you don't know it basically fucks up mainly co-ordination and mental organisation but a lot of other things as well) and would have frequent panic attacks and anxiety attacks, sometimes lasting up to an hour, and this made my life hell. 

  
Now I tried twice to do college at the age of 16 but failed both times. My anxiety and addictions made it very hard for me to give my studies the attention they needed, and since I'd never studied before I was in for a hell of a shock to the fact that you can't just show up on the day for A-levels and expect a good mark, or at least I couldn't. My second time around my adictions became so bad to the point that I was doing substances in the bathroom and washing it down with cranberry juice and vodka in class. I don't even know how I managed to hide it, but I somehow did. I passed my AS level though not well with C, D, D. In my second year however I suffered a breakdown. My life became just me sitting in bed, doing drugs, and drinking. This all crescendo'd to the point where I did 1g of MDMA a day for 5 days. I suffered a 15 minute seizure and thankfully I survived. Now, you would've thought this would be my wake up call? Well no, I continued down that path up until only just 4 months ago and I'm now thankfully clean (though I'd more so call it California sober) and now that I'm not so fucked up that I can't think I've realized how badly I've messed things up so far. I want to make a change, I really do, but I feel as if my brain only wants the quickest route to pleasure and instant gratification. I can only focus on things I care about and if I have something that doesn't interest me then I find that it feels as if I'm dying as I do it. Not literally, but I just get this horrible feeling and mental cloudiness that begs me to pivot to something more interesting. I don't really know where I'm going with this haha, but I'll just wrap it up here. What can I do so as to stop feeling as if everything has and is continuing to pass me by? Thank you <3",What can I do to stop feeling as if everything has and is continuing to pass me by?,"The individual described in the Reddit post has faced several significant life challenges that have contributed to their current crisis. 

1. **Family Situation**: The person lost their mother at the age of 12, which introduced a deep sense of grief and loss. They also mention being a young carer, indicating a responsibility for family caregiving during a formative period in their life.

2. **Abuse and Bullying**: They have a history of physical and verbal abuse, as well as bullying throughout their early years, which likely contributed to their mental health struggles.

3. **Mental Health Issues**: After entering high school at around 15/16 years old, they began to experience severe anxiety and depression, impacting their ability to function academically and socially.

4. **Substance Abuse**: Following their mother’s death, they turned to alcohol around the age of 14/15 as a coping mechanism for their grief and unaddressed trauma. By the age of 18, they identified themselves as a poly addict, using various drugs, including LSD, weed, ketamine, codeine, cocaine, and MDMA.

5. **Education**: Their struggles with addiction and anxiety led to difficulties in maintaining their education. They attempted college twice at 16 but failed both times, as they couldn't engage with their studies effectively. Their previous lack of study habits further complicated their ability to succeed academically.

6. **Physical Condition**: They have dyspraxia, which affects coordination and mental organization, contributing to their challenges in daily functioning and job retention.

7. **Work History**: Due to their anxiety, addiction, and dyspraxia, they found it difficult to hold down a job, leading to prolonged periods of instability and reliance on substances. 

These factors collectively paint a picture of an individual who has faced significant adversity and trauma, leading to a complex interplay of mental health issues and substance use that has impacted their education, family life, and personal development.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1izludv/20_neet_and_have_pretty_much_messed_up_everything/,Adulting

2025-02-27 15:33:10,1izigl6,Afraid of being perceived as childish and immature,"Last year, I (20F) met someone online (22F) with a similar interest in a video game I really liked. I can't say we've truly hit it off since then, but throughout the year we interacted a lot and I noticed that I really like her as a person - not only as a 'fandom buddy' who I can talk to when I need to share my thoughts on the game (which I'm no longer as passionate about as before, but she still is), but as an actual human being I would love to be close to. I like the way she thinks, and I think she carries herself pretty well in the adult world, even though she probably wouldn't agree with me. She feels mature, like you can actually discuss anything with her and be understood, which honestly doesn't happen much with other people my age. Hell, we've even met in real life and even though we couldn't spend time together properly, us sitting down for coffee while she showed me things she bought from a festival she visited in my city (we both live in big cities four hours apart, but the commute's pretty pricy, which doesn't allow me to just visit her city without a proper reason) was more than enough to make me like her even more. I'd love to actually be friends with her, but... I don't really know if being friends with me would interest her, and that's why I'm not pushing past us being simply acquaintances.   
  
Because next to her, I honestly sometimes feel like a dumb child who wanders life blindly while everybody else's got it all figured out, and I don't think she would need that kind of person in her life. 

She's got a degree, a somewhat draining day job, a flat she either has or rents in her city (obviously, I never asked) and a cat she cares about. I'm almost on my last year of university, but I hate my major and I am in a pretty difficult position where changing it isn't really an option, and all my expenses are covered by my parents. I also have problems with my mental health caused by rough upbringing, and even though she probably wouldn't mind, I feel like all of this combined makes me feel really immature. I also probably have ADHD (sadly, I'm unable to get properly diagnosed because my country still doesn't think ADHD in adults is a real thing) which doesn't help at all. I have hobbies, but none of them are at a level where I would be considered extremely good, so, uh, I'm pretty unremarkable all things considered. In conversations, I'm mostly a listener and sometimes have trouble speaking my mind. I didn't think that her being a bit older than me would be much of an issue, and most of the time when we talk about our interests it really isn't, but then I hear her talking about her job or just life in general and I think 'wow, how can she be interested in a friend who isn't as stable?'. She also knows a lot of things that I probably should've realized way earlier, like, for example, she knows how to dress, she navigates conversations better than me and she understands a lot of basic concepts way better than I do (not in a philosophical kinda way, but in a 'knows how to act in a variety of social situations' kinda way). I fear that if I pursue a friendship with her, it will one day feel like a... mentorship of sorts? I've made friends with a lot of immature people at some point in my life, and I know how tiring it is to be the so-called 'mom friend'. I know I wouldn't do that to her, but what if I make her feel like that by accident? Yeah, I can't possibly know everything, sometimes getting friendly advice is nice and all, but I don't want that to grow into a full-blown teacher-student situation.   
  
I guess what I really fear is that she's only being nice to me right now, but if I tell her I want to talk more outside of our usual topics, she'll reject me because even though I can theoretically say 'yeah, don't worry, I know what I'm going to do after uni, I'm not really looking for a babysitter/therapist', I can't really prove it. Everything about me is not a good look, from my life to my appearance. I've also had bad experiences in middle school when I could've talked to people a bit older than me about literally anything in the world and they would say they really liked talking to me, but once I've told them my actual age, it was over. I was suddenly treated as if I were an infant and I've lost a lot of possible friendships because of that. She knows my age and that didn't stop her from talking to me, and she doesn't seem like a person to care about that kind of stuff, but still. She already has close friends she talks to on a regular basis who are more like her than me, and I don't know if letting me into her friend group would be a good idea.  
  
I'm afraid of being perceived as a burden. I know that if that were the case, the right thing would be to simply end the friendship altogether, but I want to know - are there, perhaps, any ways to, uh, show a person you're responsible and composed without saying it directly? Or, better yet, to do just that and also conquer that fear? Because I feel like I'm missing out on so many opportunities to make new friends just because I believe I'm not 'mature' enough to talk to all these interesting people.

Also sorry if my English's a bit wonky, not a native speaker, but I try my hardest.","How can I show someone I'm responsible and composed without saying it directly, and overcome my fear of feeling like a burden in a friendship?","The individual is a 20-year-old female student currently in her almost final year of university. She expresses dissatisfaction with her major and feels that changing it isn't a feasible option. Her expenses are covered by her parents. She has a challenging family background, which has contributed to her mental health struggles. 

She suspects she has ADHD but is unable to obtain a proper diagnosis due to insufficient acknowledgment of adult ADHD in her country. The individual feels unremarkable in terms of her hobbies and often perceives herself as immature compared to others, particularly someone she admires who is 22 years old, has a degree, a demanding job, and lives independently with a cat. This comparison leads to feelings of inadequacy and concerns about seeming like a burden in potential friendships. 

Socially, she describes herself as more of a listener and struggles with expressing her thoughts in conversations. Previous negative experiences in middle school have also impacted her confidence in forming friendships with older individuals. She fears being perceived as immature or a burden in relation to the new acquaintance, who already has established friendships with peers she views as more similar to herself.",1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1izigl6/afraid_of_being_perceived_as_childish_and_immature/,Adulting

2025-02-27 13:23:53,1izfo7k,Anyone here who took the leap into their true passion trajectory?,"Hello everyone,

I’m in my mid-20s (23F), almost done with law school, and currently working at a legal firm. On paper, everything looks great—stable career path, decent salary prospects, clear trajectory. But the thing is, I know I can’t spend my life this way. The idea of working 10 hours a day, glued to a screen, constantly stressed, and having no time for anything outside of work feels suffocating.

I have big dreams, creative and purpose-driven, but they don’t fit into the typical mold of what’s considered “successful” or “secure.” I know leaving this path would come with a lot of uncertainty (and probably a good amount of skepticism from others), but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m meant for something else.

So I’m here looking for stories from people who have done it—who followed the “safe” path for years, only to realize it wasn’t for them, and then took the leap into something more fulfilling. How did you do it? What was the turning point? And most importantly—was it worth it?

Would love to hear any experiences, big or small.","How did you change from a stable career path to something more fulfilling, and was it worth it?","The individual is a 23-year-old female who is in her mid-20s and almost finished with law school.

2025-02-27 13:14:30,1izfh15,Struggling with HSP and adult life,"Hi,

When i was little, i was diagnosed as an HSP (Hyper Sensitive Person). During my younger years this has brought me immense benefit. I was incredibly social, made friends quickly, and i had a great intuition for how people felt. I enjoyed all the good parts of being an HSP without the bad, because being 'overstimulated' was rarely, if ever a thing back then.

I do still enjoy these qualities, but as i've gotten older (27 now), the bad parts started to creep in. My ever increasingly busy schedule takes a toll on my mental capacity at times and it leads me into this weird routine where i spiral downwards after nearly burning myself out from trying to keep up with everything, losing habits that i've built in the process. (like going to the gym, keeping up with friends, etc.) And after a while of isolating myself, i start getting my energy back and i enter an upwards spiral, only for this whole thing to repeat itself over and over.

I wonder, does anybody else struggle with this? I know that it's fairly common for people to struggle with the intricacies of adult life and the busyness that comes with it, but in my case it seems to be heavily exacerbated by the fact that i get overwhelmed more easily.

If so, i could use some tips on how to combat this, thanks in advance :)",Does anyone else struggle with the challenges of adult life and dealing with being overwhelmed as a Highly Sensitive Person? What are some tips to combat this?,"The individual is 27 years old and was diagnosed as a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) in childhood. During their younger years, they found great benefit in this sensitivity, as it allowed them to be social, make friends quickly, and have a strong intuition for the feelings of others.

They currently experience challenges related to managing a busy schedule, which affects their mental capacity and leads to cycles of burnout and isolation.

2025-02-27 13:09:23,1izfcxz,(30/F) How should I correctly navigate my Dad's ballistic/silent treatment reaction to my communication boundaries?,"I (30/F) wrote a letter stating communication boundaries to my Dad, that I will no longer be doing routine check-ins every 1-2 days when at home, and no more 10PM curfews on vacation (where he would demand/insist that I stay on the phone and walk up to my hotel room together, then making me promise not to leave after that). That instead, I will speak with them socially as adults, for a more authentic and organic connection. Said it makes me feel truly suffocated, depressed and smothered living like this. That there may be days/periods I don't answer immediately, but doesn't mean I'm always in trouble either. That I appreciate their care for my safety, that I'll get back to them when I can and do, that I hope they can trust I'll be fine, and hope they can allow me to reach out to them in my own time also.

In the letter I explained a bit (hoping for their understanding) that for years I've been feeling it draining having to maintain mental hypervigilance to not miss a text / call from them, or else they'd panic after and consider escalating to authorities. This is on top of my job that requires high mental vigilance majority of each day as well, and so I feel I really need the choice in my life when I can just switch off without a ticking time bomb in the background, and to not have to feel tethered to my phone without break for years.

*(Multiple occasions: When I felt asleep in university around 9PM without going on phone, they got a warden knocking on my door. Felt really frustrating and intrusive. They demanded daily contact as well, to ensure I wasn't kidnapped etc. Another time was when I was probably 27+ and fell asleep after work, didn't open phone, went to work next day. Once I looked at phone end of 2nd day, they were on edge of their seats panicking and considering next steps of calling authorities).*

*(For your quick context, he also does a lot of narcissistic behaviour like blowing up if you don't agree, gaslighting and invalidating your feelings, multi-hour lectures when I was a child, and when I'm 30 criticising how much toilet roll I use, instructing me not to put my backpack down on the floor while taking photos on a tour, instructing me like a teacher to eat faster / not sit back and digest while nibbling last few bites, because it seems to annoy them, to get ready faster even though they end up taking longer, etc.)*

Back to this letter - I also expressed that the lack of space builds frustration and resentment, and doesn't allow me to miss them.

I sent the letter through text and email, and my Dad came online immediately and read it. I turned off my phone as I anticipated he'd go ballistic and probably demand to talk to set me right or something immediately.

After a couple hours, he emailed a response but **I haven't opened it yet** (I was on last day of vacation and wanted to make the most of it before having this mess with my head). I just accidentally glanced and saw his response started with 'Reading', along with other words 'thought you'.

My letter ended with 'I'll leave this with you, and will be more in touch when I'm more settled back in the EU in the next weeks' (I kept it vague as I frankly don't want to endure his wrath over hours on the phone trying to strong-arm me to abandon my needs and 'see sense/be smart about this', and also hoping more time would help him digest my message. It's been about 3 full days since sending it, without interacting with him so far.

**My 2 questions:**

**1) If his only response is some sarcastic snappy mean email that demeans and invalidates my feelings, and tells me to talk to him when I see sense in him just wanting to ensure my safety and him just being a dad etc, then if he doesn't say anything else after that, how should I respond?**

I've been learning good tips here on Reddit/mental health resources on staying firm with boundaries, not JADE-ing (justify/argue/defend/explaining) etc. **However, I think I'm also getting doubtful thoughts arising sometimes - am I doing the right thing asserting these boundaries, am I being unreasonable, etc. Should I reach out after a period of silence to ensure they aren't getting an incorrect, distorted idea of me being completely selfish and abandoning them? etc. Or should I rightfully just let their resentment fester?**

I also told my Mum about this letter, and she understood where I was coming from but said she would hold her own opinion as she sees my point but also thinks I should have some 'duty' to keeping them in the loop etc. Regardless, she said she'll still accept and love me regardless what I decide. Before I sent the message, I said I hope she doesn't get too 'poisoned' from his rants/influence. **Since I sent the letter, she's now gone more rigid with minimal responses**, but still shows some care eg. wishing the best when I took a flight, etc.

**2)** When I eventually get on a call with him, and if he starts reeling off *'why I'm being so stupid with this letter, how he thought I was smarter than this', 'that they're trying to protect me and that I should comply, how will they know I'm safe? That I haven't disappeared if I haven't texted / been online in a week? I'm a part of this family, after all they've done for me, why can't I just give a bit?'*

**How should I exactly respond?** I'm aware I should hold my ground, but also try not to Justify/Argue/Defend/Explain. I've written down a few one-liners to repeat so far: 'I've shared my feelings already.' 'It's my choice when I want to text you.' 'I can't keeping managing your anxiety' (Not sure if I'll necessarily use these).

What would you exactly say/do in a phone confrontation like this? In order to try move on from this and get back onto better terms with them again if possible? **Btw if possible, please kindly don't only tell me to immediately just go No Contact because I've also had a good relationship with my parents over the years,** where they've been strong pillars of support during challenges, provided hours of moral support, advice and care. **Hence if I wanted to try keep them in my lives somewhat,** what phrases / words should I say during such heated calls to stand my ground while hoping to wrap up the ongoing conflict with them? (However, if you think otherwise, please feel free to share your thoughts as well)

Curious to hear your thoughts how I should effectively / healthily go about this using the right approaches / perspectives.

Best wishes on your journeys as well.","1) If my dad responds to my letter with a sarcastic and mean email that demeans my feelings, how should I respond?

2025-02-27 12:52:01,1izf0l5,How to deal with inferiority complex and betrayal?," Hey all, I'm 25 now and at 20, I faced a rejection from a woman who seemed just perfect. So, I took 4 years in moving on from her, and seeking help and trying to learn how to deal with this rejection. I shared all my insecurities with the people and this is what people tried to tell me :
1. Majority of the times, looks aren't the reason for your rejection
2. The dating scene is much more fair than I think
3. Personality matters a lot too
4. I am beautiful the way I am, along with all my quirks
5. Women aren't as harsh while selecting someone as I think. If anything, they are more mature
But last year, I really liked a colleague and she kept on giving me signals until a very hot, very conventionally attractive guy came into the scene, and after which she started giving him attention too. That was a rejection for me. 
And now, it's been really hard to digest how I am just an option for a woman and can be thrown away any time she wants. And now when I'm seeking help to deal with this situation, this is what I'm being taught : 
1. Majority of the times, looks primarily sway the direction of women's decision
2. The dating scene is heavily unfair, especially towards men. And it's justified
3. 'Personality matters a lot' was actually more of a marketing technique. The real, harsh truth is that the hottest guys win this race and personality is secondary. 
4. I am not enough the way I am. I need to be like the ideal guy -- super hot, super charismatic,  perfectly confident, dominant
5. Women date up and pit men into harsh competition. They'll choose the best person in this competition, superficially
My whole worldview feels that it has been shook, and now I can't let go of the interiority complex I have developed, especially when I pass by this colleague. 
It hurts to feel that I'm not good enough in her eyes and that I'm just another rat in her rat race of even hotter men out there in the wild. And this is making me crazy. 
How do I cope with this?

While I do have family property—about 20 acres of land—I desperately want to live there for my entire life. I was born and brought up in my hometown, and after experiencing cities like Delhi and Bangalore, I know I dislike the rush and chaos of big cities.

That said, I understand that humans are adaptable. If I stay in a metropolitan city, I will likely adjust over time. But my biggest fear is that if I settle in a place like Delhi, my future children will lose their roots and grow up disconnected from the life I value. I don’t want to live a life where home is just a holiday destination. Instead, I dream of leaving the corporate world to start a business—maybe a café in my town, along with a few small ventures based on my farm.

However, I don’t have the courage to make such a big decision right now. I also worry about how society perceives this lifestyle. Settling in my hometown with a non-traditional career might make it difficult to find a life partner who shares my vision.

A Possible Path Forward

The most practical solution seems to be working in the corporate sector for 5 to 10 years, saving money, and setting up a stable business before quitting and returning home. This way, I can build financial security and ensure my family’s future.

However, even with this plan, my children might still grow up disconnected from the upbringing I want for them. Additionally, switching careers could create instability, which might affect my personal life, including marriage.

Uncertainty and Fear of Regret

I don’t know if I’m overthinking or if this is just a delusion. Should I simply accept my fate, embrace corporate life, and stay away from home and loved ones permanently? Or is there a way to balance both dreams?

2025-02-27 08:39:55,1izb9x5,Nobody prepares you for how old you get so quickly,"I always get a weird feeling this type of year but particularly the winter air has stirred up some stark emotions over the last few years. Tonight is a miserable one so I'm in reflective mood but honestly nobody ever tells you how quickly you go from being and feeling young, cool and relevant to just over the hill. I'm 35 and can never imagine anyone ever finding me attractive or wanting to know me anymore. It all happened so quick, when I turned 30 I had that optimistic, life doesn't start till you're in your 30's mindset but tbh I can't say that's true. I think what happens is you become more self-accepting and maybe more realistic as you age but for me being realistic is accepting that maybe I'll always be that lonely guy. I always thought I was on a path to somewhere and I think in your 30's you sort of realise the path doesn't exist, it did until you left college and maybe found your career but then it stops and you have to build that path from scratch yourself.

BTW not being depressing, there's good aspects to being 35 or even older when we just live in the NOW but it's just weird to not be looking at your future with a sort of unknowing like might have existed when I was 25.

For the record, I might look 35(I don't think I do) but I definitely don't feel it. I feel like 24 me physically, mentally am a bit jaded but we still know we're on the clock. But we always were.",How can I cope with feelings of being lonely and unattractive as I navigate turning 35?,"The individual is 35 years old and reflects on their life experiences, particularly as they relate to aging and self-perception. They mention that their perspective shifted significantly when they turned 30, moving from an optimistic outlook about life in their 30s to a more sobering and realistic view of themselves and their future. The person expresses feelings of loneliness and a perception that they may always be isolated. 

They also highlight a sense of disillusionment regarding their career trajectory, noting that the sense of direction they may have had during college dissipated after that period, leading to an awareness that they need to construct their own path in life. Additionally, they mention that while they may look their age, they do not feel it and liken themselves to their 24-year-old self physically, despite feeling more jaded mentally.",188,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1izb9x5/nobody_prepares_you_for_how_old_you_get_so_quickly/,Adulting

2025-02-27 08:00:42,1izar62,Help,"I literally don’t know what to do. I got myself into a situation and I’m a bad person whatever decision I make. I’m a 19F and basically in December of 2024, my grandma started pushing me and my sister to get a house using a rent-to-own program. This was for a multitude of reasons but mainly my sister’s apartment complex is just a really bad place to live and she can barely afford to live there as is let alone the other stuff.

Either way, we got pretty serious and started looking at houses and just kind of ball-parked our budget, and to me, it’s a terrifyingly bad idea. I was excited to look at houses and my sister and I have been sending picks of houses to each other but I get nauseous thinking about the financials. I barely make any money with my work-study job that’s ending in a couple months because I’m graduation and moving on to another school next semester. We are talking to a lender in a couple days but I feel it will be pretty useless. School and work is stressful enough by themselves. But like, if I don’t commit my sister will go homeless or have to live with our aunt and that’s a whole problem on its own but if I commit and try to buy and finance a house, there’s no guarantee I’ll be able to pay anything back with no job and trying to find anything right now is difficult. Let alone paying for tuition. Plus I am still living with my mom for free and just saving whatever money I can for future tuitions.

2025-02-27 07:52:45,1izanij,i always feel empty and lonely,"im a 19 year old guy.  i have a chronic feeling of emptiness.  i can’t feel genuine happiness, love, or empathy.  the only thing i care about and try to fight for everyday is to not feel alone, not feel abandoned.  i feel disconnected from everyone and I feel like people are out to get me.  my mind automatically assumes everyone thinks bad about me, even if there’s no evidence to prove it.  i always feel lonely even when im around people. way i view myself is also distorted.  I always feel insecure and I have no confidence.  some days I genuinely believe im a bad person, and then the next day i view myself as a creep

since i always feel lonely i am desperate to find a new relationship when one ends.  i come off as clingy to girls and that often creeps them out and pushes them away.  but i feel so desperate to not feel alone so i keep having the urge to do it.  that’s basically the story of my life.  i want people to care about me because i feel like nobody cares about me, but my behavior just pushes them away 

sometimes the feeling of loneliness and being abandoned becomes too much to handle and i snap and self harm.  i will zone out and feel like my mind is on autopilot and sabatoge myself.  I will cut myself and then show it to people as a last ditch effort to see if anyone cares about me.

2025-02-27 06:39:37,1iz9ni0,5 brutal truths about adulting no one warns you about (but here’s how to survive),"I remember the first time I got sick as an adult. No mom bringing soup, no one checking in. Just me, in a cold apartment, realizing that if I didn’t drag myself to the store, I was gonna starve. That moment hit me hard - adulting is just you vs. the void. No roadmap, no guarantees, just vibes and bills.

And honestly? No one really tells you how weird and unpredictable life gets. You expect a neat little timeline, but instead, you get job layoffs, friendships fading for no reason, and the existential crisis of realizing you might never afford a house. So here are some hard-earned lessons I wish someone had told me earlier:

\- No one has their life together. Everyone is just pretending. Some are better at faking it than others.- Changing jobs often is the fastest way to get a raise. Loyalty won’t pay your rent.- Making friends as an adult is painfully slow. Most people will ghost you. Don’t take it personally.- The idea of “the one” is a scam. Love is about timing, effort, and choosing each other.- Your body will betray you. Take care of it now, because fixing it later is expensive.- You are 100% responsible for your money. No one is coming to save you.- Social media is fake. Everyone is struggling, they’re just using good filters.

My therapist also threw a bunch of book recs at me, and honestly, reading these changed everything:

*“****The Mountain Is You****”* – Why do we keep sabotaging our own success? Brianna Wiest, a bestselling self-improvement writer, unpacks how we subconsciously hold ourselves back and how to finally break the cycle. If you feel stuck in life, this book will help you *actually* move forward.

*“****Can’t Even: How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation****”* – Anne Helen Petersen’s viral article turned book explains why so many of us feel exhausted all the time. It breaks down how hustle culture, student debt, and unrealistic expectations have made burnout the norm. If you’ve ever thought, *why am I so tired all the time?*—this book has the answers.

“***The Courage to Be Disliked****”* – This book took Japan by storm and changed how people view happiness. Based on Adlerian psychology, it explains why approval-seeking is ruining your life and how to stop caring what others think. It will seriously rewire how you see yourself.

“***Die With Zero”*** – What if we’ve been doing money all wrong? Bill Perkins argues that saving *too much* is actually a mistake and that we should optimize life for experiences, not just retirement. This book will make you rethink how you spend your time and money.

“***How to Not Die Alone****”* – Logan Ury, a behavioral scientist at Hinge, uses actual data to explain why modern dating is so hard—and how to stop self-sabotaging. If you’re sick of situationships and want real love, this book will change how you approach dating forever.

Honestly, adulting is just one long improv performance where you figure it out as you go. Some days it’s great, some days it’s just taxes and back pain. But if you keep learning, keep growing, and keep moving forward—you’ll be okay. What’s been the hardest part of adulting for you?",What’s been the hardest part of adulting for you?,"The individual in crisis describes a background marked by a lack of familial support, particularly highlighting the moment they realized they were sick as an adult without anyone to care for them, illustrating a sense of isolation in their living situation. They live alone in a cold apartment, suggesting a limited family situation and possibly a solitary lifestyle.

Their experience reflects a challenging transition into adulthood, where they face difficult life circumstances such as job layoffs, fading friendships, and concerns about financial stability and home ownership. This leads to a sense of existential crisis, making it difficult for them to cope with the complexities of adult life.

Additionally, they reference a lack of preparedness for adulthood, facing the unpredictable nature of life without a clear roadmap. They reveal insights gained from personal struggles, suggesting an ongoing journey toward understanding self-improvement, financial responsibility, and the intricacies of relationships in adulthood. The mention of therapy and book recommendations indicates a proactive approach to managing their mental health and personal growth amidst these challenges.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1iz9ni0/5_brutal_truths_about_adulting_no_one_warns_you/,Adulting

The reason I was out of work is due to being heavily involved in my daughter’s life (I was also applying for jobs and for the life of me could never get one. So a year passes and I ask a friend of mines for a job, and he literally hired me the next day. I’ve been happy and grateful for the job and actually enjoy the work. The biggest “issue” I have is spending time with my daughter. 

I told the company upfront that I would need some weekends off due to my daughter been 3 hours away and I am her only family where I stay. They assured me it wouldn’t be an issue as long as I told them in advance. I’m a person that plans ahead (6 years of military service has me like that) so I always tell them. Fast forward I’ve taken one weekend off already due to my daughter’s recital (which ended up being canceled and moved to this Friday). I’m not gonna even take off this Friday because it’s back to back and it’s my 2nd week of work. However I’ll have to take the next 2 weeks off one because it’s my week to keep my daughter and the week after that is my daughter’s birthday.

It seems like my friend who got me the job is annoyed with me taking the days off and so is most of the managers. These guys wanna work 60 hours every week and that’s fine, but my daughter comes first. 

Lastly, I put time with my daughter over work or money. I have more than one stream of income but more money is always better I keep hearing about “making sacrifices” and I find it funny coming from guys who haven’t deployed to war zones and missed YEARS of their kids lives.

2025-02-27 02:29:24,1iz5adi,"Still virgin at 33(F), after long relationship","M
Hi everyone and I sorry for my English, I ll try to explain the best I can. So I met my boyfriend at 21, we were young and same age. I was a virgin.. we ve been together for 12 years… I know 12 years together and still virgin it’s a bit strange but that’s my story.. every time we tried , it hurt for me and he was afraid to cause me pain so he stopped etc so we only had oral sex and he said that oral sex was enough for him.. and for example he never help me to have sex by buying lubricants or smth that could help me, it was always me that I had to tell him , we should do it , I suffer from being still virgin etc. Anyways 2 years ago, my depression + ocd started, like I wanted to do nothing, had no work , was afraid to go outside alone, couldn’t take the metro , bus etc.. I know it was difficult for him to see me like this.. anyways now he broke up with me.. he said he can’t bear seeing me suffer etc.. he didn’t help me to find a job he didn’t help me to loose my virginity, he met my mother 3 years ago talking about engagement etc and now that he has bough his appartement/ flat, has a beautiful car he can’t bear my problem???? I was always standing by his side, listening to him etc. When he bought his flat he told me even if he bought it alone ( I had no work no money) he didn’t wait to buy something together( which was painful because It was my dream that we buy smth together), he said that it’s my home even he is the only owner but when I move in 2 years ago , when we had arguments etc he said if u r not happy u can leave , it’s not ur home etc.. and then after would apologize saying it’s ur home I didn’t mean what I was saying… another example because of my depression I told him that I needed him on the weekend and I was fed up with with going out to his friend flat until 5 am.. I told him like just 1month stop going out… because during the week, we had no quality time to reconnect together, so I wanted quality time on The Weeknd I know it could sound selfish, but he has always going out since we met, I never took his freedom, he has seen his boyfriends on The Weeknd. I know that depression Is difficult for him and even my ocd.. but every Friday he left me alone and came home at 5 am..but I think always waiting him made me sick, being still virgin made me sick… and maybe because all of that , I became crazy like I have no life and didn’t grow… and now he Left me like that without anything. I have nowhere to go.. I have no job I want to die.. and I told him how he could left me still virgin after all these years together, he told me we can try it once before the end. So now that’s over he want to have sex to try to loose my virginity.. it doesn’t make any sense .. don’t want nothin anymore I feel like he took my youth, my beauty.. and now I m ugly depressed looked like nothing.. he was always with his friends, I was always alone..  the suffer is unbearable ",How can I cope with the feelings of abandonment and despair after my breakup and my struggles with depression and OCD?,"The individual in crisis has been in a long-term relationship with their boyfriend for 12 years since they were both 21 years old. They started the relationship as a virgin. Over the years, they experienced difficulties with intimacy; attempts at sexual intercourse were painful, leading to a reliance on oral sex instead. The boyfriend did not seem to support efforts to address these issues, such as buying lubricants or facilitating the transition to penetrative sex, and the individual felt they had to advocate for their needs.

Two years prior to the breakup, the individual began to struggle with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which significantly impacted their ability to work, go outside alone, or use public transportation. This decline in mental health seemed to create strain in the relationship, and they felt their boyfriend was frustrated by their struggles. Despite their challenges, the boyfriend had plans for engagement, meeting the individual's mother three years ago and later purchasing an apartment and a car.

Throughout their relationship, the individual felt increasingly isolated, as their boyfriend continued to prioritize outings with friends over spending quality time together on weekends, contributing to feelings of loneliness and resentment. The individual expressed a desire to reconnect but felt that their mental health issues and virginity were contributing factors to their deteriorating situation. Following their breakup, the individual feels lost, without a job or support, expressing feelings of worthlessness and despair.",2,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1iz5adi/still_virgin_at_33f_after_long_relationship/,Adulting

I did not that I had homework keeping me from doing stuff and getting fixated in grades but says that BS that I was sitting around watching TV or on the computer. Now I question myself if what I said was true or even a good reason.

It gave me the implications that I didn't do enough to defend myself because I was scared of being wrong. This kept going until after I finished college. But I don't know why I didn't bother socializing even though I had an anxiety disorder. I am busy now with my volunteer work at church and searching for a first time job 

I just feel that my excuses for not going out and not fighting back were unexcusable. I was just afraid of hurting others and elmom encourages me to get mad and get into trouble when it was just not implemented in me.

Plus I felt that if I joined some curricular activity growing up it would interfere with my grade which mom says it's BS since I had constant distractions everywhere with TV or laptop.

I feel ashamed of who I became and trying to put myself out there more but there are times where I zone out and that what I am doing is not enough.

2025-02-27 00:01:09,1iz29wt,A is for Accountability P-1," I hadn’t noticed the comforting blanket effect of having someone else help keep you accountable until it became absent from my day-day, practically absent from my life. The type of accountability that is consistent, reliable, & stable. Especially when it was coming from someone whose perception of me was also driving me to be better, because I wanted to be the best for not only myself but him as well. I wanted his interpretations of me to be transparent, pure and honest, even if just a friendship I was sick of people shrouding their raw honesty with fake lack luster lies basically about their day to day. I’m not saying I chose impending doom lore to talk about all day, I’m just saying we were beyond transparent with everything we could have been when necessary.  This is someone (well call him Sam*) who I considered the possibility of us coming together for something long term (in the distant future) and I didn’t want to start out not being Real.
  After meeting Sam* and becoming good friends over the phone especially I slowly realized I had found the perfect guy for the job on my journey to become the best most accountable version of myself. He was someone I had briefly met in person, he was familiar, he knew how to handle my attitude, behavior and personality with such finesse and gentle sexiness I don’t think i’ll ever recover. We both expressed the emphasis on “just friends” as I was still engaged to someone and he was casually seeing people as well.  
Our unison devotion to being politically correct and fair to our partners was beyond obvious. So much so cut to me leaving the abusive person I was currently with and deciding to not only be “single but not going to mingle.” I took a year to myself, not dating or sleeping with anyone, etc. ",How can I find accountability and support when I'm trying to become the best version of myself after leaving an abusive relationship?,"The individual sharing their experience has undergone significant relationship changes and personal growth. They were previously engaged to someone they describe as abusive, which suggests a challenging family or relationship situation. After leaving this relationship, they took a deliberate year for self-reflection and personal development, during which they chose not to date or engage in romantic activities. 

The main point of concern in their current situation revolves around accountability and support from friends. They found a supportive friend (referred to as Sam), who enhanced their journey toward being a better version of themselves. Their connection with Sam began as a friendship over the phone, and they both maintained a commitment to being transparent and honest in their interactions, reflecting a desire for authenticity in relationships. This suggests the individual values deep and meaningful connections and is seeking stability and reliability in interpersonal relationships.

Overall, the person's background includes a history of an abusive relationship, a conscious decision to focus on personal growth, and an emphasis on honesty and accountability in friendships.",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1iz29wt/a_is_for_accountability_p1/,Adulting

2025-02-08 03:26:14,1ikduv0,Late night rant - post graduation loneliness,"Late night rant - post graduation loneliness

Hi guys just seeking some guidance/want to rant a little bit to anyone who listens.

I’m a 23 M that graduated from my masters back in august. It feels like a lifetime ago but I can remember it like it was yesterday.

I was at university for 5 years, yea FIVE years. So essentially my entire adult life all I have ever known was my own independence, living in my university city which I love, hanging out with friends and going to classes etc.

I moved back home last august and for first few months it was ok because I was seeing lots of friends from uni and it was the summer so lots of plans. But now that I have a full time job that I hate I feel like I have become a shell of my former self. I have never felt so lonely in my entire life.

I was never social in high school and in my home town mainly due to distance and where I lived but I felt on top on the world when I was at uni. I was incredibly sociable I was always known to be the person to be up to do literally anything. I would plan things, ask people to do things spontaneously. I was on the committee for a few university societies and would host socials. I was decently well known around campus. I LOVED living with other people and the community/family aspect of it whilst also having my independence.

I loved the fact i lived in a large student city where I could step outside and do whatever I wanted. If I wanted to canoe there’s a club for that. Sing? There’s a club for that. Just go partying? There’s 10 places within 5 minutes of my house and all my friends are down to go in the next 10 minutes.

Now that I live at home in small town where the average age is like 60, I feel so lost. All my hometown friends live a minimum of 30 mins away and I have no car. My friends from university live in cities that are hours away or are travelling across the world. I have looked on insta and google and there are no social hobby  clubs near me at all especially not for any with people in my age group. The closest city to me is still 30/40 mins on a train away from me. My new job that I have is almost entirely remote and is terrible 0 work culture, no one talks to each other unless I start the conversation. 

I have started dance classes in hopes to ignite my social spark again but I’m really really struggling. These classes is 2 cities away from me so about 1hour on a train away. I find that I’m a very spontaneous guy, so if I want to do something it must be done in the next 1 hour. I’m not the best planner which is why I think I’m struggling so much as I can’t just ask my friends that I would have lived with if they wanted to do something. Now people have jobs and commitments and we have to plan everything in advanced.

Even the small things,for example in the summer at university I loved having a bbq in the park when it was hot. I could ask my friends to come and we would all be there within 5 minutes surrounded by other students and people like me too. Now if I wanted to do that I would have check when my 3 friends that live near me are available. How we would get there, who’s paying what, what time we are going home. 

IDK anymore I’m truly truly struggling, living at home is draining all the energy out of my body and I am slowly losing motivation to go out and do things.

*sorry for the shitty grammar and spelling, the Reddit app is terrible and I can’t scroll up to edit things lol.

I’m a high school senior, and I’ve never really taken school seriously until now. I know it’s not fair that I suddenly want to turn things around, but here I am. I’ve been making up my credits, and I only have 10 left to graduate. A couple of years ago, college was the last thing on my mind, but now it seems like a real option. That said, I have no clue how any of this works. I also have a few Ds on my transcript, so I don’t know how much that will affect my chances.

The thing is, I don’t even know what I really want to major in or what career I’d want in the future. I don’t know if this is just a motivational surge, but being a lawyer seems cool. I’ve also been interested in psychology and philosophy for a while, but I have no idea what careers come from that. At the same time, I know I don’t have to do college—I’ve been open to trade school for a while. That was actually my original plan before I started thinking about college, but growing up around people who did hard labor, I’ve always heard how exhausting it is. Still, becoming an electrician is really appealing to me, and I don’t think anyone in my family has done it yet.

On top of that, I’m also considering the military, mainly the Marines, since I know they can help with college.

I guess my main questions are:
	•	With my current situation, how do I even start looking into colleges?
	•	Will my Ds and past mistakes completely ruin my chances?
	•	What careers actually come from psychology or philosophy?
	•	How does the military help with college, and would it be a good route?
	•	Would trade school be a better move for someone like me?
	•	Any advice on staying disciplined now that I actually care about my future?

I know I should’ve been thinking about this earlier, but I really want to make the best decision for myself moving forward.

Since graduating, struggling to achieve same level of happiness as I had. Life is good, but good will never beat perfect. How to move on, try to achieve happier years?



Graduated University in June of 2024 and still struggling to live up to the happiness that I once had. I've heard so many people say ""college will be the best years of your life"" and I truly hope that it's not true, but more and more I've been scared that they will be.

In the 5 years I was in school, I lived with my best friends, and a 10 minute walk away from the rest of my best friends. I was physically active multiple times a week, going to the gym, playing intramural sports, etc. I went to a campus everyday that was walkable, had great food, constant social events, and every amenity I could ever need within a 10 minute walk. I was hanging out with my friends and girlfriend every single day. I enjoyed learning new things, putting new skills to use, and having structure and purpose in my life. All in all, it was literally the perfect life for me. I was really really happy during those years.

Since graduating, I've moved back into my parents' house. Some friends live nearby that I see maybe once or twice a week. I see my girlfriend most weekends as she's still in school. I know that what I miss most about uni life is spending time with my friends, so I've been making a big effort to see them. Trying to plan big get togethers once a month, etc. But going from seeing friends every day to once/twice a week has still been a difficult change.

Objectively, my life is great right now. I have a cool job involving travel lined up for this summer, I'm in a happy relationship, I've picked up some hobbies that I dropped due to school being too busy, I'm seeing friends atleast once a week. Nevertheless, I'm still struggling with comparing my life to how it used to be. Life right now is good, but it's hard to beat how it was when it was literally perfect. I'm grateful that I had such an amazing time in school, but now that shift is making me really miss how life used to be.

2025-01-27 05:13:38,1ib0kyf,How did you deal with moving back to your (isolated) home town after university only to be completely alone?,"Last year I finished my undergrad in biology and social science. It was truly the best years of my life, and I believe my social identity was closely tied to that experience.   
  
After a pretty serious break-up and having drained my savings due to the cost of living while studying, I've moved back in with my family in the countryside. It's near-rural and 5 hours away from the closest city. The population isn't terribly small but it's demographic is retirees or families. The only work here is in aged care, health and youth education. Once you turn 18, you basically pack up and leave. Even the local McDonalds is run by people in their 60s.   
  
I was fortunate enough to finally find a casual job at a bank after two months of job searching. Even the local supermarket wouldn't hire me. The job is low hours but living rent-free with your grandparents means I can save every penny. To fill in the extra time, I've enrolled in a teaching support course at the local community education centre.   
  
My plan is to buy a car and save through 2025 so I can cover the insane cost of finding and securing accomodation in the city. There, I will hopefully find work in high schools and then pursue a masters in teaching which, alongside my undergrad, will qualify me to teach in upper high school levels. After a decade of that, I would like to try my hand at education roles in universities since I love everything about universities - the phsyical space, community, impressive people etc.   
  
My only problem right now is dealing with post-grad depression, getting over my ex, and insane lonliness. I'm not lying when I say there is no one remotely close to my age over 18 in this town, except for the occasional tradesman who'd rather talk about beer and sport than science and art. I've lost contact with the majority of my friends due to moving away, the break-up and physical distance (Australia is massive, especially without cheap transport and free time). I still have friends I can talk to online, but nothing compares to in-person friendships. 

Any advice for how I survive this year?","How can I survive this year while dealing with post-grad depression, loneliness, and getting over my ex?","The individual recently completed an undergraduate degree in biology and social science. They experienced a significant break-up and have drained their savings while living in an area with a high cost of living during their studies. Subsequently, they moved back in with their family in a near-rural location that is 5 hours away from the nearest city, which has a demographic primarily of retirees or families. The local job market offers limited opportunities, with jobs mainly in aged care, health, and youth education, and few positions available for younger individuals. 

After two months of job searching, they managed to secure a casual job at a bank, but the hours are low. Living rent-free with their grandparents allows them to save money. To occupy their time, they have enrolled in a teaching support course at a local community education center. 

Their future plans include saving to buy a car and preparing for a move to the city by 2025, where they aim to find work in high schools and pursue a master's degree in teaching to qualify for upper high school levels. Ultimately, they aspire to transition to university teaching roles, as they have a strong appreciation for the university environment and community. 

Currently, they are struggling with post-graduate depression, coping with the break-up, and feelings of extreme loneliness, compounded by the lack of peers their age in their small town. They have lost touch with most of their friends due to the break-up and the distance created by their relocation.

I'm studying accounting with a minor in business analytics in the middle east. I'm a canadian citizen so I plan on going back to Canada to get my CPA and masters and was just wondering if anyone can give me advice on a few things. For further context I would ideally like to work in Ontario or Alberta but if you think there are better places to work as a new grad please let me know.
1. Which city is the best with regards to opportunities and salary for new grads
2. Does GPA really matter for accounting new grads
3. Public vs private accounting firms which do I have a better chance of getting hired
4. Should I get a car? Do you feel like it's necessary? Or should I wait to be earning a certain amount before I get one
5. Is it realistic for me to expect to be living without a roommate? Because in all honesty the main reason I'm rushing to leave my house is because I would really like to live alone and not deal with anyone or their problems because having to deal with my family has taken a huge toll on me. I feel like even if I'm struggling in other regards, knowing I'm coming home to an empty house is worth every bit of it.
6. Should I be saving money in my early career? Like is it realistic for me to expect to be able to put money into my savings?
7. Since quite a few companies cover the cost of getting your CPA, should I find a job first before registering or I should begin the registration process now? If I start it now will I be reimbursed if I find a job later?
I know this is a lot, but I'm feeling so anxious about the future because I realized I have nooo cluuee on what I'm supposed to be doing or how to really function completely on my own.

2025-01-15 03:01:11,1i1nzb0,Dealing with post grad depression,"Hello, I F 23 recently graduated in May and have been in the one of my worst periods of depression I’ve had since being in highschool. College was never really that great for me, I struggle with general anxiety and social anxiety and to be frank the first 3 years of undergrad sucked. I could say I’m fairly smart in that I never struggled academically. I was a mathematics major and while yes I had hard classes I never really had to study and my concern was never not passing but wheather I’d get an A or an AB in the class. I didn’t have many friends I was too afraid to do anything alone including eating.

Just to give an idea of how bad my anxiety is, I started seeing a therapist my first semester of freshman year to help with my anxiety but mostly in a desperate state of need because I lost nearly 20 lbs in my first semester simply because I had too much anxiety to go get food, even off campus, and lived off of a case of coke and the few frozen meals my dad bought for me when I came home on the weekends. 

This therapist wasn’t my first one I ever saw but she’s been the best and I still see her till this day. After 3 years she finally convinced me to try anxiety meds going into my senior year(I was very against it because my parents forced me to be on them when I was in middle/highschool for obvious reasons). Anyways I got prescribed Cymbalta and it was the greatest thing that happened to me. My energy was through the roof, I wasn’t sad any more, I was working out and starting out my senior year of college I even made (somewhat they were my roomates friends) 4 friends. This made my senior year an absolute blast. I was going out Thursday-Saturday the weekdays were filled with hangouts late night study sessions I even met a guy and was going on all sorts of dates. All things that my anxiety filled self could never have dreamed about when she spent the first 3 years crying herself to sleep. 

However second semester came and while things were still great 1 friend dropped out, another (my roommate) started a fight with my boyfriend over me and stopped talking to me altogether(a story for another time), and the other was in a hell of a semester in nursing school. While I still had my 1 friend and my boyfriend I was having to practically beg for my friend to do anything bc she was so busy studying and my and my boyfriend and I pretty much agreed that it was a fwb situation because we couldn’t commit to the long distance after graduation (well he couldn’t I could). And so while my senior year was still great I started to dread the end more and more because for the first time ever I was loving life. 

Every day was still roughly a great day. Until graduation came. Due to a miscommunication I had a horrible anxiety attack on my graduation day. My makeup was ruined I was crying when I grabbed my diploma, I don’t have a single picture I liked and didn’t even post that I graduated anywhere. I hate this day so much, what I spent 4 years working for ruined by my stupid anxiety. My 1 friend moved back home and a few weeks later my boyfriend ended things.

I applied for jobs hoping to do something related to math, and I got a job within two weeks of graduating as a software engineer and I was ecstatic they told me my job would involve math . I’m making more money than I ever dreamed I’d start out at as a new grad. Except I’ve spent every day since graduating in tears. I thought I was hiding it well but one of my coworkers pulled me aside and told me he was there for me to talk to if I ever thought about doing something stupid to myself. And my dad who would never ever let me quit a job without another lined up told me to quit because the stress was going to kill me. But I’ve been stick it out for the pay, bullheaded like my dad. Everyday I leave work exhausted mentally drained that this is my new reality. It’s not that my job is hard per se but just draining. I stare at a computer for 9 hours and have maybe 20 minutes of social conversation a day. There’s not even a full 9 hours of work so 6-7 of these hours are with NOTHING to do. And the other 2-3 hours is being asked to do stuff that I don’t know how to do that isn’t related to math that I struggle to figure out. The social isolation and lack of work is not great for someone with the level of anxiety that I do. 

I’ve tried a handful of new meds but nothings helped and I’m back to what I was on before when I was happy. I’m back in my hometown with no friends. My mom always tells me to reach out to people from highschool or go on a dating app, but I was bullied all throughout highschool and I’m still not over my ex enough to start dating again. When I can I go back up to college to see my one friend who’s taking a fifth year, but I always end up an emotional mess reminiscing on what I once had. 

I get so angry at myself and the world that my first three years of college were spent alone in my dorm. And that when I had finally made friends and had better control of my anxiety I had less that a year to enjoy it. I mean hell even my ex who was 31 has friends from highschool he hangout with weekly. It’s been 7 months since graduating and I’m still sad. 

I truly do have a passion for studying mathematics and have long considered pursuing a PhD in mathematics. Although I was discouraged by my advisor to apply as she said our school isn’t good enough for me to get into a grad program let alone any of the schools I wanted to apply to. This was despite me having a 3.9 gpa and spending 2 years working as a math instructor in undergrad. I talked with my therapist and I figured I’d take a gap year save money and reapply. I was dead set on it too, wrote my personal statement got the information in order except I never got my letters of recommendation to send everything in. Because I realized that I couldn’t live off the stipend a PhD program provides and wouldn’t be able to have a well enough job to afford living. So for now my gap year has turned into a two year gap. 

I spend all my free time stuck in near debilitating and existential dread of where I belong and what I should be using my life for. I’ve been trying to chase the high that was my last year of college and nothing compares. I’m left with just memories as a painful reminder of what was and what will never again be. 

I’ve been really trying to push myself to do self care, I’ve bought some books some math some non fiction and have been reading a little each week. I try and do skincare and makeup to make me feel better about myself. Perhaps spending a little too much here and there in hopes that the material items will help me feel something. But it’s not enough to pull me out of my depression.

I guess I’m looking for advice of how to deal with the post grad blues? I thought things would get easier as time moved on but it’s just gotten worse.

2025-01-08 21:42:44,1hwvtfc,"Adjusting to life after high school, as a college commuter living at home (who didn't want to commute)","Sorry I know this is really long but it's hard to explain everything in a short way. 😭

**tldr: I'm disappointed because my college experience isn’t what I wanted. forced to commute tough, haven’t moved on from high school. feel too undeveloped for a college freshman**

I'm not sure if this is the right community to post because I'm still in school, however I feel like my problems fit the most in this group

I recently graduated high school last spring and started my freshman year of college during the fall. My college experience is not going the way I wanted it to. I commute to a school thats 25 minutes away from where I live. I only have my permit so I get dropped off by my parents. It makes me feel miserable.

*Throughout high school (and even before then) I would over-romanticize college. Don't get me wrong I was nervous to grow up, i've always been, but at the same time I was so excited for a new start. For freedom, for a new environment, for a life thats mine and not anyone elses anymore. I remember when my sister first started college when I was a preteen, I saw her life change and how much she grew.*

*In high school, I had similar feelings. I used to look up colleges during class and look at everything that colleges had to offer. I would tour colleges and have the feeling of excitement. Whenever I would have a mental breakdown in high school or feel disappointment, I immediately thought of college and the new start I would have. It was scary, but exciting.*

But at the same time, I grew so much in high school. The pandemic hit when I was in 8th grade and my entire freshman year of hs was online, so when I went inperson sophomore year I felt like I was in a whole new world despite being in the same district. I became friends with people I never was friends with before, I went through moments I never went through as a kid, I found interests and connections I never had. High School was not perfect, I had a lot of lows and moments that I'm glad are over, but at the same time I had a lot of good and transformative moments that made me grow a lot as a person.

Why am I not feeling so much the same about college? Months ago when college decision due dates were coming up, I still didn't know where to go. I wanted to go on college tours but my parents were like ""No, I'm busy"" or ""Why don't you settle in with this school?"" or ""No that school is too far."" I don't understand. My sister was allowed to dorm for her first year, but my parents were so against it for mine. I had to settle in commuting to the school I currently go. (me and my parents had a bunch of arguments during senior year about college, they kept stressing me about college)

*I don't hate my current school. I like the school, I like the campus, the class sizes, the friends, some memories. But I don't feel like I'm growing. I plan on transferring for sophomore and this was something I knew for a long time. I always wanted to go at least away from home, for new experiences, for new freedoms, for a new version of myself. I feel miserable, I've been seeing the counseling center and my school.*

I don't feel like I'm moving on from high school. Theres always the saying of ""peaked in high school!"" and it's making me feel worse about my problems. I feel like I can't talk about this without people saying ""you peaked in high school."" I do miss high school, and I did grow a lot and have good moments, but it wasn't perfect. I had a lot of lows and parts of my life I wanted to change (and some parts that I'm still going through now unfortunately)

*I feel like my life was better months ago when I was still in high school, which I feel sad. I always saw college as an opportunity to grow and be a better version. However being forced to commute under my parents rules and having no ""college-aged"" life is making me feel worse. I did not peak in high school, I just think I'm not living the college way I want.*

Another crisis I'm having is just growing up. I don't know how to act. As a kid I over romanticized high school and not being in it anymore feels so weird. I don't think my problems are that different from a high schoolers, I mean when I see high school media I'm like ""that was my life recently, it's not that different from now"" (i mean i'm still a teenager going through teen problems) However I'm scared that I might me immature. Am I supposed to have the same maturity as an upperclassmen?

It also really makes me upset when I see people talk about their college experiences and maturity. I hate when people expect me to fit into those boxes of maturity. ""Oh but you live alone freedom"" ""You have parental freedom"" ""You dorm"" I'm a commuter with no freedom and I hate it. 

I plan on transferring for my sophomore year, maybe then I'll get the college life and growth I always wanted.

I just needed to vent, ty","Why am I not feeling the same growth in college that I experienced in high school, and how can I handle my feelings about being a commuter?","The individual recently graduated high school and started their freshman year of college in the fall.

2025-01-07 20:14:47,1hw0s4s,How to deal with lack of social life after university?,"TLDR: I will be working from home. I am moving towns with my partner who can financially support me, but I don't feel ready to leave my social life I have here. I only just got one.

Hello! 


I graduate from college this semester. Tomorrow is my last first day of school for the rest of my life. I'm getting a Bachelor of Fine Arts with a focus in Illustration and Ceramics. 

I know I will be fine financially. My partner and I have long term plans together, and he already has a job lined up for post graduation. We will live comfortably if we budget ourselves. No plans for kids, just two cats. We have plans to get me an at home ceramics studio sorted out. 

I know I will physically and financially be fine. 

What scares me is the social aspect. We are moving to a dying town one state over. He will only be working at this plant for a year or two before the company moves him, but the town is dying with little to no art scene. 

I was in marching band my first three years of college, and a music fraternity for the last few years. I left both of those early to focus on getting my degree (getting an art degree is hard, believe it or not). In both groups, I never really felt like I belonged. They were fun and I loved them, but it was more of a family thing than a friend thing, if that makes sense. I'm on the spectrum and have always struggled a bit with making friends, and even being able to tell if someone is my friend.

 This past semester I was able to focus on making connections with my classmates for once, and now have a good friend group. We play DND, most of us are illustrators. But I only just now got the social part of college I've been waiting for, and I'll be losing it in just a few months. 

I'll have them as online friends, but I need in person interaction outside of my partner. Working most service jobs while I build up my art career is almost out of the question due to my autism (I had panic attacks and meltdowns frequently while working food jobs before). 

Have any of you guys managed a social life while working remotely? I will still be playing DND with my friends, just online via Discord, but I am afraid of becoming isolated in my home and being far away from everyone. The town we are moving to had an arts council but it recently disbanded.",How can I maintain a social life while working remotely and living in a town with limited opportunities for in-person interaction?,"The individual in the Reddit post is graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, focusing on Illustration and Ceramics.

2024-12-31 04:05:32,1hq6bot,Unsure of what to do after Master's ,"I really don't know how to start this but im hoping for some advice on what to do im at my wits end

I'm a masters grad from FIU in psychology. Psychology was something I was truly passionate in and after I graduated with a Bachelor's I went into the Masters programs, but I had no idea which one. Im an only child and the first in my family to attend college, so after speaking with a counselor and going back and forth a bit, I went into the Applied Behavior Analysis masters program, I did my research on the field, saw that it was about helping children with autism and related conditions and thought the field might be a good fit for me.

It was a *mistake*

ABA was absolutely NOT what I expected it to be: the field was super abusive to the kids (i once saw a supervisor yelling at a kid for being a little hyper), the supervisors and coworkers were massively disorganized for my practicum, they were rude and dissmissve and played favorites, and maybe i just had a bad site but I did more searching about the field and found it was INCREDIBLY sketchy and a lot of it just wasn't good.

The thing was that I couldn't back out or switch masters once practicum started in the 2nd semester because that's only when you learn the truth after the first semester, so I was pretty much stuck with this until I graduated in May, and ever since I've been job hunting with no luck. I don't want to stay with ABA even though I have the RBT certification (did the actual exam not the 40 hour site thing) because it's such a terrible field both science wise and working wise, but I don't know what to do and have been fruitlessly applying to all types of jobs I can think of

I have no idea who to ask or who to turn to since I'm sure as hell not trusting the FIU counselors again and my parents, even though they've been housing me, are somewhat boomerish and don't understand that todays job market is incredibly terrible. 

TLDR: Im a masters graduate with a MS psychology degree on its own with basically no valid credentialling for actual legitimate fields and have no idea where to go with it

After graduating, I didn't have a job lined up, so I moved states to live with my parents and save on rent. However, I really underestimated the toll it would have on my mental health. My parents still treat me like a child and my whole family is just so dysfunctional. The house is constantly filthy/messy and people are always arguing.

I really regret moving home, and now realize that some things aren't worth saving money for. I plan to move out and rent with other people, but I know my parents are against it because they want me to save money. I also know that this city is more expensive to rent than my previous one.

I just can't help but feel like I made a massive mistake moving here and hate myself for it. I wish I could go back in time and stay in my uni city - I didn't realize how good it was until I left.

2024-12-21 04:29:28,1hj26vx,Reflection on life 3 years after College.,"Hi guys,

I graduated from college with my MBA in accounting in December 2021. It’s been roughly three years since then. I thought I would give my reflections on how life has been since then.

The first two years 2022-2024 were absolutely horrible. I applied to over 1000 companies and no one wanted to hire me. I was absolutely depressed and felt worthless. I went through a terrible surgery that left me half deaf and everyone looked at me as a failure. (Or at least it felt like it.) I had no money and the aftermath of Covid left everything beyond expensive. I had to float myself using credit cards and racked up over 8k worth of debt on top of my student loans. I went through 20 interviews and couldn’t get past the third one. I tried applying for disability because but didn’t have enough work credits to qualify. I tried applying for supplemental security income but didn’t qualify because I wasn’t disabled enough. I had no friends anymore after my best friends girlfriend tried cheating on him with me and dipped. My dog passed away, uncle passed away, grandfather passed away, friends passed away. My car shit out on me (a few weeks after starting my first job.)

It was really just a terrible time altogether.

I just wanted to say that everything got better for me after I started my first finance job in 2024. The first job I got was absolutely horrible and was a 100 mile commute but I knew I needed the experience and the pay was decent. I put up with some terrible coworkers. That company is getting sued now but I job hopped to my current company and now make almost 6 figures with a 15 minute commute. (One way.) Since starting my new job I have paid off all my credit card debt, invested in physical therapy to improve my health, attended over 8 concerts, paid off my student loans, and finally broke 10k+ in savings for the first time in my life.

I still struggle. I still have not recovered from the surgery. My health is bad. My heart is still broken from losing my best friends, my family, my pet.  I am lonely and can’t believe my mid 20s have passed by so quickly. I am bitter from things that have happened in my past that I don’t think I deserved from the people who are supposed to support me most. (Family and friends.)

However I struggled so fucking much to get where I’m at and I’m so proud of myself for finally have a good year after what seemed like a perpetual black hole. It’s incredible how many of my problems came from lack of money. However, money has not solved my loneliness. It has made it easier to treat the one friend I do have left as well as my sister who is a single mother. 

Life after college has been very lonely and maybe I’m only writing this because I wish I had a friend I could share my thoughts with. But don’t give up hope because getting that first job is the hardest and life will absolutely improve once you get that.",How can I cope with feelings of loneliness and loss after experiencing significant life changes?,"The individual graduated from college with an MBA in accounting in December 2021.

Eventually, I decided to follow my passion for cooking and pursue a career as a chef. It felt like the perfect choice, even though I knew it would be a tough path.

When the time came for my internship, I was thrilled to work at one of the best restaurants. It was an incredible learning experience, and the people I worked with were fantastic. But as the months went by, the harsh reality of the profession started to sink in. I was working 12–16 hours a day, barely getting 5 hours of sleep, and living like this for months on end. The compensation for such grueling work was, frankly, disheartening—just enough to scrape by, with no room to save.  

Even when I looked ahead, the prospect of climbing the ranks didn’t seem much better. I know not every kitchen or workplace is the same, but I realized I couldn’t see myself doing this for the rest of my life.

2024-12-13 22:06:12,1hdnn7x,Is This A Bad Idea?,"My second-to-last semester of college officially wrapped up a few days ago. It's (unfortunately) time in my life to start thinking about what I want to do post-grad, and truthfully I don't know if I'm ready for a ""big-boy"" job immediately after I graduate. I have plenty of experience related to my major and a handful of connections that I could utilize in the job-hunting process, but I don't necessarily know if that's what I immediately desire.

The genius idea of a plan I have instead? Work as a server (or other high-paying temporary gig) over the summer, save up as much money as possible, and then road trip around the United States as one big adventure before I settle down and start looking for serious, full-time jobs.

Is this a terrible idea? I know objectively this is not advantageous to future career prospects, but I feel like this will legitimately be one of the only remaining times in my life where I can sort-of do whatever I want before I have more serious responsibilities.

2024-12-05 19:13:42,1h7h5eu,Graduating grad school next semester,"Hello! I am about to finish my masters in vocal performance in TN. I have a loaded teaching resume in music (summer camps/private studio 8 years/working at high schools/etc.). My performance resume stands to just school, community, an abroad pay to sing, and I made it to a national comp/won 1st in state. 
So I’m not going to get paid to sing any big roles.

What I need is a life style where I can get my voice/body where I need. School gave me the refinement and now I need to put it to work in actual life before getting my DMA/moving abroad. 

The advice I get is either, move to New York and audition, or get a DMA so I can be a 
professor. (I teach in grad school too). 
I want to move to New York, I even have a partner who is applying to grad school there and wants to move.
But like, moving to New York is hard! I’m a first gen college student, we are both the first eldest of our families,and a queer couple. 

So I guess what I’m asking for is, where are there jobs? Not necessarily in my field, I would do my singing/teaching on the side while hopefully working something that makes tips so I’m making $$$. Or nannying/home care; my mom runs a cleaning business and I could do that too. 

But how does one get an apartment with out a fancy job? I make enough doing lessons/singing/other work, always have. Any advice in an area? (outside of big cites: New York, Philly, Chicago, saint Louis)
 
My partner will have their degree in history, and going to pursue a masters in art history.  I have a cat. No idea if this is information needed but yeah! I’m also 25!

2024-12-03 21:56:03,1h5zdkl,How common is it for people to move somewhere completely new and far away right after college?,"I apologize if this might be a little naive for me to ask but I've been thinking about where I want to be after graduation and this got me thinking. Someone I know from my college who graduated at the end of last year moved far away for a job right after graduating college. This person is from the same metro area as me (in California) and went to the same university as me (also in California). However, he/she got a job in Philadelphia upon graduating and moved there.

This seemed pretty out of left field to me. I know many people who graduated last year and most of them are just sticking around in the Bay Area or LA or wherever they are from after graduation if they are not continuing on to graduate school. I know some people who live elsewhere for a job after graduation but they (1) live in or near where they went to college, (2) live somewhere else that's still somewhat close by (e.g. Sac, LA, OC, SD, Portland, Seattle), and/or (3) live in a place they have family or friends. I know one or two people who probably don't fulfill any of those criteria and moved to NYC for a job, but it's NYC and I know people from all over the place who did summer internships in NYC anyways, so I could see the appeal. This person definitely does not fulfill (1) or (2). I'm pretty sure he/she doesn't fulfill (3) either and that he/she lives alone in Philly. The company he/she works for isn't headquartered anywhere near Philly either. By the way, this person is in the architecture field. It's interesting how this person literally moved across the country all by themselves to a completely new place right out of college for their first job. I'd guess that he/she just really wanted to get out of his/her parent's house and really wanted to be in Philly or the northeast and maybe start a whole new life there. I'm not that close with him, so I'm a little uncomfortable about asking him directly. I'm curious how common it is for new college graduates to make this kind of move. Is it more common than I'm imagining?

Personally, I don't know if I would make that kind of move right outside of college. I feel like it would make me uncomfortable considering I don't know anybody outside the west coast and have very little familiarity with the northeast or east coast. I haven't done an internship outside the west coast. But it sounds like all of that is true for this person as well. I think after I graduate, I'll probably stay in my parent's house if possible, but I think other areas are still worth looking into. I think I'm pretty likely going to go to graduate school, but it won't be right away.

I'm sorry if someone knows who I'm referring to in this post. I don't have any negative intentions. All it boils down to is that I'm curious about how common it is to make the type of move that this person did right after graduation. I just want a greater perspective on what post-grad life is really like as I get closer to graduating from college.",How common is it for new college graduates to move far away for a job right after graduation?,"The individual writing the Reddit post is currently a college student in California, preparing for graduation. Their educational background includes attending a university in California, where they are presumably studying a subject related to professional fields, such as architecture, as they mention someone in that field.

* Hygiene Factors: Markers of job dissatisfaction

i’m currently a junior at university and i overall just feel like i had higher expectations for it. i’m not enjoying my time as much as i anticipated when i graduated high school. during high school, i didn’t like my time there that much either as i felt lonely and isolated sometimes, and wanted to go far away for college. i did just that but in college, i feel the same way as i did in high school. i haven’t really made any meaningful connections here. i don’t have a significant other, or a close tight knit group of friends. i have people i can hang out with and talk to and stuff but i don’t have like,,, a core friend group and all of my relationships here feel surface level. i’m such a floater friend, just like i was in high school. and also a lot of these friends have kind of done me dirty and were lowkey not good friends to me, but i can’t do anything bc i feel like they’re all i have. i feel like a loner, even tho i know i’m not lonely, but also, i don’t really see any of these bonds lasting after graduation. it just always feels like everyone else has other people, and i’m kind of an afterthought friend who people will try to make plans with once every few months. i spend 99% of my time alone, and it feels so lonely. i’ve joined clubs, tried initiating things with people in my classes, but it’s so draining and my energy is never matched so i’m kind of just counting down the days til i graduate. however, at the same time, i’m nervous that even tho i want to leave right now, i’m gonna look back at these years and miss them. (i’m a very nostalgic person). i did the same in high school- i wanted to get out so bad but now i look back and miss those years- even tho i enjoy college much better than high school. 

i feel like i just placed these expectations of me in college having an S/O and a nice tight knit group of friends in college and not having that makes me really upset. maybe at the same time, everything is just all in my head. i don’t know. i just wonder, did anyone also feel this way in college, and has post grad been better for y’all? i’m so scared my social life is gonna be even worse after college because you’re not constantly seeing people and you have to go even more out of your way to make friends and meet people. is it even possible to meet an S/O after college??? everyone says it’s so much harder. i just don’t know and i’m kind of anxious about the future. i really don’t like where i am at life right now but i feel like i’m gonna look back in a few years and miss these years, so i also want to make the most of it without my negative mindset impacting me. i really don’t know, i’d appreciate any insight. i’m really betting on post grad life being much better.

2024-11-12 06:43:47,1gperww,Does anyone else kinda miss college...?,"I recently graduated from a public university in california back in June and I oddly miss being in school. I recently moved back home in the Bay Area with my parents and absolutely dislike it. I feel pretty lonely because most of my friends are in socal while im in the Bay Area. I dont really talk to my friends from high school or a lot of them have moved out of our hometown. I'm currently working retail part time while spending my weekdays looking for a full time corporate job/interviewing.

But socially, this feels very similar to my time in community college. Very lonely, just going to work and then going home. Parents aren't much help because they still treat me like a child and they're pretty controlling/over protective (if you have asian parents iykyk). 

When I was at UCSD I felt like I had a very social structure of spending my week day going to class/studying with friends and then my Fridays + weekends going out to the club/raves or simply getting food with friends (yes I balanced going out and studying dont worry lol). I feel like alot of  the social time that I have had was stripped away from me in a way. Even though I only graduated college a few months ago, I often times look back at the pictures and memories I had on my phone.

2024-11-11 18:37:07,1gozh5o,Moving to a new city ,"I graduated school in May and started working two months ago in a city where I knew no one coming into. There is objectively nothing wrong with my life post college. I have a low stress job that pays well, my coworkers are nice. I don’t have a commute I get to walk into the office and work remote on Mondays and Fridays. I live in a beautiful one bedroom apartment. I’ve met a lot of people my age in my building who are all nice and I get along with. 

Regardless I am so sad and anxious. I miss my community at college more than anything. I went back for homecoming last week and I have been so depressed ever since. It was so unbelievably nice to see people who know me and understand me. I know that things just take time but I’m just so over meeting new people here. I just want to see people everyday who understand me. Again, I know this just takes time but it honestly just sucks and I’m sick of forcing myself to go out and meet new people it feels exhausting. 

Something else I am struggling with is living by myself. In college I lived with the same roommate for 5 years and we had the best relationship. I really miss having someone to come home and talk to that understood me and held me accountable. It was so much easier to go to the gym, do the dishes, etc. living with a friend. I am struggling so hard to do things for myself. 

All I want to do is run back to the same city I went to college in. Realistically I know this won’t help because things are just different now but it sucks. I feel guilty for being so sad because I know I have it a lot better than other people coming out of college. I feel like not enough people talk about how difficult this transition is.

2024-11-06 07:30:22,1gkt0m8,"After going through college depressed, I’m so confused/uneasy after college","I’m seeing a therapist now, but also wanted to just rant here.

I went through college quite severely depressed. I dealt with a chronic health conditions that really mentally affected me right before freshman year.

It made me unbelievably distressed, insecure, and just a shell of who I was. Secondarily, I felt bitter because I was watching everyone around me have fun and develop, whereas I was stuck in my own problems.

I was somewhat high functioning though. Fear of regret was almost solely what pushed me to do things. It was really difficult, and often joyless, but I still passed classes, went out, and dated a little bit. 

Graduated, moved to a major city, making good money. It was just like everything came crashing down. I was bottling up everything for so long just pushing myself, and I felt so depressed I didn’t even know it was possible to feel worse. My first few months in this new city, consisted of me isolating myself, neglecting my life, and just so hopeless and down that I could barely focus on the job that I had once dreamed of.

Whatever I was hanging onto in college was just gone. And I couldn’t run away from my problems forever. Yet didn’t know how to cope with them either.

Also I realized - I felt like I just don’t know who I am. In college I played the role of a confident, chill, too cool guy, and hid my depression always. But I also hated this acting game I played. 

Idk… for me college was indescribably rough and I always hoped it would miraculously get better afterward. But now I just feel like I don’t even know myself and my own life. I can act and keep acting but it’s not the life I want to live. And in reality, I’m just a severely depressed dude who can somewhat maintain the appearance of a decent life.

They went through college while experiencing severe depression and dealing with chronic health conditions that had a mental impact starting just before their freshman year. This situation led to feelings of distress, insecurity, and bitterness as they observed peers developing and enjoying their college experiences while they felt trapped by their own issues.

Despite their struggles, they demonstrated some level of high functionality, motivated by a fear of regret to engage in activities like attending classes, socializing, and dating, albeit with difficulty and a lack of joy. They graduated from college and subsequently moved to a major city, where they initially found themselves making a good income. However, this transition led to a significant downturn in their mental state, as they began to isolate themselves and neglect their life, struggling to cope with the accumulation of unaddressed problems.

The individual reflects on their time in college as especially challenging, where they felt compelled to present a façade of confidence and success while concealing their depression.

After Graduation, I decided I would go on a little trip with my friends to have some fun after college since the whole journey in college was chaotic. After I came back from this trip, I decided to take a month off to have the summer vacation that I missed since high school. It was a time for me to have some more fun with my friends back home.

Now, I have been constantly sending out job applications and looking for jobs but this whole process has been so dehumanizing for me. The constant ghosting, rejections, and getting to the last stage to be dropped. For context, I am taking this gap year to get some experience in the Legal industry in some type of way as an intern, legal assistant, or receptionist at a law firm. I am also gonna be studying for the LSAT but the whole studying that I started weeks ago has been making me a little sad. My family is constantly asking me what I am going to do and I am starting to feel the pressure from them.

I used to be able to use college as an excuse to figure out things. But now that I graduated, I feel like a failure and I hate going on Linkedin to see people post about getting new jobs and grad schools. I know I should not compare myself to others but it is honestly so hard not to. I also apply for part-time jobs at retail stores and restaurants, since I need the extra money for something in the meantime as I look for jobs in the Legal industry. However, nothing appears to be working out and I feel rather stuck and lost at home. It doesn't help that my family just thinks I am some lazy person who is not trying hard enough to find a job.

I do have somewhat of a support system. However, this whole post-grad life has made me realize how burnout I have been and this constant feeling of anxiety and stress is not helping.

I came out of graduation very self assured about my future. I didn’t exceed in college, no where near to that, but I told myself every morning ritualistically I’d get a job. And just like that I began a new chapter. 

My job is not bad by any means. It pays well, I work with friendly people, and it’s a good mix of ages. But every morning, like clockwork, I wake up with this unbearable dreadful feeling in my chest. I have this sense of longing for when life felt more real and unpredictable. 

My college experience to most would seem like a nightmare. And in some ways it was. There was a lot of isolation, loneliness, and soul crushing experiences. It was not your typical college experience, but man did I learn a lot. There was fun and wild nights. There were nights in. It was such a bizzare mix of experiences. Regardless of that, what I miss more than anything, is the freedom and energy. I cannot seem to rekindle that sense of adventure. I had such a zest for life even when I got lost down a few darkened paths. 

Something about the work week zaps me of the ability to see a vision forward. I miss the awe I had for what was next. I miss being surrounded by the chaos and passionate peers. Now I feel restricted and stuck. I know I don’t have to stay at this job forever, but eventually I need to sustain myself financially. And the only way to do that is to make money. It just feels meaningless. What is my purpose if I’m just here to make money?

I’m struggling to figure out what lights a fire in me. How do you do that? How do you even find what you like or what sparks life in you? I want to shake this feeling of longing for college when it felt easier to grab hold of that vision. What are practical ways to stop the nostalgia and look forward?

2024-10-01 02:18:21,1ftdcec,"God this is 100x worse than I thought it would be, I'm seriously struggling","To preface - I am seeing a therapist so I'm trying my best to help myself.

Where do I begin. College was difficult for me, I struggled with my mental health, times when I was deeply unhappy. I didn't have the resources/clarity to seek help. But there was also a sort of safety net, you know? It's just college, nothing seemed that serious. There were many distractions, friends, sports, activities, that kept me somewhat grounded.

After grad, I moved to a major city in the US. Full of activities, people, fun. I was excited. I didn't fear what a lot of people worry about in terms of boredom or loneliness. Well, clearly my existing mental health issues were not solved. They came back even stronger once I lost the distractions in college. Furthermore, because I was a real working ""adult"" now, I felt like that safety net of college was removed. This was my life now, less distractions, no more putting off my deepest problems saying ""oh maybe it'll fix itself"". That realization in itself made me more depressed.

On top of that, i'm dealing with a potential relationship ending. The most amazing girl I could ever ask for. The type of girl that you fall for when you first see her, and the more time you spend together, the more you realize how special she is and you feel like she is truly one of a kind. I love this girl and she loves me. But after college, she moved across the world for work, no telling when she might come back. We're deciding whether or not to continue this. All signs are pointing to ending the relationship, the distance, the fact that we're both working, the unknown of whether or not we will be physically closer - and then add on my own mental health struggles. 

But my heart is in so much pain right now - all I want is to be with her, I don't know what to think, and I feel like there is no good decision to make here. So I'm struggling like crazy. Feel incredibly depressed/anxious, trouble sleeping, brain is foggy, can't focus at work, isolating myself - the whole shebang. Never did I imagine my life would look like this after graduation, but add on all the responsibilities of being a working adult while dealing with this... I don't know. It's so incredibly tough.",How can I cope with the pain of potentially ending a long-distance relationship while also managing my mental health struggles?,"The individual faced a challenging college experience, struggling with mental health issues and a lack of resources and clarity to seek help.

I graduated in January. I am unemployed and so I am free to do anything with my time before my MA starts in October. I did not do anything during that time. I was initially planning to fix my phone ""addiction"", and subsequently replace it with books and the gym. 

But I didn't do any of that. I'm still spending 7-9 hours on my phone everyday. Obviously, I feel regret. Sometimes I will feel better about this because of advice I read online when it comes to wasting time. But the regret keeps coming back. Its a cycle.

 I think the biggest thing I regret about this is that I will probably never get 9 months of completely free time ever again. I'll do my MA and then probably get a job (if I'm able to get one lol). So this was the perfect opportunity to change my lifestyle a bit to the better. I could have done so much. I had a few reading and learning projects in mind that I wanted to do.

 Now, if I want to do those projects, I have to do them in spite of other stuff, like studying or working, not freely and with as much time as I want. I could have treated it like a job, learn for 8 hours or something. I can't imagine how different I would have become by now.
