        "title": "I'm struggling with resentment towards my girlfriend for how she hurt me when we were on a break",
        "content": "My girlfriend [F28] and I [M29] have been together in some way for about 10 months. We've been friends for the last few years, but when our previous relationships ended around the same, we hooked up an evening after a show. We had fun and kept meeting up, intending to be FWB, but it naturally became much deeper. We were really clear with how we were feeling; I was open to anything, she was still unpacking her break up. We we'ren't rushing, but we still came to love eachother a lot, and 2 months later we decided to openly commit. It was good for about 3 months, but she still needed to do some work on herself, that became evident when I approched her when I felt insecure and needing of reassurance when I noticed she hid her relationship status on FB. It wasn't the biggest deal, but it spiraled out and led to her wanting us to break up. We did, but we ended up still carrying on as of we didn't. I viewed us as inevitable, but back to being open and seeing eachother. I was still wholly committed to her either way.\n\nThis began a lot of pushing and pulling, which was present when we first started, but with less reassurance than before. It confused me and other people in our circle. She was honestly very toxic in this phase. She told me at times she didn't want us to be together because she was too damaged, but she can't stand the idea of me being with another girl. Somedays I was her boyfriend, other days I was only her best friend. It was hard at times, but we still talked and spent time together frequently. Not long after we broke she slept with a guy she met the weekend  we had a fight. I find the troubling at times still, but that was her right. She told me about it days later when we were drinking with friends, expressing her personal disappointment and said how it just made her want to be with me. We did not get back together after that discussion however. \n2 Months pass, we seem to be getting in a good groove again, my optimism is building up more than ever. This changes a night we go out to celebrate a friends birthday. We all meet up at a bar near her place. I sit next to her, we're touchy and couply as usual, and we plan to stay at her place after. The night goes on, we're having fun, I've changed places to talk to others. One of our friends I'm in a band with takes my spot next to her and they talk together and with the few at that the end of table. The thing is, I've always gotten a vibe from him that he had a crush on her. It seemed pretty often that when we all went out, he'd gravitate towards her and seem to be flirting. He seemed to be doing that again, and being a little drunk, it irked me and she noticed. I could tell it bothered her. I honestly should've just talked to her at the time, but in my state I could only stew with my feelings. I got quiet, inserted myself between them when I had the chance and it obviously annoyed her. They spoke over me between them, and it just made me more upset. I felt overlooked and unwanted. It was around midnight, others were starting to leave, so I figured we might as well go too. I said I wanted to leave, but she wanted to stay a bit longer. Confused and upset, I said okay and left.\nThe next morning, she texts me asking why I was being weird, I told her I was feeling jealous of the attention she was showing our friend (bandmate), and she scolded me for being insecure, restating that we aren't together and I have no ownership of her. I apologized and accepted what she was putting before me. We carried on as we always did.\n\nA month later, we're at that bar again, relatively the same group, but her best friend is with us too. Her best friend and I have always gotten along well, and it turns out the two of them have been really frustrated with eachother, they apparently argued in the bathroom throughout the night. Over the evening her best friend pulls me aside a few times to express her perspective on my \"ex\"girlfriend and I's relationship. Her friend really thinks we shouldn't be together, for logical reasons I've chosen to ignore. She would use me, but she was everything to me, I could forgive her for almost anything. She keeps pulling me away to talk and eventually says, \"There's something you need to know, but I can't tell you here.\" Intrigued, I tell her she needs to tell me now.\nShe reveals that my \"ex\"girlfriend and bandmate slept together the night I was feeling jealous. I'm overwhelmed with anger and clarity. I agree, I need stop seeing her. I go up to my \"ex\", my bandmate is next to her, and I say I'm ready to leave now, it's almost last call anyway. She's drunk and says she doesn't know what she wants to do. I tell her that's okay, but I'm leaving. She says she's gonna stay a bit longer. I leave. \nWhen I get home, her best friend texts me that my bandmate and her left together a halfhour later. I spent the rest of the night enraged. I cleared her drawer at my apartment, and packed all her things in a bag. Beginning the process removing her from my life. I layed in bed all night thinking of what I was going to say to her tomorrow, feeling sorry and stupid. I probably had two hours of sleep because I couldn't shake my nerves. I waited until 11:00am to text her:\n\"I'm coming in a half hour with your things from my place\"\n20 minutes pass\n\"I'll be home in 20.\nWhy are you dropping my things off?\nWe're not together so I guess that makes sense. Just weird tho. Are you mad at me?\"\n\"Yes I am. You are about to see me and we can talk\"\n\"Oh. lol can we just not do this\"\n\"Now or never, most likely. I'm not texting about it. Either way, I'm here and I can help you with your things.\"\n\"Ok\"\n\nWe sat down in her apartment and I confronted her. She admitted she slept with my bandmate a month ago, and the night before, and pleaded that we aren't together and it shouldn't matter, but I got her to understand that of course it would hurt me. I told her I was done with this and we should just be friends once things settle. She broke down, apologized, and begged me not to do this. I told her these are consequences for her actions and she needs to figure out how to earn my trust. We kissed and I told her she can contact me only in crisis. I left and went on my day. She reached out a few times, I stayed on point and asked her to respect my wish to not contact me and just think about our discussion. As I was getting ready for bed, she reached out again and said she thought about everything and really wanted to commit to our relationship again. We talked for hours, bouncing between hopeful ideals and venting how upset with her I was. By the end, she convinced me she was true and would put in the work for us.\nWe've been together since, and I feel like she is really trying this time and my trust in her has gotten stronger every day.\n\nHowever, I'm still panged with resentment towards her at times. It feels disgustingly pathetic. I hate the thought of any other having her since we came to be. The fact that it happend 3 times (I got her to admit to another time I suspected) in a months span feels so offensive. We were still seeing eachother constantly, and fairly intimate, but -we- were not having sex. She tried to soften the blow saying he could never compare to me, but it just annoys me that why didn't she desire me at the time and why did it happen so many times. It gives me a painful retroactive rejection. \n\nI'm putting this out there in hopes it will help me close these feelings and maybe get validation and other perspectives. I'm not delusional, I know she is going look awful in this recounting, but I believe she is so much more than the past few months. I've never experienced the love and understanding I hold and recieve from her. I hope to let go of these doubts.\n\nTL;DR: During a two month break, my girlfriend slept with my bandmate 3 times. I confronted her after finding out and wanted to end things fully. She didn't want to lose me, and fully committed to a relationship with me again. I still struggling with heavy resentment at times when I'm reminded of it.\n",

        "content": "So I F20 have only ever been in one serious relationship (the current relationship I'm in) and a short relationship when I was 17 so obviously not a professional at relationships and don't know if I'm being toxic. My boyfriend, M22 is totally insecure over what I wear even when I'm out with him. He hates anything that has any sort of cleavage and thinks all the shorts I wear are too short. I do not dress to seek attention I dress to feel comfortable, which he thinks if I have cleavage out or am wearing shorts that aren’t appropriate for him he thinks it’s for other guys attention.\nIt goes over 40° Celsius where I live so obviously in summer I will not be wearing t shirts and pants and want to wear tank tops and shorts. If I'm wearing shorts my boyfriend says I have to wear bike shorts underneath. I wear shorts to work and there is only one male at my job and I would never in a million years ever even flirt with him because I am loyal let alone try wear short shorts for and my boyfriend gets so angry about the shorts that I wear to work and makes me film myself and show him what I'm wearing underneath. Keep in mind these shorts I wear for work go past my finger tips because I’m not going to have my cheeks out while at my job. \nHe has caused so many fights over this and I don't know if I am in the wrong for not just giving in and buying longer shorts or if he is in the wrong for being so insecure. I obviously fight back and don't back down which doesn't help the fighting but I really don't think im doing anything wrong. I'm really at my limits for this and I don't know if I should just leave him. I love him and really don't want to but constantly having someone bug me all the time over what I wear is so draining. \n\nTL;DR my boyfriend is trying to control what I wear \n",

        "content": "\nHi everyone, basically long story short I’ve been dating this girl for about a year or so now. It started off at first where she was chasing me; I simply didn’t want a relationship. As I started to fall for her, we became sexually intimate months down the line, where she would make the move at first. We had a healthy sex life, made her finish and happy Everytime and she looks at sex more of a “to be closer to you” rather than sexual satisfaction.\n\nLately I’ve been initiating and she’s been more hesitant. We recently had sex and she started to cry afterwards (don’t know related to multiple orgasms or what) she asked if I’d still stay with her if we didn’t have sex. I was confused and asked why she’s asking this. She said she wants to make sure I like her for her and not get confused with sexual intimacy &amp; lust with love. She also said that if we want God in our relationship then this is a sin and so on. She said she feels guilty sometimes after we do it for this reason. \n\nI’m taking it personal. I have anxiety so im thinking is she cheating on me? There aren’t any signs tho. Does she not find me attractive anymore? Are there other stressors or factors in her life? It’s driving my head in circles, if I told her these she’d most likely get upset and tell me that it’s for the reasons she stated. \n\nBackground; she has had 2 sexual relationships prior to meeting me, both relationships. Last relationship was with an emotional abuser &amp; narcissist.\n\nTLDR; me and my girl of a year have been having sex, all of a sudden after last time she started crying post sex saying how she feels guilty due to religious reasons and wants to make sure I like her for her instead of getting confused with sexual intimacy &amp; lust &amp; wants to maybe stop having sex until marriage. I’m taking it personal by thinking she may be cheating, not attracted to me anymore and so on.\n\n",

        "title": "My Mom Hates My Girlfriend",
        "content": "Hello,  \nI need some advice (25 Male - Me, 27 Female - Girlfriend).\n\nThis all started when my mom met my girlfriend about eight months ago. She met her at the same time I did because I was moving into a new building. During a quick five-minute conversation, my girlfriend mentioned that her birthday was coming up. My mom said she’d make her a cake, even though they had just met, and she followed through on that promise. A few days later, she brought over a cake she made from scratch, which she spent hours on, along with other foods. My mom handed it to me, and I gave it to my girlfriend since she wasn’t around when my mom dropped it off.\n\nThe first two times they met afterward, we’d ask my mom for general relationship advice and her perspective on little things we were going through. My mom would share her experiences and opinions. My girlfriend would also mention things I do that annoy her, like leaving clothes in the washer for too long. While they weren’t exactly flattering, I believe she was trying to bond with my mom over random things she thought my mom might also notice about me but my mom took it as she is always complaining about me to other people and putting me down/making me look bad.\n\nThe third time they met, my girlfriend and I had a argument before my mom came over. My girlfriend implied I was stupid in front of my childhood friend, which made me feel really bad. No matter how I expressed that it hurt me, she wouldn’t apologize, saying she’d only apologize if she was actually sorry, regardless of how I felt. We agreed to ask my mom’s opinion since her previous advice had made sense to us.\n\nWhen my mom arrived, my girlfriend made dinner, which she prepared spicy, even though she knows I don’t handle spicy food well. I don’t believe she did it on purpose, but my mom thought she was trying to spite me after our earlier argument. After eating, we brought up the earlier conversation where my girlfriend implied I was stupid. My mom said, *\"That wasn’t a nice thing to say,\"* disagreeing with my girlfriend, who still tried to defend her words. Eventually, my girlfriend acknowledged it was wrong.\n\nAlmost immediately after, my girlfriend said to my mom that she thought she looked like one of the *\"Mexican cleaning ladies\"* in our apartment building. Even after I told her that wasn’t a nice thing to say and that she should apologize, she refused, insisting, *\"No, she understands what I meant.\"* (For context, my mom is Turkish/Persian.) She never apologized in person; instead, she had me pass along an apology much later, after I repeatedly brought up how rude her comment was.\n\nSince then, my mom hasn’t liked my girlfriend at all. She said she was kind and respectful from the start, baking her a cake, driving 40 minutes to deliver it, getting her flowers, and making lots of food, and treating with only respect and kindness while my girlfriend only complained about me and was extremely rude.\n\nFast forward: my mom started making assumptions about my girlfriend, saying things like I should watch what I say around her, that she’s rude, she needs an older man, she tries to change me, and that *\"she’s not all that.\"* She even blamed my girlfriend for me cutting off certain friends, among other rude and sometimes baseless assumptions.\n\nI would argue with my mom, defending my girlfriend because, after that last meeting, my girlfriend genuinely wanted to make amends. However, my girlfriend started insisting that there’s \"*no way\"* my mom would feel this strongly without me saying something to make her hate her more. Out of frustration, I offered to call my mom without mentioning my girlfriend was listening. My mom repeated that her opinions were based entirely on their interactions, not on anything I’d said. I defended my girlfriend even during that call.\n\nOver the following months, my mom continued to make sly remarks, which I consistently shut down. My girlfriend truly wanted to fix things, but my mom wasn’t interested. About two weeks ago, my mom and I met up, and she again accused my girlfriend of changing me, saying I wasn’t the same person I was before dating her. I defended my girlfriend, insisting my mom stop talking about her unless they met face-to-face. Things got heated, and my mom said she didn’t want a relationship with me or to see her future grandchildren if my girlfriend would be around. I asked her to leave my apartment.\n\nLater, my mom texted me, saying she’d be open to giving my girlfriend a chance, for my sake. I responded by defending my girlfriend and said my mom should also apologize for some of the things she’s said. She never replied, and that was about one to two weeks ago.\n\nI was extremely upset and called my girlfriend to vent explaining the entire story but she blamed me again, insisting there’s *\"more to the story\"* and *\"no way my mom could dislike her to this extent\"* without me hiding something. I even showed her texts proving I’ve been defending her and not saying anything bad about her, but she still doesn’t believe me.\n\nNow I feel terrible. No matter how much I defend her, she still doesn’t trust me and keeps blaming me, insisting I’m hiding things. Can anyone help me understand how to navigate this or why she always blames me?\n\n  \n**TL;DR:** My mom and girlfriend met eight months ago. My mom initially went out of her way to be kind (baking a cake, bringing gifts), but things soured after my girlfriend made rude comments (including saying my mom looked like a \"Mexican cleaning lady\") and refused to apologize at the time. My mom now dislikes my girlfriend, making negative assumptions and comments. I’ve defended my girlfriend consistently, but she thinks I’m hiding things and blames me for my mom’s feelings. Despite my efforts, my girlfriend doesn’t trust me, and my mom refuses to engage unless my girlfriend apologizes. I’m stuck in the middle and don’t know how to navigate this.",

He cheated on me within the first 5–6 months of our relationship, and I chose to stay and try to move past it due to various circumstances. It has now been a year and a half since I found out, and since then, he has been working to make up for his mistake while I have been trying to heal.\n\nFor the past few months (maybe 3–4, possibly longer), I’ve felt that the pain from his cheating—along with my existing mental health struggles—has become something he no longer wants to help me with. In the beginning, he was patient, understanding, and supportive. But now, while he still says he understands, he gets frustrated and short with me when I have a “meltdown” or struggle to cope with certain situations. His reactions hurt me a lot.\n\nGiven this context, do you think he should still be putting in effort to help me through the pain he caused? Or is he right in saying that it’s all in my head and that I need to work through it on my own?\n\nTL;DR : A 20-year-old woman has been with her 23-year-old partner for nearly two years. Early in the relationship, he cheated; she chose to stay and heal. Initially supportive, he now becomes frustrated when she struggles emotionally. She seeks advice on whether he should continue supporting her healing or if she should manage it independently, as he suggests",

        "content": "I (M 35) been working at a midsized insurance company for the past six years, handling claims and doing some sales on the side for a little extra commission. A few months ago, a new woman (F 26), who we'll call Vanessa, started in our office. She's a single mother with a six-year-old and a newborn. Admittedly, she's a bit younger than I'm usually attracted to, and the fact that she's a single mom is a lot to take in, but there's something about her maturity and life experience that I find really appealing.\n\nShe seems to flirt with me sometimes, and I've been trying to work up the courage to ask her out. It's just that I have this crippling fear of women, stemming from a childhood filled with abuse. I'm constantly drawn to women, almost desperately hoping to fill the void left by my mother, but the thought of actually getting close to someone, even just touching them, terrifies me. The irony isn't lost on me – I long for a connection but I'm scared of it at the same time.\n\nAnd there's another layer to this whole situation. I'm infertile, and I've always liked the idea of marrying into a family. So, on some level, Vanessa's situation with her kids almost seems... ideal? I know that probably sounds messed up, but it's the truth.\n\nVanessa sometimes brings her newborn to the office. It's allowed, as long as it doesn't interfere with her work, and our office thankfully provides spaces for nursing mothers or private offices to work in if the baby is being fussy. She often goes to one of these rooms to nurse, but she recently got in trouble for spending too much time in there. Our boss started to suspect she was slacking off, so now she brings milk from home and keeps it in the employee fridge.\n\nNow, I know the rules of this subreddit disallow too much detail on this next part, so I'll keep it brief. But essentially, I'm fascinated by breast milk. I think it's tied to my \"mommy issues,\" and it's something I often think about in private. So, seeing Vanessa's pumped milk in the employee fridge has definitely amplified my attraction to her.\n\nFor weeks, I've been wrestling with this. I'm wildly interested in pursuing a relationship with Vanessa, but the thought of actually asking her out fills me with dread. I keep hoping there might be a way to express my feelings, maybe even explore this fascination without having to actually confront my fear of rejection.\n\nA few weeks later, I found myself working late one night, long after everyone else had left the office. Exhaustion was creeping in, so I decided to make myself a cup of coffee. As I brewed a fresh pot and headed to the fridge for some creamer, my eyes inevitably drifted towards Vanessa's pumped milk.\n\nIn that moment, with the office empty and no one around to judge, a forbidden thought crossed my mind. I won't pretend it was my proudest moment, but curiosity and a strange sense of daring got the better of me. I grabbed the bottle and poured a splash of the milk into my coffee.\n\nThe feeling was exhilarating. I felt a surge of empowerment, a secret thrill. It was as if, in that small act of transgression, I was somehow connecting with Vanessa, experiencing a part of her world without having to face my fear of rejection.\n\nAnd the taste? It was surprisingly interesting. A little watery, with a subtle sweetness and an almost almond-like flavor.\n\nI've been doing this for 2 months now and this whole situation with Vanessa's milk has become complicated. The thrill of secretly using it in my coffee hasn't worn off, but it's mixed with guilt and confusion. Being around Vanessa is weird now. Every time I see her, I can't help but think about what I've been doing. It's like this secret is creating a barrier between us.\n\nIt's harmless and no one's getting hurt. But deep down, I know it's not that simple. This whole thing has become a substitute for a real relationship with Vanessa. It's a way for me to feel connected to her without confronting my fears.\n\nI'm at a crossroads. Should I come clean to Vanessa about what I've been doing? Or should I keep it a secret and try to move forward with a relationship? I know keeping secrets isn't healthy, but the thought of confessing fills me with shame.\n\nPlus, there's the ticking clock. Vanessa won't be breastfeeding forever. Soon, this whole bizarre chapter of my life will come to an end.\n\nI'm so confused. I'm in love with this woman, and I truly believe she could be the one to help me heal from my past. But I'm terrified of ruining everything. What should I do?\n\n  \nTLDR: I've been drinking my coworkers breast milk in secret and I don't know how to ask her out",

        "title": "My Mom Hates My Girlfriend (M/25, F/27)",
        "content": "Hello,  \nI need some advice (25 Male - Me, 27 Female - Girlfriend).\n\nThis all started when my mom met my girlfriend about eight months ago. She met her at the same time I did because I was moving into a new building as she was the only one willing to hold the door and elevators for us while moving in. During the last moments of their meeting my mom asked her how old she was, my girlfriend mentioned that her birthday was coming up which was a week from the day and that she would be turning 27. My mom said she’d make her a cake which my gf said no to many times before accepting, even though they had just met, and she followed through on that promise. A few days later, she brought over a cake she made from scratch, which she spent hours on, along with other foods. My mom handed it to me, and I gave it to my girlfriend since she wasn’t around when my mom dropped it off.\n\nThe first two times they met afterward, we’d ask my mom for general relationship advice and her perspective on little things we were going through. My mom would share her experiences and opinions. My girlfriend would also mention things I do that annoy her, like leaving clothes in the washer for too long because they would stink. My mom agreed I did that also when I lived at home. While they weren’t exactly flattering, I believe she was trying to bond with my mom over random things she thought my mom might also notice about me but my mom took it as she is always complaining about me to other people and putting me down/making me look bad even though at that point she hadn’t mentioned this.\n\nThe third time they met, my girlfriend and I had an argument before my mom came over. My girlfriend implied I was stupid in front of my childhood friend because of my views on how immigration and food prices correlate which made me feel really bad. No matter how I expressed that it hurt me, she wouldn’t apologize, saying she’d only apologize if she was actually sorry, regardless of how I felt. We agreed to ask my mom’s opinion since her previous advice had made sense to us.\n\nWhen my mom arrived, my girlfriend made pasta and used a vodka sauce base which was store bought, she told me that she didn’t know it was going to be spicy. I don’t believe she did it on purpose, but my mom thought she was trying to spite me after our earlier argument knowing that I don’t do well with spicy foods. After eating, we brought up the earlier conversation where my girlfriend implied I was stupid. My mom said, *\"That wasn’t a nice thing to say,\"* disagreeing with my girlfriend, who still tried to defend her words disagreeing with me about immigration being a cause of food prices. Eventually, my girlfriend acknowledged it was wrong to call me stupid in-front of my friend. \n\nAlmost immediately after, my girlfriend said to my mom that she thought she looked like one of the *\"Mexican cleaning ladies\"* in our apartment building when she first met her, to which she tripled down on this. After my mom had left I told her that wasn’t a nice thing to say and that she should apologize, she refused, insisting, *\"No, she understands what I meant, I didn’t mean it that way .. etc etc.\"* and tripling down on this multiple times throughout the night. (For context, my mom is Turkish/Persian.) She never apologized in person; instead, she had me pass along an apology much later, after I repeatedly brought up how rude her comment was.\n\nSince then, my mom hasn’t liked my girlfriend at all. She said she was kind and respectful from the start, baking her a cake, driving 40 minutes to deliver it, getting her flowers (which my gf never received, because I told her it was fine and we were going out anyways), and making lots of food, and treating with only respect and kindness while my girlfriend only complained about me and was extremely rude based on her observation meeting my girlfriend.\n\nFast forward: my mom started making assumptions about my girlfriend, saying things like I should watch what I say around her, that she’s rude, she needs a 40 year old man, she tries to change me, lying about her age and that she’s actually older and that *\"she’s not all that.\"* She even blamed my girlfriend for me cutting off certain friends even though I never hung out with them much before her, among other rude and sometimes baseless assumptions.\n\nI would argue with my mom, defending my girlfriend because, after that last meeting, my girlfriend genuinely wanted to make amends. However, my girlfriend started insisting that there’s \"*no way\"* my mom would feel this strongly without me saying something to make her hate her more. Out of frustration, I offered to call my mom without mentioning my girlfriend was listening. My mom repeated that her opinions were based entirely on their interactions, not on anything I’d said. I defended my girlfriend even during that call.\n\nOver the following months, my mom continued to make sly remarks, which I consistently shut down telling her that she doesn’t know my girlfriend and to stop mentioning her unless she’s willing to meet her further and get to know her more, citing how kind of a girl she is to me, among a multitude of other things, but my mom wasn’t interested. About a week ago, my mom and I met up, and she again accused my girlfriend of changing me, saying I wasn’t the same person I was before dating her. I defended my girlfriend, insisting my mom stop talking about her unless they met face-to-face. Things got heated, and my mom said she didn’t want a relationship with me or to see her future grandchildren if my girlfriend would be around. I asked her to leave my apartment.\n\nLater, my mom texted me, saying she’d be open to giving my girlfriend a chance, for my sake. I responded by defending my girlfriend and said my mom should also apologize for some of the things she’s said. She never replied, and that was about a week ago.\n\nI was extremely upset and called my girlfriend to vent explaining the entire story but she blamed me again, insisting there’s *\"more to the story\"* and *\"no way my mom could dislike her to this extent\"* without me hiding something. I even showed her texts proving I’ve been defending her and not saying anything bad about her, but she still didn’t believe me, bringing it up to other strangers stating that even they agree with her that I’m hiding stuff and there’s no reason for her to dislike my girlfriend this much.\n\nNow I feel terrible. No matter how much I defend her, she still doesn’t trust me and keeps blaming me. Can anyone help me understand how to navigate this or why she always blames me? I want to also state that my experience with her and my moms is different hence why I don’t agree or allow my mother to keep on speaking on her especially since they had only met those few brief times and didn’t speak enough to gage each other in my opinion. My girlfriend is usually kind to me, helped me grow in multiple different ways of life, is absolutely beautiful, extremely funny, and honestly an overall sweetheart deep down. (No matter if she drives me up the wall sometimes lol)\n\n**TL;DR:** My mom and girlfriend met eight months ago. My mom initially went out of her way to be kind (baking a cake, bringing gifts), but things soured after my girlfriend made rude comments (including saying my mom looked like a \"Mexican cleaning lady\") and refused to apologize at the time. My mom now dislikes my girlfriend, making negative assumptions and comments. I’ve defended my girlfriend consistently, but she thinks I’m hiding things and blames me for my mom’s feelings. Despite my efforts, my girlfriend doesn’t trust me, and my mom refuses to engage unless my girlfriend apologizes. I’m stuck in the middle and don’t know how to navigate this.",

        "content": "\nSo this is my first ever relationship in my 20 years of life time and I am 23f and my boyfriend is 1 year older than me. What i understood is I am the problem in our relationship. We were dating for more than a year now and it started to shatter more and more. My partner is a well mannered,mature and sweet guy. He takes good care of people around him. And he has a couple of past relationships which didn't last long but he knows how to take care of the other person.\n The thing is i really don't know how to behave in a relationship, how to show love, my emotions and feelings. And whenever my partner have a hard time I seriously don't know how to give him support wheather it's emotionally or mentally. From the start i am very closed off person, don't know how to make friends or have connection with them. I sometimes even feel like I am a robot. \n\nBut after meeting my love of my life i thought of changing myself. Getting out of my shell is really hard but somehow I came out a bit but not totally. Also we have a language barrier too and sometimes we both don't know how to genuinely express ourselves (me being the most bad in it) and i being a people pleaser while trying to keep up with the people around me, I hurt my dearest person in my life neglecting in some ways. I am trying myself but somehow I am hurting him and it makes me hate myself more. After few months of getting into relationship i thought maybe I am really not that often a relationship person because I am so clueless sometimes. My partner likes to be showered with love and i am somehow unable to do it fully feels like something lacking. We had a lot of breakups in between but he was giving he chances that I may change. Now the situation is almost like he is fed up of everything and wants to leave me. I too feel like it's better for him to do it. And both love eachother so much that we are unable to do it. But he is done now I can see that. I really want to be a better person for him. But I also think he needs peace and its best for him to leave me, still I can't live without him. What do I do...\n\n**TLDR** My boyfriend gonna leave to his hometown in few days and he says he is not gonna comeback anymore..",

        "content": "I don't know how I'm going to fix this, I've messed up bad. I figured maybe I could find some advice here. My bf, I'm just going to refer to as J from now on, is such a cool and interesting person. I love him so so much, we've been good friends for the last 4 years and have dated on and off since we've met. We met in middle school and, to be completely honest, he's my first boyfriend. I have always had trouble connecting with others, but J has always been there. We were dating in-person for the first few months of our relationship, but for reasons I won't bother typing up, we both ended up moving away to different parts of the country. Even though we were far away, we've always kept in touch, Sending memes and joking around with eachother like always. Eventually, we ended up long distant dating again and have been going steady for the last 3 months. \n\nI'll be honest, I'm a quiet person, or that's what people say that I'm like. I have a hard time connecting with others. I enjoy listening to other people talk about themselves, and J is a very talkative and social person, the complete opposite of me.\nRecently, he's been saying that I've been distant, and that he doesn't know me at all, he had called me last night asking if anything was going on, which nothing has. \nI've always been depressed and suffered with anxiety and fatigue, wich really effects how i intract with people, and ive realized i can be very avoidative and people pleaseing at times without even realizing. He texts me all the time and if I don't reply right away he starts lovebombng me and asking if he's ever good enough. I feel so guilty because it's hard for me to resupricate the same energy. \nAfter yeasterday, I told him I needed a break and wanted to talk later. To be clear for the last few days, I've been sick with pneumonia so I hadn't texted him as much recently, but now i think i should have been more clear that this was the case. Yes he says he knows I was sick yes wanted to know if anything was wrong with me anyway. \nThis afternoon, he called me saying we had to talk. I reluctantly picked up his call because he seemed very distraught, and when I did he was crying. So while we weren't talking (this had been only a day) he went through my message history on numerous discord servers that I was in. He found a screenshot that I had shared about 5 months ago, one of him bombarding me with a wall of about 20 texts asking why I wasn't replying to his messages, at that time I hadent had my phone so I found it quite uncomfortable on my part. I had uploaded it to the server asking what others thought and they reciprocate committing that it was odd behavior.\nJ was sobbing while calling me saying that I had betrayed him by sharing screen shots of our conversation to people he didn't know, and that in a million years he never thought I would hurt him in such a way. I had only talked about him twice with others, j was very offended that I referred to him as a 'friend' and that he feels sick and that he feels I had made fun of him behind his back. \nI just want to note that the messages in question had no personal information about him or me, and was him questioning me over and over about my whereabouts. J mentioned how he felt like he doesn't even know me anymore as 'every conversation we had' I had also had in that server, as in memes and art that I share with other people. J expresses how he doesn't want to talk to me right now and feels we can't even be friends anymore, and that he's sacrificed so much to talk to me evey day.\nI just feel torn up and don't know what to do.\n\nNow looking back it was a very stupid of me to vent into a public server about my relationship. Omg I've hurt him so bad I don't even know what to do. I just want to go back to how things were before, yet I know I'm just a terrible person who can never keep any relationship because I'm just stupid. How do I even salvage this??\n(TL;DR, my bf found my discord messages and now wants to break up) ",

        "content": "I, 27F, and my boyfriend, 38M, are having a rough patch in our relationship. It's not “rough”as in we don't get along with each other, there's not much happening the moment we hit the bed.\n\nWe go on dates, we go out with friends frequently, we chit chat every day and laugh and have fun, but there is simply put, not much sex going on. I think he is slowly being able to see the lack of sex, too, but it almost feels like im not sure what to say as I don't want to embarrass him or assert any pressures on him. He just feels like the closest friend ever, now. I know he won't make advances on me much anymore.\n\nWe met at a work event over 6 years ago (we have the same job, different companies), when we had a passionate start to \"meeting\". Then C-19 hit, and after the restrictions were lifted we continued our relationship into a full on commitment (2023). As we are in the same work field, I know how stressful it can be at work, but something hasn't been right as of the past 6 months.\nWe have only had intimacy 3 times in those 6 months. He has also been on a serious work journey said past 6 months working late as can be in the office most days.\n\nI finally muster up the courage to talk to my friends about it, and they said that this is not a good sign.\nMy friends (same age as me) all have the same age partner or older partner who are still able to be intimate, and it makes me feel as if I'm the issue, or something else with him is going on (he has been extremely stressed out with work the past four months).\nWhen we do have intimacy now it's barely long lasting and he doesn't really last much to make it worth it, and he tires so quick he doesn't have effort to please me which he has apologized for over and over again saying he is \"too old now\". I've tried comforting him with positive words or even asking him if he wants to do some sort of therapy about it, but he seems shut out like it’s a new revelation.\n\nI really try to be positive about it because I don't really expect him to immediately change out of nowhere, but l'm not too sure how to go about this politely. I do not want to be mean to him. I'm really unfamiliar with sexual issues as I've had no partners before him, and was quiet growing up, never learning about sexual relationships until I met him. I desire sex frequently and ask for him if he ever wants to participate frequently, to which he has never accepted my advances.\n\nThinking back to our past moments in our relationships, whenever we've gone on vacations, he has never participated in any sexual activity whatsoever. 3 weeks in Europe? Nothing, he can't sleep (first vacation in 2023 when we became official) Hawaii? It was too hot. Snow(can’t say the location because it’s a giveaway) Too cold. He only initiated when it’s his right time which doesn’t bother me, it’s the amount of times he tries.\n\nWe're about to go on a huge vacation around Europe and I'm expecting this to be sexless and listless.\nl'm running on fumes here. I genuinely love this guy because we have the exact same interests (huge into reading sci-if novels and and video games) which is how we got into each other to begin with. His excuse typically is that he is just too old to continue, but I don't know what to do as I am not a male, I want to know more but I have no male friends, and I keep to myself. So asking everybody here for advice because I don't know what to do or where to go.\n\nIs this age related? Is this depression inactivity? I don't know what to say, how to say it, and I really don't want to be impolite or not kind to him if he is, indeed, hurting. Is there medical therapy or guidance he needs to know what to do next? I don’t want to do too much or don’t know what to do. He keeps to his own feelings most of the time until I break down his walls.\nTo add to the fire, whenever we've been out with friends and they've made casual talk about asking about sexual activity, he lies to his friend saying that he has sex frequently with me. Genuinely it hurts my feelings because how can he lie to his friends saying that he's so active, when in reality that's farthest from the truth.\n\nAnd I'm genuinely curious here l'm trying to be as polite as I can be, I would also love to know what you all think and how I can attempt to remedy this. Is it really age? I need advice on what to do. Thank you very much, everybody.\n\nTL;DR: I 27F want to know if my relationship with my 38M boyfriend is sexless, what I can do to attempt to get him help, how to approach the topic with him on therapies, or guide him towards the right path to fixing his libido. I just miss the romance I had with my boyfriend.",

And she said \"hmm I'm not sure, we kept talking like normal and all that, then about half an hour goes be she messages me, saying she wasn't expecting me to ask that and sorry she kinda said nothing, I said it's fine I was just curious, but let's keep talking and see where it goes, and she agreed and we texted back and forth some more, and we are going to hang out in a few days for the first time. If anyone's interested what we are doing then just ask, what impression should I make ? I am interested in this girl.\n\nThanks everyone\n\nTL;DR I didn't get a straight answer out of this girl when I hinted at dating even though we have been hitting it off.",

        "content": "TLDR: partner has likely broken into my phone and transferred money out of my personal bank account and is denying it.\n\nMy partner (43M) and I (31F) have been together 7 years, lived together for 2 with his daughter from a previous marriage (aged 12).\n\nWhen we moved in I set up a joint bank account exclusively for bills, with the intention that we both would put money in at the start of each month, and maintain our own personal accounts for spending.\n\nHe has always used this account beyond its intention - for groceries, unexpected payments, etc, which I have voiced my disapproval of but let it slide as long as he put in a little extra at the start of the month. I continued to use my own personal account for groceries and anything else.\n\nHe earns approximately £15k more than me however he is always short of money at the end of the month. I understand some of this. His car payment is about £200 more than mine, plus he pays for his daughter's school related expenses (not fees, just uniform, school trips etc which her mum also helps out with) but I have previously wondered if things aren't adding up. \n\nThere has been a few occasions where he has needed money from me. I have asked him to give me a run down of his outgoings so I can get a handle on our spending, which he always says he will do but never gets round to it.\n\nLast night I was checking my personal bank account when I noticed 3 additional transfers to the joint account from my account, the last being on the Saturday just gone. I was immediately concerned as I do not remember making these payments at all. The payments add up to about £300. \n\nThe payments were all made at around 7am on Sunday mornings, which is when I would most certainly have been asleep.\n\nMy phone and account are protected by the same pin (stupid I know, obviously I have changed them now) which is his birthday, so if he didn't already know it then it would be an easy guess. He says he doesn't know the code.\n\nLooking deeper into the transactions on the joint account, the payments in were immediately preceded by payments out of the joint account to his personal account.\n\nOf course, I feel what happened here is very obvious.\n\nI can only think of two other possibilities. 1 - I have completely lost my mind and have transferred the money in and forgotten about it. 2 - someone hacked my account to transfer money... to myself? Yeah. Probably not likely.\n\nI was completely blindsided by this. By most other measures he is a great partner. I have been dealing with an awful episode of OCD and depression recently and he has been there for me through it all, doing the cooking and a lot of the cleaning. I hate to say it but I have become very dependent on him.\n\nI immediately asked him about the payments and he denied it. I asked him, gently, a couple of more times if he was being honest. He tried to insinuate that I did it and forgot but I am positive I haven't. One of them was only a couple of days ago and the payments are all made with references that I would never use like emojis. One of them was when we went out on Valentines day - it had a winky face. He offered to pay for the meal but then paid from the joint account which I thought was weird.\n\nNone of this is about the money. I don't have heaps of expendable income but if he needed money I would have given it to him. It's about that he snuck around me and broke into my phone, and then has continued to deny it and gaslit me.\n\nI really have no idea what to do. I just feel so sick and violated, and honestly wish I'd never looked. I think I should have fought harder for answers. But say I do and it ends with a break up it's going to be very disruptive for his daughter who I love very much. The house is in my name (when he moved in with me he couldn't get on the mortgage as he had only just recently moved back to the UK. We were intending to wait for the end of the fixed term in a years time and then go in together), so they would have to move out. \n\nI haven't told anyone yet. It sounds stupid but I felt like I just needed to get this all written out before I work out what to do. I'm thinking about fucking off to my mums for a couple of days just to clear my head, but I am not sure where I go from here. I'm trying to see a way through this to a place where is honest and I am able to forgive him but the longer he goes without admitting it the less likely I feel that is.\n\nAm I looking at any of this the wrong way? I'm so prone to self doubt and anxiety that sometimes my perceptions are warped. I've tried to relay it in the most unbiased way possible.",

But then Thursday they provided the ticket and Friday was the flight. I showed immediate concern because I am aware of scams and had large safety concerns.\n\nShe messaged last Sunday and its now Tuesday with no messages. She just \"liked\" a insta reel that I sent to her yesterday.\n\nThere are our last messages tho i do admit that I did sort of push to discussing what I did. My friend also said I did which I regret\n\nConvo:\nGf: Listen dw about it rn I was annoyed but I’m not now but we’ll speak later properly\nGf: Yeah I’ll send some while I’m on the boat (never sent photos)\nBF: Is that why there were less messages?\nBF: I think we should do a call on this today when you are free\nBF: A little tbh but also I was out the whole day\nGF: And so am I today\nGf: We’re going outside the itinerary with groups of people\nBf: Alright lets discuss then later today\nGF: Man we’ll talk on this after I’m back. I’m not annoyed anymore but I’ll call you to show you the place later mostly tomorrow cause that’s a more chill day for us\nBf: Alright np. Id rather resolve the conflict but anyway enjoy the rest of the day!\n\nHer flight is coming back today and I decided not to message until she does.\n\nI was thinking if by Saturday there are no messages I am going to call to get my spare keys back.\n\nJust looking for advice on this whole thing. Personally I doubt she would end it just because of this because our personal connection is very very high and this is a very tiny thing to end what could have been a wonderful future as our likings like 70% match\n\nTldr: i got concerned over what appeared to be a shady prize trip.

        "content": "So my ex girlfriend messaged me 5 years after our breakup and I dont know what to do. The breakup was tough. She was my first love. But I broke up with her. During the breakup, I regretfully told her my reason was that i didnt see a future with her and that i didnt know if i really liked girls (this was my first anything with a girl) and that I loved someone else too. \n\nAnd after more reflection over the years and what Ive never told her was: I felt staying with her would have kept me from moving forward. She had a bad home life and growing up, I did too. But the difference was my home life was finally good and hers wasn’t. I felt staying with her and being around her toxic family and everything that came with it was keeping me from breaking that cycle. I realized by staying with her, I would just perpetuate the toxic cycle that I grew up with. (I think it’s important to add she was not a toxic person herself. I have nothing but good things to say about her. She’s as good as they come).\n\nAnyway, she messaged me saying she hopes it’s not weird for her to follow me on social media and she didnt know what compelled her to message me but that she hopes im doing well.\n\nI messaged her back saying i was surprised to hear from her after all this time and I hope shes doing well.\n\nShe replied that shes doing well and moved to another state with the better part of her family.  \n\nAnd i replied with “ oh, nice” 🤦‍♀️\n\nBut what i really want to do is apologize and tell her she was never a phase and that she was my first love. And that the main reason i broke it off was because I felt like staying with her was keeping me in this cycle I tried so hard to break. That being around her shitty family was making me feel like I was a kid in my own toxic house again. But how do i say something like that without making her feel like shit. \n\nI also want to tell her that I’ve thought about her over the years, and have wanted to reach out but didnt because I noticed she was in a relationship. I guess now she isnt in a relationship anymore. Idk. She deleted her pictures of her girlfriend off her social media. But now I’m in a relationship and have been for the past year with a really amazing guy (M24) \n\nSo since im in a relationship, i’m torn about what to do or say to my ex girlfriend. I dont want to come off short and rude to her because a part of me will always care about her, but I also dont want to cross any boundaries and want to respect my boyfriend. I told him an ex messaged me but that i didnt plan on pursuing conversations with her and that I accepted the follow request and message because i wanted to know why she was reaching out after all this time. \n\nI don’t know what to do. \n\nTl;dr my ex gf texted me and there’s a lot of things that have gone unsaid on my behalf, but I dont know if i should talk to her about all the things ive wanted to say since I have a boyfriend and want to be sure to respect him and not cross any boundaries ",

She's very beautiful and honestly I do feel lucky.\n\nShe is quite socially anxious - she is generally shy and very reserved until she is comfortable. Thats started to cause a problem. She opened up as she became more comfortable in the relationship, also I communicate what I need and quite often it'll be like she needed permission to do that thing, if that makes sense?\n\nI've been feeling a bit down lately and it's because I'm worried a limit has been reached in the relationship. I love flirting over text and things like that, but I've noticed she'll usually just make weird jokes around the subject to shut it down. She'll send me sexy stuff but it's never gone anywhere, again, usually it's like she'll go for it but then it's like she puts up road blocks to end the situation. From my point of view I just can't really understand doing this with someone you really care about and Im getting worried she's just settling. It just feels more like a friends kind of relationship at time. I'm also worried because I think a relationship should make someone happy and comfortable in life, and I worry I'm just making her anxious?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend has social anxiety.

        "content": "TL;DR: I (19F) clogged the toilet at my boyfriend’s (18M) parent’s house at 2 am and faked unclogging it.\n\nI am HORRIFIED right now. I have just gotten home from spending my day at my boyfriend’s parent’s house when I felt the need to poop real bad before driving back home. Mind you, he fell asleep at this point so I went in thinking I could have peaceful poo. Well, no. I usually use a lot of toilet paper to wipe my bum, especially because I’m more used to washing my butt with water but it’s the States and people use toilet paper here. Horrifyingly but also expectedly, not all the toilet paper flushed and there was no more water from the first flush. I initially thought I can just wait until the water fills up again so I can flush, so after a few minutes and flushing it again, I was about to leave when water suddenly flowed out of the toilet :’D It soaked their rug :’) In panic, I tried to look for something just SOMETHING but I couldn’t. There was no plunger in sight. Out of desperation, I looked through my bag and tried to find anything. Be it a plastic bag to try and use to dip my hand inside and manually unclog it and remove the stuck toilet paper or worse case scenario, a water bottle to gather and dump the toilet water try and reduce it to attempt unclogging it easier.\n\nLong story short, toilet water (and probably some bits of shit) got in the plastic bag I used to put my hand inside the toilet bowl in an attempt to remove the toilet paper 💔 At that point, I just thought, “Fck it. It already got in so might as well go all out.” So I did just that… I used the plastic bag to scoop up water from the toilet bowl and dumped it in the sink (gross, I know) and when it finally got to the level where I could put my hand (using the same plastic bag, even though it was already dirty) in the hole and hopefully get some toilet paper out, I realized just how long the train of unflushed toilet papers were and how much more I’d have to scoop out. Mind you, I have a curfew and it’s that I have to be home before 1:45 am. It was already 1:43 am at that point and the drive home takes around 20-30 minutes. I was trying to unclog it for 10 minutes at that point. I was fucked. I was even more fucked when his parents woke up, so I knew I had to do something. With me stuck at the corner, after attempting to remove, flush to see, remove again, about three times, I decided to just fake it. I took out more toilet water and made it seem like it was flushed, hoping that the next person would think it was them who clogged the toilet after throwing in toilet paper in there (because I know his parents and even he, himself, throws in toilet paper in there and flushes without looking and more often than not, the toilet paper stays floating). At that point, I was out driving back home at exactly 2 am.\n\nI don’t know why I didn’t just wake my boyfriend up to ask for help but my fear of disappointment and disgust just overpowered every rational thought in the brain. I will not be able to recover from this. We’re supposed to hang out early in the morning tomorrow (in 4 hours) but I am scared and can’t bring myself to face his family in case they ask about it because they’ll know I’m the last person who used the toilet and God knows just how much my face and body language shows when I’m lying :’) Lord. That was the grossest thing I’ve ever done since I was 6. Help.",

We eventually started living together in the same city and were living about 10 min away from my family. After 4 years we started talking about buying a house. This was the first time he brought up interest about moving to his city (closer to his family). At first I was adamant that I did not want too, since I did not have any friend or family connections there, but since its only 1 hour away I agreed to consider it. I offered to rent first for a year so I could see if I would be okay over there, but he did not want that. We started looking at property in both city's, and since my city is the capital it was way more expensive and his was less. Short story, we found a property in his city that had a garden (I dreamed of after years of living in apartments). We are fortunate enough to buy in this economy and so I moved to this new city. At first I kept my old job and commuted, but after a while I dicided to start working in the new city and try to connect to it more (meet people etc..). So I did that, quit my job and found a new one swiftly. The people at this new job are nice, but after 2 years here I just don't feel like I want to build a life here. Meanwhile my boyfriend is really content here, he also found a new job with he really enjoys and has a lot of friends and family nearby. I crave some more nature (we don't really have a park or nature nearby) and just really miss being close to family and friends. When we first bought this house we agreed that I would give it 2 years, which I did. And I really feel like I gave it a good run, but it's not for me. Recently we started trying for a baby, and the idea of having a child and not being near my support system makes me sad. We don't have a car and I would have to take several trains/busses to visit my mother. I told my boyfriend about these worries and the past few days he has been sad and closed of. I don't know what to do in this situation. I am often questioning myself if I am overreacting. I just can't shake the feeling that I don't want too settle here. We don't agree on where to live, and my fear is we don't want the same thing. I really want to slow down and move out of the city, he wants to stay.  Our relationship is strong and I love him, this is the one issue we have been facing the past few years. I try to compromise and offered to live between the 2 city's. He told me yesterday it makes him really sad to change the current living situation and he doesn't want to commute to work. \n\nWhat do I do? Give it a few more years ? ",

        "content": "**TL;DR:** My boyfriend of 10 years wants a break but still wants to see me. He says he’s mentally unwell and needs space. I want to be with someone who genuinely wants to be with me, so I’m struggling with how to handle this situation. How do I navigate this while making sure my needs are met?\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for almost 10 years, though we haven’t always lived together due to work. We had finally planned to move in together, so I gave up my apartment. However, over the past year, he has seemed less and less interested in me and our relationship.\n\nI was away for three months for work, and while he supported my decision to go, he barely made an effort to stay in touch. He never really asked how I was doing, and when I returned home, he wasn’t even there—he had booked a random weekend trip instead. Yesterday, we had a serious conversation, and he admitted that he’s not interested in my life.\n\nHe then told me he wants a break. When I asked him to clarify, he was vague but mentioned that he:\n\n* Wants to try being completely alone.\n* Feels mentally unwell and wants to talk to someone.\n* Sometimes thinks about ending his life.\n* Wants to move to another country.\n* Wants to sleep with someone else.\n\nHe also said he doesn’t like how rude he is to me (which is true—I’ve put up with a lot), and that he needs space to \"pull his life together.\" He’s lived in his apartment for three years and still doesn’t have a bed, so I do believe he’s struggling.\n\nAt the same time, he says he still wants to see me, but do more “wholesome things.” Ideally, he’d like us to get back together this summer. He’s going out with work friends this Friday, and when I asked if he’d be staying over there, he said, *\"I’ll check it out, and if not, maybe I can sleep at your place?\"* This confuses me—what does a break actually mean to him if he still wants to spend time together like normal? He did say that he just wants no expectations.\n\nI’m struggling to figure out the best way to handle this. I’m 26 and want a relationship with someone who actively wants to be with me, but I also don’t want to completely shut the door on a decade-long relationship without thinking it through.\n\n**My question:** How do I set boundaries and navigate this situation in a way that prioritizes my well-being while also acknowledging his struggles? From the sounds of it, this break isn't something I want, how do I communicate that clearly?",

It led me to keeping sex as a special thing only having sex in a relationship but in that relationship I’m hypersexual and it is a sign of love for me to give and receive.\n\nShe accidentally told me I had a small yk after our first time having sex because I couldn’t get hard and we were both high. That we weren’t intimately compatible. It really hurt but I’ve tried my best to move on. We have had sex later and it was great but she’s told me she doesn’t want to have sex as often. It feel weird that men who do nothing for her and ghost her she’ll have sex with readily but when it comes to me and we’re months into our relationship. I’ve done a lot of things for her none of which were done out of the expectation of having sex but she doesn’t want to have regular sex with me. It just feels like she isn’t attracted to me and that maybe she’s settling down. That she wants to rather date these guys she’s hooked up with but they’re not ready to commit the way I am. \n\nI really want to get over it and I knew she had a lot of partners but it didn’t really bother me till recently especially because she keeps telling me stories about her hookups. Anyway I don’t really know what to do or how to even attack the situation.\n\nTl;dr: girlfriend has a lot of partners but now that she’s in the first “good” relationship doesn’t want to have sex",

And one day she confessed that she likes me and I initially told that I don't feel the same but we went on talking normally and after a couple of weeks my friends and all were pointing out things that made me rethink my decision and talked to her again and we decided to date. The thing is that she is dating to marry and is overly obsessed with me, and I am still trying to figure things out and I also fear that if I take too much time to decide and if it's a NO in the end the more it will hurt her. one more thing is that I have a very good connection with her but not that physically attracted to her and not that it is all that matters but it might be a thing that is holding me back I am not sure.  \n\n  \nTL; DR: Friend confessed feelings; initially declined but later agreed to date.

        "title": "Ridiculous trouble and flak for my past marriage(s)",
        "content": "I'm gonna get laughed out here because in the eyes of many this will sound trivial, and \"religion is stupid\", people are dying in poverty, yadda yadda, but here we go:\n\nI was married twice before (a CIVIL wedding both times, this will become important later) and am going to marry a third time. This is not because I have some uncontrollable urge to enter into marriages but because I feel (and felt) that it matters a whole lot to my partner of the time and that I want to make her happy. I couldn't live with myself if I deprived her of this. It's however only my current fiancé that I really feel like I want to spend the rest of my life with, I'm very comfortable with the idea of having a family etc. With the previous ones, my thought was \"She really wants to get married, it's important to her, let's do it, it's just a civil wedding, if it doesn't work out, we'll sort out the divorce like human beings\". They weren't the types that would fight to hell and back over shared property and there was little of it, so that made it easier.\n\nNow, my current fiancé is catholic and has insisted on being wed in a catholic church, by a catholic priest. She was baptized as a catholic, I was baptized as a lutheran, and therein lies the epic hindrance. We talked to a catholic pastor about the possibilities of a catholic church wedding, he took some time to get back to us because he had to talk it over with other priests and clerics,and finally said that we can't be married in a catholic church because according to the lutheran rules a member does not need to enter a marriage in a canonical form for that marriage to be valid before God. So, in the eyes of the church (and God, apparently), my first marriage is still valid and hinders me and my fiancé from entering a catholic marriage. Neither of us saw this type of obstacle coming, our wedding is in about 7 months and the planning is underway, deposits for the venue etc. have been made. The only way to invalidate the first marriage is to basically file a petition with the church, they will summon the involved parties, witnesses etc. and the whole process might take over a year (way past the wedding date) with no guarantee it will go our way. \n\nI feel like this is a giant cosmic practical joke being pulled on me by the marriage deities due to various reasons:\n\n* I didn't kill or hurt anyone or robbed anyone, I didn't ruin anyone's life, I got married to make the other person happy, and it was almost 14 years ago, the divorce happened almost 10 years ago. Why is this blowing up in my face a decade later?\n* Neither me, nor my fiancé, are really churchgoers and I think this was the first time either of us talked to a pastor in many, many years. Yet for some reason it's super important for her to get married before God and now apparently my past marriage is the problem, although it had zero to do with the church (at that time) and she's really heartbroken about that, saying that she didn't really care that much about the venue, the guests, the food and the party etc. but really wanted a church wedding. That is now apparently not just in jeopardy, but unlikely to happen at all.\n* I, who doesn't enjoy dragging people into stuff they don't wanna be involved in, might have to go convincing my ex and other involved parties to go testify before the catholic church that the first marriage happened due to all the wrong reasons (it was basically to facilitate her permanent residence in the country and for the foreign police to stop bugging her, although we did have a real relationship at the time). We're on the friendly basis, but imagine convincing a satanist-for-a-joke metalhead to go testify about something before the catholic church. She might do it because we're friends, although it's a trip and she'd have to clear her schedule for a specific church-ordered date so not exactly convenient considering it's not even her religion. The whole thing would be mortifying as hell to me. And even if she goes and testifies, but somehow the whole deal ends up not going our way in the end, my current fiancé will have a gigantic beef with her and will not be able to stand her, so there goes our friendship. And in my current relationship, this depriving of a catholic marriage may get thrown in my face as convenient. Kind of like having to forever carry some form of \"the original sin\", which is FUCKING HILARIOUS, BECAUSE I'M NOT EVEN RELIGIOUS AND I DID THAT SHIT TO PLEASE ANOTHER PERSON, NOT MYSELF.\n\nI don't really expect practial advice, we're going throughour options already, I just wanted to write down and share how ridiculous this ordeal is.\n\nTL;DR: My first, civil, marriage, divorced long ago, is hindering my upcoming marriage, a catholic one, and the canonical form is really important to my fiancé and I might now never enjoy the relationship without being blamed.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "**Hello everyone,**\n\nI'm writing here because I'm going through (28M) a very difficult situation with my girlfriend (27F), and I’d like to hear your opinions, especially from those who have experienced something similar.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for almost three years, and our relationship has always been healthy, peaceful, and without any real problems. We've always had a strong bond, great complicity, and mutual trust. She also has a beautiful relationship with my family, especially my mother, who has always been very supportive of her during difficult times.\n\nHowever, in the last two months, her personal situation has worsened a lot. She has been through several past traumas and has been taking psychiatric medication for a few years to manage her emotional state. From December to January, she went to Portugal for two months for an internship with her university, where she was able to escape the toxic home environment (which is the root cause of her struggles and the reason she had to start taking medication). While there, she made new friends and, according to her, was finally able to live \"like a normal girl.\"\n\nDuring that period, we kept in touch regularly—calling, updating each other, and even though we talked a bit less due to our respective commitments, everything felt normal. However, ever since she returned home, she has been experiencing a period of intense stress and difficulty, which has put her in a deep emotional low. I know she is dealing with a lot, and it's as if she has completely shut down.\n\nI have tried asking her to meet up so we could talk, both about her emotional state and, if necessary, about any issues in our relationship. But since she came back, she has become more distant. She told me she feels bad, depressed, and needs time for herself. I have respected her space, trying not to pressure her, but still letting her know that I am there for her if she needs anything. However, over the past few weeks, the distance has only grown more and more, until about a week and a half ago, when we completely stopped talking. There was no fight, no specific discussion—it just happened. We are still together, but honestly, I am really confused. This situation is tearing me apart, and I don’t think she realizes how much this is affecting me.\n\nWhat hurts the most is not knowing whether her withdrawal is just a phase related to her emotional state or if there is something deeper going on. I have always believed she would never intentionally hurt me, and I don’t think there is someone else or that she wants to end things completely. But this prolonged silence is wearing me down and filling my mind with countless doubts.\n\nI am afraid to contact her because I don’t want to make things worse or make her feel pressured. But at the same time, not knowing what’s going on is destroying me emotionally. I don’t know if I should wait for her to reach out first or if I should message her to understand if she still wants to continue our relationship or if she needs even more time.\n\nWhat would you do in my place? Have you ever been through a similar situation? What was the outcome?\n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to give me advice.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR  \nWe've been together for almost three years, and our relationship has always been strong, loving, and without major issues. However, after returning from a two-month internship abroad, she started struggling with her home environment again, which triggered a deep emotional downturn. She has past traumas and takes medication for her mental health, and now she has completely withdrawn from me.\n\nOver the last 2 weeks, she became more distant, and now we haven't spoken at all for over a week and a half. There was no fight or breakup—just silence. I don't think she would ever intentionally hurt me, and I doubt there's someone else, but I don't know if this is just a temporary emotional shutdown or if something deeper is happening.\n\nI don't want to pressure her, but this uncertainty is breaking me.",

I believe we are soul mates however I need advice. \n\nAs far as I was aware, he was straight. However A notification showed on his phone and I clicked on it and found out he was in groups about penis and gay chats / sex. I found out he’s been using Grindr and apps for dirty talk chats. This has been going on for 2 years (as far as I know). \n\nMy partner denied he’s ever physically cheated and would never actually meet up with someone for sex. I do believe this as said he’s a virgin (to gay sex)  in one of the chats and I don’t think he has the guts to actually do anything. \n\nI have forgiven him but if he did this with a woman, I’d dump him instantly. I have forgiven him because it’s a man. I don’t know why I’m more forgiving because it’s a man? I have no issue with him being bisexual, I would stay with him if so but I won’t allow sexting behind my back. If he is gay then obviously we would break up but we would remain best friends I am sure of it. \n\nHe says he isn’t gay and it’s purely just a fantasy/sexual thing and that he’d never be attracted to a man. I am straight but I prefer lesbian porn - is this the same thing? We both allow eachother to watch porn but I would never sext anyone behind his back.  \n\nWe have had the best years together.  This happened months ago and we have made up, but i still feel confused about the situation. \n\nThere was a period where I was fantasising about sleeping with other people, I understand long term couples will have other fantasies and this is normal, but I’ve never acted on it. \n\nThe whole situation made me realise that he has a really strong sex drive. I am annoyed he wasn’t trying to have sex with me but wanted to get off with strangers online. However I believe it’s actually improved our sex life as we have been having sex more since.\n\nI really don’t know what to do because we have an amazing relationship despite all this. We are the best of friends and I am really attracted to him. \n\nTl;dr\n\nMy questions are:\nHas anyone else been through this? \n\nCan you have gay fantasies without being gay or bi?\n\nis sexting other people a step too far? If it’s just with anonymous people online, is that bad? I’ve overthought it so much that I don’t know how to feel anymore. \n\nIs this any different to watching gay porn?\n\nI don’t want to dump him but I just need someone else’s perspective. I haven’t told anyone. Please don’t tell me to dump him because I don’t want that right now. \n",

        "content": "F30, BF 33 and ex gf is F27\n\nWhy do I feel bad after finding out that my boyfriend’s ex said negative things about me?\n\nMy boyfriend vented to his ex, saying, “My girlfriend gets upset when I don’t type the ‘I’ in ‘I love you.’ I’m out drinking and enjoying time with my friends.”\n\nHis ex responded, “How old is she?”\n\nMy boyfriend replied, “She’s turning 30 this year.”\n\nHis ex said, “WTF, at that age, she’s too immature for that. Send her a screenshot of this so she knows.”\n\nMy boyfriend said, “No, she’s too soft. She might cry.”\n\nHis ex said, “Maybe if we fight, she’ll just cry, and I’ll light a cigarette after.”\n\nAs his girlfriend, I’ve never said anything bad about his ex, so seeing how she spoke about me was disappointing and made me feel bad.\n\nBut when I expressed myself, he kept saying, “She likes you, she even thinks you’re pretty, and it was just a joke. Besides, I told her that you’re soft, feminine, and caring.” (Maybe that’s why his ex joked that if we ever fought, I would just cry, and she would light a cigarette after.)\n\nBecause for me, whenever he talks about his ex, I try not to say anything bad because I respect her as someone who was once part of his life. I also don’t like speaking badly about others.\n\nTL;DR, Am I wrong for feeling this way? Or did I just misunderstand their humor and relationship, even though they’re already broken up and my boyfriend assured me there’s nothing to worry about because, for him, it’s over?",

        "content": "\nSo I (18F) have been dating my boyfriend (20M) for a month now, this incident is quite recent and I’m just confused on how to navigate what he said and whether I’m overreacting. Or maybe what he said was truly as hurtful as it sounded. \n\nSo two days ago my BF called me at 2am to inform me that one of his closest friends had died of heart failure (I never knew the friend or was close to her),so  of course with news about death, I immediately go into comforting mode. I say the usual “I’m so sorry this happened”, “she was too young for this” and “I’m here for you if you need me to cook or clean”. \n\nHowever, he wasn’t as upset about it which caught me off guard, and instead started speaking about how random death can be. I agreed as it’s true, but I also didn’t want to add any input as I wanted him to have his moment to speak about how he felt on his friend’s recent passing. So the majority of the conversation consisted of me saying “exactly” and/or “that’s so true” and things along those lines. However this is where things got weird, at the end of the conversation he started calling me “basic” and how his brain is so much more “advanced” than mine. I was quite taken aback and asked him “what do you mean?” And he went on to explain how I’m unable to carry out deep thinking and my brain is so “average” and that I’m not as smart as him in these things. I just said “oh okay” and went quiet. \n\nA few minutes passes of the call going silent and I decided to cut the call and call it a night.\n\nNow this isn’t the first incident where he says comments like this, our relationship is based off teasing and poking fun at each other but there are moments when I can tell he isn’t joking and is genuinely being rude. Because of our age difference he likes to use that as a way to give himself a leg up in being the “mature” one. However I can say with how he deals with relationship conflicts he is not the mature one. \n\nHowever, the question is, am I overreacting or was what he said genuinely rude?\n\nTL;DR , My Bf claims his mind is far more advanced than mine and thinks I’m too basic to carry out conversations",

Because of this, I have trouble believing anybody around me.

We’ve been together for nine months, and we spend almost every day together. I know I love her and care about her deeply. The problem is, when she tells me she loves me, I have a really hard time believing it. It’s not that I think she’s lying. I just can’t fully accept or trust it emotionally.\n\nI’ve talked to her about it, and she’s very understanding, always trying to help. I have improved since the beginning of our relationship by being as open as I can (which is really difficult for me because I struggle to show emotions). I try to tell her how I feel and explain the overthinking I go through when she reassures me that I don’t need to worry and that she’ll always be here. But despite all this, I don’t feel like things are getting much better.\n\nHas anyone else struggled with this? How did you work through it? Any advice would be really appreciated.\n",

        "content": "I (18) F and my boyfriend (20) just recently decided to go on a break after going out for almost 6 months. Me and my boyfriend are both in college and on weekends my boyfriend likes to go out to bars and whatnot, I dont really have a problem with this and its never been an issue in our relationship until he got back to my place after going out on a Saturday night. he was laying on my floor texting people and when I go to lay next to him I ask who he's texting and on his phone it looks like he's talking to one of his friends back home  but when I see the texts they are all not recent so I start to get suspicious. at the time my friends were in the room with us so I didnt say anything because I didnt want to make a big deal. he ends up crashing on my bed but I can't fall asleep because I have an itching feeling about something happening so I decide to go on his phone and see if there's anything alarming and I see a text with this girl saying he enjoyed seeing her and specifically asked \"so when will I see you again\" this to me was pretty bad because all of the texts being sent were around 1-2 in the morning. I look at another text from that night where his friend texted him asking where he is and asked my boyfriend \"Happy hunting?\" which insinuates to me he's looking for girls to talk to at the bar. I decide to go to bed and the next morning I start crying asking him why he's cheating on me and showing him the texts, he insists the girl was a friend she hadn't seen in a while from back home and that's why he said that. He explains a little bit more and starts crying saying how he would never do this to me how he loves me blah blah, he tells me I can go out with him every time he goes out and even says he will never go out again if it will make me feel better, I decide to believe him but it's still eating me up inside. The next day I ask if I can talk to him and tell him I still have a bad feeling about it. this time he swears on his mom (who recently just got out of cancer treatment so It was a big deal for him to say something like that) I still hesitated and after hesitating he suggests that we should go on a break because he doesn't want to be in a relationship with no trust and that we should build our friendship more so that trust can grow and  we can work out in the future. He's been stressed out lately because he had a falling out with his friend group and has a bunch of tests and he told me he is super stressed and to be having problems with me as well is not what he wants. to me it was super out of the blue for him to say that because we really have not had any fights prior to this and overall our relationship was pretty good. and in this situation asking for a break kind of seemed like he wanted to be able to go out and see other people because he wasn't able to commit to a relationship and he realized that through this argument. however, he said he still wanted to Hang out and he still wanted to talk normally and also said we should promise not to see or entertain anyone else during this break, he also doesn't want to tell anyone that we are on a break and just keep it between us to focus on building a better relationship we spent that whole night just talking and crying and he is the type that you will never see cry ever so I can't tell if its tears from feeling guilty or tears because he genuinely cares.\n\nI think the going on a break to become closer friends makes sense but also at the same time he seemed very unwilling to just talk to me about it and gave up kind of quickly, but the fact that he actually wants to keep hanging out, he said he'd still take me out to dinner and take me out to go places, everyone thinks we are still in a relationship and he wants people to think that, etc. so its conflicting to what exactly his intentions are with this break. Today we had lunch and we just spent hours talking about our lives and talking about random things, laughing, good banter, etc. He still texts me thoughout the day and sends me tiktoks so Its really hard to tell if he's being genuine about this break and what it really means to him. Do you think im totally blind or do you think all of this makes sense? What advice does anyone have for being on a break because I'm not entirely sure what it means to be on a break but not broken up. anyone who's had similar experiences please share and anyone who's been on a break before how did you make it work or not work?\n\nTL;DR  \nMy boyfriend and I are taking a break after I found some suspicious texts on his phone and he said its a good idea to build on our friendship so that our relationship is stronger and so is our trust. He still wants to stay exclusive and hang out,  he doesnt want to tell anyone were on a break and really wants to keep it between us. His actions so far seem like he's trying to make a genuine effort to still see me and connect with me as a friend but I can't tell if this is an excuse to see other people or if he is being genuine about his intentions with this break. What advice does anyone have for me who's been on a break and made it work? Do you think I'm being stupid by entertaining this break or if it seems like he's being genuine and trying to make our relationship stronger",

        "content": "tl;dr My (23M) polyamorous friend (24F) offended my new girlfriend (20F, 10 months) by not inviting her to a hang out. My girlfriend has stopped me from contacting or seeing my friend and blames me for being uncomfortable when my friend texts me.\n\nI am worried my (23M) girlfriend's (20F) emotional immaturity is going to be an ongoing problem in our relationship. The problem I talk about in this post has been ongoing for a while and neither of us have dealt with it well, but it's reached a point where it makes me feel so bad that I'm considering breaking up.\n\nWhen I met my girlfriend 10 months ago, I thought she was mature and independent, having done some self improvement after a bad breakup. Now I'm starting to doubt whether my impression was right and whether she's right for me, despite us loving each other so strongly and imagining spending the rest of our lives together.\n\nI have a female friend and past coworker (24F) who I have known for a few years. I worked with her and have gone to uni with her. She is married and I am confident there has never been any desire for anything more than friends from either side.\n\nMy friend is bisexual and would probably call herself polyamorous. She used to have a female partner whilst she was with her boyfriend (now husband), but is now only with her husband. My girlfriend is strongly against polyamory on ethical grounds, so she has never had a good impression of my friend for this reason. When I told her my friend was polyamorous about one month into our relationship, she was horrified and couldn't believe I would hang out with her. I had previously suggested the three of us should hang out and my friend was eager to meet my new girlfriend, but obviously this wasn't going to happen now.\n\nAbout two months into the relationship, my friend texted me asking if we could hang out. At this point she knew I had a girlfriend but didn't explicitly invite her in the text. This really offended my girlfriend. She told me she didn't want me to see my friend or talk to her ever again. There were two occasions in the last few months where I replied to my friend's texts without consulting my girlfriend which made her very upset (understandably as I broke her trust). I apologised and we moved on.\n\nLast week my friend texted me again asking if I wanted to hang out. I told my girlfriend about the text and she got upset as I expected, but I didn't reply because I knew she would hate that. In the last few days my friend texted me again asking if I was okay and telling me she was worried. This made my girlfriend even more upset, and she has said some horrible things about her, implying that she is selfish, malicious and even asking if I wanted to have sex with her.\n\nFrom the start of this issue I've been very uncomfortable with the way my girlfriend has dealt with it. She gets very defensive and heated and tries to position me and my friend against her and make the issue into a conflict. The whole time I've been clear that I'm not comfortable with ending my friendship over this but I know it's the best option because I love my girlfriend and I don't want to lose her, so I have come to terms with it. I have a bigger problem with not telling my friend about the situation and ignoring her which feels completely wrong to me, but I was prepared to accept that to satisfy my girlfriend.\n\nI am seriously wondering whether this is an irreconcilable issue. I don't know whether I can just end a close friendship without telling my friend why, yet my girlfriend isn't giving me any options. If I even suggest contacting the friend my girlfriend will blow up, as she has done before. Even without that, whenever my friend texts me or is brought up for any reason, my girlfriend becomes very hostile to me and I feel that she'll never be satisfied even though I'm doing exactly what she wanted.\n\nMy bigger concern is that this sort of thing will happen again. My girlfriend is easily offended and very emotionally volatile. I can imagine this sort of thing happening again, and I don't know if I should just put up with the situation for the moment and see what happens, or cut my losses and break up with her. We love each other so much so breaking up would be horrible for both of us.\n\nIs there anything I can do to save this?",

Our relationship was great and we were super compatible, and I even thought I was going to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her. But then we broke up because of my own shortcomings. I kinda stopped putting as much effort into the relationship as I used to earlier. \n\nEver since the breakup, my ex is living her life to the fullest. Going on vacations, making new friends, working out, going on dates etc. I'm still struggling to cope up with all of it. We had a common friend group which has been divided into two because of our breakup and I lost some friends there too. I see her in the university almost 3-4 times per week (we're pursuing the same course and are in the same class) and it makes me feel like I'm really losing in life. \n\nI wanted to start working out and eating healthy too and I tried but I just get overwhelmed and stop after about a week. My sleep schedule is fucked. And I have atleast 2 mental crashouts every month whenever I find out new information about her or see her doing fun stuff on her instagram story. \n\nI want to do fun stuff too, make new friends, start looking better and enjoy life again. But I don't know why I haven't been able to do that. The only thing I was able to conquer after breaking up is academics. I have been the best student of my university in terms of grades for the entire duration of the study course. I stopped studying for about 3 months after the breakup but I'm back on track again now. Currently studying at about 60% of the intensity that I used to before the breakup. \n\nI tried to cut off all contact with her but she insists on staying friends. Sends memes and reels to me everyday on instagram. We talk on calls 1-2 times per week for about an hour each time. She says she doesn't want to lose me as a friend because I'm one of those rare people who understands all her jokes and references and we have the same sense of humor, and that she just connects with me really well. \n\nPlease help me get out of this breakup rut. I want to get back into a routine of waking up early, working out, eating good, studying, socializing, and not just bed rot everyday and have nothing going on in my life.\n\nTLDR - broke up with girlfriend 5 months ago. Still not able to get back to a normal functioning life, while ex is doing great. Please help me get better.",

It was miracle and we felt like we're so special, getting to know each other a lot in a short period of time. And we're really happy in it, like really really happy. She's always telling me what I really mean to her and how much she loves the way I treat her. And I really love her deeply and got plans for a future with her. We never really had to try much to get the best of us.\n\nAnyway, it's a relationship, so we sometimes had small conflicts and we always managed to figure things out in a couple days. But, a couple weeks ago, we had a really big problem, which includes me being always emotionally dependent on her, never being initiative to go out (because I thought I am prioritizing where she wanna go or what she wanna do but I was wrong), being annoying, my emotions and stress impacting on her and our relationship. Now, she said she can't really count on me and she's unsure about her love and feelings for me.\n\nAs soon as I realized, I tried to fix, I changed and worked on myself, I gave as much space as she needed, and I tried to get better. Then, I planned a drink night and we went out, talked, went to a karaoke and had a lot of fun and seemed like things were getting better. But, after that, we were having snacks at a restaurant and talked, and we kinda got into another argument. It wasn't a fight but we were arguing. I didnt' know I was messing things up again and I thought I was just explaining. But then, she got frustrated and decided to go home. I tried to stop her but, it made things worse.\n\nI've been trying to talk to her in the meantime, but she needs some space right now. So, this time, I really wanna fix everything and work on myself to change my behaviours to be more mature and more logical. And I really wanna have a future with her. I really wanna make her love me back again.\n\n  \nTL;DR How can I work on myself? And if she's unsure about her feelings right now, can I still make her get her feelings back?",

We now haven't had sex in 6 months. I have tried multiple times in many ways, dressing up, asking, touching him absolutely everything. Sometimes I can get so far as sucking on him, but after 20mins I want some attention too but it doesn't go any further. He doesn't even get himself off after that. I'm not touched AT ALL. We don't really fight, and I've tried to talk to him about it but he kinda just shuts down the conversation saying nothing's wrong and he's just tired. I ask when is a good time, he says when he's not tired. Well he's tired all the time, even on the weekends when we do nothing. Our relationship is good other than this. He acknowledges that I don't get enough sexual intimacy, but does nothing to change it. He says he still is attracted to me, and still desires sex, but just is never in the mood. I don't get it at all. It's getting to the point that any time I initiate anything it almost feels like I have to coerce him or like I'm assaulting him, even if it's just a suggestion. He barely even lets me look at him naked anymore. It's starting to feel like we are just really close roommates or like siblings which is so weird. He works a pretty normal job so idk why he's so tired, but he's not so tired he won't stay up late playing games or watching movies. We even go out to bars and dancing sometimes and he's not too tired for that. I know he tells others we have sex, but it's just not true. What could be happening?? I promise I haven't gained weight or anything, nothing about my appearance has changed. He says he feels good about himself. I just don't know what's going on or what to do and hope y'all have any ideas. Please help me\n\nTl;dr: nothing seems to be wrong, he still won't fuck me? ",

        "content": "I (33f) have had a ln epiphany. \n\nHave you ever felt secure in a relationship — only to suddenly feel like an afterthought? Like your importance in someone’s life keeps shifting depending on what else is demanding their attention?\n\nHave you ever felt secure in a relationship — only to suddenly feel like an afterthought?\n\nLike your importance in someone’s life keeps shifting depending on what else is demanding their attention?\n\nThis is something I struggled to explain for a long time — until I realized: The problem isn’t just about being a “low priority.” The problem is that your priority status is unstable.\n\nThe Core Concept: Why This Happens\n\nIn stable relationships, your space is protected — even when life gets busy.\nIn unstable relationships, your space shrinks whenever something else shouts louder.\nSome people don’t intentionally deprioritize their partner, but they are reactive instead of intentional.\nMany people believe that as long as they are “somewhere” on their partner’s priority list, that should be enough. But it’s not just about placement — it’s about consistency.\n\nThe Shouting Effect: Why Some People Keep Pushing You Aside\n\nImagine every priority in someone’s life as a circle. When one priority “shouts” (demands attention), it expands — pushing others aside.\n\nIf you’re in a relationship with someone like this, you feel important only when nothing else is making noise.\nEvery time you shrink to make space for their other priorities, it hurts more — because you made a sacrifice expecting stability that never comes.\nThis isn’t necessarily about neglect or even lack of love. Some people are simply too reactive to hold space for you when other pressures arise.\n\nWhy This Hurts More Than Just Being a “Low Priority”\n\nIf someone simply doesn’t care about you, it’s painful but clear.\nIf someone does care about you but keeps shrinking your space every time something else demands attention, it’s confusing and destabilizing — because they never actually say “you don’t matter,” but their actions keep pushing you aside.\nThey haven’t cared enough — or been strong enough — to protect your space, to hold the boundary, and to respect your place in their life. Instead, they let everything else dictate how much space you get.\nSometimes, you recalibrate willingly — because you can see they’re being shouted at, and you love them enough that you don’t want them to be overwhelmed. So you choose to let them take your space.\nAnd sometimes, the space is taken from you — without regard, or with little regard, for your discomfort.\nThe worst part? You start believing, “Maybe this time, it will last.” But it never does.\nThe Real Issue: Boundaries &amp; Security\n\nA stable partner protects your space, even when life is chaotic.\nAn unstable partner lets external demands dictate how much space you get.\nSome people even crave the chaos — because it makes them feel important.\nOthers don’t trust stillness, so they unconsciously create situations where they are constantly needed.\nHow to Know If This Is Happening to You\n\nDo you feel like your space in the relationship shrinks when something else demands attention?\nDo you find yourself making sacrifices, believing it will stabilize — only to lose that space again?\nDoes your partner let work/kids/stress/exes expand into your space instead of protecting it?\nIf any of these resonate, you may be experiencing the insecurity of relative priorities — a dynamic where you’re never intentionally abandoned, but you are constantly displaced.\n\nConclusion: What You Deserve\n\nA loving relationship isn’t just about being a priority. It’s about having a secure space that doesn’t disappear when life gets hard.\n\nA healthy relationship has consistent boundaries that hold, even when pressure arises. If you are constantly adjusting, shrinking, or sacrificing, ask yourself is this is a pattern that you’re willing to keep enduring. You only get one life. \n\nTdlr: epiphany out of my relationship ",

        "content": "\n     I’ll try keep things short and simple even though there’s a lot of information, it will all be condensed. I’ve known my boyfriend since elementary school, but we were never close, until later when we were romantically involved for a short while. \n       He’s a business man who dropped out of school and started a successful business. We recently rekindled and things have been amazing, but something has felt off from the start and I can’t put my finger on it. From the start it felt like he wasn’t being 100% real with me (ex. Sometimes it felt like he was just flirting and saying things to say them, saying things like “what’s ur ring size? Let’s get matching diamond rings.” Or “let’s go travel” and then proceed to research really nice air bnbs, and luxury car rental prices.) I never took those things serious but it bothered me that he was almost trying to impress me instead of real. \n       The relationship itself is amazing, we get along perfectly, our communication is super healthy, when there’s a problem I always leave the conversations feeling better about him than I had before, we dedicate time each day to work on ourselves and our relationship through open conversation, devotionals (I’m Christian), and praying together. We spend hours in deep back and forth conversation, not just about our relationship but our lives and philosophies. He takes care of me with whatever I need (ex. Paying for my cabs to work, staying on the phone for hours with t mobile when my service was acting up, buying my dinners when I go out with friends.) But it’s moved super fast. (I love yous early on, talk about marriage, kids, asking me to move in with him ect) \n        Despite our connection feeling healthy and positive for me. Problems started appearing within the first month of us being together. \n\n     1. Fake numbers calling him (he claimed not to know nothing about) turned out to be his very recent ex. To which he had given me the impression that they had broken up much longer ago, but in reality they were still in contact days before he asked me on a date. \n\n\n   2. Being completely inconsistent. Saying things like “oh you’re hungry let me order you food”,and going as far as to create an order and then never order it. (Situations like this would happen all the time!) \n\n    3. Things that he would say didn’t add up. (Ex. He told me he work in New York, but the dates of his flights came and went. “I pushed my flight back.” When I asked to see the tickets he couldn’t find them. (He actually booked a ticket after pretending to not be able to find it and then suddenly remembered that he booked it on a different airline. In reality he booked the ticket right then to cover it up). More stuff like this happened. \n\n\n     4. When I confronted him about his inconsistencies, he was extremely apologetic. Took hours out of his day to write me a letter “coming clean about everything.” I forgave him but in the letter he claimed to not have a problem with dishonesty. Only inconsistency due to work stress and adhd. I was suspicious that there was more but I thought it was just my trust issues from past situations in my life. \n\n    5. The bomb drop: after this, we really worked on the trust between us, having active time talking and praying and learning about healthy relationships together. (Important context. I’m living in Thailand while he’s in the United States for a few months) he had “plans” to come see me. He had told me over a month ago that he hard ordered his passport, but then went on a work trip. Every day he made plans to come see me. From sending me Airbnb’s, telling me he was taking me shopping for Valentine’s Day, talking about our plans when he gets here. But his passport never came. Everything I asked him about it he claimed “this passport situation was stressing him out” and I ended up promising I would leave him alone about it. Finally I confronted him about it to which he swore on God that he had ordered it. Then telling me not to bring it up because he had a surprise for me. Finally when the “surprise” was revealed it was our original plan for him to come and see me. I asked him again if he had really ordered his passport originally, to which he then admitted he didn’t. \n      After this situation, he tried to defend himself (manipulate me) \n  “I did it for you “,  “I was scared to tell you because I know you hate lies.” , “you’re acting like I cheated on you.” “I had good intentions behind it” \n     It was like I woke up. I confronted him about his lying problem with all of the lies that I’ve noticed. He admitted to having a problem with lying and confessed other lies he told me (all little things to impress, or exaggerate, or make himself more relatable to me.) he’s been spending a lot of time actively trying to change. Journaling about reasons why, what his triggers are, the consequences of continuing to lie. How he’s going to change it and what he’s doing each day to change it. I want to forgive him because he really is a great man in every other aspect, my mom, who I got advice, from thinks he needs to fix this problem, and we can make this a work. She thinks we both have baggage and need to fix it before anything healthy can happen. We’ve given each other space so he can work on himself and I can stop hindering our relationship with the resentment I’m still carrying. \n    But I can’t help but notice the signs. The fact that he seems eerily similar, almost like he was made for me. The dramatic love bombing. The grandiosity in everything he does but especially our relationship, his obsession with appearance to other people that shows by his constant  exaggerations of the truth , the grand promises and so much talk of the future.  The manipulation, the gaslighting, the lies. Even now I after he’s admitted he has a problem. It’s almost as if he’s using “I just have a problem” to distance himself from the disrespect he put towards me. Is this salvageable? \n(TLDR: boyfriend admitted to having a problem with lying, but I’m worried it might be deeper than that. He shows some characteristics related to NPD. Is this salvageable?)\n",

My mom and sister are outgoing and enjoy chatting with them, which I don’t mind, but they tend to wear small, loose-fitting clothes at home that can be revealing—like low-cut V-neck t-shirts that are so hot when they sit or move around. My mom’s boobs are 42HH, and my sister’s are 40HH, so it’s pretty noticeable.\n\nSometimes I laugh at my friends’ jokes too, and OMG, they’re so flirty and masculine—my friends even compliment my mom and sister, saying they look like sisters. It’s starting to make me uncomfortable, but I’m not sure if this is normal or if I should ask Mom and Sis to wear bigger clothes. I don’t want to hurt my friends, mom, or sister—they’re all cutie pies.\n\nShould I say something about their clothes when my friends are over? How can I bring this up kindly?\n\nTL;DR: My mom (42HH) and sister (40HH) wear revealing V-neck shirts around my flirty friends who compliment them a lot, and I’m uneasy but don’t want to hurt anyone. Should I ask them to cover up more, and how?\n\n",

        "content": "TLDR : summary \n\nI have struggled with depression, anxiety, and abandonment issues for nine years, feeling like everyone I care about eventually leaves. I got attached to a guy who initially wanted to help me but later resented the situation and distanced himself. he ultimately pushed me away for good, saying my mental health affected him. Now, I’m struggling with extreme panic, unable to function, and terrified of him moving on while I’m left feeling abandoned again. I’ve been begging him to take me back, but he refuses, and I don’t know what to do.\n\n\nThe whole story is here , read it if it helps cause i really need help.\n\n\nHey , I’m 24F , i have been dealing with depression and anxiety since 9 years now. I have abandonment issues as well. I will guys let u know what happened in short. So whole my life i felt people have abandoned me. Friends or people who i like. This increased my mental health issues. I have been isolated from 3 years now where my mental health got worst but i was scared to have someone in my life cause i unintentionally clinged onto them. I just have one desire to be loved. I literally act like a dormant when i wanna keep that person into my life. I don’t care about myself. My worth depends on that person. If i have them I’m happy otherwise i feel dead. \n\n\nSo last year i shifted to another country for my masters , i was forced to talk to people as i had to make contacts and shit. I met one guy 24M we started talking and he was spiritual as me we connected and i got attached i told him about my past and he was very understanding. We used to talk day and night. But then he came to know i got attached and he started distancing him, my anxiety peaked and i was trying to make him stay( was before shifting to another country) It went on and off and 2 months later when i came for my masters i met him in real life we used to stay close and i moved in. \n\nLet me tell u his perspective as well , he was very clear from the beginning he wanted to explore as he was left by his ex whom he liked. Then he yet dated on and off and i came into the scene. He was just trying to help me and wanted me to break this looop of attachment. And was feeling pity on me. Wanted to help me. \n\n3 months into living together he fought and used to get mad at me for no reason at all. He then realises it and tells me sorry. Cause he had this grudge on me cause i pushed him into all this. \n\n\nIn November we had an huge fight over him talking to his ex. See im not saying im right but the way he treats me and other girls or ex is way too different. I used to beg for even vcall and for her its so easy. Im not saying he is a bad guy. He has been honest with me whole the time. The love never came for me. He has moved on from his ex but at one time she was imp so are friends and his ex is still in love. (Btw she has been seeing other guys while in relationship with him) thats the plus i don’t like her. Also i have never been in a relationship before. So the fight , i argued and he told me he was never interested in the place into me. The. I was crying the whole night and i started avoiding cause i didnt knew how to deal with it. In anger i left the house. He came crying that night to my house to take me back. He told me he is trying but he wants freedom and i am important to him and he loves me but not romantically. And he is attached to me. And im the closest person he has. I went back. We got more close he got more close. I made sure i asked him 10x if he was sure and wanted me in. I knew he didnt have romantic feelings. He always said i was too extreme. So i agreed on the middle ground and said yes. He also made me understand that his ex has no friends and shit thats why she called. He has given me his password. The thing i got an issue with was he said i miss u to her when he fought and i lost it. But that was past i let it go and i was like okay be friends. And most of the times she used to call. \n\n\nIn January as soon as break ended  he distanced himself and started fighting like anything without no reason like he had some kind of grudge on me. And till now acted like he wants to get rid of me. And yes as he acted pushing away unintentionally hold tight. I got mad cause he was talking normal with her and i thought it was very unfair. I told him not to talk to her. He agreed. Because he cares for me. Thats what he said. That girl has been constantly calling him to this date. And he didnt answer. And i told him just tell her i was  not comfortable with her thats why u are not talking and he was like i dont wanna hurt her. I was like the fuck. He pushed me indirectly to move out. Yesterday i moved out. I knew as soon as i move out he will talk to her and he did. Breaks my heart, made me look like i was some obsessive stupid person.\n\n\nI cannot handle this. He is acting like he dont give a fuck. Like i am nobody. All those things were mere words. I feel i am abandoned again. I cannot handle this. I have bad panic attacks. I cannot eat or work. Chest pains all the time. I am begging him to take me back i said ill improve i will give him space. He wants freedom i will give him. Just dont leave me. But he said he is out for good. And my mental health was affecting him idk how cause he is my comfort place. U name it i did everything for him all the wife duties. He says he is out for good and doesnt like this clingy behaviour. And  he is out for good this time.\n\nMy brain keeps thinking what if he dates somebody else ill be gone from his life. All i did was love and i get abandonment while some other girl who will put mere effort will get him. It just spikes up my anxiety. \n\nAll my desires are dead now. Its either him or nobody now.\n\nAll i wanted is to be loved. Cause i love unconditionally. Please help me i am like begging him everyday idk what to do.\n\nI just cant function anymore , right now i am at my work place in the bathroom crying writing please somebody help me. \n\n\n\n",

        "title": "I had a breakup. I'd really like some clarity as I'm extremely confused rn.",
        "content": "Yes I framed it using chatgpt\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend of four years recently broke up with me, and I’m genuinely confused about what I could have done to prevent it.\n\n\n---\n\nBackground\n\nI (19M) and my ex (19F) were together for about four years. I had a crush on her since 8th grade and finally confessed in 11th. Our relationship was great—we were happy, went places together, and genuinely enjoyed each other's company.\n\nHowever, about a year and a half in, she admitted to something that wasn’t exactly cheating but was close. I was devastated, cried a lot, but ultimately chose to forgive her. I even begged her not to leave me. That’s when she revealed she had lost feelings for me two months prior. At that moment, I decided to accept reality and move on.\n\nFor a while, I was doing well—until she started talking to me again. Eventually, she asked me to get back together, and I couldn’t say no.(6 months after the breakup) During our time apart, I had a hookup out of anger (which I admit was childish), and I deeply regretted it. Even though we weren’t together then, I chose to tell her( somewhere around 2 months after the breakup so we weren't back then) She was furious, called me names, and later, out of revenge, kissed a friend of hers—twice. She hid it from me for almost a year before finally confessing. Although I was disappointed, I let it go since it was in the past.\n\n\n---\n\nIssues in the Relationship\n\nOne major issue was her anger. I rarely got mad at her—maybe four or five times in our entire relationship (which she acknowledges). On the other hand, she would shout at me almost every other day until she decided to change. I was genuinely happy when she tried to improve, but her new approach wasn’t much better. Instead of yelling, she would completely shut down whenever she was upset and refuse to communicate. I kept asking what was wrong, but she never gave me a straight answer.\n\nOver time, all that bottled-up frustration led to toxic conversations. Instead of discussing things, she would accuse me of things she had already decided in her head. No matter how much I tried to explain my side, she wouldn’t listen. I was frustrated but never expressed it because:\n\n1. I knew she was genuinely trying to change, and even if it wasn’t working, I appreciated the effort.\n\n\n2. I was scared of how she would react.\n\n\n\nDespite everything, she was an amazing person. She truly loved me, put effort into the relationship, helped me financially when I was struggling, and gave me thoughtful gifts.\n\n\n---\n\nThe Breakup\n\nIn the past year, I was struggling to balance college, an internship, and daily travel, which affected our relationship. I couldn’t meet her as often and had financial problems (my family stopped supporting me because I smoked). As a result, we didn’t go on as many dates or met very often.\n\nShe brought this up once, and I tried to explain, but once she had a certain idea in her head, nothing I said could change it. Last month, she broke up with me because she felt I had \"changed\" and no longer put in effort. I pleaded, cried, and convinced her to stay, which made me incredibly happy.\n\nA month later, over a minor mistake (which she admitted wasn’t a big deal), she decided to break up again. I spent four days trying to convince her, but this time, she refused to listen. Finally, out of frustration, I spoke up about my problems—something I had never done in four years.\n\nHer response? She started abusing me, calling me names, and demanding all the money and gifts back. Things got ugly, and for the first time ever, I blocked her.\n\nFour days later, she asked a mutual friend to tell me to unblock her. I did, thinking she had realized something and wanted to talk things through. But I was wrong.\n\n\n---\n\nFinal Conversation\n\nOn our last call, I patiently explained everything again. I accepted my faults which I did even last month when she brokeup and admitted that there were times I should have done more despite my circumstances. But she completely dismissed my struggles, calling them \"bullshit.\"\n\nWhen I brought up her issues—not to attack her but to address them for the future—she misunderstood me and called me manipulative.\n\n\n---\n\nNeed for Clarity\n\nI accept that I made mistakes, but I never acted out of bad intentions. I had my limitations, but she refused to acknowledge them. Meanwhile, I endured her anger issues and frustrations in silence for years. From her pov, she isn't ready to believe that my circumstances was the actual reason. To some extent, I've even agreed to that but not entirely as it was actually a major reason. \n\nSo, am I wrong for not putting in even more effort when my circumstances didn’t allow it? I genuinely loved her, and I know she loved me too, but I feel like our biggest issue was a lack of proper communication. I still believe she's an amazing person because of the efforts she was trying to put in.\n\nWould love some perspective on this.\n ",

        "content": "My bf (15M) and I (16F) (don't say anything abt out age please I don't care if we are too young for a serious relationship, we're trying) have been together for 9 months now. \nWe started to have a really hard time, I'll not go into detail but we fought really often, my mental health was total shit (it started to be shit before), and I tought about unaliving myself a couple of times and almost did it once.\nMy bf suggested we should take a break since it seemed like the relationship just worsenes my situation but I refused telling him it would just worsen. \n\nA couple of days ago I noticed how his behavior changed, he wasn't cold or distant but there was something off so I asked him. He told me that he doesn't know why he just suddenly doesn't feel like before anymore, he still cares and is attached but doesn't feel the spark. When he looks at our photos together he doesn't feel anything, if he used to mean it when he told me he loved me now he's just unsure about it. \n\nAfter some discussing we agreed on trying to get those feelings back and that it could be due to this hard time we were having with the relationship but if nothing changes or just worsens after a while we'll just break up.\n\nYesterday we've seen eachother and the first thing he did was hugging me tightly and held me while I was crying, my head was on his chest and I heard his heart beating really fast, and it was like this everytime I couldn't hold my tears back. He initiated physical contact, such as taking my hand, hugging, kissing, cuddling etc.\nWe went to the park where we had our first date and talked.\nHe said he wants to get those feelings back and wishes it is just the rough patch. When we started heading back I said I was going to a cafe so I could use the toilet and he said: \"you leaving already? Aren't we going to my place?\"\nSo we went to his place and cuddled more, he kissed me more and said he was going to call me that night, I asked him if he was sure because if he wanted space I would have respected that. He confirmed he wanted to call and we headed to the bus stop. Before I got on the bus, even if I was in a rush he pulled me and kissed me.\n\nThat night he called and at the end, since we were used to say \"I love you\" before going to sleep, I told him he didn't have to say it if he didn't mean it. He first agreed and said that he still does it for habit, but then before hanging up he said that he just couldn't not say it and told me he loved me.\n\nI honestly don't know how to feel about this, I don't know whether to be hopeful it is just the ups and downs of a relationship or it's just over and we're clinging onto something that can't be fixed.\n\nTL;DR My bf said he doesn't feel the same as before while we are in a rough patch but doesn't want to give up and still acts like he loves me.",

        "title": "I (F36) don’t want to meet my husband’s (M37) ex-fling even though it’s just a friendly reunion. He doesn’t understand me, do you ?",
        "content": "Been married for 10 years now to a (M37) man I (F36) love. Before we met, he was in a 5-year relationship. During that time, he cheated on his girlfriend once with an Argentinian girl, let’s call her Kelly, he met in Spain during a 4-month student internship.\n\nThat fling with Kelly was never serious, just an \"abroad thing,\" and when he returned to the States, he got back together with his girlfriend. Kelly was living in Argentina at the time and visited my husband (and his then-girlfriend) the following year. They acted like friends, and that was it.\n\nThree years later, my husband broke up with his long-term girlfriend, and we met and started dating. That summer, Kelly had planned a vacation with another friend of hers and my husband, so they went on a road trip together. I was cool with it—actually, I didn't know at the time that they had previously dated, but it seemed like just a friendly holiday.\n\nMy future husband and I got serious, but due to our studies, we had a long-distance relationship. He stayed in DC while I was in Seattle for my studies.\n\nOne day, while talking about past relationships, he revealed his story with Kelly, which was before we met. He also told me that the year after we met, Kelly confessed by email she was still into him and asked if he'd consider moving to Argentina. He flat-out refused, saying he didn't feel the same way—he even showed me the email he sent her at that time.\n\nOne day, he mentioned that Kelly was on a business trip 2 hours away from DC. I played it cool, and they met while I was on the other side of the country. They were out of town and shared a hotel room. He told me beforehand, \"You don't have to worry, she's just a friend.\" We didn't have much money then, so it was easier like this than booking an extra room. To this day, I wonder if anything happened. I've mentioned that day to show how trusting I was, and he always said nothing happened.\n\nLater on, my boyfriend—soon to be husband—moved to Seattle to live and start working there. He asked if I'd be cool with Kelly visiting us for a weekend, and I said yes. The weekend went fine; I played the coolest girlfriend ever, even though I was jealous of their shared experiences. It's natural, I guess, but I shouldn't be since they dated before my boyfriend even knew I existed. I just told him after she left that I felt awkward on a few occasions as they mentioned Spain a lot—not about the two of them, but the overall experience, and I felt a bit left out. But that's life, and it wasn't too big a deal.\n\nA few years passed, and we never saw Kelly. I think they occasionally communicated to wish each other happy new year on Facebook or something, but that was it. We got married, and a few years later, my husband went to Spain to have a reunion with friends from there. Kelly came too since she was part of that friend group. I stayed in the US. There was no real reason to be suspicious, but one thing made me a little nervous: they ended up going to the seaside together one day before the whole group joined (which wasn't the original plan). There was no special reason apart from the fact that others had to work while Kelly and my husband were off.\n\nNow, three years later, my husband tells me that Kelly moved with her boyfriend to Minneapolis and she suggested we all meet for a weekend (the 4 of us). The only time I met Kelly was many years ago, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I told my husband I was fine with him meeting her without me, but honestly, we were never friends, so why force it if I'm not feeling it?\n\nAm I being a jerk? Am I the asshole here? Am I overreacting ?\n\nI know they were together for only a few weeks, and that was a long time ago and before we even met, and that it never meant anything serious. I'm feeling a little jealous, and I don't know why I should force myself. I'm also not stopping him from meeting her if that's what he wants.\n\nTL;DR! Husband (M37) had a brief fling with a girl years ago before we met. Now she’s back, living nearby, and wants a double date. Is my (F36) reaction normal ?",

        "content": "Hi there,\n\nI first got with my girlfriend in May 2023. She was a little out of my league, but after she kept pursuing me. Even though I didn't really have much interest at the start. She was a friend of one of my best friends so I knew her for many years. Anywhere id go she would make sure to come so she could spend time with me. \n\nI gave in and we started to see each other over a period of months, though I was due to move to another country for four months in Sept 2023. The night before I left she asked me to be her boyfriend. \n\nDuring that time before we became official the sex was incredible. It seemed like she was always texting me about it, telling me she couldn't wait to see me, making up role plays, talking about what we would do when we seen eachother in a few days, she would use her sex toys all the time, watch porn etc. \n\nBefore me she was single for ten months after a seven year relationship and was being very sexually promiscuous. She was into ripped gym guys and black guys, I am neither, hence why at the start I wasnt so interested to anything more than a hook up. Even during her previous relationship she would have threesomes a lot (I am not interested in them but she clearly was a very sexual person prior to me). \n\nWhen I was first started seeing her, she told me men's only value to her was sex because she had such a bad break up with her ex and so many men had let her down during her life. \n\nWhen I eventually moved away for four months. She was almost annoyingly horny. Wanted phone sex constantly, sexting constantly, would go on these rants about how she needs sex everyday and that's how she's always been. She was so sexually frustrated that I actually started to worry she would cheat on me whilst I lived away. \n\nWhen we finally reunited sex was good for perhaps two months. Then it dwindled. It's like something changed within her. She suddenly hated porn and everything it represented. She no longer used her toys or masturbated at all. It is like her libido literally just died. \n\nWe moved in together, and of course it got worse. The only time she seems horny or even remotely interested in sex is the week of her period. Whilst I dont mind period sex it's annoying that's when we are always intimate. \n\nI can't help but feeling insecure and that it's me. If she was with her \"usual\" type perhaps she would be horny  more. I know it's nothing to do with the actual sex as my girlfriend is very forthcoming and straight up and she told people when she was pursuing me I was best sex she's ever had, and when we do it have sex it is incredible and she orgasms a lot of times. \n\nIt just feels like since getting with me her sexual balloon burst. I love sex, I'm not hyper sexual but I like to have it 1-3 times a week with someone who feels the same and me and my partner feel most connected when we are having it. \n\nTd;lr gf libido tanked since we became official ",

Said nothing.  \n\nAnd now im here bawling my eyes out because i feel sooopp guilty for being cruel to her and breaking her heart.

We never met in person, but our connection felt deep, we supported each other and built dreams together. I’m a total lover girl, so I gave this relationship my all, i mean my ALL, i even neglecting my studies just to be there for him. But i didn’t care all i wanted was to make him feel loved, heard, respected and important since LDR requires much more effort. He cared for me too ngl, but I definitely put in more effort. We had conflicts, likely due to our maturity gap, and I was always the one to go back and try to fix things in the end.\n\nTL;DR: Our last argument started as a joke about our age gap, which never bothered me or him before, but he said, “What if people think you’re my mother?” and other comments, I made it clear it rubbed me the wrong way and expected an apology. He didn’t apologise, so i kind of went cold, Instead, he just mirrored my coldness. After a one-word response from him, I only reacted with a heart, waiting for him to fix things, and now… nothing, 10 days of radio silence.\n\nAnother thing that weighs on me is how little effort was put outside the daily conversation. I never expected or asked for gifts because i know how long distance is, but a small gesture (like delivering flowers even for once) would’ve meant the world for me. Even on Valentine’s Day, when I had plans for us, wondering what to get him, how can we spend the day from distance, all I got was a short text. It was cute and all but made me wonder if I was expecting too much or if I just wasn’t that important to him.\n\nNow, I’ve noticed he’s deleting some of our conversations and removing me from certain platforms, which makes me think he’s moving on. It hurts to think I was so easy to forget after everything I gave. I don’t know what to do—should I reach out, or is this silence my answer?",

        "content": "So I (22M) sort of went on a date with a girl (19F). It wasn’t really a date because I went to her house but I’ll just call it a date for the sake of it. It was a lovely time. We watched two movies and at the start we were quite separated but slowly her and me moved closer and closer to each other and by the last half of the second movie we were basically cuddling with her nuzzled into my shoulder and we were holding hands. It was really nice and sort of perfect. \n\nWe’ve been on a few dates now but that’s the most intimate moment we’ve had. Me and her both told each other how we feel. \n\nA couple weeks ago it came up in conversation about if we’ve had bf/gf’s before and she said she never did and before uni she was sort of scared of guys (I don’t think literally but just nervous around them). I haven’t had a girlfriend so this is all new to me. I’ve kissed a few girls but they were at a club so they were drunk kisses and the typical tongue making out. But on my own principle I’ve never wanted to go further (like sexual) with a random person and want it to be with someone special. I think she’s the same as she doesn’t seem like the type to have casual sex. \n\nSorry for the ramble but basically when the movie stopped it wasn’t really awkward we just got up and said I should go as it was 1am. In hindsight I should have just kissed her when we were more in the moment. But anyway we’re just sitting and she ordered me an uber. It arrived and I hugged to say goodbye and I said fuck it and said “I really want to kiss you right now” (I know not smooth at all, but I didn’t want to startle her) and it just wasn’t great. I can’t really describe it but I think she’s just wanted to kiss me on the lips and I went for more of a French kiss type so I just felt her teeth, and I realised it was going bad so I stepped away and said “I should probably go and get the uber” and it was a slightly awkward goodbye. Now I don’t know if we just got the wrong vibe or she’s never kissed before. \n\nBut when I got back home I messaged her and thanked her for a great time and said “sorry I rushed that kiss, I feel like we were both for different things 😂😂😭 but they do say practice makes perfect” I thought I’d take the blame off her and just acknowledge it but in a funny way and I think it worked because she said it was okay and that practice does indeed make perfect. \n\nIf we kiss again and it’s just as bad what should I do? Should I ask what she’s actually done with a guy to maybe help her or something. I really do like her but I’m just nervous that she might be a bit too shy when it comes to more intimate things. \n\nAlso bonus question - I am quite shy and she’s definitely shy. Shes never initiated physical touch (although we haven’t done much, we held hands last date but first time cuddling) i want a strong connection but im very attracted to her and want to progressively get more intimate but how do i do that  while making her feel comfortable and safe because i do care a lot about her\n\nTL;DR - kissed this girl goodbye. I sort of miss read the situation and went for a more passionate kiss and I think she just went for a peck/normal kiss and it was a little awkward ",

        "content": "TL;DR: My boyfriend (23M) keeps liking a certain girl's posts and it's starting to make me (23F) uncomfortable. Should I be worried or am I being too paranoid?\n\nHi everyone,\n\nMy (F23) boyfriend (M23) have been together for a few years now. Before we got together he was already following this girl. They went to high school together and she was the popular pretty girl every guy had a crush on, my bf as well. No big deal, this was high school so it was years ago. However, I started to notice he was liking ALL of this girls’ pictures. Note this: she doesn’t follow him back and they were never friends. I brought it up last year, he said he just likes all postst from people he knows and he doesn’t mean anything by it. I let it slide but made very clear to him I don’t want him liking her pictures anymore since it is sending the wrong message and it makes me look a bit stupid being his girlfriend. After this he stopped liking her posts (she postst quite a bit). \n\nA few months later I noticed he did like a new pic of her. I brought it up again, he said the same thing; ‘didn’t really notice, I like all posts of people I know’. I told him again, I don’t like that in this case since she doesn’t even follow him and I feel its disrespectful to me, especially since this is the second time I have to bring this is up. He said sorry and told me he will not do it anymore if it makes me uncomfortable. This is 6 months ago. \n\nNow you guessed it: I was bored just now and checked her IG, and he liked the last picture she posted yesterday. I am disappointed and feel disrespected since I brought it up TWICE so this would be the third time.\n\nThis may seem as a small thing, but it is not about liking the pictures, it just feels like he is not taking me seriously and it makes me feel stupid being his girlfriend, and people (including me) seeing him liking her posts all the time.\n\nIs he just being disrespectful to me, is it oblivion or am I exaggerating?\n\n\n",

She would always tell me (34M) to share things that bothers me or anything at all really. On the other hand, I know myself that I can be a bit closed at times especially during disagreements where I would not have an answer and just keep silent (it's something that I was working on improving) \n\n  But certain topics with her, she'll be answering me short answers or nothing like about why her parents decided to separate back when my ex was 16 or 17 years old, or about how her ex boyfriend treated her badly. Yet she always pushes me to share my feelings and troubles with her. \n\n\n   Now since she broke things off with me, she's totally avoiding me and being cold, mean and rude.\n(I went through depression last year and wasn't able to face her and when I gained strength to meet her to explain myself she just decided to leave me and say she wasn't supportive and she couldn't marry me which was totally not related to what happened to me last year). \n\n So all the times we were together, I didn't really see or notice any signs of her being an avoidant but now I do which is puzzling. \n\n\nTL;DR : Partner was always attentive but now super mean and distant after she broke up with me",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I (35M) need some perspective on a situation with my fiancée (25F).\n\nWe’re both Christians, and we made the mistake of having premarital sex. We recognized it was wrong, repented, and wanted to move forward. But after we did, she made some hurtful statements comparing me to her past lovers—insinuating that she’s had better experiences. She even said it made her “feel like going back” (to them).\n\nThat cut deep. I felt dishonored as a man, disrespected, and like I’m second best to the woman I plan to spend my life with. I’ve never had a woman say something like that to me, even when I was still out in the world. And to be clear, I’m not naive—I don’t expect to be the best partner she’s ever had. But what bothers me most is that she said it. It’s one thing to think something privately, but to voice it so casually? The Bible says, “Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.”\n\nIronically, she’s also not the best partner I’ve had, but I’d never say that to her. At this stage in life, for me, sex is about connection and bonding, not just performance. And now, no matter how much she apologizes or tries to backtrack, the damage is done. I can’t shake the thought that this is how she truly sees me. The sanctity and exclusivity of our relationship feel tainted, and she’s introduced insecurities that I never had before.\n\nAt this point, I don’t feel like moving forward with the marriage. Am I overthinking this? Being insecure or immature? Or is this a valid reason to walk away and save myself future heartbreak? Because right now, I feel like this is a red flag I can’t ignore.\n\nTL;DR: My fiancée and I had premarital sex (we’ve repented), but afterward, she made comments comparing me unfavorably to past lovers and even said it made her “feel like going back” to them. I feel disrespected, dishonored, and like I’m second best. Now, no matter how much she apologizes, I can’t shake the feeling that our relationship is tainted.

I mentioned it and he said that it has nothing to do with it but as I'm a Latina and he German, was schocked that I was impressed by the idea of going to a Sauna (naked in front of other naked people), or that once we watched a horror movie and the first half an hour was about naked woman so I decided to change it.\n\nI also bought Sex toys and things to experiment with him, but he someway overthough how open I can be, mentioning ridiculous things as he might feel uncomfortable offering me doing 69 which we already did and that I do things for him only, which I clearly denied because it was my decision.  I'm also into some BSDM stuff so doesn't make sense at all.\n\nSomething about this feels off, I don't really know how to react, it someway feels wicked how he says that he is lacking that from my side, and at the same time he understood that i'm not ok with it. Why would he bring it to the table when he know how I am and if it was not that relevant? He told me that he only wanted to be sincere with me and that that's the way he is.\n\nI was insecure and told him that now I feel that we'll look for that in other people, he denied it and told me that before that our relationship will be ended. \n\nI'm focusing on knowing him more as a person and he already feels that lack?

My bf (23M) and I (23NB) have been together for a year and a half (with two breakups in that time frame) obviously we've had some problems such as when I found out he was still on tinder 2 months after we became official, him messaging girls while we were together, responding to girls selfies with🔥 or 😍, having snap streaks with girls that he only had on his snap because they were hot. Every time these things happened I would come to him and tell him how I felt and how upset I was and sometimes we would fight. He would then do the absolute bare minimum to change. On new years eve of '23 we got into such a big fight over it I went through his phone and blocked like 20 girls. I've gone through his phone a few times since because I've of course found it difficult to trust him again. This month I was on our shared iPad (which is linked to his Apple account) and I ended up going through the photos. He had a lot of screen shots of OF models (most of which he was following on insta), screenshots of some of his ex's posts, and screenshots of one of his female friends in a skintight and revealing outfit. None of these pictures were sent to him directing, they were just screenshots of posts or lives. I confronted him about this and asked for explanations. He didn't have anything to say about the OF models or the screenshots he had of his friend. He said he took the screenshots of his ex to show to one of his guy friends because he thought she was using a really heavy filter or something??? I don't know how much I believe that though. He wouldn't really talk to me about it and just went to sleep. I called him in the morning (which was Valentine's Day) and we kind of talked about when he was going to come over. I reminded him that I work that night (I work overnights, so I wouldn't be going in until 11pm) and he got so mad at me and hung up and texted me that he couldn't believe I would think so little of him to think that he wouldn't have made any plans. That went on for about 2-3 hours of him honestly berating me and treating me like crap. He eventually came over and he gave me chocolate and we watched a movie, then we went to dinner, but we had to go to like 3 different places because he didn't make reservations anywhere. We literally didn't do anything else, there were no other plans so I don't understand why he was so mad at me. I honestly feel like he was just trying to get the attention off of the pictures I found the night before. \n\nFor some other context, in the beginning when we were just talking and hooking up he told me that most of his friends were girls because he was trying to get with them. Hence why I was so upset when I found the screenshots of his female friend. \nAlso since in non-binary I think I have a lot of additional insecurities about our relationship because he's straight, so I just worry that I'm not \"feminine\" enough for him. \n\nI'm basically just looking for other people's opinions on the situation. I don't know if I'm overreacting because of my personal insecurities or if he genuinely just isn't ready or mature enough for a committed relationship?

        "content": "\nBack in college Me (26 F) I went through a really rough relationship one that left me questioning so much about people, about love. It made me wonder why some girls get so deeply attached, why they hold on when it’s not working. At one point, I even started resenting men in general.\n\nMaybe it was the past wounds talking. Childhood experiences had already planted this thought in my head that love wasn’t meant for me, that I wasn’t meant for anyone. I genuinely believed I would never find it again.\n\nAnd then, one day, I met this boy. (M -28)\n\nI used to have conversations with my friends, casually saying, “Who gets so obsessed over a guy? Just let it go. If it’s a real relationship, sure, respect it. But if someone is just playing around, why even take it seriously?” I thought I had it all figured out. And then this boy walked into my life, and everything changed.\n\nFast forward to today I married that boy. And even after all this time, every morning when I wake up and see him, it still feels like the first time. I watch him get ready for work, and for a second, I feel like a teenager with a crush. Then reality hits me—oh wait, he’s my husband.\n\nIt still feels like there’s some background music playing when I look at him. And even though I’ll never say it out loud to him, the truth is… I love him more than I ever thought was possible.\n\nAnd to my younger self—the one who thought love wasn’t meant for her—I wish I could tell her, “It happens, sister. It happens.”\n\n\nAnd funny enough, I still remember a call I once had with one of my close friends we were discussing how a girl could ever get so obsessed over just one boy. Oh, how life proves us wrong in the sweetest ways.\n\n\nEk ladke ke liye kaun itna obsessed hota hai? Yeh sochne wali main hi thi… Jab tak meri baari nahi aayi. Phir samajh aaya, hota hai behen, bohot hota hai! \n\nTL;DR: I used to question love and obsession, but then I met the one who changed everything. Now, I’m happily married, and love still feels new every day.",

Apparently he regularly lies to those closest to him to keep up appearances. Whether it’s exaggerating accomplishments, lying about going to the gym or bigger lies like having cheated on a partner in the past. \n\nHe’s admitted all of this to me and said he wants to seek help. He’s since organised to see a therapist.\n\nDuring this time I asked that he go stay somewhere else because I needed time to process. He ended up staying with his parents who enabled his behavior and tried to convince him that this was not that serious. \n\nEven worse, they then started placing the blame on me saying they were concerned about his well being because I’ve exhibited controlling behaviours. He claims to have refuted their claims and made it clear that I am very loving and supportive but I do occasionally get upset with him because he constantly fails to deliver on promises (which he acknowledged was in part due to his lying)\n\nPlease also keep in mind that he’s closer with his family since I came along and his family have on multiple occasions acknowledged this and thanked me. An abusive person would isolate you, not push you closer to your family. Also, I’ve done so much for them and have treated them like my own parents/siblings and asked for nothing in return. \n\nI am at a loss for words and feel so hurt by his family. I’m also hurt that they’ve refused to check in on me and said they’re concerned about him. He’s now back with me but they are now making plans without me.

        "content": "TL;DR: My relationship with my partner has been going well since my parents finally loosened up, but we’re at the stage now where it’s figuring out where those boundaries are. I wonder if it’s right or not to ask if I can stay at my partner’s for a week or two when his parents aren’t there. Or at least how to go about that.\n\nHey everyone! I hope you’re doing well!!\n\nThings have been going alright between me (21F) and my parents (Mum 45F and Dad 54M) when it comes to my relationship with my partner (20M). \n\nDespite me being 20 when my relationship began it was always hard to spend time with my partner without the restrictions of a 16 year old girl. But after a year and a half of pushing that I was capable of handling my own relationship and so on, they started to relax on me going out with my partner longer than  6PM, sleeping over at his and so on and so forth.\n\nI can tell my mum still feels icky about it, she’s understandably overprotective, but she rarely fights back anymore about it. I gained my own independence and control in my relationship, and I’m really happy about it!\n\nThe advice I need on is figuring out how slow I should take the progress of my relationship for my mum. \n\nMy partner asked me last November that he’ll be alone in April since his parents are away, he suggested that maybe I could live with him during that time so we can get a feel on what it’s like to live together. I agreed as well, however, he been hesitant to ask since things have always been rocky with me and my parents when it comes to these things.\n\nI’ve seen couples spend time together like that for a week or more, so I think it would be fine. But my mum is overprotective and won’t see it as normal.\n\nI want to do this, even for a week would be fine, but I’m worried that she won’t take it well or assume I’ll just do something horrible during that time. I also don’t want to push the boundaries, I know they’re finally trying to let loose and I don’t want to take a mile when I’ve been given an inch (if that phrasing is right lol).\n\nIt’s really hard to talk to my parents, they can be stubborn and while I’m usually calm around others it’s hard to keep my cool around them.\n\nHow do I go about this? Do I just ask her advice on it? Im thinking I’ll say his parents are gone for two weeks and just hopefully land on two weeks—then if an argument does come out and I lose at least I’ll be able to sleepover at his for that one weekend his parents are ‘at home’. \n\nI feel bad for wanting it to be honest, a part of me doesn’t think it’s right since they’ve actually been trying this time but I also don’t want to keep this cycle of slowing down my relationship to make my mum comfortable. \n\nAnd there’s also the fact that if I don’t do this I’ll disappoint my partner, he’s always been there for me and is very understanding but I know he looks forward to spending that time with me and it would be nice to see a glimpse of what our future could be like together.\n\nAny perspective is well appreciated, I hope I’ll be able to navigate this on my own soon. I wish everyone the best of luck and a good day/night, thank you for taking the time to read my troubles :’). ",

As part of this resolve he unfollowed all of these women on Instagram. I later found out that he was still following some of them, we had another fight over this and he unfollowed these girls (however he lied about following them before eventually doing this). \nI have just found out that he is still connected with these girls on other forms of social media. As far as I am aware he is not in contact with these girls actively. I do not want to have a fight with him and I am worried that mentioning this will bring about a fight. I also love him so much and don’t want to risk anything that could cause us to separate as this is the only problem I have with our relationship. What should I do in this situation and what are things I can do to better myself in terms of not feeling jealously so m",

On top of that, I wasn't even aware that I was looking at this waiter and she was just telling me this after. \n\n  \nAnd now my girlfriend was a little bit mad at me incest that she wants to build trust over time. We have been together for six months now and I was wondering what is something that I can do that shows her that I'm 100% committed and don't want to talk to any other woman on this planet. I really wasn't aware that I was looking at other women and also don't want to do this but now it happened and I am a little bit helpless because I don't find any ideas what I can do to give her trust right now and to give her more safety.\n\n  \nTLDR: \n\nMy girlfriend got mad at me because I looked at another girl and now she needs time to build trust again.

        "content": "I (M/30) have a fairly low sex drive, and it's significantly affecting my relationship with my fiancée (F/30). It’s not that I don’t find her attractive or that I don’t love her—I do. I just can’t explain why my libido is so low. We’ve been together for eight years, and it has always been this way. There are times when we have sex regularly, but then there are phases where we go one or even two months without it.\n\nI’ve taken several steps to try to address this. I went to the doctor and had my testosterone levels checked, but everything came back normal. That didn’t surprise me too much since I’m physically fit—I work out regularly (strength training three times a week, cardio two to three times a week), and I’m in good shape (5’12” and 168 lbs).\n\nI also stopped watching porn because I realized it was affecting my libido. At first, my sex drive improved significantly for a few weeks, but now it has dropped again. We both enjoy sex when we have it, so it’s not a matter of dissatisfaction.\n\nStill, I can’t shake the feeling that it’s “wrong” for a man to have such a low libido. When I talk to my friends, they don’t really understand my struggle because they say they’re constantly horny. But I just don’t work that way—I never have. I’ve been in long-term relationships before, and this issue has always been present.\n\nAnother possible factor is that I’m generally an anxious person. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and while I try to manage it, my anxiety fluctuates. Right now, it’s particularly bad due to personal struggles—I recently lost my job, which has been weighing on me heavily.\n\nI feel helpless because I’ve tried so many things—supplements, exercise, open conversations with my fiancée, even “forcing” myself to have sex—but the problem keeps coming back. My mind is constantly racing about this issue, which I know only makes it worse. I’m at the point where I wonder if this is just who I am—maybe sex just isn’t that important to me. But I don’t want to accept that because I fear it could damage my relationship.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar, and if so, how did you handle it? Any advice or success stories would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\n**TL;DR:** I have a low sex drive, and it has been this way for years, which is affecting my relationship with my fiancée. Testosterone levels are normal, I stay fit, and I’ve tried various solutions (stopping porn, supplements, exercise, open communication), but the problem keeps coming back. Anxiety might play a role, but I feel stuck. Looking for advice or success stories from others who have faced similar struggles.",

        "content": "I (25M) have never been in a relationship. I’ve had an obsession of being in one for the about 13 years. All through out High School and College, I have missed opportunities to take the plunge out of fear of rejection or embarrassment. Not only has this affected my dating mindset, but also forming basic friendships as I’d always put their needs above my own. Looking back, this was me desiring over being liked by others by believing that having a girlfriend will somehow make me Universally respected (this is a bad mindset as it treats my partner like a trophy/accessory rather than a person). Over this period I believed that I wasn’t worthy of being part of society due to being surrounded by couples and marriages (both of my sisters have long-term boyfriends who I’ve known for years), putting the pre notion in my head that being “the single one” means you’re not important.\n\nOver the past couple of years due to COVID and my mother passing away, I became even more isolated than before. But I took this time to educate myself and learn what I like and what makes me a good person. I’ve grown a newfound respect for my single hood and I’ve been learning to stand up for myself and practice self affirmation.\n\nNow I’m in a weird stage where I respect my single hood, but I also still have the desire to date and eventually be in a relationship. I’m asking for advice on how to approach this new perspective. Is it still selfish to want a partner knowing that somewhere in the back of head my old mindset might come out and treat her badly? I appreciate whatever help I can get.\n\n  \nTL;DR - I've accepted being single but would still want to date. Not for social status, but for myself.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.",

We were classmates and barely talked for the first 7 months and then we started to talk on chat (starting on 18th February, 2018) and then I started to find my comfort in her soon and within a month told her that she's my bestfriend. And a month later (in May) she told me that she feels the same way. On July 30th, 2018, we were sitting next to each other in class and I started to play with her hand and something in me just clicked. In the weeks that followed I started to fall for her. (It all sounds so cutesy, maybe even funny, but we were 16, so it was this cutesy) \n\nI told her multiple times that I like her but always followed it with kidding, I guess I just loved to see her eyes go wide when I said it, trying to find her reply in those eyss I guess. It was so great so good, I found my first love in my bestfriend. Fast forward to September 2018, on 3rd, we asked each other out and we started our relationship.\n\nI am not the most calm person, (recently got diagnosed with ADHD) and I lose patience quickly, but oof I respected her, fell in love with her, cared for her more and more and more and more and even more  everytime she still chose to be with me. She loved me more. There was no doubt....\n\nWe wished each other month anniversaries (mensiversaries) on 3rd of every month\n\nI loved her so much, she is the sweetest thing ever. We both did things that pushed us apart but my anxious attachment didn't let me see it's time to let go.\n\nIf today I am able to work towards gathering the courage to let go, it's because of her. I don't want to remember what we had in a different way. It was perfect and we were not mature enough to keep it. She loved me enough to make we want to keep hoping forever. But it's time that I let go of what we had in the past.\n\nI want to let go and still keep hopes up, it seems do-able. But only time will tell.\n\nWe were each other's Momo from 3rd September 2018 to 22nd May 2024. \n\nHehe 😝😝 she's still the cutest thing ever😝😝...and yeah I still become a child when I think about her 🤭🤭\n\n\ntl;dr - She brought out the best in me, she loved me right.

We've been dating for three years and we arent exactly long-distance cause we're in the same state, but we're still an hour apart so not exactly close. \n\nAt college I have a pretty solid friend group consisting of mostly girls and a few guys. That's the exposition, and basically recently I've caught myself gaining a little crush on one of them. Nothing serious or anything, just like once in a while he'll do something in a way that makes me go \"damn.\" But then I lock in and remember I have the sweetest boyfriend on the planet and I stop thinking that way.\n\nEven though it's just a little thing I still felt guilty about it because my boyfriend and I made a promise that we would tell each other if we ever had feelings for anybody else so we could work through it together. So, I told him the next time I saw him after realizing, and I ended my explanation with, \"I completely understand if you want me to distance myself from him.\" And other things along those lines.\n\nBut get this, his response was basically along the lines of, \"Nah, you're chill.\" I essentially told him that I'm gaining feelings for a guy that I see almost every day, and I offered to stop hanging out with him (cause tbh I feel that's fair) and this sweet man tells me, \"I don't want you to change anything about your days. Hang out with your friends like usual. I already trust you, but the fact that you told me you like him gives me even more reason to trust you. This is normal in a long-term relationship to have feelings for someone else at some point, the important thing is that we're honest with each other. Thank you for telling me, love.\"\n\nLike, I was speechless I want to cry over how understanding and caring this man is in our relationship. I am so lucky.\n\nTL;DR- I might have a crush on one of my close guy friends and I told my boyfriend and his response was basically, \"It's okay that you're feeling this way, it's normal to at some point have feelings for someone else while in a long-term relationship. And l trust you even more now that you told me. Thank you for telling me love.\" He was so sweet and secure and didn't tell me to stop hanging out with this friend or anything even though I offered.

If my partner is at home, then I should be at home too. If I’m out, I have to message him constantly otherwise he says ‘I don’t love him’.\n\nThe relationship wasn’t always this way, but my partner has many health problems and I think feels the need to control something in his life - that thing being me. I’ve spent 4/5 years being his carer, being taken for granted and never supported by anyone else in his family (they all hate me, and i don’t like them either). I’ve seen messages between him and family members accusing me of lying about my Autism diagnosis and taking the piss out of me for being Autistic.\n\nI had a breaking point not so long ago, where I decided that I would treat myself as an adult and do the things I wanted too. Of course, that has apparently ruined our whole relationship that I had the audacity to go out with friends and not follow his rules. It’s mentioned in every argument, and he makes snide comments about things every single day, pushes my buttons and then tells me I’m the problem when I bite back.\n\nOf course at some point I loved him, but I think that’s long gone. I don’t know how to approach it, whenever I’ve mentioned anything his health is suddenly awful and I have to stop the conversation to look after him. I didn’t realise any of these things were happening, until a really close friend moved in and noticed all of these behaviours and pointed it out to me - I feel a bit stupid as I’ve been in abusive relationships before so don’t know how I could’ve missed this. It isn’t as simple as walking away, at all.\n\nI’ve also, found myself having feelings for someone else. I didn’t mean for this to happen, and it was instant as soon as I met them. I feel safe and myself around them, and that’s something I don’t think I’ve ever had with my partner. It’s tricky, I don’t know what to do.\n\nTL;DR - My partner and I have been married 2 years, he’s controlling, narcissistic and makes me feel like I’m genuinely insane. He comes with many health problems which are often used against me. It hasn’t always been like this. I also have feelings for someone else. Has anyone been in a similar situation? “Just leave” Isn’t that simple.",

She said they already tease her a lot, and it feels like she’s being ganged up on. I stopped doing this, but at her birthday dinner, she mentioned I upset her, though she couldn’t remember what I said. At Thanksgiving, I helped clean up while her family relaxed, and she told me I made her look bad because she just wanted to sit and read.\n\nAnother issue is her sister, who doesn’t have many friends. She asked me to be a bridesmaid and help with wedding planning (the wedding is in five months). My friend, the maid of honor, hasn’t done much planning and got upset that I was stepping in again saying it makes her look bad. She also mentioned that most of her friends like her sister more.\n\nShe’s also told me I can be “too much” and overwhelming. I don’t want to walk on eggshells, but I also don’t want to make things worse.\n\nTL;DR I feel like my friend (F 26) has a lot of unspoken rules for me, especially around her family, and it’s becoming awkward trying to navigate that space.

It ends here. \n\nNow, I know it isn’t his fault, but I can’t help but feel awful about it. This is so petty I know and doesn’t seem like a big thing but I’m annoyed as hell. Like, what made her feel so entitled to do that. How did she not even think about it once before doing it. Why did she not care. ARGH. \n\nWe’ve been dating for a couple months. We have known each other for 5 years. \n\nAnd like, this is the same girl who decided to casually ‘darken’ the hickeys I gave him when we were not officially dating and just in more of a situation-ship (I was undecided). Also who decided to sleep in underwear?? while sharing his bed with him when staying over (also before we were dating). \n\nIk my bf is a loyal man who only has eyes for me and I can’t be mad at him, it’s just I find her annoying.

Just some words might help. I’ve just been in a bad mood all day bc of this. \n\nTLDR; My bf has a friend who does stuff I don’t like and find annoying such as wearing his jacket. Other stuff too like darkening his hickeys and sleeping next to him half naked but this was before we were officially dating and only a situationship. \n",

        "content": "My bf (40M) and I (35F) just returned from a week long 40th bday celebration for him in Mexico (where he wanted to go). \nWe’ve been together for a yr and I paid for the trip (accommodations, flights, dinner-$5k) as it was a milestone bday and wanted to do something special for him. \nTwo days into the trip he brought up wanting another gf (again) and when I pressed why he said “to do the things you don’t want to do”. This confused me bc I want to do all the things but he never does lol. I asked “what don’t I do?” To which he waved me off and began ignoring me. He later attempted to talk to me when he saw me having an issue w management while ordering from the bar. Bc he’d already ignored me when he asked me what was going on I responded “oh, you can hear me now?” Why’d I say that?! lol Why was I upset about being ignored over something so small? That one question ensured there was no more communication for the rest of the night! We went to his birthday dinner in silence, ate in silence, and left in silence! \nOnce we got back to the resort I went to the bar (after not wanting to be quiet/weird in the room), made friends, got drunk, and had fun singing drunk bar songs. \nThe next morning we woke up in silence and my bf left. Once I made it downstairs and ate, I realized he’d left and gone to the beach. All I could think was “wow, having sex w other women is really this important to him?” Like we’re literally on a bday trip to celebrate you and that’s not enough? I should’ve had women on call each night for him to appreciate me or the trip. Well the trip, not me I guess lol. Anyway, I saw all the ppl I met the night before and hung out w them the rest of the day. \nThe next day, silence again lol. I woke up, went to breakfast, and spent the day at the pool. Around 1pm, the fun started! Under the guise of “what time do we leave tomorrow” came the insults and anger he’d been holding in. In short, I’m just a “fun girl”, I’ve had threesomes before (college) but don’t want to have fun w him now that it’s his turn, and he’s glad he got a free birthday trip outta me. (My bday is in less than a month and I thought we were doing something but we’re not :)) “What man doesn’t wanna fuck other women?!” He shouted at me once I confronted in the room after enough texting. Lol i was stunned, hurt, and angry all at the same time!! He also said that I was upset which is why he began ignoring me in the first place and I truly wasn’t! Like I was honestly just asking what don’t I do and it turned into this. We’ve discussed this many times and I’ve said I’ll have a threesome w him but that’s not something I want to consistently do or be involved in a relationship w another woman. It’s like I’m being punished for being honest about things I’ve done in the past and am being held to that. My past literally doesn’t define me! \nHe also pointed out that as an adult, I should’ve opened my mouth and started a conversation at any point if I felt ignored….\nNow it’s my fault I was ignored for 2 days…cool….\n\nAfter he got all that out the next day was fine. He woke up attempting to make conversation, asked me to breakfast, and so on…as usual after an argument. No apologies, ro resolution, just move on. It’s 2 days later and I can’t sleep bc I’m bothered. I feel unappreciated, he already says I don’t do enough but I understand now what he means. Me waking up to make him breakfast before work @5a, packing his lunch, making sure he has dinner, and making sure he has whatever he needs in life means nothing if he doesn’t have other women to share it with. Lol… \n\nTL; DR If I agree to I guess an open relationship or threesomes often will he actually like me more? I’ve been asking to go on dates, to feel special, for him to want to do anything for me to make me happy…is this what makes relationships “stronger”? If I do what he wants, will he do what I want? I feel so stupid when I know the answer is he just doesn’t want me in general and I keep trying to make it happen…”that’s so fetch” of me lol\n\n\n",

To give people some background my wife(26f) and I \n(28m) have been together 11 years and have been married for one. I have been a gambling addict for the last 12 years, I have managed to stay clear of it for periods up to at most a year. I recently relapsed and had attempted to cover it up, I was then found out. \nThere was very little financial damage done on this occasion, I accept I am totally in the wrong and I should not have let the guilt rule me into thinking I’m protecting people not telling them.\nSince then I left the house to give her some space at her request. I have put up no fight on this at all and have helped with everything and anything asked.\n\nMy words mean little but I intend on putting more than I ever have before into recovery, I will show this and should I not, I accept the decision from her may be that the relationship is over and I take full responsibility. I’ve attended ga 5 meetings this week and intend to attend 50 in the next 90 days. I’m putting in the work to improve my physical health and I intend to see a therapist.  \n\nNow here comes the part where I need advice, I want to give her space but I also don’t want the only things she hears about me to be her friends telling her to leave me. The majority of our relationship is amazing , we love each other so much and there are so many good things that come from it. It’s just this one thing I have been battling with for a while now.

        "content": "I’m 29F, and my husband is 30M.\n\nLately, I’ve been reflecting on the idea that men are supposed to be the \"leaders\" in a relationship—the ones who guide, protect, and make bold decisions when things get tough. This thought came to me because, in movies and TV shows, husbands are often portrayed as smarter than their wives, better at managing finances, naturally earning more, and serving as a source of motivation and advice.  \n\nIn my reality, though, my husband and I feel like equals. We are both equally smart, we both earn above the average, and in some areas, I feel I’m even better equipped—for example, with finances, since my parents are entrepreneurs, and I go to them for advice. On the other hand, my husband is great at cooking and fixing things around the house. However he has no drive to start a business, make more money, or climb the corporate ladder into management because he simply doesn’t like leadership roles.  \n\nFor me, this is completely fine. We do everything 50/50, and I identify as a feminist, so our relationship feels fair and balanced. But I can’t help but wonder—am I questioning this only because I’ve been subconsciously influenced by movies and societal expectations? Have we all been conditioned to see men as natural providers and leaders, even when reality is far more nuanced?  \n\nCurious to hear your thoughts! Do you believe men *should* naturally take on a leadership role in a relationship, or is this just an outdated (or even fictional) expectation?\n\n**TL;DR:** Movies often depict men as leaders, protectors, and primary providers in relationships, but real-life dynamics are often more balanced. Have we been conditioned to expect men to take on this role, or is it an outdated idea? Should leadership in a relationship depend on personality rather than gender?",

(genuinely, how do you say this?) i wont date a good looking guy just because he says hi to me and for some reason people my age find that very crazy, even crazier when i say that just because they have a good personality also doesnt make you automatically date them (you also have to take views, interests, and how ur personalities mesh together into account).\n\n  \nanyways enough yap. i just miss the security of being able to just ask my bf to hang out and what not. and just like kiss and do other teenage things. idk, i feel like its normal to not want to be extremely and unheathily attached to someone at my age. i'm literally 15. \n\n  \nTLDR: I need advice on communicating what I actually want in a relationship.",

We attend foreign language courses together. There is a girl sitting in front of us on the course who is incredibly friendly to us. (My boyfriend emphasises that she is just nice to everyone).

        "content": "Hi people,\n\nI dumped my ex 18 days ago after a relationship that lasted a bit over a year. The main reason was we were arguing almost weekly which drained my energy and our last argument ended up with her saying “You’re not my fucking babe, stop calling me that” in caps log in the chat. It hurt me a lot and I impulsively called her and ended it. Sometimes - I felt like no matter what I would do there would always be an argument, felt not good enough at times.\n\nBut after thinking about it there were other reasons at play: 1. She comes from a difficult family and she doesn’t think that her father will allow her to marry me 2. I am moving to another country in about 15 months - and I’m moving away for medical rotations for 3 months in end of June, and doubts she would be willing to follow me.3. Needed to focus on my studies, and arguments drained me and disrupted my studies.\n\nStill, I felt empty and without a purpose for most of the time in those 18 days. The relationship ended well though - with both of us thanking the other for the time we spent together and that we will never forget the moments we shared regardless of the arguments, and we both told the other that if they needed to talk we could call each other (although we blocked each other on all other apps).\n\nYesterday night - she called me asking how I was, crying and said how sorry she was for the way she acted during these arguments - said she doesn’t know why they happened and that she never intended for this. I told her the truth - that I also miss her and think about her at least 10 times a day. But I told her that even if we get past this - we still can’t guarantee that her dad will accept me, and she said it would be “almost impossible”. She highlighted how it was so nice to hear my voice, how she misses all the memories we share, and indirectly hinted at us getting back together, even though she could not find a solution for our future, which made her miserable. I said that I do not want to put her in a position where she should choose between me and her family, as I don’t believe its fair on her. \n\nMy rational side says that this will most likely lead to nothing, I also need to focus taking the most important exam of my life (taking Step 2 for those who know) which I can’t do if I keep getting drained by the arguments (if they reoccur). Also - the fact I know it will end might make it even more sad in the future, especially since after 18 days, I might be starting to heal a little.\n\nOn the other hand, my heart misses everything about her - her touch, her smile, her love, and says that it is stupid to end something because of uncertainty about the future. Perhaps it might make her more grateful and she will be more understanding about my work obligations, and the arguments will decrease because now we know how miserable we are without each other. Maybe just enjoy it while you can - maybe she will manage to convince her father or move out with me- if life decides you need to go your separate ways then do it when the time comes. \n\nWhat should I do: should I 1)let it go and keep trying to heal no matter how hard 2)Take her back and let life decide our fate 3) Agree with her that this will not lead to anything - but still enjoy our remaining time?\n\nTd;lr: Should I take back my ex when I miss her like crazy, even though there is no future due to her parents probably not allowing her to marry me? ",

I had to get to bed (2am shift), so I just apologized and hoped she would understand.\n\nIt has now been 3 days, and I've gotten two one-word texts out of her (we live together). She's taking extra shifts in the evening to avoid coming home when I'm awake, and won't kiss me goodbye when I leave for work in the morning (currently writing this in the parking lot).\n\nShe tries to be understanding of mental health and all that, but I feel like ED just isn't an excuse anymore, nor is \"I'm in a bad depression slump and can't shut my head up for long enough to be intimate\". Now I can't get so much as a \"good morning\" or \"I love you too\" back. \n\nI feel like if I pop some boner pill or something dumb and try to \"make it up to her\", that's just going to make her more upset (\"So you could have done this the whole time\").

She assured me she wouldn’t talk to him again, and I believed her.\n\nThen in May 2024, I discovered she had been cheating on me for a whole year with her office colleague (who is three years older than her). The way I found out was crazy—he somehow tracked our location and showed up at an Oyo room where we were staying. What hurt me even more was that she apologized to him the next day instead of me. That was my breaking point, and I immediately blocked her.\n\nA week later, she came back crying, saying she wanted to fix things with me. I was confused, but after a month, she changed her mind and tried to fix things with him instead. Then, a few days later, she returned to me once again, saying she finally wanted to be with me.\n\nWe have been back together since September 2024, but my family doesn’t like her, and for the past 2-3 months, we have been arguing a lot. She constantly complains that I don’t give her enough time, but being an advocate, it’s difficult for me to talk for 2-3 hours daily.\n\nNow, I find myself questioning everything. Did I make the right choice by giving her a second chance? Can trust ever be rebuilt after such a betrayal? Is it worth it when my career and family are being affected?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.\n\nTL;DR: Been with my GF since 2021. She cheated on me for a year with a coworker. I found out in May 2024, broke up, but she kept coming back. We reconciled in September, but my family dislikes her, and we fight a lot. She says I don’t give her enough time, but my job as an advocate keeps me busy. I now question whether giving her a second chance was the right decision.\n\n#RelationshipAdvice #Cheating #TrustIssues #SecondChance #LoveOrMistake #CareerVsRelationship #AdviceNeeded",

Obv we've made out and stuff and I've gone down on him too.\n\nRecently, the topic came up about going down on me, and he said and I quote \"yk I feel like I'm not mature enough yet\" and obv I say that I understand, I get it really. And like I am myself not very comfortable w showing him everything yet. \n\nBut when he said u out loud like he didn't wanna do it, it made me feel a little disgusted by myself that I am doing it. Now it's not his fault ik, he's never forced me to do anything and I'm doing it out of my own will but still now I'm overthinking it. \n\nI hope y'all understand why I'm feeling this way :') I wondered if I should stop doing it to him maybe out of spite but then I kinda like it so it would be a lose lose situation for me ig😭\n\n",

        "content": "We have been together almost a year and there has been a consistent communication pattern of hot and cold from him. \nIn our first three months, there was so much affection and then things changed fast.\nHe started being late a lot, harder to communicate with over text (didn’t like calls, lives in another town), and only has time to see each other on his schedule.\nWhen I asked him why the affection was so different, he said it was normal for a man to put forth more effort in the beginning than they intended to in the relationship. He wouldn’t hear my side on how I thought that was love bombing, and I adapted to the difference because when we did have time together he was present and usually kind. \nHe suggested that we start the steps of moving in together, and after we started a good pattern of staying together 4 nights a week, he suddenly became bitter and said he needed space because he was a “private person” with no further explanation. I was working 50 hours a week, we didn’t see each other till 7pm (for reference).\nFor about two months, he wouldn’t be interested in sex unless I was about to travel for work or had something important coming up. He told me that the reason he wasn’t interested in sex was because he watched porn… everyday. He was offended when I asked him to slow down on that and save some of that energy for us.\nThe up and down has me confused on if this is a lack of effort thing or if he’s probably keeping way more secrets than you should in a monogamous relationship.\nLastly, In the last couple months, any time I try to have a mature conversation about how different he is now versus then, he blames me. Without examples he says that I make him miserable, the things he does to support me make him feel like shit for a week (giving me a ride early to the airport; once) and doesn’t seem to see my side at all. \nWhere am I dropping the ball here?\n\nTLDR: my bf either is addicted to porn or he doesn’t have the ability to be emotionally vulnerable about how to make him happy.

We have been together for 2 years straight now, but things haven't gone well. After we initially broke up, things haven't been the same. I've been less sexually attracted by her. Things started to get monotonous and boring.\n\nWe are long distance, and we meet once every two weeks on average (plus we spend summer together). However, lately I've been feeling very strong anxiety at the mere idea of having sex with her. I'm not into her anymore. I tried to wait, because I thought it was just a period, but it's been so many months now. Every time I have to meet her, I feel depresses. When the weekend is over I feel relieved.\n\nI don't feel like planning vacations with her. I avoid intimacy because I don't feel like having sex.\n\nWe are very different, we have different goals and ambitions. Yet, she loves so much (way more than I do). She's always been extremely gentle with me, but I don't feel the same way.\n\nI'm afraid I might regret not having put enough effort in this, but the fact that I'm not physically attracted by her anymore makes things way harder (I'm going to a psychologist for this problem but things didn't change).\n\nI'm afraid I might never find someone who loves me as much as she does, but the relationship feels boring and I think she deserves to be with someone who WANTS to give her what she deserves.\n\nWhat do you think? Can this be fixed?\n\nI see people saying that grass is greener if you water it. Could I really fix this? Could I really push myself to like her? Could the sexual attraction be rebuilt after two years of such lows?\n\nTL;DR: can you save a relationship if you don't find your partner sexually attractive anymore? ",

A month before we started dating, they had hooked up and because of this, I told her how I felt about it and I said that it is inappropriate to maintain that friendship where they still text almost everyday, out of respect for me and the relationship. Now, when they ran into each other, she said that she is now friends again with him and they had even started talking on social media again behind my back. \n\n\nDuring this conversation, I had brought up my feelings about her feeling distant and that I feel like I put in more effort than she does in this relationship. I made it clear that I am willing to be open and communicate to make this relationship work. However that incident made me feel disrespected because she knew it was something I was not comfortable with, but I also feel bad because she actually does not have friends. \n\nI feel like I am not prioritized in my relationship and her views on being friends with past flings do not align with mine.

        "content": "Me and my gf have been in a long distance relationship for over one and a half years now. I am a lesbian and she is bisexual.\nAbout a year ago she has met her current best friend and they have become extremely close since.\nBecause of being in an LDR we only meet each other every couple of months for about a weekend, but we text almost daily. Because of mental health reasons I dont want to get further into, the most amount of physical intimacy we have is cuddling and sometimes a kiss on the cheek, not even on the lips. She has never told me that she wants \"more\" in that regard and seems fine with my boundaries, although she did say she wished we could cuddle/see each other more often.\n\nNow about them: The meet each other atleast once a week and are also platonically intimate with each other. Something that I was ok with initially because we also did that before our relationship started. I know she is a very physical person and I am fine with her getting that intimacy from other people when she cant be with me.\nHowever the extent of their intimacy is starting to get me worried.\nThey cuddle, she sits in his lap, they hold hands, he even gives her forehead kisses. At one point she directly told me that he was her type, and apparently he even confessed to her that he has a crush on her, but she told him thats she's already in a relationship and he is allegedly ok with just being friends. She also does this with none of her other friends.\n\nNow, I dont know everything about their dynamic, but the relationship between us has admittedly been pretty strained for a while. I have mental health issues im in therapy for, chronic illnesses that require lifelong medical care (although I am largely independent in my daily life), I have low self esteem and often tell her how I think I dont deserve her, we get into more and more fights as the relationship goes on, I sometimes lash out at her while Im emotional leading to awkward apologies.\n\nI honestly kind of want her to leave me over him, that she finds someone better than me she can be happy with so I dont drag her down, but she keeps saying how they are just friends and she has never once expressed being unhappy in our relationship.\n\nSo, do you think this is all just a fabrication of my insecurities or is there really something more going on with them?\nI love her and want to keep her and want to trust her. The fact that she is so open with everything about him makes me believe she isnt cheating on me, because If she did why not keep it secret? But also, isnt this going way to far for a regular friendship? She even told me she would stop everything intimate with him immediately If it bothered me, but it feels unfair to take that away from her If we see each other so rarely.\n\nTLDR:\nMy LDR gf shares the same level of intimacy with her best friend as she does with me. She assures me everything with him is just platonic. Am I just insecure or is there more going on?\n\n",

I (21F) have recently met this guy in my degree (25M), and while we’ve only spoken a couple of times, we seem to get along well and I find him pretty attractive. Thing is, we’re part of different friend groups, and we haven’t spoken to each other enough to be considered “friends” as opposed to acquaintances. Regardless, I’ve noticed that we tend to make a lot of regular eye contact whenever we’re in the same class, and several of my friends have told me he will look at me and smile to himself while I’m not looking. Bottom line is that there’s a big chance he’s interested in me too.\n\nI just don’t know where to go from here. All but one of my past relationships started similarly — where there was obvious attraction right off the bat, but they ALWAYS went too fast and the relationships failed. It was like the “friendship” stage was always skipped over because the chemistry would be too great by then, thus it wasn’t considered necessary, but it’s honestly a stage that is so vital to a long-lasting relationship. \n\nI don’t want the same thing to happen here. My most successful relationship was a true friends-to-lovers but it only worked because we only really started liking each other several months into our friendship. It feels like me and this guy lowkey already have chemistry (not just from the eye contact, but when we did talk), but I don’t want it to just be another burning flash! Idk I guess I need tips on how to subdue the chem long enough so that a genuine friendship can grow?\n\nTL;DR: don’t want to screw up a potential relationship by taking things too fast.",

        "content": "My boyfriend (20) and I (21) met each other in February of 2024. At this time in my life I was living with my mom.  We met at a skating rink while I was there with my mom and younger brother. We met because my friend who is a female (19) introduced us. I had met this friend a few months before she introduced me to my now boyfriend. This friend knew my now boyfriend for a year before introducing us. When I met him, he was very interested in me really fast and asked for my number the same day we met. We talked pretty much the entire session of 3 hours of skating. I had never been in a relationship before and was a virgin. I was very nervous about the idea of a romantic relationship and I could tell that he really did like me. He started texting me good morning every single morning after we met. Our female friend who introduced us later told me that she did mean for us to meet to be a \"matchmaker\", she did tell my now boyfriend her intentions of wanting us to date before she introduced us but she didn't tell me. I was made to feel like coincidentally he was there with her at the same time I was. I didn't know at the time that I was being a part of a matchmaking. I wasn't ready for a relationship I thought at the time. Over time me, my now boyfriend and our female friend would all hangout together every so often, but then he started to just spend time alone with me. Our female friend would tell me things like \"over the past year I've known him he's always been respectful towards me\". and that he was a \"good guy\". She would also talk to me about not letting the fact that I hadn't been in a relationship before scare me from being with him. As time went on we spent more and more time together.\n\nWe stared dating 2 months after we met. He asked me to be his girlfriend.\n\n   While my now boyfriend and I started to spend more and more time together, my mom would every single time I came back home from hanging out with him tell me that he was not good for me and he's the wrong guy. To this day she says that he picked me because he sees me as naïve and able to be manipulated. She calls him things like arrogant, controlling, egotistical, full of himself, and a manipulator.\n\n1. She brings up that she doesn't remember him saying hi to her when we first met, (he says he did).\n\n2.  She brings up a time when I told her that I was with him and I started having slight period cramps and he offered me Tylenol, and I said I didn't wanna take it because the pain isn't enough to make me wanna take pain relief pills and he said (while trying to help me take pills because I don't like taking pills). \"I know you need these because you are in pain I know you just don't like taking pills, if you don't take them in 10 seconds I'm going in the other room and you won't see me for the rest of the night\". I didn't take the pills, so he proceeded to go into the other room and leave me in there all night and not see me.\n\nThere's other things she brings up about him like how he is the type of person to like attention from lots of girls and he goes to the gym a lot because he's shallow and egotistical, and need someone who he thought he could manipulate and control. She says that's why he picked me. She says she can read him, and he is a lot like guys she has seen in her past relationships. She likes to say that I was love bombed in the beginning, and that eventually he's gonna get bored with me, not because of me but because of the type of person she thinks he is.\n\nFast forward to now, over time my mom and I would have arguments about how she thinks I deserve better and that I don't see that I'm being manipulated and tricked because I'm sweet and trusting, and I'm blinded by things like \"how cute I think he is\".  She says she's trying to protect me.\n\nWe would argue so much over the moths that sometimes when I would see my boyfriend I would be very emotionally upset, or just randomly get upset at the fact that I have this tug of war going on. So, my boyfriend who is living with his mother suggested that I move in with him in his mom's house in October 2024.\n\nWhen he suggested it the first couple of times, I was hesitant and would say \"no not right now\". But as time went on and him more consistently seeing me be more upset by my mom's and I conversations, he pushed for it more. I honestly felt a bit of a vibe coming from him like a \"you need to move out of her house or I can't be a part of your life\". It wasn't an aggressive vibe, but I could tell that he wanted me to a lot.\n\nSo, I moved out of my moms house because he would talk to me and be like \"I see you upset so much that it's upsetting me and getting to be a lot for me to see you upset like this over your mom not trusting you, so I think it would be best for you to not to  constantly be around that.\"\n\nSo now, the problem I'm having is\n\n1. My boyfriend said that I can see my mom in person as long as he's with me to protect me and we can leave together if my mom starts talking about it again.\n\n2. my mom is ok with seeing me by myself, without him there. She says she does not ever want to be around him. \n\nI said that I wanted to see my mom by myself because that's the only way I can see her right now because of what she said, and my boyfriend told me \"If you see her without me there, or you move back in with her, we are going to have to breakup and you move out of my mom's house so that I'm not something your mom can argue with you about and hurt you.\n\nSo pretty much I'm feeling like\n\noption 1. I can't ever see my mom again in person unless she changes her mind about him.\n\noption 2. We would have to break up so I can see my mom\n\nI am absolutely devastated to be in this position because my mom and I were really close and I know she really does care about me, but I also can't stand to think about my boyfriend and I having to break up because we have become so close. I am devastated everyday I can't see my mom. I was so upset when my boyfriend told me that if I see her without him there we would have to break up. When he told me that, he also made it very clear to me that the whole situation with my mom was making his mental state decline and it started making him depressed to see me so upset all the time, over accusations about him that he feels \"aren't true\".\n\nWhat should I do? If anyone has any advice I'd be really thankful. This is a lot for me.\n\n    ---\n    \n    **TL;DR;** : This is a sample summary of the TLDR rule, just copy the text in gray box.

        "content": "So there’s this girl in class I like and I've known her for like 5 months now. I take the same train home as her everyday, but she’s always with her friend so I don’t try to force myself into a conversation and don’t go out of my way to sit next to them to give space to her and her friend. I’ve sat and talked with them on the train a handful of times but I don’t want to overdo it because I don’t want to bother them.\nShe’s friendly with me and there are quite a lot of moments in class where I interact with her, it’s not like I can’t approach her, she probably knows me better than most boys in class.\n\nAnyway to get to the point, today i was waiting for the train on a bench when they get seated across of me, in a way that we face each other. I say hi, she says hi, but I don’t try to start a conversation and immediately after just scroll on my phone because she was also talking to her friend.\n\nThe train arrives and they leave without really looking at me or saying bye, this is unusual since the last few days we actively interact with each other when we happen to see each other before the train arrives, we just hop on together because it would be weird otherwise. I think it’s worth mentioning her friend was sick the other day and me and this girl had a pretty good conversation about school and traveling with just the two of us, her always being with her friend makes it hard for me to judge if I can approach or not.\n\nI wonder if maybe I was too distant and should have just started a conversation? I literally only said hi and I feel like I made it awkward because of that, maybe they didn’t bother saying bye or didn’t acknowledge me after because I was in my phone, idk\n\nIt kinda left a sour taste in my mouth because I had a lot of good interactions with her these past few days so I’m wondering what you guys think\n\nTLDR; I think I was too distant to this girl I like and I am afraid that made for a awkward interaction where she now thinks I’m weird or something",

        "content": "I (31F) have been struggling with my partner's (M36) relationship with a woman he has a sexual history with.\n\nFor context, I struggle with social media. While I've never gone through my partner's phone, I've noticed that there will often be women in his DMs when he's showing me something. Once, I noticed someone's name I didn't recognize whose profile picture was very thirst-trappy. I asked him about her and he told me she was an old friend. I asked how they met and he told me they met on Tinder, but they've hung out before in non-sexual contexts. In her picture, she looked very young (like early 20s). I asked more questions and found out that they had a hook-up situation over the course of a couple years. I asked what she was messaging him about and he told me she reached out to him at 6am asking if she could ask him something, but ended up not asking him. Feeling increasingly uncomfortable by the fact that he kept leaving out facts until I asked specifically for more information, I asked if I could see the messages. He was very cagey with his phone and held the phone up, clearly hiding something above those messages. I noted that he was clearly trying to hide something by the way he was holding his phone and he told me I wouldn't like what was there. Allegedly, right after we became exclusive, she told him she was going to be in town and asked if he wanted to meet up. He initially said yes and they started to plan a time to make it happen. In the end, he backed out and said he actually just started seeing someone and that they shouldn't meet up. A few days later I couldn't shake the fact that he was lying about the messages he was hiding so I asked to see them. He told me he deleted them because they made him feel icky.\n\nWe got into a huge argument over this. I was upset that it took him so long to tell me the truth about her and I was also distraught that this woman he almost cheated on me with was still messaging him. After a lot of back and forth, he said he wouldn't talk to her anymore and that if she messaged him again, he'd show me. Fast-forward a few weeks and she sent him a DM with - likely - NSFW photos. She said, \"I'm not sure if you still have a girlfriend, but if not, feel free to look at these\" or something like that. The photos had to be opened on instagram and he swears he did not open them. He said he deleted her messages and said, \"I have a girlfriend - not looking!\". We got into another argument about this because I wished he would have been more clear with her, insisting that she not contact him further and at the very least, unfollow her. He did unfollow her after I asked. The thing I always come back to is my partner really understands transgressions to be blatant inappropriate activity (sexting, overt flirting, meeting up secretly). For example, he understands almost meeting up with her was wrong, but until she sent him inappropriate photos, didn't see anything wrong with maintaining contact as long as nothing else inappropriate happened. She could still reach out about anything unrelated to sex and he'd respond to her. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the lengthy start of setting the stage, but since that point almost a year ago, I have had a lot of anxiety about instagram and his DMs. I've noticed there was one woman who sometimes commented on his posts and liked every single photo he posted *except* the one photo of us on his grid. I noticed her in his DMs a few times before asking about her. Again, I was met with the, \"she's an old friend\" explanation and after asking more follow-up questions, found out that they had hooked up a few times over the course of several years. From my understanding, they went on a date when they first met, but he entered a long term relationship for several years. They'd run into each other on occasion, but were never close friends. She lives in a city a few hours away and he says they haven't seen each other in person for 4-5 years, but I did confirm that they hooked up the last time they saw each other. He said after that (during covid) they started keeping in touch more on instagram. I haven't looked through their messages, but the frequency in which I noticed her in his DMs leads me to believe they're messaging each other often. He said their conversation is mostly just them reacting to stories they respectively post. I let him know I was uncomfortable with this, especially because he seldom posts me on his social media. He maintains that they're just instagram friends and nothing they talk about is inappropriate. He said she thinks he's cool and funny and that he thinks she's cool and funny and it's nice to get attention from someone who you think highly of. He's been very clear that he's not going to adjust the nature of their communication just because I'm uncomfortable because he maintains hasn't done anything wrong.\n\nI'm not opposed with being friends with someone of the opposite sex or even someone you have a past with. Fwiw, my partner maintains contact with other people he has a past with and for some reason, the nature of those relationships don't bother me. I think it's because the communication seems to be less frequent. \n\nI maintain contact with several of my exes and sometimes will get a DM here and there from someone I've hooked up with in the past. However, I feel like I'm very clear with my exes that I'm in a relationship and have set boundaries or ceased communication with people who I feel don't respect that. I feel like I'm a good judge of people's intentions and the nature of relationships and pivot when I feel like anything is approaching the point of disrespecting my relationship. Additionally, I often post him on my stories so anyone following me is aware I'm in a relationship. \n\nAgain, he's stated that he's unwilling to change anything about their friendship and has liked photos of hers since our conversation. He's even told me that me raising the issue is upsetting to him because he doesn't think of her like that and it makes him feel gross to have to question himself and their friendship. I still find myself bothered by their relationship and can't shake the feeling of unease anytime I see her name. I feel like if I could see the messages, I would have some sense of relief, but I don't like that level of monitoring in relationships and don't want to stoop to that every time I feel uncomfortable. I've expressed my discomfort to him and he's sympathetic my discomfort, but feels strongly that cutting people off just because of my discomfort is a road he doesn't want to go down because it feels like control. \n\n**How can I work through my discomfort and rebuild trust in my relationship, given that my partner is unwilling to change how he interacts with this woman? What are some practical steps I can take to feel more secure? I'm also interested in communication strategies to better talk to him about this issue, but I fear that I've exhausted every approach.** \n\nTLDR: my partner is frequently messaging with someone he used to hook up with and I need advice shifting my mindset.

About an hour in after a few drinks I walk off by myself to dance with a bit more space. I notice this girl looking at me a few times and talking to her friend, then the friend comes over to me and says \"my friend here thinks you're really cute\". So I approached her and we got along really well and talked for about an hour, everything just flowed great and we really clicked. We then start dancing together after a few more drinks and eventually make out for around 3-4 hours until she needed to leave. We exchanged instagrams and as she's walking away she says \"text me!\".\n\nI wake up the next morning to 4 likes on some really old instagram posts. Obviously at this point I'm thinking she's really into me, so I sent her a message, nothing crazy just saying that I had a lot of fun with her and asking how she's doing. And no response.\n\nWhat do you all think happened? was there something I did wrong? Was she never really into me to begin with, just wanted someone to kiss that night? It doesn't make sense to me - she made the first move, we had great conversations, she asked for my instagram and for me to message her, and even went deep through my social media. I get we were both fairly drunk (nowhere near wasted though, able to type fairly coherently and walk without issue. I also only saw her have 1 drink in the 4 hours we were together), but still it's not adding up for me. I cannot get her out of my head, this was the first real connection I've had with a girl that didn't feel forced. I'm really hoping for some advice here from some people with experience, because honestly it's killing me.\n\nTIA!!\n\nTLDR: after 3 hours of making out and talking to a girl in a nightclub is ignoring my DM I sent the day after.

I am nervous about the change but I couldn’t help but feel more excited about potentially meeting new people. I have been stuck in a routine and life felt so mundane for a long time. I did meet some future classmates and one of them I really enjoyed talking to. On the outside, he is more my type than my boyfriend and we have very similar interests. I have been talking to him consistently as a friend but I think the conversations turn into flirting sometimes. I don’t necessarily want to date him but it’s fun to just talk to someone new. I think I miss being desired and want more excitement in my life. I am worried that I am choosing chaos because of my past trauma and giving up on this comfortable love I had for years. My relationship is far from perfect. I think my trust has been broken years ago but I chose to stay because it was easier to just forgive. My bf is working on it and has been trying to gain my full trust back again. Is this new connection another sign that it’s time to move on? Or is this my anxiety overthinking and wanting more stimulation while my relationship is perfectly normal and reached a natural plateau? \n\nTldr: am I self sabotaging my relationship if I start to crave attention from someone new \n\n",

        "content": "I (32F) have been dating my boyfriend (29M) for 9 months. I am naturally petite and skinny, I always have been. My boyfriend has never pointed out my weight even tho I’ve gained weight since meeting him. All he’s ever said are comments about how much he likes my body or certain parts of my body, how pretty I am etc. \n\nRecently I’ve been noticing that he’s always pointed out others weight (M/F) like saying how much they’ve lost or how much they’ve gained. For context - he loves working out, and has lost over 160lbs. He was overweight for most of his life before I met him and shared that his ex wife had commented on his weight that she wasn’t attracted to him anymore, which is why he started his healthy journey.\n\nThe other day, he was saying that he likes women who aren’t overweight. That he’s simply not attracted to them. That a girl he was seeing he wasn’t as physically attracted to her because she wasn’t his type. I asked for context and she said physically (he dated her after he lost all the weight and his ex wife asked him for a divorce. ) That he usually goes for athletic people. I spiraled into overthinking and started asking a lot of questions. I asked what if I get pregnant and gain weight and can’t lose it? He said that’s “different” that he loves me and will love me in any form that it was situational because he didn’t like her personality so he at the time was making any excuse to leave.\n\nI most likely will stay this size most of my life and will fluctuate 10/15 pounds. Even tho technically this doesn’t affect me it makes me deeply uncomfortable. It feels judgmental. I expressed that to him but he was clear that isn’t not that he just had a preference because he’s active and it’s just what he’s attracted to and doesn’t understand why that’s bad. I honestly don’t know if I think it’s bullshit or a deal breaker for me. I don’t necessarily know how to approach this or if I’m with the wrong person. I just feel bad for all the people who are judged for their weight, and need advice on what to do or if I’m over reacting? \n\nTL;DR : I (32F) have been dating my boyfriend (29M) for 9 months. He’s always been complimentary about my body, but I’ve noticed he frequently comments on others’ weight (gain/loss). He’s lost 160lbs and prefers athletic/non-overweight partners, which he’s openly shared. When I asked how he’d feel if I gained weight (e.g., during pregnancy), he said it’s “different” because he loves me. Still, his comments feel judgmental and make me uncomfortable, especially since I’ve gained some weight since we met. I’m torn on whether this is a red flag or just a preference. Am I overreacting, or is this a dealbreaker?  ",

(mind you they were together for 5 years) and i think they’ve been broken up for 1-2 years. so he said she’s considered a family friend atp bc she’s neighbors with his family and she’s just very very close with his family. idk sometimes ill go on fb and see that they’re friends and see that she still has their pictures up on fb (obviously i can’t do anything about it) but it reminds me that they’re still in contact. this doesn’t bother me a ton like it’s genuinely not a big deal and it’s not that i don’t trust him it’s that i don’t particularly like it. like with all relationships i’ve had a rule for myself and the person i’m with that there’s zero contact with exes. recently she reached out to him and he responded. it was about something completely innocent. basically 6 years ago when they were together he won her a goldfish at a fair and she texted him saying it finally died. and he was basically like “that’s sad i can’t believe it lived that long”. like that’s fine that she’s a family friend like whatever but i feel away about them still texting. like idc if you guys are following each other on socials (i mean a bit im not gonna die) and i understand like his family is close with her like totally get it. but idk about them still TALKING. okay so what im asking for is: in general is it normal to be in contact with your ex while in a relationship? part of me wants to bring it up but not sure how, i don’t want to sound controlling or rude. i’m scared he’ll think i’m being too much. \n\ntl;dr -my bf is still in contact with his ex and im somewhat bothered and im not sure how to bring this up to him in a healthy manner.

        "content": "I work in cybersecurity. Security is about understanding risks and testing vulnerabilities. That’s what I do. I run security assessments, including social engineering simulations, to ensure people—especially those close to me—are resilient to deception. It’s a practical, real-world approach. If you don’t test, you don’t learn.\n\nMy wife (together for 6 years, married for 2) has been my primary test subject for years. It makes sense—she’s my closest attack surface. I’ve phished her, spoofed calls to her work, and installed (harmless) malware on her computer. She has gotten better at spotting these things, which is proof that my methods work. Usually, she tolerates it. Sometimes, she even laughs.\n\nThis time, for reasons I do not fully understand, she did not.\n\nI read an article about a now-patched PayPal scam where attackers used Gmail forwarding rules to make scam emails look legitimate. Basic attack vector, nothing revolutionary. But it gave me an idea: how blindly do people trust input fields? How much do they think before submitting?\n\nSo I created a test page: *“Top Things My Wife Does That Annoy Me”*—a harmless exercise. It had a few lighthearted bullet points, such as \"Promised to make tacos but instead prepared emergency rations.\" At the bottom was a form:\n\n“Put your dirtiest secret here!!!”\n\nAt this stage, a rational person should pause and ask: Where does this go? She did not ask. She typed.\n\nFor maximum educational impact, I configured the form to email the submission—to me. Then, because I wanted to illustrate how easily information can be redirected, I set up an auto-forward—to her mother’s email. It was supposed to be a mild, controlled demonstration. It clearly demonstrated how the information could leak and appear authoritative. I even stamped it with \"Sandra sent you a message!\"\n\nThen I saw the submission:\n\n&gt;I loved how at Christmas I was feeling you under the dinner table and I just got hornier and &gt;hornier and you took me upstairs and ravaged me. Quiet anal while my family was downstairs &gt;was super hot.\n\nI laughed. A lot. It was objectively funny. Also, she should have known better. Who submits something like that without verifying where it’s going? (We argued about this, the form never specified it was going to me). I thought she’d see the humor. I explained that it was a basic awareness test. I even walked her through the technical process.\n\nShe did not find this illuminating.\n\nThat was 48 hours ago. She has not come home from her mother’s. I have attempted multiple explanations—rational ones, outlining the key security takeaways—but they have not been acknowledged. My messages remain unread.\n\nI am currently drinking a West Coast Cooler (which is not great) and discussing this with an old high school friend who came over to help. My wife's brother has text me and called me a fucking idiot and said if he ever sees me again he will fight me. I practice jiu jitsu, so I should be fine.\n\nThe test was valid. The reaction is disproportionate. I feel like she should be aware of this by now, given all the prior tests.\n\nDid she overreact? Was I out of line? I'm leaning towards this being a normal part of our shenanigans but her family don't seem to agree.\n\n**TL;DR I accidentally auto-forwarded intimate details of our sex life to my mother in law while I was security testing my wife**",

But then it kept happening. In the hallway. At the gym. Even at the grocery store, where I ran into her for the first time in months.  \n\nEvery time, she’d look away quickly, like she hadn’t meant to get caught. But I *knew*. And it was driving me crazy.  \n\nWhy was she looking at me? Did she miss me? Was she plotting something? Did she hate me? Did she *not* hate me?  \n\nI spent weeks overanalyzing every glance, every awkward half-smile, every time she lingered a little too long near my locker.

They’re about the memories we shared, the bond we lost, and the questions we’re both too scared to ask.  \n\nWhat do you think my ex-friend’s (26F) lingering glances mean? Has anyone experienced something similar with an ex-friend or someone you’ve grown apart from?  \n\nTL;DR \nMy ex-best friend (26F) and I (25F) were inseparable for 8 years before growing apart.

I’m Latin American, and she’s Latina from South America, so we have some cultural differences. I’m wondering if I’m just a sensitive American, unintentionally sabotaging an otherwise great relationship.\n\nHere are a few things she’s said that have bothered me, followed by her usual response: “I’m ALWAYS joking. I LOVE you. You know how I feel about you. Don’t assume what I mean by what I say.”\n\n* After playing tennis for about an hour, I said, “Wow, I feel that in my legs already.” She responded, “We didn’t even play an hour.” When I asked about it, she said it was just a joke. And \n* She asked how I knew a song from her country so well. I said through an older artist (embarrassingly, because of my parents), and she agreed, “That is embarrassing.” I didn’t want her to confirm that, but when I asked, she said it was because the artist is from an older generation.\n* After watching a show that’s been meaningful to us, I offered to talk about it. She said “sure,” but when I struggled to express my thoughts (since I’m slower to grasp the season), she flatly said, “What are you talking about?” I felt dismissed. When I said that felt sad, she responded, “Well, I’m going to go. You need to work and maybe nap.” She left quickly, and while it could have been thoughtful, it felt dismissive since it was her decision alone.\n\nI have other examples from earlier in dating, but she's gotten a little better because we briefly saw a therapist. But now that we are weeks out from that appointment it feels like we are struggling again. \n\nAm I being too sensitive? Is my girlfriend being a jerk? It’s tough to say because she’s usually very sweet, mature, and kind.

        "content": "About 5 months ago, I (F 19) met someone (M 28) after deciding to book a tattoo with him. For the sake of this post we'll call him Jay. Upon meeting, I instantly felt extremely attracted to him. Going in I wasn't sure what he would look/be like but he was genuinely the personification of a text book definition of my type.\n\nAs we got to talk a bit more, I realized we had soooo many common interests. Music, shows, media, personal style, values, humor, etc. We talked all day (long tattoo session) and eventually the topic of age was brought up. I was quite surprised to learn he was 28. I don't find that \"old\" by any means other than comparatively of course, but it also shocked because I really couldn't sense any significant disparities in our personalities throughout interacting; rather we were super compatible.\n\nThat session ended and we went our separate ways like normal, but I soon ended up booking another tattoo. This one was larger, and took about 3 decently long sessions. Over the course of those 3 sessions we spoke even more deeply, learned a lot about each other, and shared so many good laughs and conversations. It feels so natural with him. At this point, I was painfully aware of my attraction to Jay but didn't think pursuing anything was feasible due to the age gap. I assumed that he wouldn't think of me in that way due to me being quite a bit younger.\n\nBy the time the tattoo was complete, I felt a sense of closeness to him. We had bonded so much, and it's extremely rare I feel so strongly for someone. I payed and gave him a little funko pop doll of one of his favorite characters to express my gratitude, (also it was nearing Christmas by this time) which he received super well and even gave me a little hug. I left that night prepared to not rlly interact with him for a while, but it just didn't feel right.\n\nIn the days following, I made a few subtle attempts to talk to him. We were sending memes for a bit, and then kind of just launched into conversation- the kind of text convos that are just continuous and about anything and everything. I don't know how it got to the point, but soon enough he was inviting me over. Somehow I still believed this was more than likely platonic at this point because I was just so doubtful the age thing wouldn't be a dealbreaker, but also I had mentioned that I missed my pets back home and he said I was welcome to come play with his cats and also toy around with a bunch of cool games he has that I wanted to check out, so it seemed like a normal invitation to me.\n\nAnyways I go over and it's starts off pretty regular. I'm looking through all his cool things and playing with the cats and it's a great time. We sat down to play a game on his console and kind of started on opposite ends of his couch. As the night progressed we got closer and closer, and then after a few hours passed and it was later at night he finally asked if I'd be willing to come closer to him.\n\nSo now we're cuddling and I can't even believe it. My heart was pounding so hard. I know this is kind of dumb but I really, really did not expect him to reciprocate my feelings. If it makes any sense, he seems like the type of person that would avoid something socially questionable in this respect. Anyways, we start making out, and do end up being intimate in the bed room. After everything is done, we pretty much immediately talk about the age gap. He expresses how he did feel an initial attraction to me, but didn't try to pursue it because of the age gap and I told him how I did the same. It's difficult because he's never been with anyone significantly younger and I've never been with someone significantly older so we were both trying to make sense of it.\n\nWe’ve come to the conclusion that despite our uncertainty with the dynamic, we both feel such a strong liking towards one another that it's worth going slow and taking time to explore each other more and the feasibility of a relationship between us.\n\nIt has now been 2-3 months since all this and I am even more confused. I like him. A lot. And I'm picky, very very picky. It's still too early to say anything of this nature, but I can't deny that I can feel feelings of love arising; or at the very least the seed is planted. He is my perfect person, when I'm with him it feels beyond right and I never want to leave. He is kind, compassionate, and I feel like I can truly say he treats me exactly how a man should. At this point, I can honestly say this is the type of person I would marry...but of course after quite a bit of time because I am really young and I don't want to ma any huge life decisions right now as I'm still trying to build my life and figure out everything that I want.\n\nThe main problem here is that he's on a time line that I'm not bound to. Not surprisingly, he is thinking about meeting a person he could settle down with and start a family with. We've talked about it, and basically he really wants to have kids by 35 (for reasons based on biological clock, things like sperm quality and all that) I've done the math many times.\n\nAround the age he would want to conceive, I'd be 24-25. I can't deny that is super young! I'm in college right now, and I'll graduate at 21. (after 1 year) Obviously, my main goal right now is that, and ensuring I can eventually secure a job that brings in adequate income.\n\nHere's the thing, when I think about doing all this with him, it's not necessarily a no??? I do know that I want to have a family at some point, but for me that would ideally be 27-33. Furthermore, If my life plans went well, I had a good job with a few years to save for a house, costs entailing to financing a baby, I could see this being a viable route for me. But here's the thing...I'll never really know if that's how things are going to go even if it's what I want now, right? Honestly, the way I feel, it could go either way. There's absolutely a world in which I graduate, find a decent job, and feel ready to start that chapter of my life with Jay in my early 20's. It seems like a stretch but honestly the way I'm feeling about this man and the way that he makes my future path seem so clear...I really don't know what to feel.\n\nUltimately, I'm going to take it slow with him for the next few months and think really really hard about what I want my life and future to look like. We've both gone over all of these concerns, and agree that whatever the decision is no one should have to settle or give up things they really want for the other. My life will change forever if I pursue this kind of future with him, especially with kids and what not so it's something I go back and forth on constantly. Honestly, my biggest fear is that I follow my heart here and then in a few years I learn some things that I don't know yet and realize I'm not ready. The last thing I want to do is waste his time when he's already expressed he feels it's a crucial time for him to start making these steps.\n\nI'm definitely not going to jump the gun and decide any time soon, but I would love to get some insight from the people of Reddit who have more experience with relationships, particularly with these sort of complex circumstances. Those who got married/ had kids early-mid 20's was it worth it ? Do you regret it? Those who let the one get away for this sort of reason, does the life you have now make you happy with your choice ? I need all the honest opinions I can get. Thanks everyone.\n\n- - -\n\n**TL;DR;** : By chance, I met the man of my dreams. The problem: I’m 19 F and he’s 28 M. I’m concerned about establishing my career now. He is thinking about settling down and starting a family in the next 6 years. I really like him, and could see myself settling down with him, but I’ll be so young even after 6 years that I still might not be ready. I don’t know if I should pursue him any further. ",

        "content": "Hi there, M22 here, I really need some opinions about this girl I am dating because.. my friends don't want to give me any advice or any opinions about my relationship. So... I really struggled with relationships last year, most girls found me ugly or not that interesting till I found this girl, (F20) she is beautiful, inside and outside, talked for about a month then we got into an relationship, it was amazing, talked to eachother non stop, she was perfect until the arguments started to settle, arguing over anything...\n\n1.What I found weird is that the arguments mostly started when she made me feel... sad, I was having a good day. feeling happy then she for example was dry or something and I ask her what's wrong but her replies we're idk, off, dry.. and when I get sad about it and I tell her that she becomes, furious? Like she tells me something like \"oh great, now you're upset too, uhh\" and when we argue about it she starts to throw things like \"oh, I can't do \\_\\_\\_ but remember when you did it 4 times back in \\_\\_\\_ \", basically things from the past that I did when the conversation is bout her.\n\n2.On New Year's I was out with her, watching the fireworks, I was looking into her eyes and seeing that \"spark\" was gone, she was looking into nothing, speaking weirdly, don;t know what happened.. 3 days later she needed a break, the break lasted 1 week, she mostly stayed home, she was very dry to me, she said she wanted a brake because he is not feeling good WITH HER (It was very sketchy) still have no proper answer why she did that but anyway, we got \"back together\" 1 week after. I don't have the same crazy feelings I used to have for her, I am kinda scared to \"love\" her the way I did\n\n3.Last night I was with a friend out and she became upset about it because.. I don;t really know why but she became upset saying \"that's nice...\" and just started being dry for no appearent reason, she went to sleep and I got home, texted her I got home safely and I told her some cute things about us, about what I think of her that I can't wait to see her soon, she woke up and said good morning, how are you and just liked my \"cute messages\" saying \"I am still mad about last night\", asked her why and she says i dont know....\n\n  \nso.. she had a few relationships, maybe 1 or 2 but long distance relationships so she doesn't have that much experience but to be honest I feel a weird in the relationship and maybe I don't see the red flags but I am really trying to show her how to be a girl, maybe I am doing something wrong, I am not love bombing her, I'm somewhere in between, I am kinda teaching her how relationships work so whenever she's mad or acting weird I am trying to understand that she never had a good relationship and that she didnt had a good childhood either. I truly love her and feel bad for her that she wasn't treated right, nor as a girlfriend, nor as a child and I want to show her that there are people who still care about her and love her the way she is but... she kinda doesn't change and loves, arguments kinda and is very VAIN sometimes, what I saw it changed in her is that after an argument she is giving up and wants to fix things up not like before when she was mad for hours and couldn't do anything to her, dunno, if u have any questions feel free to ask me, i am not the best at explaining things\n\nTL;DR : boyfriend is trying to understand, love and teach a girl that wasn't treated right her life since childhood",

        "content": "I (28M) have been with my girlfriend (35F) for 1 year. We enjoy activities together and have similar values, but I have some doubts as well. She wants kids, so I need to decide fast before she gets too old to have them with me or someone else. But I have never been in a relationship before, so I can't tell if my doubts are normal or dealbreakers. How can I distinguish between genuine incompatibility and immaturity/anxiety/normal relationship challenges, without having to figure it out over several more years?\n\nMy main doubts are:\n- I worry she might just be settling for me to fill a role in her life, rather than actually loving me. But I'm not sure if that's just the nature of real relationships.\n- Although we are comfortable around each other, she is more Type A and I am more Type B personality, so I can imagine another relationship might feel more comfortable (but have never actually experienced that).\n- I don't have the same burning desire to always be around her that I have had for other girls previously. But we met online and there was not much of a \"chase\", which might be all that I'm missing.\n- Despite our shared interests and values, we have differences too, and I feel like our relationship takes substantial compromise from me, but not from her. Most of these compromises seem logical though and making her compromise on them happens to be less practical due to our respective living situations, families, careers etc.\n- I hate growing old and part of me wants to cling on to my younger years by dating a younger girl and having more time before I become a parent.\n- We have discussed much of this but it still hasn't allayed my doubts, whereas she seems to have no doubts.\n\nSome potentially relevant info about me - I have wasted many years pining after a couple of girls who didn't like me back. I have dated before but nothing more than a few months. I want children and a relationship, but I'm used to being independent for so many years. I think I have very good emotional intelligence generally, but I'm missing something when it comes to romantic relationships.\n\nTL;DR I am in my first relationship, with a 35 year old woman who wants kids, and I want to know whether my doubts about our relationship are actual problems.",

She told me right after it happened and I didn’t think much of it. Although I did get a little worried because the way she explained it she didn’t immediately turn him down but rather continued the conversation until he asked if she had a bf. She never told me how the conversation ended but I didn’t think much about it. \n\nToday (the day after) I was thinking more about it and was a bit uncomfortable about the way she explained it and how she didn’t immediately say she had a bf and wasn’t interested so I asked her when I saw her why and she says “oh I was super high and didn’t know what to do”. So whatever, but eventually I checked her phone cause we have an open phone policy and see that they followed each other on instagram.  This obviously upset me and I left her place and told her I needed space to think. She was very upset and honestly started turning things on me and making me look like the bad guy saying I was being really mean and what not. I did not yell or call her mean names but I did maybe raise my voice slightly and tell her how I felt. I see how it could come across but I was very upset because I’ve told her from the start my boundaries and how this was one of them. She denied that we ever talked about this.  \n\nSo obviously I’m very upset and left her place but I just don’t know whether I’m overacting or not. Can we recover from this? She’s done some stuff in the past that has crossed boundaries but it wasn’t as serious so I let it slide and communicated my feelings and thought we understood each other. After this though I’m just confused and don’t know what to do. She didn’t physically cheat on me but it feels like a betrayal and I’m very hurt so I don’t know how to move forward. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice?\n\nTLDR: GF told me a guy hit on her and I found out later that she added him on instagram.

During the first few months after the tragedy, I tried my best to support her. We met occasionally, but most of our communication was through texting. However, after the second month following the accident, arguments began. We started disagreeing on many things, and I struggled to fully understand her situation. She often expressed that I didn’t understand her pain, and because she rarely opened up about her feelings, misunderstandings became frequent. She would say things like, “You don’t know my pain,” and “You’re arguing with me instead of supporting me.” I always tried to understand her, but it was challenging. Our arguments mostly happened over text, as we less spoke on the phone or met in person.\n    \n    **TL;DR; :  iAM NOT sure what to do**.\n    \n     \n\n \n\nThis situation has persisted for almost a year now. It feels like she has lost much of her emotional connection to me, but when I ask her directly, she sometimes indicates that she still needs me and doesn’t want to break up. I feel the same way and want to make things work. Lately, we’ve been arguing most nights, often over small things. I’ve been considering taking the next step toward marriage, hoping it might bring us closer and resolve some of these issues, especially since our relationship is mostly limited to texting. but we have to fix ourselves then step into it as I think we have to marry due to love not escaping from the issues.\n\n \n\nThe main problem is that I feel she’s not the same as before. She often blames me, saying I wasn’t there for her after her brother’s death and that I’ve changed. I’m unsure what to do in this situation. Sometimes, I think about giving her space for a few days, but I miss her. We still appreciate each other’s personalities, and when we meet in person, things seem fine. Neither me nor her want to break up. However, over phone calls, especially after a text argument, she becomes distant and cold. What should I do? What’s the best advice for handling this?\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "We met on tinder in early jan &amp; had on &amp; off chats until we decided to finally meet. First date was set up but a flake cause we both got pretty swamped on the day and ended up not texting each other at all to confirm anything\n\nShe reached out a few days later to apologise and suggested we reschedule. \n\nThis time everything went smooth, and the next few weeks were great. Plenty of dates, we’d just hang out &amp; get food together or go to gigs etc and made sure we were both on the same page about wanting something serious. \n\nSo she had plans for a valentines night out with her girlfriends so I decided to surprise her on the 13th instead. We went to a bougie spot for dinner, got her some flowers there and she invited me back to hers and we had sex\n\nNext few days were more of the same, we’d text &amp; make plans for later on in the month. She’d show me how cute the flowers looked etc. I suggested we hang out again soon but she had a work project to focus on and had a deadline to make.\n\nShe was clearly focused on this quite a bit so I tried not to think of her late replies too much. Instead, telling her she needs to focus and that our outings can wait. Around this time she fell ill and had to get an extension on her project, I felt really bad as she had been trying so hard to get this over with\n\nI thought I’d do something nice and dropped off a gift basket I made for her w some essentials you need to get through a flu\n\nThe replies had really started to dwindle down a lot by this point and I’d found myself feeling anxious and checking my phone a lot\n\nAnd then she randomly suggested we go for a walk through town so she can get some fresh air, we did and we had a great time too getting lost in the nooks and crannies of this remote village. Obviously there was very little physical contact through this whole outing as she was very visibly ill. We got back and she told me she feels much better, I told her I had a great time seeing her again\n\nAnd then just radio silence for the next few days, I told myself that I’d let her focus on her work project which was due on Monday (we last went out on Thursday) and didn’t bother her at all during this time.\n\n4 days went by and me feeling anxious about the whole thing decided to call her.. no response but I did get a text message saying that she’d call back and that she was in the middle of something. Except she never did\n\nShe texted me a whole day and a half later apologising and telling me that she’d just gotten really busy after having recovered, asked what I’ve been up to and then just disappeared again. It’s now been a further two days since she last texted me\n\nI’m not sure how to proceed, we had both established that we were looking for something serious but my experience tells me that someone who wants you in their life makes an effort to put you in it, and that this girl who I’ve come to really like is just taking me for a ride. Cause surely you can find 10 seconds in your day to text back someone you’re seeing\n\nBut at the same time I find myself having a great time every time I’m in the presence of this girl and it makes me wonder what I’ve done for her behaviour to change this much.\n\nWhat do you guys make of it? \n\nTLDR: Seeing someone, things are going great and then she falls sick, response times go to hell, part of me wants to call it and move on",

        "content": "TLDR: My (F24) married gaming buddy (M22) with 3 kids is pissed off because I am romantically interested in his best friend (M23). Additionally, he has a bipolar wife that harasses me through various platforms and profiles.\n\nSo this is not the end of the world, but it does piss me off as I have not really done anything to cause this situation: hence venting out of frustration and the whole illogicality of the situation.\n\nBackground:\nI’ve been in the same clan for 5 years and at times I have been the co-leader. 2 years ago two guys (M22 and M23) picked up the game and joined our clan, which we promote as a helpful/low threshold community. It is exactly the altruistic and friendly atmosphere, which has made me stick, even at times when I can’t play much. \n\nInitially I didn’t interact with them much, but I got to know them through weekly group events. July 2023 we had a clan get together for everyone who could make it IRL and I met both of them there. Let’s call the married guy Alex and the single friend John. I got along super well with them, I had the most fun I’ve had in years, just talked about specific raids and fails and such. It was also the first time we discussed anything personal. Alex told me he is married and has 3 kids. He is unemployed because of anxiety, which is why he smokes weed and plays most of the day. I don’t judge, but it doesn’t sound like a fun life imo. John on the other hand is a mechanic, single, lives alone, works out most days, doesn’t drink or do drugs: which is exactly the same way as I am. Both of us have been single for a few years and are not interested in situationships. \n\nI gave John my snap and last year we have met a few times for a coffee. Somehow Alex always tags along. However, we live far away from each other and although we engage in innocent flirting, we expressed not progressing as neither want a long-distance relationship. Since the coffee “dates” Alex has become more irritable every time we play as a group. Sometimes he intentionally lies to John saying I’m not online (I play offline but clan member can see me). Additionally, Alex’s wife has started messaging me through her own profile, his profiles and fake profiles. Occasionally she screams in the background asking if he is playing with me. \n\nI’ve told her this is unnecessary drama I am not interested in your HUSBAND and the FATHER of your kids. I said I am however interested in his best friend. Nevertheless, she has kept harassing me and calling me names. Other clan members want him out because of her behaviour. John though is a happy go lucky guy and said (jokingly) she will shut up once we marry. \n\nIt so happens that John is moving only an hour away from me in 3 months. He said he hates to be obnoxious but could I possibly reserve a date for him and perhaps “wait for him”. I thought that was incredibly cute and I said of course. I rarely play anymore as I just started doing my PhD in October and I spend long hours at a lab or I am just tired after gym. I only login Friday/Saturday evenings.\n\nThey are still best friends but I feel that they won’t be once he moves as John doesn’t really like either of their behaviour. He told me she has bipolar, which adds to Alex’s misery as she is very jealous and paranoid. I just wish we could all get along as I don’t see an issue here: I’m pursuing a single man.\n\nAnyway. Had to get this off my chest as their crazy behaviour is making me want to login less and it is my only quality time with John at the moment until he will move. He has asked not to kick Alex out of the clan as “he doesn’t have much going for him”. I get that, but hey, I was there first.\n\nThis is all frivolous I get it, but it does piss me off regardless.\n\n ",

        "content": "TL;DR I’m not sure if I should continue on with my girlfriend after learning about her promiscuity\n\nI’m a 23M dating a 25F and we have been dating for two months. I’m writing this the morning after so I don’t forget any details. She just dumped a lot of history on me in a conversation we had last night where we agreed to have no more secrets and I don’t think I was mentally ready for it. She told me her body count, she said it was around 30, I never asked but she felt it was necessary to say since she was insecure about it. \n\nShe’s slept with coworkers, bosses, and mostly guys from the club. What bothers (and honestly, disgusts) me the most is some of the age gaps. In one situation she was 23 and her boss was 45 Another thing that bothers me are the stories behind some. She was always never the one initiating and just had sex with whatever man tried enough. The boss took her on a business trip to a neighboring country but only booked one hotel for them (intentionally) and “one thing led to another”. I’m confused as to why she didn’t make proper judgement calls if she said she wasn’t as interested as she said she was. Another issue I have is that she told me she never lied about the age she lost her virginity (22) meaning she’s slept with 30 men in the span of three years. She has never cheated and she said she’s fully devoted to me, a complete 360 of when she was going through her “phase” as a result of ex boyfriends breaking up with her. \n\nI lost my virginity to her, and I love her too, but I keep asking myself why sleeping with so much men is an answer for being emotionally distraught for so much people. Before our conversation she would also occasionally respond to messages from guys she’s slept with in the past non romantically to “catch up” most of them are in current relationships too but I still feel it was wrong so I told her to stop. I did the “ Reverse roles” thing and she understood.  She said she will respect my decision since she lied and hid so much things from me during the relationship. I need advice to cope with seeing a completely different woman I thought I was dating from 24 hours ago.   ",

For the past 6 months or so he has been messaging me outside of work on Whatsapp about all kinds of things non-work related. He does it on a daily basis. I never initiate the conversations but message back because I like him and don't want to be rude. He's never messaged me about anything sexual or asked me on a date but he has asked if I would like to hang out after work one day. I'm not really sure how I feel about it and whether this is appropriate. I really like him and I would definitely like us to be friends. It's not against company policy to date coworkers but I have always wanted to avoid doing that because I think office romances are messy, and he has also explicitly told me in the past he would never want to date a coworker. Does this mean it's okay to meet up with him and message him and that this just means we are friends/coworkers who get along well? He has never flirted with me that I can tell and sometimes talks to me about famous women he finds attractive which I assume he wouldn't do if he thought of me in a sexual way. I don't want to broach the subject with him to be clear that we are just friends because he's never given me any explicit cause to believe he could want something more, and I could just be worrying about nothing and it might freak him out. There does seem to be some ambiguity but that could just be my perception of the situation - I hope it is just in my head because it would be much simpler for me if we were just friends. The only reason I question whether it could be something else is because even my best friends don't message me this frequently, but I know that he's more active messaging people than I am. Does anyone have an impartial third-person view of what's going on here? It would help me to get some clarity\n\n  \nThanks in advance",

        "content": "I (27F, Christian) have been with my partner (27M, Muslim) for five years. Our relationship has had its ups and downs, but last year, he surprised me by asking for my hand in marriage. What I didn’t know was that before asking me, he had already told his family I was going to convert—without ever asking me directly.\n\nI don’t have an issue with Islam itself. My issue is how everything is happening. He told everyone about our future before he told me. He assumed I would convert because:\n\t•\tI fasted during Ramadan (because I enjoyed it).\n\t•\tI don’t eat pork or drink alcohol.\n\t•\tI went to Taraweeh prayers twice.\n\t•\tI once said I don’t believe Jesus was God, only a prophet, and that I struggle to understand the Trinity.\n\nBecause of this, he assumed I was already on the path to converting. But I’ve always told him I don’t see myself as a religious person—Christian or Muslim. At first, he didn’t pressure me, but now, his family keeps asking why I haven’t converted yet and when we will do the katb kitab. His mom recently confronted me and asked, “What’s wrong? What don’t you like about Islam?”\n\nThe Christmas Issue &amp; Family Pressure\n\nAfter he asked for my hand, I told him conversion is okay, but I don’t want to drift from my family. My mom said she wants the kids over for Christmas, and at first, his mom said no problem—even letting them decorate the tree. But then my dad found out and was furious, saying he would disown me if I converted.\n\nHis family’s reaction? “It’s okay, he will come around. Just move forward.”\n\nThen suddenly, my partner changed his stance. He said:\n👉 “You can go for Christmas, but me and the kids will stay home.”\n\nI told him that wasn’t fair, and that if that was his stance, we weren’t compatible. After months of fighting, he finally agreed to come, but his mother said he could leave if there’s alcohol on the table—even though he already knows alcohol will be there. Now, he says he might stay or might leave, making it feel like a fake compromise.\n\n➡️ To be clear, in no way does my family expect him to participate in any religious practices involving the blood and body of Christ. They simply want him to be present as part of the family.\n\nWhy I Feel Torn\n\t1.\tHis argument: “You already live like a Muslim. What will actually change?” But to me, this isn’t just about lifestyle—it’s about my identity and choice.\n\t2.\tThe guilt: He says, “I told my whole family about you, I convinced them to accept you, and now you’re letting me down.”\n\t3.\tThe expectations: His family treats me well because they believe I’m going to convert. If I say I won’t, I don’t know how they will see me.\n\t4.\tThe double standards: He wants a religious wife who will teach Islam to our kids, but he himself doesn’t even pray five times a day and has admitted he struggles with following the religion fully.\n\t5.\tThe emotional toll: I feel like I can’t win. If I convert, I lose a part of myself and my family. If I don’t, I lose him.\n\nHe says he wants me to convert for God, not for him, but if I don’t, there is no marriage.\n\nSo… what do I do?\n\nHas anyone been through something similar? How did you handle it? I feel exhausted, confused, and like I’m being asked to make a decision that doesn’t truly feel like my own.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nMy Muslim partner (27M) assumed I’d convert and told his family before asking me. Now, they’re pressuring me, saying he’s “waited long enough.” He says I already live like a Muslim, so converting shouldn’t be a big deal, but for me, it’s about choice and identity. He wants me to convert for God, not him—but if I don’t, there’s no marriage. I feel stuck. What would you do?",

        "content": "I've been living with my boyfriend for the past 4-5 months or so and I have moments where all I want is to go home. my mother and I had never been on the same page with each other and it was constant arguments everyday. I love her dearly and that'll never change. I ended up taking the chance and leaving. A big factor in that decision wasn't mainly because of her and I arguing but, because of her husband as well. He would get drunk and call me names and call his family and talk ill about me as a person. Then lie to my mother either telling her he never did it or lie in general about me not doing my house chores. He would also snoop through my bedroom when I wasn't home and took pictures of things inside of it. In one situation I locked my door before I left the house and came home to it open and my prescription meds opened and scattered across my floor. And these situations were constant.\nI'd love to go home just to be with my siblings, mother, and my two dogs but part of me doesn't want to have to put myself back in that position with her husband, and part of me very much enjoys staying with my boyfriend. Just like my mother, I too love my boyfriend dearly. i need advice or opinions, and not anything regarding my age. I am aware 17 is young to be already living with an S/O. Thank you..\n\nTL;DR- I’m conflicted on if being at home with my family would be better for me or if I should just stay where I am at.",
