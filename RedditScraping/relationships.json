        "content": "I (F) have been dating my boyfriend, Rohan (M), for six months now. We met on Hinge, clicked instantly, and have been seeing each other almost every day since. He had a messy past\u2014he cheated on his ex multiple times and even sent private videos of them to someone he was sexting. It turned into a huge mess when those videos got leaked back to his ex. His parents found out, and he hit rock bottom.\n\nAfter that, he turned his life around. He got into meditation, journaling, working out, and reading self-improvement books. By the time I met him, he seemed like a different person. When he told me about his past, I took some time to process it but decided not to hold it against him because he had never given me a reason to doubt him. He has been nothing but loving and committed, constantly talking about our future together and how he wants us to be together forever.\n\nBut yesterday, something happened that shook me. His mom visited a jyotish (a person who predicts the future), and the jyotish told her that I\u2019m the kind of person who keeps secrets. She also said Rohan would \"fall on his face\" for loving me and that he would have more girls coming and going in his life.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in astrology much, but hearing this still affected me. It planted doubt in my mind, even though I have never done anything to betray Rohan\u2019s trust. He has also never given me a reason to think he\u2019s being unfaithful now. Logically, I know a prediction shouldn\u2019t change how I see my relationship, but I can\u2019t stop overthinking it.\n\nHow do I stop letting this get to me? How can I move past this and trust my own experience instead of an outsider\u2019s words?\n\nTL;DR: Been dating my boyfriend for six months. He has a bad past but has completely changed. His mom went to a jyotish who predicted that I keep secrets and that my boyfriend will suffer for loving me. I don\u2019t believe in astrology much, but this has planted doubt in my mind. How do I stop overthinking and trust my own experience?",

He only comes for his week long breaks. We\u2019ve been dating for a little over than a year and a half but was friends for 6 months prior dating. Our relationship has been great so far and I can really see a future with him. But recently he\u2019s been acting very weird and it worries me so much. He will tell me how much he misses me and all the things like that, \u201cI want to see you so bad\u201d, \u201cI wish you were with me\u201d, etc. But every time I actually get to see him..he doesn\u2019t want to be with me. After the first two days of being with me he tells me he needs a break and won\u2019t want to hangout until a day or two later. And I know that doesn\u2019t sound too crazy but for me after not seeing him for months I would like to spend every second I can with him you know? It just really hurts that he doesn\u2019t feel the same and when I ask him about this he just says he doesn\u2019t know why and just needs time away from me. He\u2019ll also say \u201cbut I love you so much\u201d and \u201cI love being with you, I do miss you\u201d but I\u2019m like I haven\u2019t seen you in months so why are you needing breaks if you miss me so bad?  He also keeps saying how he will change bc he hates seeing how his actions hurt me. So Idk if it\u2019s just me or if how he\u2019s acting is weird or wtv. But idk what I should do? Should I wait it out? Or maybe we can talk to someone, like a therapist? Idk\n\nTL;DR- I don\u2019t see my boyfriend very often due to distance because he in college. Only see him for his week long breaks. Even with us going months without seeing each other he needs breaks in between seeing me. Say if he is here for a week, he\u2019ll spend the first two days hanging out then need a day or two until he wants to see me again. Idk if it just me but it kinda hurts.",

I\u2019m torn. \n\nI\u2019m a 26F and he\u2019s a 32M. For reference, he suffers from depression and no amount of counselling or medication seems to help him. He tells me his view on life is pretty much.. pointless. We\u2019ve been together for 10 years and in cases he\u2019d never be able to hold down a job for more than 1 year cuz he\u2019d suffer from his depression and revert back to video games.. \n\nAnd drinking. \n\nHe\u2019s an avid drinker. I\u2019d say roughly -2L or so a week on a 1 day binge. He used to drink more, 2-3 times a week but now limits it to a 1 day binge of 2L. It\u2019s crazy. I\u2019ve tried to get him off it but no avail. According to him it doesn\u2019t contribute to his depression but makes him feel good about life like he should feel. We tried walks, hotels, diff environment. He\u2019s bored with everything and little joy in it\n\nAnd this is where i come here. Every week. Or every 2 weeks, he wants me to cover for him [we work at the same company] so he can do his binge with his friends. He wants me to cover 2 days of his work so he can play video games and drink. He says it\u2019s therapeutic to him and makes him less depressed. Tbh I feel like a sucker and an enabler but he won\u2019t do anything to help himself. Today is Thursday and rn he\u2019s playing video games with his friends while I\u2019m due to cover this morning. He\u2019ll definitely go for nearly 24 hours. It\u2019s right now 1am. \n\nHe has never covered me in all of our relationship. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is normal \u2026 the drinking absolutely no way but his friend and him don\u2019t have aligned schedules, so Thursdays are pretty much the only times they can hang. I\u2019d say roughly my husband is being covered by me 2-3 times a month with a maximum of 6 days in a month. I still take his pay away ofc. \n\nGive it to me straight guys \nCriticism accepted. \n\n\nIs it ok me to cover his shifts so he can hang with his friend? \n\nThanks \n\n\nTLDR; husband wants me to cover his shifts so he can hangout with his buddies and drink litres of alcohol and play the PS4, says helps with his depression and he wants fun",

        "content": "Throwaway. I (20F) have been with my bf (20M) for over a year now. I love him dearly but I've been thinking of breaking up with him for a while now. I'm a very analytic and very self aware person. Self aware when it comes to myself, meaning that I understad why I feel the way I do, I can figure out root issues or triggers for why I feel the way I do, and I'm able to understand why people may feel upset about things. I don't want this to come off as rude, but my boyfriend doesnt really have that high of an emotional capacity. Whenever I try to talk about my feelings, he usually takes it personally. Whenever I try to communicate how I feel he gets defensive and gets upset with me. He rarely ever ackowledges how I feel and always says \"but that's how you feel it's not the truth\". It's extremly frustrating and draining and it hurts so much. I'd like to add that when I communicate I always use I statments and make it clear that this is how I'm feeling. I'm able to seperate emotion from thought and I'm aware that how I feel is how I feel and that that might not be the truth of the situation, but it's still how I feel and I'd hope that that would be important enough. He oftentimes finds it very difficult to reassure me which leads me to feel much worse because he straight up doesnt ackoweldge how I feel. I don't know what to do. It hurts so much because I love him and he's a really sweet, funny, silly individual. He perfect in every other way except for the fact that he doesnt seem to understand. I'm just so hurt and frustarted because he genuinly doesnt seem to understand. He genuinly doesnt seem to have the emotional capacity to be able to understand how I'm feeling. It's so frustrating. He's also not the best at communicating his own feelings to me. I'm just sad because he gets mad at me and he doesnt seem to understand why I feel the way I do, even after i explain it multiple times. My feelings arent a personal attack towards him, but that's all they seem to be towards him :(. I love him and I want this to work out but I also can't ignore the fact that I've been second guessing our relationship for several months. I genuinly feel like I'm going crazy for having feelings, because if I want reassurance or to talk it always starts an argument :(. I can't do this to myself. I can't be with someone who doesnt have the emotional capacity to meet my need. I can't be with someone who will only ever get frustarted or mad when I'm genuinly trying to tell them how I feel. Communication isn't key, understanding is. Communication means nothing if understanding isn't there. I feel so hurt. Idk I just dont feel like my emotional needs are being met. I would also like to add that I've told him how his reactions to me telling him about my feelings make me feel and its the same thing. Anyways if you read this far, thank you for reading.\n\nTLDR: My bf gets defensive and takes my feelings personally when I try to communicate and it's making me rethink my relationship because he genuinly doesnt seem to understand why I feel the way I do.",

        "title": "How do I (21f) get over this friendship?",
        "content": "I was friends with this guy (m24) for a few months. He was a very kind guy. Probably one of the kindest people I ever met. We met in September at a social event and he approached me bc he noticed I looked a bit anxious (I have social anxiety and am autistic, but I\u2019ve been trying to step outside my comfort zone and make friends more lately). \n\nAfter that we hung out a handful of times. However, I noticed that every time we hung out, I always initiated it. It made me a bit sad, but I figured they were just a busy person. They were a very charming and social person, so I figured they just had too many friends to remember to reach out to just me individually (especially since we didn't really have any mutual friends). And they always seemed happy to spend time with me, so I tried not to take it personally. \n\nI have an upcoming trip, and during our last hangout, they suggested they could take me to some store to help me prep for it because it was my first solo trip. I agreed. This was four weeks ago and we made plans to go sometime last weekend. The Sunday before this past Sunday, I texted them to ask if they still wanted to go, because they hadn't reached out to plan it. We decided on going Friday evening. They were supposed to pick me up and we would go over there. We were finalizing the plans Sunday, and I asked them what time they were going to come pick me up. They did not respond. It was nighttime so I assumed they fell asleep bc they had work the next morning. Days go by and it is now Thursday. I texted them asking them again what time we were meeting up.\n\nThis is where things went south. They responded \"oops sorry\" and then told me they did not have their car. They then told me that the plans to go to the store they suggested had fallen through and we would have to do something else. I asked them why they didn't tell me that sooner. Had I not texted them, I would not have known the plans had fallen through. I asked them if they ever planned on saying something, or would Friday have come and gone and they wouldn't have said anything and just ghosted me completely. They then ignored me for 7 hours. I followed up and asked if I should consider the plans cancelled because he was completely failing to communicate anything to me at this point. He eventually responded and apologized and said several people have told him he's been a bad communicator lately. He then said he had no solid idea of what to do Friday.\n\nI was confused and asked if he had any idea at all or if he wanted me to come up with something. Then he responds two hours later, saying we should not be friends because he can't meet me where I'm at and put in the same amount of effort I do. I was baffled bc he'd been bullshitting me all day and then suddenly decided he doesn't want to be friends. I told him I felt very disrespected and confused. He then said he was stressed by how I was approaching planning this meetup and that I was being confrontational. I reiterated that this was a situation he caused because he did not communicate the plans had fallen through until I had to reach out after he ghosted me for days. I then asked to call because we were going back and forth and not getting anywhere.\n\nHe sent an audio message instead and basically said it \"wasn't a reflection of\" me and that he just didn't view our friendship as sustainable. He said he realized he wasn't putting enough effort into the friendship, and I guess instead of trying to put the effort in, he decided he just didn't want to try at all. Then he stopped responding. I told him he was a piece of shit. Months ago I wrote him a letter bc his mom is dying. My mom died of illness when I was a child and I really felt for him, so I wrote him a letter with some advice and wisdom and to show I cared. It was really heartfelt and vulnerable. After how he treated me, I told him to burn that letter.\n\nI can\u2019t help but feel like I did something wrong. Like, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have said anything about him ghosting me. I\u2019m really hurting from the ending of this friendship. This feels like the closest thing to a breakup I\u2019ve ever experienced. I\u2019m devastated and confused. I don\u2019t plan on reaching out to him or anything. I\u2019m just heartbroken.\n\nTLDR; I confronted a friend about being uncommunicative and flaky and they ended the friendship.

My ex (also 25F) and I were together for about nine months, and while things were mostly good, we had a bad argument near the end. Out of nowhere, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re too small to please me,\u201d and compared me to her ex, saying he was much bigger. I didn\u2019t even know how to respond\u2014I just walked out. She apologized a lot afterward, but I couldn\u2019t forget it, and I eventually ended the relationship.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m about 5.5 inches, which I know is within the average range, but ever since that moment, I\u2019ve felt really insecure. I never thought much about it before, but now it\u2019s constantly in my head. I hesitate before dating again because I worry I won\u2019t be \u201cenough.\u201d Logically, I understand that confidence, connection, and how you treat someone matter more than just one physical trait, but emotionally, I\u2019m struggling to move past this.\n\nSo I guess my questions are:\n\nFrom a woman\u2019s perspective, how much does this actually matter in the grand scheme of things?\n\nAnd for anyone who\u2019s dealt with insecurity, how did you rebuild your confidence after something like this?\n\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any honest thoughts or reassurance. Thanks.\n\nTL;DR: M25, my F25 ex insulted my size during an argument, saying I was \u201ctoo small to please her\u201d and that her ex was bigger. I know I\u2019m within the average range (5.5 inches), but ever since, I\u2019ve felt really insecure about dating and worry I won\u2019t be enough. She apologized, but I couldn\u2019t move past it and ended things. Looking for perspectives\u2014how much does this actually matter to women, and how can I rebuild my confidence?\n\n",

        "content": "I (36F) have been dating my bf (30M) for about 2.5 years. After a few months of dating I checked his IG following (it's the only social media inhavez he has ig, FB and snap) and he followed a bunch of random girls, like a lot. I struggle with insecurity and trust issues and I let him know it made me feel a bit uncomfortable hatbhe was following all these random women (younger, attractive) and he unfollowed them. \n\nHe really is a loving bf and I shouldn't have any reason not to trust him but the last few weeks I just noticed he didn't text quite as much, and then some nights he stopped saying good night and I wouldn't hear from him before bed, where as before he always made a point to say goodnight and I love you. Today I didn't hear back from.him for about 10 hours which is unusual. He has also been staying later at work and had to start going in on weekends. And then the other week he randomly got me flowers, just because. Which he hasn't done since we started dating. And he is usually the type to love bomb as well and always tells me I'm the only woman for him but lately it's been extra.\n\nI know some people who cheat will start doing nice things randomly for their partner and I'm also quite paranoid from my trust issues so I just randomly checked his IG followers and I noticed him and this younger girl started follow my eachither. She's liked a few of his recent selfies and then randomly liked a post he made specifically about me. Yes she is more beautiful than I and also younger. (I admit our age gap has always made me insecure)\n\nMy mind is spiralling and I'm going to ask him about it in person tonight, just let him know that I noticed him and this other girl started following one another and just curious how they knew eachither. \n\nRelationships are hard. This is my first long term relationship and person I really loved and it makes me feel a bit crazy sometimes..he never really lied to.me before that I know of..he did lie about his finances to me in the middle of our relationship. Basically he lives at home  and said he was saving all this money but was actually going into overdraft each month. \n\nHe also always has his phone in him and it he got a case that covers the screen and is always on silent \n\nTLDR: am I over-reacting about a new girl following my bf and liking his photos? (This sounds so childish when I type it out but I know social media can hurt relationships)",

For the first time in our relationship he decided that we need to take a break and packed a few things and told me to give him space for awhile.\n\n It's now on day two and I havnt heard from him and the anticipation of what's going to happen is killing me. We have a daughter ( 2 F) together and I am also currently pregnant.\n\n Hes been drinking and partying almost every night since we found out I was pregnant two weeks ago. His reason for a \"break\" was in my rage i suggested an abortion due to his actions and making me feel terrible since we found out I was expecting. I don't actually want an abortion and regretted saying it and reassured him i don't want to get one. I just felt like he wasnt understanding what his actions are doing to not only me but to everyone in our family. \n\n",

When I told my girlfriend, her response was, \u201cI hope it will be okay\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s hug when you come here.\u201d I figured we\u2019d talk more when we saw each other, but when I got there, she asked me to cook for her. After I did, she thanked me and then just kept asking, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d in an impatient tone, like she had already forgotten what I told her that morning. It felt more like an obligation than actual care, and the way she kept insisting was honestly annoying.\n\nLater, I talked to two of my friends, and I realized I felt so much better after that conversation. They gave me the empathy and emotional support I wished I had gotten from my girlfriend. We talked about death, regrets, and friendship, and it actually helped me process everything.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve felt this way with her. She often doesn\u2019t notice when I\u2019m upset, and when I bring it up, she either says \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cI knew, but I didn\u2019t want to bother you with that.\u201d I\u2019ve called her out on it before, and since then, she\u2019s made some effort to check in on me more. But now that I\u2019m actually going through something really difficult, I feel alone and unsupported. When I told her how I felt, she admitted, \u201cIt makes me uneasy, I don\u2019t know how to talk about these things.\u201d I told her that i felt like i couldn\u2019t rely on her when it matters and it really upset her.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. Are my expectations too high? Is this something that can improve, or is it just doomed? Can someone learn how to be emotionally supportive, or is it just who they are? \nShe apologized for being \u201ca bad partner\u201d and promised to do better, but I\u2019m lost. Would love to hear some opinions.\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend struggles with emotional support, and I felt completely alone after the death of a friend.

        "content": "TLDR; my partner and I have been together for 1.5 years and I\u2019m having doubts, even though we love each other deeply. At what point of second guessing the relationship do you need to end it, and what circumstances should you stay? I fear I\u2019m cursed with relationship anxiety and feeling that things aren\u2019t ever good enough. \n\nI (F26) and my partner (M31) have been together for 1.5 years (coming up to 2 years since we first met/started dating). \nInitially things moved quickly and there was excitement and immediate fondness between the two of us. Though I was fairly hesitant initially (I\u2019d only broken up with my ex 2 months prior and wasn\u2019t looking for anything serious), he caught me off guard with his open heart and genuineness. \nWe ended up together, obviously, and are both now in love. There\u2019s something I can\u2019t quite put my finger on that\u2019s bugging me to my core. At the start, he was devoted, expressive of his feelings towards me, made grand gestures etc. (granted he was overseas on a trip he\u2019d planned before meeting me, of which he cut short in part so we could be together). Now, he\u2019s kind and considerate in the simple ways, he offers to do things for me, will make me food or help out in some way. I can\u2019t help but feel there\u2019s a deeper misalignment between us - he\u2019s incredibly logical and black and white in his thinking, whereas I\u2019m a broad picture thinker, struggling to look outside the grey. Though I don\u2019t think this is inherently a problem, opposites attract after all, it has led to many tense conversations or attempts at seeing eye to eye over the simplest things. These are qualities we both admire in one another but also both struggle with. \n\nI suppose my question is, at what point do you throw the towel in? Is this fundamental difference in seeing the world and communicating enough to end an otherwise loving and caring relationship? Am I being too picky, expecting the excitement you see in movies or when you\u2019re young, or can you still experience and foster this with the right person long term? \n\nThings are feeling more serious between us. He wants to move in together, he\u2019s a bit older and is settling down, I\u2019m feeling older too now. I can\u2019t help but feel that we wouldn\u2019t be best friends if not a couple, and that\u2019s something I see in my parents and others around me that I aspire to have, a sense of fun, adventure, curiosity, deep soul knowing - is this unrealistic? I\u2019m becoming painfully aware that I\u2019m not getting any younger and I\u2019ve been in a three relationships since I was 16, the other two last 4 and 3.5 years - perhaps the issue is that I don\u2019t know myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nExtra notes: my family and friends don\u2019t comment, but I know they\u2019re sceptical of him and my relationship, in part I believe because he enjoys his alone time and doesn\u2019t fake interest in things he doesn\u2019t like, hence he\u2019s not super easy to get to know and we don\u2019t do many social things together (another area of the relationship I\u2019m struggling with).

And every time I hangout with his friends it seems fun and like things are going well, but lately like the past two months it seems like his friends invite him to hangout with out me. Before it was two couples and a single guy friend and everything seemed fine. We\u2019d get together for game nights, but I felt like they were forced hangouts, with them trying to involve me. Lately however, his invites to hangout have been times when his friends know I can\u2019t make it due to work and other obligations on my end. I feel like I could be overthinking it, but it went front hanging out with them every other week to now I haven\u2019t seen them since December. I felt like before we were hanging out because it was cordial and they were being polite inviting me. We would exchange pleasantries and have a good time together, but I admit I suffer with anxiety and sometimes I can get pretty awkward. We also don\u2019t have many things in common, which I think hurts the relationships with them. Today my bf was invited to hangout with one of his friends for their bday. I thought it was just a guys hangout so I really didn\u2019t think much about it, but then one of his friends brought along their partners(the two other couples). I was available to hangout and I knew of the plans for a couple weeks now, but every time my bf brought them up, it never included me possibly coming to hangout too. I know this may sound like ramblings, I\u2019m trying to provide all the details. It just feels like something changed, and I\u2019m not sure what I did to make this change, but I keep thinking about it, and I\u2019m worried that his friends just don\u2019t want to hangout with me included anymore. Especially because the last 4 hangouts I have not been invited to. I brought it up to my bf but he just brushed it off like don\u2019t be silly they like hanging out with you too. It just doesn\u2019t seem like that anymore.  How do I talk to my bf about this without coming across as too needy or am is this just over thinking on my end?\n\nTL;DR! Pretty sure my boyfriends close friends don\u2019t like hanging out with me. I brought it up in passing to my boyfriend and he brushed it off, that of course they do. But I haven\u2019t been invited to hangout since December and they\u2019ve hung out at least 4 times since.",

        "title": "Issue regarding house renovation with my (F29) partner (M31) of 4 years.",
        "content": "Hi,\n\nSo I (29F) bought my first home (by the method of auction) with my partner (M31) in December last year (huge milestone, as the UK rental system is completely broken!)\n\nWe were both very excited, if not a little nervous as it's a doer-upper (1989s build previously inhabited by a heavy smoker who did 0 upkeep of the place). \n\nAfter having a level 3 survey done which showed no major issues, we decided to get an asbestos survey done before beginning renovation (no building work involved). Asbestos insulation boards and asbestos tiles were found throughout the property and we were quoted \u00a38,000 for the professional removal. This was a cost that we were not expecting at all and it would have broken our budget for renovations. After a bit of thinking my partner and his mum decided to remove the asbestos themselves (following UK government guidelines). This wasn't the route I would have gone down, but in the end I supported their decision as long as I wasn't involved in it.\n\nI spoke to numerous professionals about what to do after the non-licensed removal of asbestos (most were disapproving of this) and the general consensus was having a professional air test done and possibly an environmental clean and a certificate of reoccupation. Having this done would give me huge piece of mind knowing that we can safely move into our home upon completion of renovation works. But it will cost between \u00a3500 and a couple of grand depending on options and quotes. The problem is my partner isn't willing to split the costs as he doesn't deem it an issue. He is very stubborn on this take. Both him and his mum also don't seem to see the seriousness of the issue, which I can't get my head around.\n\nIssue 1: I don't understand how I can get across how serious this issue is (both to him and his mum). It's like speaking to a brick wall, they just don't see it as a danger in the same way I do. My parents also don't understand how they are not seeing this. For context, I'm pretty health conscious and the health of myself and my loved ones is very important to me (I'm not a complete health freak though, I've smoked cigarettes socially throughout my twenties for example). But I absolutely CANNOT move into that house and potentially start a family without reassurance that it is safe. Home is sanctuary to me.\n\nIssue 2: His unwillingness to help pay the costs for the air testing for piece of mind has left me feeling unsupported and questioning the relationship. (Why should I have to be out of pocket?) (how would we deal with another large potential future disagreement?) (how do we move forward if I feel like my concerns aren't heard?)\n\nPlease help, this is keeping me awake at night and I just want to move forward and get on with life.\n\n**TL;DR;** : This is a sample summary of the TLDR rule, just copy the text in gray box. Is this going the right way?",

When we argue, we don\u2019t communicate\u2014we just ignore the issue, and when we meet up, it\u2019s like nothing happened. But it doesn\u2019t feel resolved; it just lingers.

Instead, I feel like I have to take on the \u201cman\u201d role in our relationship because I always have to tell him what to do. The bare minimum\u2014things like the sidewalk rule, standing behind me on the escalator when I\u2019m wearing a skirt, or letting me get in the car first\u2014are things I have to remind him of constantly. It makes me feel like he\u2019s not naturally looking out for me, and I hate that I have to spell it out.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to communicate what I need\u2014how I want to be loved\u2014but he doesn\u2019t really do the same for me.

He\u2019s persistent when he\u2019s horny, and I hate it because I\u2019m not really someone who enjoys sex like he does. And once, when I was sleeping, he did the deed. I don\u2019t know how to feel about it, but I know it\u2019s not okay.\n\nI\u2019m tired. I don\u2019t know what to do. Can someone tell me what to do?\n\n---\nTL;DR",

Wife suddenly appeared around the corner, and I quickly locked and hid it. She told me I looked very guilty. and to show her my phone. I refused. (obviously not wanting to ruin my ideas)\n\nBut she got angry and stormed off out the shop and then drove off to our next destination to pick up one the kiddos, telling me I could walk there or be left behind. (I've also been in hospital recently and was unable to walk for weeks still some pain currently)\n\nThis went on all day, I said hiding nothing, she said I was. Eventually I just told her what I was looking at, it was going to be a gift. She didn't believe me.\n\nI was on the bed and she lept on me, strangling me with her leg, trying to grab my phone off me. I'm not sure how but eventually we were back up, and she pushed me against a wall with a mirror on it, just as our daughter came up the stair and the mirror smashed behind me.\n\nTaking my phone, she could see the pictures I had taken on my whatsapp, but didn't believe me, started looking through it. I eventually took it off her and she then grabbed the laptop and started looking on that.\n\nMeanwhile, I was trying to tell my daughters everything is fine.\n\nIt became and endless loop \"tell me what your hiding\" - \"nothing\" - \"I know when your lying\"\n\nShe locked me out of our room, I obviously tried to get in, begged to come in, saying I am not hiding anything. \"Tell me what your hiding and we can sort this\"\n\nSo I ended up staying in the spare room, our daughter had woken up and joined me.\n\nAnd this has been the state of play since, she won't talk to me, saying I am hiding something, telling me I can just sleep in the spare room.\n\nI don't know how to convince her.\n\nYesterday she started saying stuff like, I can tell you are lying - who are you messaging, someone we know, someone we don't?  \nOh your shagging someone, much worse than I thought. I know you are lying I can see it in your face.\n\nNow she is telling me all the trust is gone and we are going to separate if I don't tell her what I am hiding by the weekend.  \nShe even went through my phone and laptop yesterday and said well you deleted it all now haven't you.\n\nI am not hiding anything.  \nI can see she is winding herself up, but I really don't know what to do and I certainly do not want our family torn apart.  \nI don't see how I can convince her I am not hiding anything - she just won't listen to reason\n\nTLDR  \nWife saw me hiding an innocent picture I was taking for a mothersday Idea, I quickly hid it.  \nShe doesn't believe me I am not hiding something even after seeing phone and laptop.  \nShe is now winding herself up thinking I am seeing someone else.  \nIs telling me we will separate if I don't tell her what I am hiding  \nI don't know what to do to resolve the situation.\n\nOther notes  \nWe have been together since young teenagers  \nI did talk to some people online when I was about 20 (16 years ago) after we had split up for a while because she was hanging around with her ex. But never since  \nWe have had issues, such a lack of sex in the marriage (her side) and stress from kids/life probably not getting enough time for each other.  \nI work hard, always doing probably more for/with the family than most dads. Usual household stuff, cooking, stuff with kids. Always being the best I can be.  \nRecently was ill and had to work from home - I couldn't walk for weeks.

        "content": "Please don\u2019t judge me because this situation is extremely messy. I met this guy on a dating app let\u2019s call him guy A so when I revealed myself to guy A on the dating app I wasn\u2019t sure if he was still interested in ,e bc I\u2019m insecure but I tried my best not to show my insecurities because I know confidence is attractive. Anyways guy A and me were chatting after I sent him some photos we were still chatting and it was 5AM for him and shortly after he went to sleep and i got insecure bc I didn\u2019t know he had fallen asleep and thought maybe he\u2019s not attracted to me and matched with another guy we will call him guy B. So I asked guy B for advice on guy A and wether guy A was attracted to me or not I sent him some pictures of me and me in gym outfits nothing provocative or crazy but it did show my figure and guy B said he thought I was pretty and my body was nice and he thinks it\u2019s unlikely guy A was not attracted to me. Guy B then said he wants to take me out on a date and I said no thank you and he said to send him more pictures and I said no and he said I\u2019m a narcissist and I\u2019m a bad woman and he will tell guy A about what I did since he knew his social media and expose me and tell him how I showed him my body for advice on myself, he said I used him and made him feel bad about himself and unattractive, he then said he would expose me and blocked me. Guy B also told me that guy A probably gets a lot of women and is a player and he\u2019s attractive and in good shape so there\u2019s no way he would be loyal to me and I said I don\u2019t care about looks or anything and I just like his character and he told me that I am superficial like all women and will probably end up marrying a rich ugly guy for his money.Guy A told me he had fell asleep that\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t responding and we continued chatting but due to time zone differences and his work we didn\u2019t talk that much and I told him it seems he is uninterested and I\u2019d appreciate him to be honest with me. He told me he apologises it\u2019s just a busy time for him, and we tried to make up a time for phone calling. After I texted him again saying I understand but I don\u2019t want to get hurt and it seems like I will especially with our distance I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll workout, guy A then sent me another text message and blocked me, I didn\u2019t get to see the text message he sent last as I was asleep and when I opened it, it had disappeared and said I was blocked so idk what he said to me. This really upset me and I thought it might be to do with guy B and I texted him on another platform asking him if he really went through with what he said he would and he said he didn\u2019t bc he didn\u2019t care enough, so now I got the closure that guy A didn\u2019t block me for that reason but another. I texted guy A on other platforms, TikTok and WhatsApp asking him why he blocked me with no explanation and I\u2019d really like a explanation, btw I told him before I wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship I was on the app mostly because I was bored at the beginning of when we met and I told him negate I\u2019m overly clingy and I always get left and he told me it\u2019s okay he is also clingy, overtime I began to like him and told each other we would like to get to know each other more, so idk why he blocked me. Guy A hasn\u2019t seen my texts yet idk if he will reply or just block me when he does. When I reached out to guy B he told me that I am obsessive and the guy knows that now, which I told him that I never showed signs of being obsessive except now that I\u2019ve texted him after he blocked me, that may seem obsessive. But not not that he knew of anyways before I was blocked so that doesn\u2019t make sense, guy B told me I don\u2019t deserve him or any good guy and I\u2019m a beg and a loser then he told me that guy A is way too attractive for me and I\u2019m not attractive enough to be with him and he\u2019s out of my league that I was punching which really did hurt me :( anyways that\u2019s the situation I\u2019d appreciate advice from anyone I know I shouldn\u2019t have reached out to guy B that ended up hurting me even more. But I just don\u2019t know why guy A would block ,e out of the blue especially when I was vulnerable with him explaining how it\u2019s hard for me to trust people.\n\nTLDR: he blocked me without an explanation after I told him I was unsure if he was interested in me ",

We are very close and have aspirations of a future together. \n\nHe told me a few months ago that he and his mom were looking for a house to buy together. (Telling me she wouldn\u2019t be able to do it without his help) I expressed my discontent to him urging that he think it over (Him being too young to commit to such a huge responsibility, Being tied down financially to a house and to his mother, not thinking about his potential future). \n \n Not to mention: he had little to do with talking to the realtor, going over the financial aspects. He didn\u2019t even build his own credit score to be eligible for the loan (Mom took a credit card out in his name because he didn\u2019t want to start building credit). \n\n It was met with a lot of backlash from him. He was very defensive and told me I should have more faith in him that he could do it and that he\u2019s obligated to take care of his family (mom and sister). It given me a lot of doubt about our future together. He completely dismissed the way I felt about his decision to get a house and went along with it anyways. \n\nIt crushed my hopes of one day getting engaged and finding a place of our own where we both decided what it looked like and where it was located. The house isn\u2019t very pretty, the bedrooms are small and close together, he didn\u2019t even get the masters room (his room is too small for two people\u2019s possessions). I feel lost and don\u2019t know if it is a big enough reason to end the relationship. It isn\u2019t what I would\u2019ve wanted for a future with my SO-to be stuck in\u2019s house a didn\u2019t have a say in, didn\u2019t own, didn\u2019t love. Is it reasonable to be upset over this and have wanted more with my future with him? I\u2019m unsure if I should call it quits. \n\n   TL;DR (21f) My boyfriend (21m) bought a house with his mom and completely disregarded my feelings on the situation. I fear he made a bad call going through with such a commitment so young and didn\u2019t stop to think about what me and him could\u2019ve had in the future together. Feeling torn about what I should do it my relationship if I am unhappy with what has been done. ",

We work together so it's very difficult but I've tried working from home for a long time (but my manager won't allow it anymore), I went out alone to eat lunch so I don't have to spend that hour with him, etc... he is a great friend and told me many times that I am the only person he trusts and that he likes our friendship a lot. To me it's clear that my feelings are not reciprocated. I'm older than him, he is very attractive and I'm not, and he is single and can have any woman in the world. \n\nMy question is: what should I do? We never did anything, never crossed a line, never spoke about romantic feelings or anything similar, we are just two buddies that hang out together all the time but this is it, I'm sure I'm just one of the guys for him. But I can't get rid of my feelings and I feel awful as my husband does not deserve this. Is having feelings for another person a reason enough to go away, even if I never cheated physically with anyone? I don't want to ruin my husband's life and these feelings might go away some time. But I want to be honest and fair and it is not fair that I'm in love with someone else, right?\n\nTL;DR : married for years but in love with someone else although is not reciprocated. ",

        "content": "TL;DR Husband brought up a past incident, how I hurt him before in an unrelated argument and I want to talk to him about it without it sounding like I'm trying to gaslight him.  \n  \nThrowaway account here. I was married before, and it ended after 2 years because of how toxic it became. Two years later, I met my now husband, and we've been together for 4 years, married for 1.  We had one major argument a while back.  A few months back, I had been chatting online with someone, and it got a little sexual\u2014not sexting, but we talked about sex. At the time, I didn\u2019t think much of it, but when I told my husband, he was understandably hurt. I apologized, explained that I hadn't see it as sexting, and promised it wouldn\u2019t happen again. I\u2019ve kept that promise.\n\nRecently, we had an argument about something else. I was asking for more clarity on something that bothers him, which we\u2019ve talked many times before. But the way I was approaching it made him feel unheard, like I wasn\u2019t acknowledging what we\u2019d already discussed multiple times. It got heated when I tried to explain that I wanted more clarity, and that sometimes the way he says things is a bit unclear, thats why I ask again. He got angry and accused me of expecting him to be okay with everything I do, and then brought up the chatting incident to say how I expect him to simlpy be ok with it. That completely shut me down. He said he\u2019s lost trust in me and that he\u2019s constantly worried I might try to reconnect with my exes, or start sexting other people, but he\u2019s afraid to say anything because he knows how it made me feel when my ex-husband used to demand things and try to control me.\n\nI just shut up after that because I know I hurt him, and I don\u2019t feel like I can ask anything of him right now. I understand that he\u2019s hurt by the chatting incident, and I\u2019ve apologized sincerely and promised it won\u2019t happen again. I\u2019m not asking him to forgive me, but whenever we talk about it, I\u2019ve always explained how and why I didn\u2019t think then it was sexting, even though I know know it is. I realize that may'vecome across as flippant. \n\nIts been a week now, but ever since, I've been feeling a little attacked. I'm not sure if I even have a right to feel that way, but the way that argument unfolded\u2014especially when he brought up that and my exes\u2014felt like it was meant to attack and silence me rather than him telling me how hurt he was. I want to express that to him, but I\u2019m not sure if I can without it sounding like I\u2019m gaslighting him. \n\nI know I messed up, and I can\u2019t change that. I\u2019m fully committed to doing whatever it takes to support him as he heals. But when this issue comes up in arguments, I struggle with how to respond. I don\u2019t want to make things worse or seem like I\u2019m dismissing his pain, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know how to talk about how I\u2019m feeling without it sounding like I\u2019m trying to deflect or manipulate him.",

I have always not really been FOND off her and its more so the situation of me meeting her how i always wanted to meet somebody so i just kept pushing through. Ill admit she is hot and has a dope style like me and into the same music but i always find myself talking to myself saying 'i dont actually like her' and even joking about to my co workers saying 'shes okay' she is a sweet girl and i do have love for her. Im gonna break up with her in september when she goes off to university. Why not now? Well because i like being her bf i just dont rlly like Her all that much and its okay having her as a partner and i want her to be my partner through summer.\n\nTL;DR: I (20M) dont like my girlfriend (18F) but want to keep going with her until she goes to uni as i just want a companion for this summer also so she isnt sleeping around the city with anybody i might know before she goes to uni ",

        "content": "\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for two years, and I\u2019ve been struggling with feeling unappreciated in our relationship. He\u2019s not affectionate which is fine to an extent. He never says \u201cI love you\u201d (or only mumbles it when I bring it up), doesn\u2019t kiss me, and rarely initiates physical contact beyond holding hands or occasional cuddling. When I asked him about it, he said he just isn\u2019t that type of person. Which I came to accept it until it comes to arguments where he shuts down and gets cold with me.\n\nHe also doesn\u2019t communicate well. When he\u2019s mad, he shuts down, acts cold, and ignores me until he \u201cgets over it,\u201d but the issue never actually gets addressed. I\u2019ve asked him to at least let me know when he needs space and that we\u2019ll talk later, so I\u2019m not left anxious and guessing, but he won\u2019t do that either. Meanwhile, I need to talk things through to feel okay, and the way he handles conflict leaves me feeling completely disconnected. \n\nAnother thing that confuses me is that whenever I ask if he\u2019s okay, he always just says \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d But he says that both when he actually is fine and when he\u2019s mad, so I never know what\u2019s actually going on. I told him that if he really is fine, it would help me a lot if he gave me some kind of small physical reassurance. Like a hand squeeze, a quick hug, or rubbing my back so I don\u2019t spiral into overthinking. But he hasn\u2019t made any effort to do that either (and he literally just states at me whenever I bring it up and goes back to his phone or doesn't acknowledge it)\n\nA recent example: I told him I\u2019m scared we\u2019re becoming more like roommates than partners. I don\u2019t need constant attention, but I\u2019d love small things like a quick hug or greeting when he (or me) get home instead of him just disappearing into another room. To his credit, he has improved in that area. He now makes an effort to greet me instead of isolating himself.\n\nTo be fair, he\u2019s very helpful around the house, takes care of my pets, cooks, and insists on paying for things (even big expenses like vet bills). So I know he cares, but it feels more like he wants a girlfriend for the sake of having one rather than actually loving me. The lack of emotional and physical connection makes me feel unappreciated and unloved, and when I tried to express that, he was shocked that I was this upset \u201cover something so small.\u201d\n\nIs this just who he is, and I need to accept it, or am I asking for too much? If he does acts of service, but I don\u2019t feel loved, is that a sign we\u2019re just not compatible? Would love to hear from others who\u2019ve been in a similar situation.\n\nIt\u2019s making me wonder if he even sees me as his girlfriend or truly loves me, or if I\u2019m just overreacting.\n\n\nTL;DR: My (27F) boyfriend (28M) is emotionally distant. He never says \u201cI love you,\u201d doesn\u2019t kiss me, and shuts down when he\u2019s mad instead of communicating. I\u2019ve told him I need small gestures (like a hug or greeting when we get home) to feel appreciated, and while he\u2019s improved slightly, I still feel more like a roommate than a partner. He\u2019s great at acts of service (cooking, helping around the house, paying for things), but I don\u2019t feel loved. It\u2019s making me wonder if he actually sees me as his girlfriend or loves me at all, or if I\u2019m just overreacting.",

This then changed and we were seeing each other regularly for around 6 months and only each other.\n\nI genuinely had feelings for him and we stopped speaking because he went travelling. He didn't want to be loyal while over there so I cut it off completely because I wasn't speaking to him while he was with other people. We haven't spoke now for a month and a half but I can't stop thinking about him and I don't know why. We both admitted we had feelings but we knew it wasn't right.\nI'm really struggling to get over him and I have tried to date but i seem to keep comparing them to him\n\nTL;DR we met on tinder in the January 2024, and we acted like we were together, were loyal to each other, so basically a situationship until he went away which I feel a bit stupid for but the way it was going didn\u2019t feel like it would stay that way \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated",

        "content": "My (26f) bf(27m) has different ideas about communication and planning, but they just feel disrespectful\n\nI (26f) and my boyfriend (27m) of a little over a year keep having disputes over having a social life outside of our relationship. He thinks that he should be able to plan whatever, without discussing it with me, and me having a say about how it could affect our plans is \u201ccontrolling.\u201d  \n\nFor context we have fought the past month about this, almost every weekend. He did not (to his own admission) make Valentine\u2019s day very special for me which broke my heart. He promised we would celebrate our 1 year the next weekend. Instead, that Saturday he planned to golf with the guys (because he \u201chadn\u2019t seen them in a while\u201d) so I didn\u2019t see him until 5 pm, and because I wasn\u2019t feeling well enough to go with our original plans (cramps) he made the decision we should go out with them. I agreed but I wanted him to acknowledge he made plans over our plans and I thought it was mean of him to plan a day of golf on a day we could\u2019ve spent together- especially our one year. Me asking him just to acknowledge this made him get defensive and angry.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHere is a text I sent him before that night that explains more of my feelings and why I feel the way I do. \n\nI want you to understand where I\u2019m coming from. You are always willing to ask me to reschedule- like bringing up how S had snowboarding passes and moving our plans around. - I know you don\u2019t mean to make me feel this way but it makes me feel like having to celebrate Valentine\u2019s day with me is a burden to you and you would much rather be doing something with him - This has happened in the past too, not just holidays. But if it\u2019s golf or something with the guys you do not consider rescheduling. If I asked you to do something when you already had a tee time booked you would say \u201cI already have a tee time.\u201d Sometimes I don\u2019t think you consider how this could make me feel less important than whatever you want in the moment/the \u201cboys\u201d -which is literally just S. \n\nThat plus S\u2019s character. He has continuously tried to show you nudes of other women (in front of me). Told me you get hard for other women. Yelled that M was a f*t b**** and should go to the gym. Yes he\u2019s funny sometimes and I get he\u2019s your friend, but immediately planning your weekend around golfing with him rather than attempting to plan with me, or just J makes me question why I am less of a priority than this man who puts me and other women down/ drinks the way he does etc. He is not a mature friend and it makes me upset when you do this- and you not telling me he was included in golf felt like it was on purpose. \n\nAfter the conversation we had on Sunday about how I feel like you don\u2019t prioritize planning nice activities/thoughful gestures, I assumed you would look at the weather and think that would be a perfect day for us to golf or do something outside- plan a picnic, take me up into the foothills for a hike, walk the greenbelt, so many options. I guess that\u2019s where my mind went, because I want to do my activities with you. I would prefer to do things with you over other people. And maybe it\u2019s not the case, but it makes me feel like you planned dinner around what worked for you rather than prioritizing making me feel special and cared for over what you wanted in the moment- playing golf and getting drunk with the guys. \n\nI think if you consistently showed that my feelings about this stuff mattered and talked through things with me I would feel differently. But based on the past, \u201c3\u201d hours is never 3 hours and my feelings end up getting screwed over at the end of the day. I want to trust you, that it will only be the time you say and you\u2019ll have energy for me after but historically that has not been the case. \n\nThis is something I don\u2019t want to continue to fight over, and I will continue to work on being easier going about planning times. But I also want to work on our relationship growth. In the future you cannot plan things over family time or disappear for 6 hours when you said 3. It is concerning to me that this is a concept that I continuously have to bring up. \n\nHaving separate activities is important, but boundaries are important. You golfing and drinking for an entire day when you promised me time later in the day is not the same as me seeing my friend for an hour and a half. Mostly because when I say a few hours I mean it, and I come back and make you dinner and make you feel loved. And that\u2019s not to say that you don\u2019t make me feel loved, but in the past you have not had the time to make me feel special as promised after a \u201cday with the boys\u201d which hurts my feelings.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nTo make up for that situation now we have dinner plans on Saturday night. He called me tonight and asked if he could go play pickleball at a place I have been begging to go to (indoor courts) with his friend and 2 mystery players. He wants to do this around 4 pm for a few hours and we have dinner at 8. We had discussed getting ready together and I was also upset because I know how the pattern goes, he will end up rescheduling our plans or asking to push them out or inviting friends along. He says I get upset out of nowhere and now he\u2019s afraid to ask me to do things because I get upset. He said I could just say no- which if I say no he gets upset anyways. I just feel like it\u2019s a no win situation for me. \n\nI know I could be more accommodating to his plans but it hurts my feelings that he would rather spend the weekend days with his friends, especially because we both work 9-5. I also am hurt that these are activities I enjoy doing and have expressed wanting to continue doing them just for him to do them with other people. He also likes to compare me seeing my friend for dinner for an hour on a weeknight to him planning his weekends with friends. \n\nI told him that I really need to see him be more affectionate and prioritize me if this relationship is going to work, and he told me I need to work on being more flexible and letting him do what he wants (which I believe is him saying I need to not \u201ccontrol\u201d him by asking him to keep his promises)\n\nWhat are everyone\u2019s opinions on this? Including your partner in general,etc? \n\nTLDR: I feel like my partner prioritizes other plans, what is everyone\u2019s opinions on including your partner. ",

        "content": "For simplicity my friend is R (F 23), and her girlfriend is B (F21). This takes place in USA Colorado \n\nOverview: My friend is dating someone who i feel whole heartedly is one of the worst people an average person could meet. B is horrifically abusive, entitled, and has a wholier-then-thou attitude to everyone, even her girlfriend.\n\nTheir current living situation: R and B have been dating for about 5 years. They started long distance and about 3 years ago B moved in with R. B had never had a job prior, and didn't seriously plan to get one once she moved in. She tried and quit before her first shift was halfway up. B adopted 11 cats in their shared one bedroom apartment (their allowed 1 by lanlord) R didn't want the cats, but wanted B happy. R works fulltime to support the both of them and their dozen cats, while B doesn't attempt to make any income.\n\nAbout B: B has a pretty rough history, she grew up in horrible abuse and has both physical and mental illnesses. I don't fault her at all for her cards delt or what she honestly cannot help. Because of a mix of her mental state and enviroment, she has a history of racism, sexism, homo+Trans-phobia, zoophilia, fat phobia, bullying, multiple charges of aggravated assault, and more. B and i were friends right at the same time she and R met, and were friends up untill late last year, which I'm embarrassed of after laying everything out. She doesn't clean the appartment she and R live in, she doesn't cook, she doesn't have friends, she spends her days arguing online and watching drama videos ONLY. Once R gets home from work, B berates her for not doing enough around the house, not spending enough time with her, spending the occasional spare dollar on her games and not B's games, exd. Its almost funnily horrible if it wasn't my friends life that its affecting.\n\nAbout R: R is autistic, and has a hard time making friends. R and I were very close, but stopped being friends for around a year almost 2 years ago because B hated me (for valid reason, but thats not tied to this situation). R still wanted to be my friend but she can't do things B doesn't like, so we cut contact. R is a sweet person, but i feel like takes verbal beatings every day from R for absoutley no reason. When pressed, all she can muster for why she stays is \"she keeps me grounded.\" R has previous mental health issues and has gone through heavy spouts of depression, and i feel she may be scared to be alone after dating someone for so long even if its someone as horrible as B. R also has a heart condition, and stress can cause it to flare up. B has caused R so much stress that she has fainted and had her heart stop on 2 separate occasions, and now that I'm not living with them I'm worried both of them on their own with few other people to help will cause it to flare up again. When telling my friends about this whole situation, I always end it with im almost sure that B is going to kill R either due to her heart condition or her own depression due to feeling theres nothing better then this abuse.\n\nWhy I'm worried / can't do XYZ: I know all these intimate details for fact because I briefly lived with them for a month, and saw all this first hand. I knew they didn't have a picture perfect relationship, and I knew that B was non-contributing to the money side of things, but i didn't think that she was literally screaming at R for having to work to put a roof over their head every. Single. Day. I do not live even in the same state as them anymore, and due to the falling out with B that made me move, R has me blocked everywhere and as of now never wants to talk to me again. I will respect her wishes if thats truly what she wants (which i feel her decision is more based on B making her block me, because thats what happened before and after we reconnected she said B made her block me and she was upset by it.) But if R truly doesn't want to hear from me ever again, that's ok. I just want her to wake up and realize she can feel love from others and not have to take care of someone that contributes literally nothing and her 11 cats she has to care for. I understand love isn't a give and take, but even love alone can't justify the years of abuse and tearing her down right?\n\nTl:dr, what am I supposed to do to help R if I can't even contact her or those around her? How do I make her wake up from a 5 year long commited relationship and take a step of independence?",

        "content": "Me (24M) and my gf (23F) have been together 11 months now just short of a year. We\u2019ve both been hurt a lot in past relationships. We actually both have said that we both didn\u2019t expect us to find a person again but it has been really perfect in the circumstances that led to us connecting and so we\u2019ve entered into this relationship neither of us saw coming. \n\nMy problem is that I have (without trying to sound heroic or better than) genuinely been able to open up again and to try for a connection after swearing it off completely while she came on strong and spoke very sweetly and genuinely about how good it was and how positive she felt about us in the beginning but has now weaned off of that dedication. I have genuinely been able to say that I have been 100% consistent and shown up in every way to make her as comfortable as possible to believe me in what I say. We went from future plans and houses and a rock solid future to her feeding into avoidant tendencies due to pain and disrespect from her past that has left her genuinely unable to fully trust anyone or to rely on somebody in that capacity and has now become dependent on outside validation from other people to really make her feel any type of value for herself again regardless of what I do (as it\u2019s been said that I am \u201cobligated to\u201d as her partner) \n\nI have confronted her about this with her social media and the men that have messaged her where she does not outright cheat but also entertains them for the sake of her ego and validation of self worth, and I have seen situations where she will purposefully not mention a relationship as not to lose the attention she gets. I know that as an attractive woman she will get approached and I do not feel insecure about that but rather it\u2019s the fact she does not ever mention a boyfriend or shut it down but rather lets them play into it for the sake of her own morale and I am feeling like a secret or almost something she is ashamed of. \n\nIn my head I will say that she would never physically cheat, (Please just take this without the naive comments that people will aim at my mindset) due to her past and what\u2019s been done to her, but it\u2019s very clear that unless it is something physical or a genuine \u201clove\u201d feeling that is expressed in those conversations that she doesn\u2019t see it as cheating but rather as validation that she enjoys to make herself feel better regardless of the things I try to do in order to validate her. \n\nI believe she is a very extreme avoidant and a lot of it is things she is still working through professionally with therapy but due to her being my genuine best friend and both of us initially expressing the same things a lot of it is trauma and so while I do agree it\u2019s not healthy I would like to either figure out how to not over invest myself while still pursuing this in hopes that she does finish the self-reflection she has already committed to or to make her genuinely at least stop hurting me (which is known and has been a conversation that she has said she will stop) but I will not resort to phone checking or monitoring her in the meantime of how to try and make this not only healthier but more communicative without triggering her avoidant responses so that an actual dialogue can be had to benefit the both of us if we still both genuinely want to make this work. \n\nMy genuine feelings are that this is something great that is being damaged by past trauma and I want nothing more than to be happy together as we were before the pressure and issues set in due to the weight of being serious and fears built out of previous pain without us ever having anything wrong in our actual relationship \n\nTL;DR my girlfriend is experiencing intimacy issues and connections within a healthy relationship and I need to know what, if anything I can do in order to right the ship through struggle caused by her insecurity ",

        "content": "The relationship was around 1.5 years. Started off fantastic, we had natural chemistry and things progressed fast.\n\nLast year I caught her in a lie regarding her whereabouts, she had been due to come over to my house but cancelled last minute saying that she had to help her dad with something and I should come over in the morning. When I arrived in the morning she wasn\u2019t there - I called and asked where she was and she said in a very groggy voice that she was at home home to which I told her she couldn\u2019t be seeing as I was standing outside the door and her car wasn\u2019t there. Subsequently found that she had actually been at a female friends house and stayed the night. Not sure exactly what had gone on - she had lied to me about her whereabouts even that morning so it was hard to trust anything she said. I told her that lying was utterly unacceptable and going forward it would be a dealbreaker if it ever happened again.\n\nIn the months following that incident she became short and distant, repeatedly blowing off plans and being disrespectful. I ultimately broke up with her and said I wouldn\u2019t let myself be disrespected despite my feelings towards her. Following this she made attempts to reach back out and told me she was devastated and that she wanted to make things work out with me, having always pictured marriage and kids. \n\nI told her that she would need to come and see me so that we could talk it out in person. She hasn\u2019t done so yet. Three nights ago she innocuously sent me a picture in a place which didn\u2019t appear to look like her house. Gut told me something was wrong. She had happened to leave location data on the picture; it was pinpointed to her ex\u2019s house. I called her and asked why she is at her ex\u2019s house - she denied it and said that the location must be wrong and that she was at home. I told her not to treat me like a fool and eventually she said that she was at her ex\u2019s house but only to see his mum because they had a great relationship and she (my ex) is struggling with her mental health. She said her ex wasn\u2019t home but they had been messaging. Evidently I don\u2019t believe this to be the truth. At the point this happened we haven\u2019t been broken up particularly long (a month or so). I wished her luck and told her that we couldn\u2019t proceed with her lies, but am wondering if she could be telling the truth?\n\nTL;DR (Ex) Girlfriend who had a history of lying during relationship was at her ex\u2019s house and lied to me about it, then said she wasn\u2019t seeing him but actually his mom. I already know that it\u2019s a lie but need to hear it from someone else ",

He often reads mangas or plays games when we're together, and when I've talked to him about it, he says he can't focus and can't do one thing at a time. \n\nLast month, we spent the evening at some friends of mine; there were five of us. Three times during the evening, he took out his phone and scrolled through Facebook or did various things on his phone for a little while before coming back with us. The first time, it was on the couch with everyone (but he wasn't engaged in the conversation, he was just on his phone), and the other two times, he actually got up and walked away from the table to go and scroll. Each time, it lasted between 15 and 30 minutes before he came back.\n\nWe also had lunch at my family's place on a Sunday (first time he was meeting my dad's side of the family), and after the meal, he went to sit on the couch and stayed on his phone for a very long time. \n\nWhen I talk to him about it, he says he's \"taking a break,\" that it's hard for him to focus and socialize for too long. But it bothers me because it gives the impression that he doesn't care about the people around him. I talked about it yesterday with the friend who hosted the meal, and he told me that he was a bit bothered by my bf's behavior. I'm anxious about what my family might think as well.\n\nTLDR : My bf is on his phone a lot, even when we are with my friends and family. \n\nWould that bother you ? Am I overreacting ? ",

        "content": "21F from the UK, I am on here because I have had a lot of my friends feel concerned about this relationship so I'm going to go into detail. (this is also my first relationship and we have been officially dating for nearly 3 months) I met my boyfriend at a uni halloween party, we danced together and he was also my first kiss. We were also seeing each other a few times since we had met on halloween, however when we would meet it wouldn't be for long, only a couple of hours as he would say he needs to go home and do chores. and sometimes on the days we plan to meet he would cancel and say he is unable to meet for whatever reason.\n\nhe asked me to be his girlfriend in december and i said yes. the day he asked me out, he asked me if i wanted to go to his place on christmas so we could do the deed but i felt like that was too soon but hes saying he isnt that type of guy. we met up again the week after on christmas eve and went for food and drinks, and i remember him mentioning bringing me to his home again (presumably sex) but i said no. on that night he was going through his instagram, and i dont know what was going through his mind to even do this but he showed me a video of a naked woman and obviously i was mad. i made him delete all of it off his instagram search. but he says that he swears he never searched any of it up. i definitely believe he is lying because i dont search naked men on instagram yet theres no photos of naked men popping up on my search, he must have searched it.\n\nthe week before he asked me to be his girlfriend he was with a mate and they were both being silly and driving around, he lives in london and i live in essex but they joked about driving to my town and they actually did, this was 1AM btw and ngl that freaked me out slightly. he said he wanted to knock on my window and ask me a question (he was planning on asking me if we wanted to be official) he actually drove down my road coincidently but i did not tell them my house number because i dont really want anyone knocking on my window at 1AM..\n\nso we are often meeting up and doing activities together, going out for food which has been fun and hes been paying for a lot of it which i appreciate but every single time we have met up he would mention sex and when i would say im not ready, he would say when will i be ready, how long will it be. which not going to lie has made me feel pressured and less interested. even one time when we met up he bought brand new condoms with him. i texted him last week about the issues i feel we have and he said he promises that he will change. but something feels off, i should be feeling excited to see him and swept off my feet but i dont. it almost feels forced on my side? even i have better chemistry with my friends and text them way more than my boyfriend sometimes texts me. from my other friends perspectives on this, they say they feel like there is something dodgy about my boyfriend and that they feel like this is going too fast. i have to agree because my boyfriend is already saying things like he sees himself marrying me one day and that im the reason why hes still here. he has 2 exes and he said that they felt that he didnt love them enough.\n\nim just questionning if he is the right guy for me. i dont feel like we really have deep conversations or interactions that arent as superficial if that makes sense and in comparison to my friends, and when we would meet he doesnt have any ideas on what activities to do and its me who has been planning it. i forgot to add when we went out together on valentines day we did do a lot together but there was a particular interaction during dinner that i keep thinking about. he said he really wants to take me to a bedroom and i said i was on my period, which i was. he seemed really disappointed. we were talking about activities to do after that dinner, and he said i should go home after the next activity if i am on my period, which i thought was honestly horrible and made me feel he didnt really want to spend time with me. i then said my period wasnt that heavy, and he accused me of lying about being on my period. honestly im not ready to have sex and i feel like i still need to get to know him more because i am very picky with who im going to make myself vulnerable to and my virginity is something important to me because ive resisted a lot of temptation to keep it. my boyfriend says that its his impulsitivity that causes him to ask me about sex all the time and that he gets horny all the time.\n\ndo you suggest i work on this or should i let it go?\n\nTL;DR \n\nmy boyfriend said he would change but he often mentions sex when we meet up and i dont feel we have many deep conversations and natural chemistry in the same way that i do with my friends. my friends feel like there is something off with him and that the relationships going too fast.

Should i be concerned?\n\n\nI 24F have been living with my boyfriend 32M for a little over a year now. We\u2019ve been dating for almost 4 years. At the beginning of our relationship, we would have sex ALL THE TIME. We couldn\u2019t keep our hands off each other. I know it\u2019s normal for that to change and for sex to happen less frequently in long term relationships, but in the past year, i\u2019ve noticed a lot of changes in him. \n\nHe hardly ever initiates sex and he turns me down all the time. If I didn\u2019t initiate, he could go a week or more without sex. He says he\u2019s tired from work some days. I understand that maybe he does feel that way, but he also doesnt really respond when i try to be intimate in other ways, like making out with him or cuddling. Im always the one to initiate those things and it makes me feel so shitty and unwanted.\n\nIs this normal? What should i do?",

        "title": "Our (26F+27M) Arguments Go in Circles\u2014How Do We Fix This?",
        "content": "Hey, all!\n\nMy partner and I have been together for almost 3 years. Naturally, we have good times and bad times. The one thing that is always \"bad\", however, is the way we argue. Arguments about quite simple things blow up into 2 or 3 hour debates about???? We don't even know by that point... Throughout our relationship, we figured out that the way I communicate can be aggressive and lead to him feeling accused. And so I tried to change this. Even so, and even using \"I feel so and so because so and so\" affirmations, my partner still feels accused because \"why else would you mention the cause of why you are upset if not to blame me?\" And then we are arguing about what blaming is, what attacking is, what style of argument we should be having, etc. All in all, we end up very far away from the main point... And additional point of me disliking the way we argue is: my partner always has to 100% understand the way I feel to relate to me and understand/accept why I am upset. It's just bonkers to me that I have to completely break down the way I feel, the circumstances that lead to it, etc. to get sympathy from him. But then, when I am in the middle of listing the circumstances, he is feeling attacked, because \"oh, so you're actually blaming me, then? If you're saying it's because of something I did...\" \n\nI have four major issues with this:\n\n1. I feel like I can't say anything to this man without him feeling accused.\n2. I feel like our arguments are only exhausting and are not satisfying! I feel like I go into the \"argument\" (shouldn't even be an argument at the beginning!) just wanting empathy and to find solutions with my partner, but I end up dissatisfied and frustrated. This creates a lot of distance between us, tbh.\n3. It feels like my partner only accuses me of accusing him to curb responsibility and avoid accountability.\n4. I feel like it's reaaaally hard to get empathy from my partner. \n\nSo: how can we stop having these pointless, exhausting arguments? How can we have healthy, fulfilling ones? Could it be that we just have these arguments because my partner is responsibility averse and therefore tries to avoid accountability by all ...arguments... necessary? If so, what do I do? In general, would you say I am doing something wrong?\n\nTL;DR: My partner and I have been together for nearly three years, but our arguments are always exhausting and unproductive. Even when I try to communicate calmly, he feels accused, and we spiral into debates about blame, argument styles, and definitions instead of addressing the actual issue. He also struggles to empathize unless he fully understands my emotions, but when I explain, he feels blamed. I\u2019m frustrated, feeling unheard, and questioning if he avoids accountability. How can we break this cycle and argue in a healthier way?",

        "content": "Hey all.. as the title suggests.. I have OCD which centres my relationship so thoughts can be quite intense regardless. I typically have stressful periods where my OCD flares up and tries to destroy everything. I don\u2019t always think like this. \n\nAnyway. I love my partner. If I was going to have kids, I\u2019d want them with him. He\u2019s such a lovely gentle and patient guy. He\u2019s also very conventionally attractive but really doesn\u2019t so much to help himself. And I mean this from a place of care and not judgement, especially because I fell in love with him like this. \n\nHe has long hair but never wears it down. He looks great with it down but voices that it just \u201cgets everywhere\u201d. I typically encourage him to cut it then into a trendy style.. maybe a mullet or even just shave it like he\u2019s been tempted to do but he never does. He doesn\u2019t stay ontop of trimming beards. He wears the same clothes everyday for every event, even going out. The same hoodie with his favourite show all over it and drug slurs (he only smokes weed occasionally, he\u2019s not a drug taker). But the clothes he wears are barely hanging by a thread and he just doesn\u2019t ever get new stuff? None of it\u2019s trendy? It\u2019s all stained? And I often dress in lots of colours, dresses, skirts etc and I just feel we don\u2019t match?\n\nOntop of this, he complains about his minimum wage job (and financially we\u2019ve felt it for awhile) but won\u2019t do much about it. He keeps saying \u201cwhen we move house, I\u2019ll do it\u201d (to the city so it\u2019s more opportunity) but he just hasn\u2019t. He did a couple online courses, enough to get him an apprenticeship of sorts for a higher earning job but then he will just never actively look for the work. \n\nI\u2019m someone who\u2019s very ambitious and driven, I\u2019m self employed and do a lot of things, side hustles and outdoor hobbies and travelling. And he doesn\u2019t really do much? I would hate to say we\u2019re not compatible because genuinely when I met him, it felt like a no brainer that we were meant to be together, but we\u2019ve fully built a life now and I know he wants to get better with things but just seems to be happy working a minimum wage job and playing his PC. There\u2019s a whole world out there, but it seems up to me whatever we do. \n\nTL;DR",

I feel quite attracted to him and sometimes even feel that i should have a chance in life to date him, even though i believe that I won\u2019t be compatible with any other guy as much as i am with my bf since he loves me too much, much more than i deserve maybe.

I know for sure that I'd like to have kids one day, ideally in the next 5 years. However, she initially didn't want kids. \n\nAs our love for each other grew, we talked about it and she's compromised and has told me that she \"would like to have kids for you\" (me), that she reserves the right to not have kids. \n\nThis terrifies me because I really want to have kids. I feel like it's one of my goals and purposes of this life to raise a family. She initially didn't want kids because she is afraid of the physical process and thinks it will prevent her from doing the things she wants to do, eg sports and travelling. \n\nI really want other's opinions on this. We had an argument last night where I said that I'm not sure if we're right for each other, and she said that I'm not appreciating her compromising for me. \n\nTLDR; I want to have kids, my girlfriend can't guarantee that she will have kids.

The couple (M&amp;F similar ages to us) each have their own demons.\n\nAt first it was going really well and my Wife was getting on really well and so was I and we'd been over to each others homes a few times. We each have children of various ages and genders and it was great watching them all play and us adults get along.\n\nFast forward to just before Christmas and things started to get a little strange. My wife was divulged some secrets/information about their CIL husband about being manipulative and controlling and always wanting to know where they were. And then later the husband was saying that the CIL was always arguing,  jealous and also controlling. It got to the point where my Wife went over and became an intermediary to try and save the relationship for the sake of the children. Which seemed to work, at least for a little while.\n\nThe CIL became very distant and the husband kept on about how his wife had major anger issues, it all seemed to point to that the CIL was the instigator to all this conflict, up until my wife met up with her CIL and was told what he was doing is what he's done in the past with her friends and family. My wife told her what the husband had been saying and now the husband has messages my wife saying \"thanks for that I thought I could trust you\". \n\nIt's left us in an awkward situation that we didn't even want to get involved with in the first place but only because of the children my wife wanted to help.\n\nTl;DR any advice on how to tackle conflict between a couple without us getting too stuck in the middle that conflicts with morality and respect.",

        "title": "(35M) I resent my mother (58F) and it's breaking my spirit",
        "content": "I am at a breaking point. I can't stop crying. My mother 58F,  wants to send my nephew 14M with Cerebral palsy and developmental disabilities to a group home. My sister 33F passed in 2019, and the father is not around.\n\nMy mother took custody of my nephew, and after my other siblings (23M, and 21F) stopped helping her, she moved last year to be closer to me so I can help her. I've spent the last 15 months helping her with my nephew. I helped get him into school (fighting the school districts for weeks to arrange transit and to instate an individual education plan.) I enrolled him in disability benefits and got him a K-plan with medicaid. It allows our family to hire a personal support worker to help him bathe, dress etc. I work 4-5 hours a week, taking the before school shifts that would be terrible to recruit someone. We now have full coverage, after I recruited my friends and family to fill every shift. I put my mom in charge of the schedule because her and my nephew are the center, and we are trying to work around them. \n\nMy mother won't actually do anything. She is 100% checked out. Without me organizing and scheduling these workers and keeping up with the benefits, my nephew will spend entire weekends in his soiled diaper.  She won't schedule the people I found and trained and got government benefits to pay them.\nMy mom will go out of her way to hide things from school officials, county officials etc. So that she won't be embarrassed.\n\nIt's my opinion my mother is weaponizing her incompetence, as she keeps demanding that I take custody, saying why don't you try doing better?\n\nShe starts fights with my nephew, and he doesn't know how to disengage, so they ramp each other up until there is violence. She is using this as justification to ship him off.\n\nMy nephew is a good kid with no behavioral problems in school, or at summer camp. Most of the problems stem from my mother's neglect. (Sending him to camp with a full diaper, or dirty soiled clothes.) When I try to hold her accountable, she blames all her problems on him. For instance, when she didn't meet him for the bus, I was getting calls, and she responded to me asking what her plan was by removing me as a school contact. \n\nMy mother shipped me off to teen challenge for 15 months when I was 15, because she thought I had behavioral problems (I was smoking a little pot). After teen challenge I went no contact, worked as a dishwasher, went to community College, then university, and now I'm married, own a home, and have a baby on the way. My wife doesn't want to take custody, since we have our own family. (And a really small house)\n\nMy mom wanting to send my nephew away deeply triggers me. I can't stop crying. She doesn't want to even try. I want to go no contact but I can't abandon my nephew.\n\nAny advice or thoughts would be much appreciated. \n\nTldr: my mother is neglectful of my nephew, despite having extra support, and itbis rocking me.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "I (22M) am in a healthy happy relationship of 5 years with my GF(23F) but I am constantly in doubt about our relationship",
        "content": "As the title suggests me(22M) and my GF(23F) have been dating for 5 bordering on 6 years but have mostly been apart or long distance due to university and COVID. She is a lovely person. Very bubbly and very communicative and I love her for those things. The thing is now things are starting to get more serious. I've got a new job and she wants to move in with me closer to my new job so we can live together. As a result I've been thinking about our future a lot recently and the problem is my gut is telling me that she's not the person I want to spend the rest of my life with but in my head I can't justify this as in every other way she's a very lovely person. I find myself nitpicking our relationship and overthinking every thing we don't have in common as if its a good reason we won't work and i'm searching for something to make the reason for the breakup easier. The thing is we don't have a lot in common in terms of interests but we've been together so long and get on so well I just don't know how I can justify it to myself.\\\n\nEqually if what I feel is real, I know that if I leave these feelings bottled up it'll only make the hurt worse later on. Especially since she's giving up so much to move in with me, I can't in good conciensce let her come if I know I'm not confident on our future.\\\n\nI already had a conversation with her in which I tried to be as honest as possible without explicitly saying I wanted one thing or another. She was heart broken that I didn't seem to want the same things as her but she said she still wanted to go ahead with moving in together and that things would change once we lived together. At the time I agreed because we were both very emotional, but unfortunately her response doesn't make things any easier for me. If anything it feels worse, like I've now given her false hope when I shouldn't have.\\\n\nI've thought about this so much and I just can't get my brain to stick to one decision. A part of me tells me to take a chance on her as I have done the past 5 years and let her move in with me in the hopes that seeing each other all the time will change things. Another part of me tells me these feelings will always be there and that I should just stop before the pain gets worse. Either way I feel terrible that I don't seem to have the same excitemenet she does about our future and worse than that I feel like I'm leading her on. So should I end things with her now and save her any future pain or should I wait things out and take a chance on her?\\\n\nTLDR: should I end things with gf over a gut feeling or should I wait things out and take a chance on her?",

        "content": "I need some advice. First a backstory. I was in a 3 year relationship that ended over a week ago. There were lots of issues and yes, a lot of those issues were from me I can admit that. Right before the break up my ex was very adamant on  talking to this girl he works with. I never liked the idea mainly because my intuition was telling me not to trust her. \n\nAnyways long story short, we broke up and immediately following they began to get closer and be flirty with each other. I saw the girl in public. I wasn\u2019t 100% sure if it was her but when her eyes met mine I thought she gave me a dirty look. I did nothing about this and ended up leaving the establishment.\n\nThe other night my ex pretty much said he wanted to see me, so I went to go meet up with him and I expected us to have a talk. As soon as got there he got into my car and sat down and he told me, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here right now..\u201d I laughed and said \u201cno you shouldn\u2019t but the universe is crazy\u201d Come to find out he got stood up by the girl as mentioned above. She had left him on delivered for over 12 hours yet was still posting on her stories. All he wanted to do was to hang out with her. And she didn\u2019t want to. The only time she wanted to hang out was at their place of employment because (IMO) she could brag about it. As soon as my ex wanted to go hang out one on one with her she stopped answering. \n\nThat\u2019s why my ex saw me. I felt like I won in the end because he got stood up but I still showed up to be with him even after EVERYTHING! We talked and I find out that the girl did in fact give me a dirty look when I saw her and bragged about with a smile on her face to my ex\u2026not only that, as we were talking she coincidentally sent him a selfie on Snap. After 12 hours of being on delivered. So he answered and said he was with me and as soon as she realized he was with me she was basically telling him \u201cif you still want to go hang out like we planned you can come pick me up!\u201d What upset me was the fact she had no interest in him UNTIL she knew I was there. I even said to him it was weird that only when I was brought up she cared and on top of that I told him \u201csee this is exactly why I didn\u2019t trust her, I knew I was right\u201d\n\nMy ex and I finished our conversation and he asked if I would be angry if he went to see her. I was honest and said yes but it really doesn\u2019t matter anymore. I was more upset I left my house in bad weather to meet up at the other end of town to talk and then when I get there I\u2019m being told about how he\u2019s mad and confused at her for basically ghosting him out of nowhere and as soon as she gave him the time of day he wanted to stop our convo and go see her.\n\nWe both mutually decided that we need a month of no contact what so ever. And after the month we can talk and see where our heads are at. But if I\u2019m going to be in competition with this one girl who only cares about him when it\u2019s convenient for her, should I even bother trying to win my ex back? Do I risk us getting back together only because she is unavailable for him? I genuinely just don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nTLDR; got dumped, girl I was worried about in the relationship is playing games with both my ex and I, not sure if it\u2019s worth my time anymore ",

We have sex and I give him head but since then he hasn\u2019t asked again or tried to reciprocate oral .. do you think he doesn\u2019t want to or is it maybe because he is nervous and thinks I don\u2019t like it because I rejected him doing it the one time ? If anyone could answer and voice your opinions  .. my low self confidence is thinking that it\u2019s something wrong with me .. or is it likely that he is nervous to try it again since I rejected it the last time .

        "content": "TLDR: Made a post here not so long ago about a guy saying he was going on a 2 week vacation with a \"person\" and only later on tells me that it's his good female friend. I sadly deleted this post later on because I thought I was worrying over nothing. I made the mistake of trusting his words when I asked him about everything last sunday, he comes over to my house, has sex with me twice, then ghosts me for 2 days straight, never texting me about the \"surprise date\" he had planned for me on tuesday. I drink so much liquor that I puke not long after, my mom who hates seeing me like this goes full on detective mode and finds out... HE LIVES WITH THE GIRL. HE LIVES WITH HER. THAT IS WHY I WASN'T ALLOWED TO VISIT HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT BINGOBONGO FUCKING APEDILDO COCKSUCKER LIVES WITH HER. I confront him by sending him a long text explaining everything and that I wanted to end things between us, he responds sonething along the lines of \"Damn your mom is kinda crazy for that. Sorry it turned out this way. Thank you for the good memories and good luck.\" No apology, no nothing. A day later, I started questioning rverything and started to blame myself, thinking that I blamed an innocent man who just wanted the best for me and did nothing wrong, that he told me he had difficulties witu opening up and that I was a creep and a weirdo for intruding his personal space. Unfortunately, in a moment of weakness, I texted him saying how sorry I was for BREAKING HIS TRUST. I now see the irony of that. Thankfully he texted me back by saing it's ok I'm not nad at you, it's just really creepy that your mom did all of that stuff and that is not your fault, good luck and thanks for everything. With this message, I was finally at peace and replied with a final goodbye, wishing him only the best for his future. I am finally at peace.\n\nHow do I cope? I feel beyond betrayed. I have the feeling thar I'll get played like this many more times in the future. Are all relationships like this? Will I find someone who treats me right?\n\nLonger version:\n\nAbout a week ago, I made a post on here asking for advice over a situation. I regretfully deleted that post afterwards. But anyways, here's a short summary:\n\nI've been seeing this guy for about two months, he would take me on sweet dates, always paying for everything, he came over to my house three times and had sex with me every time, he met my mom and my dogs, he would constantly kiss me and hold my hand and pick me up to spin me around in the air.... I have never been treated with such tenderness in my life, ever. I honestly thought he was the one.\n\n\n He'd always tell me he'd want to take things slow and get to know me better, thus not wanting to label our relationship early on \"due to previous bad experiences\". At the start of the two of us meeting, he told me about this 12 day trip he had planned right around his birthday and he'd have a mystery \"person\" in tow, avoiding the question who it was... up until one night, when he revealed that this person was his \"good female friend\". \n\nWELP!!!\nI confronted him last sunday, he lied and manipulated me into staying with sweet words and whatnot, we get something to eat and he sleeps over at my house. We have intercourse twice as well. He makes plans for tuesday saying he know a cool spot and that he'd message me. He ghosts me for the next two days, uploads pictures on instagram and unfollows me as soon as I like his pictures... I go to investigate, find the \"friend's\" Insta and see a pic of her on HIS sofa wearing pyjamas. There's also lots of pictures of her dog near a lake, the same lake he lives right next to. I get extremely sad and paranoid, drink so much liquor that I puke my fucking guts out and stay at home the whole time...when I confront him again saying I was sad that he didn't text me about going out together on tuesday, he brings the lame excuse that he \"forgot because of stress. I'm sorry, fuuck\". \n\nMy mother who hates to see me suffer like this, behind my back, brings out her astoundingly good detective abilities and finds out where he lives, what her name is (I very much don't approve of doing this and she only told me she did this later on, I mean I'm still glad she did that because it opened my eyes, but I don't think it's morally correct.), then goes to tell a friend that she should check his mailbox and look at the named to see  if he truly does live alone. \n\nTURNS OUT THE GOOD GUY FUCKING LIVES WITH HER. HE LIVES IN THE SAME HOUSE AS HER. My fucking heart sank to the ground when she told me. He lied about everything. He lied about living alone. He lied about why I couldn't come visit him. He lied about me being the only one in his life. I texted him this morning explaining that I know everything and that I wanted to end all of it, thanking him in the end for all of the good times. He responded by saying that my mom wad kinda crazy, that he was sorry it turned out like this and thanked me back for the memories. He didn't deny it, and he didn't apologize.\n\n A day later, I started questioning rverything and started to blame myself, thinking that I blamed an innocent man who just wanted the best for me and did nothing wrong, that he told me he had difficulties witu opening up and that I was a creep and a weirdo for intruding his personal space. Unfortunately, in a moment of weakness, I texted him saying how sorry I was for BREAKING HIS TRUST. I now see the irony of that. Thankfully he texted me back by saing it's ok I'm not nad at you, it's just really creepy that your mom did all of that stuff and that is not your fault, good luck and thanks for everything. With this message, I was finally at peace and replied with a final goodbye, wishing him only the best for his future. I am finally at peace.\n\nNow I just feel relieved, yet empty. This man was everything I could think of for over two months, I bailed on plans with my friends just for him. I feel so used, so stupid for giving him another chance and letting him sleep over again just to get hurt some more in the process. I feel so dumb for trusting him. And I am so so sorry I didn't listen to your guys' advice when I first posted here. You were all telling me to block and leave him, that he was a bad guy, and I chose to downplay it. The red flags were all around me and in my face, but I chose to ignore them just so I could forget myself in the intimacy he showed me, believing that I could \"fix\" him. I feel SO stupid. I'm sorry. \n\nThere is one good thing I can take out of this: he was always loving and respectful when it came to intimacy. He made me feel beautiful, despite of the scars on my arms and my bacne which I am very insecure of. I started to see my own value and now see that people really don't care all that much about stuff like that. I feel much more comfortable in my own body.\n\nDoes love always feel like this? How do I cope after a situation like this? How can I start trusting other people when my first relationship with a man goes like this? Please someone give me some advice. Thank you for reading my story and I wish you all the best. &lt;3",

I haven't had a real conversation with the guy since before my husband and I started seeing each other. I live thousands of miles away from him. I never even thought of him until recently, randomly I had a memory in a dream. Now I can't stop. My relationship with my husband is okay-ish. I try to look at what I should be grateful for. He isn't abusive, he does care, etc. I just have always felt like we act more like roommates...even before we married. This random ex wasn't even a long-term relationship. I knew him when we were kids and we \"dated\" for like two weeks when I was 18. I wonder if this a \"what could have been\" moment, but honestly I already know my life would have been a mess with him. I want to talk to my husband about this but I highly doubt he wants to hear that I cannot stop thinking about another man. My husband is by far the better of the two. I honestly don't understand what's going on right now in my own head. So, do I talk to my husband about this? Is there a way to approach this with my husband for help without causing him to doubt me or get jealous, or hurt in any way? And maybe advice on how to get my mind to get her shit together? Please help.\n\n  \nTDLR: Cannot stop thinking of an ex who I haven't spoke to in over ten years. Don't want him back but obsessing. Don't know if I should talk to my husband about this or how.

        "content": "\nHi. I (23F) am currently unsure of what my feelings are towards my friend (26M) and I was hoping someone could help me decipher them. We just got out of no contact and I\u2019m hoping to figure it out before trying to get closer. \nBefore no contact, we were normal friends for about 6 months. We got super close. I think I had a small crush on him, I\u2019m still not sure. Who wouldn\u2019t have a crush on him? He looks like he could model. Then one day out of the blue, he confessed to catching feelings. I wasn\u2019t sure how to react so I unfortunately, went back and forth with the \u201cI like you too\u201d and then \u201cthis isn\u2019t a good idea, we shouldn\u2019t do this\u201d it\u2019s cruel, I know, I didn\u2019t mean to. This lead to us having a strange sort of friendship with romantic undertones. There were a lot of ups and downs and eventually I said to him \u201cwe need to go back to being normal friends\u201d which somehow made the situation worse and more awkward, and honestly didn\u2019t fix the romantic undertones part. I\u2019m one of those people that\u2019s good at pretending so I automatically think others can do the same. This weird friendship lasted for about a year, until I abruptly threw myself into a new relationship with someone else. No contact started because of life circumstances and respect for my boyfriend, not a fall out. As soon as my new relationship ended, I went and reached out to my friend, I felt like it was allowed since I was single. It had been almost two years. \n\nI have the same feelings about him now, as I did back then. I\u2019ve never felt so understood by someone. I feel like I can see who he is on the inside and i really like what I see. I really like what I see on the outside too, very much. I get excited when I get a text from him, I could talk to him all day. I\u2019d do anything for him and he\u2019s on my mind very often. He\u2019s the biggest muse for any art I create. When I had to stop talking to him, I went through a bad grieving phase that lasted around 3 months. I thought about him constantly in no contact and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t stop. \n\nBUT. I don\u2019t think I could ever see myself dating him. It\u2019s not because he lacks any qualities I\u2019m looking for, I just feel wrong about it for some reason. At the same time, I get slightly jealous when he gives someone else attention. I can\u2019t see there being anything past a friendship with romantic undertones. It just feels wrong, but if that\u2019s the case, why do I have such strong feelings towards him? If someone could help me figure myself out, that\u2019d be great. I don\u2019t want to try and get closer to him again without even knowing my intentions. \n\nTL;DR; : How do I decipher if my feelings are romantic or platonic towards someone? ",

She started blocking/unblocking me as she pleased, and our last conversation made me feel like I was just an option. Now she\u2019s gone, and I don\u2019t know if she ever really loved me.*",

        "content": "My partner(26F) and I(26M) have been together for 8 years, we met in College and lived together for 5 years now. We love each other so much and pretty much have a perfect life together. We don't have a lot of shared interests, but that doesn't matter to me because I enjoy just being around her and being a part of her life. She makes me happier than anyone else could and I like to think the same is true for her. \n\n\nMy best friend(26F) is also someone I met in College, actually the day before I met my gf. We lived together for 2 years with other friends and have always been really close, she's one of those friends that I can talk endlessly with. We didn't see each other for 3 years until I moved to the same city where I now live with my gf. We've rekindled our friendship and probably see each other once a week, sometimes more, often just watching movies or listening to music and chatting. We also text almost every day, which is quite a recent thing as it used to be every few weeks or so.\n\n\nI'm aware that this might be uncomfortable for my gf, I think it's pretty normal to sometimes feel jealous or suspicious about mixed-gender friendships. I try to never neglect time with my gf, I only see my friend when we would just be doing separate activities or she's busy or away. I don't think she seriously thinks there's anything going on between us, but lately she has made more comments. It's usually just joking, she'll call my friend my 'other woman' and that type of thing. She's been travelling for work lately and has said things like 'you won't miss me, you have (friend's name)'. She's been serious too sometimes, making me promise not to cuddle with my friend if we're watching a movie which obviously we wouldn't do, and once said she's felt left out because she's also friends with my friend.\n\n\nI feel a bit lost currently, I love my partner and spending time with her is the best thing. I don't want her to think I don't love her or enjoy her company, or that I have feelings for someone else. On the other hand, my friendship is really special and important to me. I have other close friends but none that live close and I can see so regularly. I know that as we get older it's hard to have this type of frienship so I want to hold onto it for as long as possible. \n\n\nMy question is, is this too close or intimate for someone in a relationship? Is it seriously possible to maintain a close friendship with the opposite gender? Should I press my gf more for her true feelings about us? I wouldn't judge how she feels about it, I just don't want her to be upset when I could do something about it. Should I run this past my friend and see how she feels about it?\nI know these might be unanswerable questions but any thoughts and advice are appreciated so please speak your mind.\nTIA.\n\n\nTL;DR - I see my best friend regularly and text most days, my GF has made a few comments about how close we are. Not sure if I should open this issue with my GF or pull back on the friendship, which would be sad for me.",

And we had some fights.\n\nMost of the time it is usually me who compromises and apologizes.\n\nWe just had a conversation that really shook me at my core and gave perspective on everything.\n\nShe\u2019s a very career oriented Type A personality woman. I am very unconfident, Type B personality. I work in government because I just wanted to be somewhere safe and stable. I make more than 6 figures. I\u2019m not looking to really go into the private sector because of the volatility and I would much rather work in a stable environment, working towards a pension. I\u2019ve seen my friends being laid off and I don\u2019t think I mentally could handle it. I\u2019d probably spiral down into depression.\n\nShe\u2019s always looking to grow and improve herself. Always willing to learn and not be left behind. Our education levels are also vastly different as well. I\u2019m an Engineer. She\u2019s in medical.\n\nBasically, I\u2019m a guy who likes to drink soda (metaphorically speaking). Soda isn\u2019t healthy at all. But she\u2019s telling me to not drink Soda and to drink Water instead.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just include career. It feels like it includes all facets of my life.\n\n-I very much enjoy gaming but it can be seen as a waste of time. And I can and probably will be feeling the pressure to give it up. Because I could be studying and improving myself career wise.\n\n-I enjoy eating unhealthy foods and she prefers me to eat healthily. Makes sense since she wants me to live a long life. But i am being pushed to give it up.\n\n-She wants me to eventually quit my current job and find better opportunities. That\u2019s what she does and she just wants both of us to make more money. She does make more than I do by a significant margin. But I never expect her to take care of me financially.\n\n-She also wants to raise kids where they are smart and very capable. Very independent. All I really care about is if they are happy and that\u2019s they live a happy life, that\u2019s my number 1 priority. So I feel like fundamentally it\u2019s different.\n\nLogically, all of the stuff she has said makes sense. I could be improving myself to make more money by giving up video games and by continuing studying/advancing my career.\n\nI don\u2019t drink. I don\u2019t smoke. I don\u2019t gamble. I don\u2019t party. I\u2019m just a simple guy who goes to work and plays video games to relax/destress from work.\n\nI don\u2019t feel supported in pretty much anything.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be even me after all of it or that I\u2019ll be happy\u2026\n\nI also have to be honest if I\u2019m properly give myself introspection, I\u2019m not fully developed or mature enough at my age. So I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being unreasonable here since logically it all makes sense.\n\nAm I just being too immature about all of this?\n\nTLDR; my GF is very type A personality. She wants me to eventually give up my only hobby ( gaming cuz it can be seen as a waste of time and she has called it stupid in the past), leave my job in the government to work in private sector for more money and to advance my career, and agree to her way of raising kids is the definitive way to raise children. Type A GF. Type B BF. I never liked being pushed but this feels like fundamentally everything about me. And only I\u2019m expected to change on all of this. Am I truly being immature about this?\n",

I started apologizing profusely and my bf said in a slightly annoyed voice \"stop, it's okay,\" and \"bapped\" me on the head. It was too light to he considered a \"hit\" but hard enough to not be considered a \"tap.\" \"Bap\" is the closest word I could think of.\n\nThis happened maybe 6 months ago, and nothing else like this has happened in our relationship before this or since. I've read online threads about early signs of physical abuse, and he hasn't shown any signs of him becoming physically abusive at all, except for this one \"bap\" incident. Whenever he gets angry, he never screams or yells at me or does anything physical to me. He usually leaves the room to compose himself before he comes back so we can have a civil conversation. Am I overthinking this one incident or is it a sign of something more?\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend \"bapped\" me when he got slightly annoyed at me and I'm wondering if it could be a sign of future physical abuse?",

As she has a crush on someone else, my question is, is it ok to keep on crushing on someone even though they don't like you back? My original plan was to just wait until she tells me she doesn't have a crush on the other guy anymore, (we tell each other everything, except for my feelings for her, obviously) but is that ok?

We were only dating for 3 months but I really liked him and cared about him. I won\u2019t get into why he did it, im at a point where  I\u2019ve come to terms with it and have moved on tbh. I\u2019m single and I feel like I might be single for the rest of my life. I might do a terrible job trying to express myself so bare with me please. \n\nPutting myself out there and trusting people has always been difficult. I have social anxiety and honestly feel as if I\u2019m not understood by anyone im around. Maybe it\u2019s been mostly surface level for most people I\u2019ve been around for example im really bad at understanding when people are joking with me, honestly because when people are joking with me they do little things to poke fun at me and I always feel the need to defend myself. I guess that just lead to me being more quiet and shy and not really expressing myself. \n\n\nI honestly have a hard time with people and letting people in my space for extended periods of time. I guess I just fear that they won\u2019t actually like me and I\u2019m not the kind of person anyone would want to be around long term. The thought of being around another man honestly doesn\u2019t sound appealing to me in the slightest. I\u2019m not a man hater by any means, if I\u2019m being honest here I don\u2019t like the thought of being around them. Maybe I just don\u2019t have the energy to go through another getting to know someone stage. \n\nHas anyone just ever felt like they weren\u2019t meant for anyone? Like there will be no one out there who will truly like or understand them. I\u2019ve been a solitary creature for majority of my life but I still want companionship and maybe love. I have a low tolerance for people so I kinda prefer sexual relationships that don\u2019t get very close. I don\u2019t really want to do that anymore, I really enjoy sex but would like to enjoy it with someone i like. I know it may seem like I have this negative view of myself and other people but I truly don\u2019t. I guess I\u2019d take any advice on how to change my perspective? To try and create more positive relationships/interactions with people. Any advice would be appreciated here idk what\u2019s wrong with me tbh. \n\nTL;DR got ghosted by my ex not sure how to navigate relationships moving forward. ",

We have had a few hiccups, as most couples do, but this one has by far been the worse. My bf decided that we wanted to go abroad next semester randomly. He mentioned an interest maybe once or twice in the past month or less. He then randomly called me saying he is going to do it. Obviously, it is definitely an adjustment and something that him and I would have to discuss on the future of our relationship and if LD is something that would work. I also want me make it very clear, I think this is a great opportunity and he should live his life. I don\u2019t get a say on the choices he makes in his life and i would never want to, but when it comes to our relationship I have a say. Long story short he told me he was going to do it after committing. He claims it\u2019s all last minute and spontaneous and we will work out and it\u2019s going to be hard but he knows we can and blah blah \u2026 he doesn\u2019t seem to want to understand my point of view . My perspective is that of course he can do what he wants, but making a big decision that effects our relationship without even considering how i may feel hurts so bad. He did not ask me once about how i felt about him going and how our relationship would go and if I am willing to do LD. I just feel so heartbroken that he did not consider how blindsided I feel that he did not even tell me till so last minute. I finally brought it up to him and told him how i felt and he was so mean and defensive and said he was not ready to have that conversation because he was scared\u2026 like once again your seeming to forget there\u2019s two people in this relationship and you made a huge choice that had an effect on it. I feel like he has just been telling me what i want to hear when he \u201capologizes\u201d, because it some how ends up my fault and my problem? What do I do with this situation? Am I being selfish or are my feelings valid?\n\nTL;DR! : My bf 20M told me 21F he was going to go abroad next semester after he signed up.

        "content": "Our relationship started in university, but my boyfriend is now a graduate and working, while I finish my studies two years after him. Because of this, he never really had the chance to meet my friends properly and only knows their names. We don\u2019t have a shared space to hang out, so my friend group from my department and my romantic life are mostly separate, with only one or two mutual friends.\n\nI was really excited that my boyfriend was visiting my university (and his old one) to spend the day with me. I told my friends that \"finally, we\u2019d reunite,\" and he saved a seat for all of us at the university canteen, where we could meet him after our classes. However, when we sat down, they didn\u2019t greet him or ask him any questions. I introduced him to them, but after that, the conversation carried on as if he wasn\u2019t there. I felt awkward, so I moved closer to him and hoped someone would ask him something\u2014just a simple question like, \u201cSo, how\u2019s work?\u201d or \u201cWhen did you graduate?\u201d He tried to engage in the conversation, but the girls kept talking about the latest class or the professors. Keep in mind, these are my BEST FRIENDS from my department.\n\nLater, I went to grab tea for us, and one of my friends came with me. I politely asked her if she could talk directly to him so he wouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable in an unfamiliar setting. She said ofc, but when we returned, she didn\u2019t. Then my best friend came over and didn\u2019t even say hello to him! This was the first time she had seen him in person, after a brief 5-minute conversation 1.5 years ago. It was really odd. She only talked about not having slept, put her bag down, and said mentioned she was going to get food. When she came back with her food, she only spoke to the other friends, completely ignoring him. I was really sad and uncomfortable, so we left about 20 minutes early before the break ended.\n\nI cried afterwards because this wasn\u2019t at all how I imagined the meeting going. I was imagining us laughing, joking, they would greet him and tell him things about me etc. They weren\u2019t specifically rude, but they weren\u2019t welcoming or warm either. For context, I really love my boyfriend and have never spoken badly about him to my friends. All they know is that he makes me really happy. Two of my friends are lesbians and tend to speak negatively about men, but even so, I expected them to act kindly and normal for just 15 minutes if they truly value me.\n\nHow should I deal with this situation? I feel like I might start distancing myself from them slowly and might act passive-aggressive because they made me feel really lonely and misunderstood. I\u2019m the kind of person who always tries to make everyone feel included, especially if they seem left out, and I would never act like they did. These aren\u2019t my only friends from the department, but they were the closest. This is my last semester of undergrad, so I don\u2019t want to leave campus feeling bitter. I don\u2019t want to bring it up with the entire friend group because each of them acted differently, though none of them were particularly warm or friendly.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend of 3.5 years (24M) met my friends (23F, 23N/B, 21F, 23F) for the first time, and their attitude made me uncomfortable. They barely acknowledged him, didn\u2019t ask him any questions, and acted cold toward him, despite me introducing him and trying to make him feel included. I felt really hurt and left early. I\u2019m now feeling isolated and unsure how to deal with this, as I don\u2019t want to distance myself from my friends but also don\u2019t want to feel misunderstood. How should I handle this?",

        "title": "Is my (27f) jealousy towards my partner's (32f) actions excessive?",
        "content": "I don't know how to start, so I'm going to try to sort this out as best as possible. It's going to be long, so I apologize in advance.\n\nFor over a month now I feel like my jealousy has gotten out of control. I stayed at my partner's house for the entire month of February (for Valentine's Day and because it was our first anniversary as a couple) and we did nothing but argue. We do literary roleplay on Twitter, and she was very invested in playing her character and socializing with other people there, to the point that I felt like I was coming second when I expected to spend a lot of quality time together being there in what was our special month. In roleplay she was in a group chat that I didn't enter, it took her days to tell me she was there and when I asked her she said she hadn't told me anything because she knew I would get overwhelmed with so many people and because she thought that if she invited me I would say no. Days later I got up the courage to try and asked the administrator to put me in the chat. I'm not very good at socializing (I'm autistic) so I spent hours waiting for the right moment to come in and surprise my partner, when another user said goodbye to go to sleep. Everyone else said goodbye in the normal way, with a \u201cGood night!\u201d or a \u201cGet some rest!\u201d but (from my perspective) my partner's response was not so normal and definitely stood out from all the others. She said \u201cGood night, ma dear. Have sweet dreams ~\u201d\n\nHonestly, it hurt me, it hit me so hard that what I did was repeat out loud the words my partner had written. She got extremely tense, it was like I had literally given her a scarejump (because she hadn't realized I had joined the group). When she asked me if I had joined, I told her yes and to keep talking nice to that user, to which she replied \u201cOkay\u201d and continued writing. A strange attitude for her.\nIt wasn't long before she put her phone aside, still tense and even offended, and faced me defensively. She blamed me for not asking her directly to add me to the group instead of the administrator, she faced me defensively and when I told her I was sorry but that I wasn't handling the situation well she got angry and walked away. When she came back she abruptly left things on the tables, she continued to act very upset until we finally talked about it.\n\nI told her that the way she had responded to that person seemed very flirtatious (English is not our first language, and I don\u2019t say things like \u201choney,\u201d \u201csweetheart,\u201d and similar to anyone in our language because I know (and she confirmed it to me) that it would bother her a lot. But it seems that things are different in English, she said that she depersonalizes using those kinds of words in English and that since she spent a year on an exchange in Korea she knows that for people who use that language they don\u2019t have any kind of emotional charge. We came to an agreement that she wouldn\u2019t use them again anyway (only with me, just as I reserve the use of those words in our language for her) and would use other things like \u201cpal,\u201d \u201cbuddy,\u201d and similar because she said that \u201cShe needed to fill the gap in a sentence with something.\u201d Anyway, it was the mix of \u201cma dear\u201d with \u201c~\u201d that I found flirtatious.\n\nA few days later, while we were both in that group chat, we were talking to the other users when my partner shared that she works at an academy and is the boss, the businesswoman. She knows that mentioning that has an impact on people (she told me so herself that day) and two people directly flirted with her for it. I had to tell her to set boundaries because she said she was just going to ignore the flirting \u201cso it wouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Obviously, I felt very uncomfortable and we fought about it again because she was offended that I felt that way.\n\nI will mention that on two occasions when we fought, she gave me the anniversary gifts early to \u201cshow me that she was clear about what she wanted, and for me to think about whether I felt the same way\u201d and she revealed a surprise she had been preparing in roleplay for my character under the same premise, to hit me in the face with the fact that I don\u2019t realize what she does for me. Both things seemed unpleasant to me, because personally I wouldn\u2019t have resorted to mentioning everything I do for the other person to turn any argument around, maybe I\u2019m the one who is wrong.\n\nAnyway. In the last of the discussions she ended up crying, saying that she did everything wrong, that no matter how hard she tried nothing was enough, that she was clearly not the person I wanted to be with and that I should tell her exactly how I wanted her to be and she would be. Obviously, I ended up feeling bad and guilty for having become jealous/uncomfortable and she told me that the worst thing was that I would surely be looking for a way to leave her so as not to make her feel that way anymore (that was not the case). I felt like a horrible, toxic partner, and I would like you to confirm this in the comments if that is the case because I do not want to be that kind of person.\n\nNow, the last thing that has happened and has pushed me to come here for opinions and advice: The person I told you she said 'goodnight' to tagged her in a post saying he was in love with her writing, that if what she wanted was to charm him and his character she had succeeded, that having a little bit of her was everything to him... among other things. She purposely commented on the post instead of quoting it like she always does, I assume to keep me from seeing it because she'd know I wouldn't like it that much (I saw it anyway because it came up on TL). Despite all this, I didn't say anything about it at all and decided to just go on with my day, but the days after that my partner went out of her way to find edits of her character and that person's and tagging him in a lot of things, so in the end I felt bad again. Still... I preferred not to say anything again, but my partner is hypervigilant and can notice even the slightest change in behavior, so in the end she insisted until I told her. She reacted badly again (I knew it would happen and that's why I tried to avoid saying anything) and told me to stop looking at others, that I have to see the difference in quality and dedication of what she does for me to what she does for others, that I have to pay attention to what she shows all the time, that she cannot avoid nor is responsible for what others feel about her and that I have what everyone wants (her) and I should be proud of it.\n\nShe ended up saying that she was going to disconnect from everything and everyone, that she needed to leave her phone for a few days and left. I told her that I would wait for her, but in the meantime I need to know what to do and I guess, above all, what to think.\n\nHave I acted like a bad partner/someone toxic? It's likely that I'm burned out because I've spent our entire relationship feeling uncomfortable because her ex-partner (who hasn't gotten over her, and I can't misinterpret this because it's confirmed by my partner's psychologist and more) has been living in the same two-story building as her all this time (he's just going to move somewhere else this Sunday). It could also be that I'm insecure because my partner told me a long time ago that, precisely through roleplay, she ended up having what she calls 'confusions' with some users when she was still with this ex-partner I just mentioned. She told me that she realized that she didn't love those people, that she wanted her then-partner to give her what they were giving her and she just got confused because of the neglect and psychological abuse she was experiencing. I guess it just makes me pretty worried that the same thing could happen while she's in a relationship with me.\n\nCan you help me figuring things out while she\u2019s absent?\n\n**TL;DR;** : I have communicated my jealousy to my partner on more than one occasion since February, and the way she reacts makes me feel like I am ruining our relationship and that I am the problem.",

I tell him I\u2019m not healthy but he still accepts me. \n\nWell recently he met a girl online. And all he does is play online with her and chat and vent to eachother. He told me she was just as lonely as he was when he her age. He told me he feels protective over her and he makes her happy. She started calling him her brother and he wasn\u2019t so comfortable with it but he likes to play with her. We been in arguments for days, not bc of the girl. But I feel a bit jealous even though I shouldn\u2019t bc he\u2019s been giving her more attention lately. He said it\u2019s bc I\u2019ve been busy with work and I\u2019m in a bad mood all the time. I get that.

I can\u2019t tell him to leave her cus he doesn\u2019t have other friends and he\u2019ll be sad. But he talks about her like she\u2019s one of the most important people in his life or something. Am I exaggerating or be concerned. \n\nWhen I was talking about my feelings with him in text, I found out he was playing with her that\u2019s why he was responding slower than usual.

(he doesn\u2019t get blackout but he gets pretty drunk). this makes me upset and anxious. however overall our relationship has been so much better as he has noticeably changed his habits. \n\nthe situation now is that i feel angry, anxious and upset whenever he wants to drink (on the odd occasion) because i fear that he will change back into he\u2019s previous habits. when we go out to an event i feel as though i have to keep track of how much he\u2019s had as i don\u2019t want him to get too drunk. he doesn\u2019t cause any issues when he\u2019s drunk, except gets very sloppy. i feel anxious and ruin my own time worrying about what he\u2019s drinking whenever we are out now. i\u2019m not sure if my reaction is reasonable or how to navigate this?\n\nanother thing is that tonight he was playing pc with his friends which were having a few drinks and he told me he was going to drink at home while speaking to with his friends online. i was fine with this as it\u2019s an odd occasion and he\u2019s been doing well. he said he wouldn\u2019t drink heaps tonight however i facetimed him before and he was completely drunk. my issue is i feel that once he starts drinking he can\u2019t set a boundary and limit the amount he drinks. all of this makes me feel so angry and upset and im not sure what to do.\n\njust to add, im 23F and i genuinely love this man so much and he treats me so well. our relationship has been so amazing and he is my best friend. i really do see a future with us and i want to make our relationship work. we\u2019ve been through so much together and he is the most supportive person ive ever met and im so proud of the effort he put in to changing his previous habits.\n\ni would really appreciate advice on what i should do. thanks in advance!\n\n**TL;DR** My (23F) boyfriend (23M) grew up with alcoholic parents and used to drink heavily at home, leading to a license suspension. I gave him an ultimatum, and he made significant changes\u2014now only drinking on rare occasions. However, when he does drink, he struggles to set limits, which makes me anxious and ruins my experience when we\u2019re out. Tonight, he drank at home for the first time in a while and ended up way drunker than he said he would. I love him deeply, and our relationship is otherwise great, but I\u2019m struggling with trust and anxiety around his drinking. Looking for advice on how to navigate this.\n\n",

        "content": "Throwaway because I need honest advice.\n\nMy husband(35M)and I (34F) have been together since high school and got married in 2018. He is the CEO and co-founder of a startup, and his best friend (let\u2019s call him C.) is the co-founder.\nThey went to college together, and since the beginning of our relationship, C. was always around\u2014so much so that he practically lived with us until 2020.\n\nI did raise concerns multiple times about how deeply involved he was in our personal matters, but every time I brought it up, my husband and I would end up fighting.\nSo I let it go, thinking, If this is what keeps my husband happy, I can tolerate it. I convinced myself that C. was like a brother to him, and I should just accept it.\n\nFast forward to late 2022\u2014when I was pregnant with our son, my husband and I had a huge fallout (the details are another story, but C had nothing to do with it).\nI won\u2019t deny that I was harsh and angry, but I was also treated terribly by my husband and his family.\nThe stress was unbearable, and I ended up delivering two weeks before my due date.\n\nHere\u2019s the worst part\u2014my husband wasn\u2019t even there during my delivery.\n\nI still held onto hope that once our son was born, we would find a way to move forward. But my husband had completely shut me out. He didn\u2019t visit us for six months.\nI was devastated and confused.\n\nOut of desperation, I called C., thinking he could help me reach my husband, considering he spent more time with us than anyone else.\nI expected some level of friendship from him, but instead, he coldly told me that my husband didn\u2019t even want to hear my name. He said my husband had already decided to divorce me and that if I couldn\u2019t handle being a single mother, my husband would take custody of our son.\nHe also said many degrading things about me and my family.\n\nI was shattered.\n\nThat call made me realize that C. never saw me as an equal partner in my marriage\u2014he saw me as an obstacle.\nHe wasn\u2019t trying to help, he was actively trying to break us apart.\n\nDespite everything, I fought for my family. Against all odds, I got my husband back into our lives.\nThings are better now between us, but I later learned through common friends (and saw messages on my husband\u2019s phone) that C. had actively encouraged my husband to separate from me.\nHe even suggested that my husband have an affair with his married ex-girlfriend.\n\nTurned out he was the snake I fed.\n\nI was furious, but I let it go because all I wanted was my family together.\n\nThen, last year, I decided I wanted to work. I had been a homemaker for a long time, and I felt the need to contribute in some way.\nSince I was familiar with my husband\u2019s company, I asked for a small role\u2014nothing major, just something to keep me engaged.\n\nBut C. opposed it and told my husband that he couldn\u2019t \u201cbear\u201d me working in the office.\nAnd just like always, my husband listened to him.\nBefore I could even fully join, I was pushed out.\n\nI stayed quiet.\n\nAnd now, the final blow\u2014C.\u2019s wife is now fully involved in the company, and my husband welcomed her with open arms.\n\nAfter everything that has happened, this is unbearable for me.\n\t1.\tMy husband\u2019s fight with me had NOTHING to do with C., yet he actively interfered in our marriage.\n\t2.\tFor years, I never showed any discomfort to him about him being around, even though he practically lived with us.\n\t3.\tI never spoke ill of him, even when I had reasons to be upset.\n\t4.\tI was pushed out of the company because of him, but his wife gets to work there?\n\nI don\u2019t understand how to process this.\nThings between me and my husband are better now, but C. and his wife being in our lives, especially in his company, drives me insane.\n\nHow do I deal with this? How do I get past this rage? Am I wrong for feeling this way?\n\n\nTL;DR - My husband\u2019s best friend and co-founder meddled in our marriage, tried to separate us, and even encouraged my husband to have an affair. After years of tolerating him, I was blocked from working in their company, while his wife was welcomed. Now, I can\u2019t stand their presence in our lives. How do I deal with this?\n",

        "content": "I (20M) have been with my girlfriend (19F) for seven months. Although we haven\u2019t been together too long, our relationship has been very romantic and we have done a lot together (traveled, spent time with each other\u2019s families, etc). For the past month or so, however, we have constantly been at each other\u2019s throats, fighting over stupid things and always disagreeing. She has told me that she isn\u2019t happy with me and has begun to break up with me on several occasions just to change her mind at the last minute because she \u201cloves me too much to leave me.\u201d There is no doubt that we both love each other dearly. With that said, the strain that our relationship has been under for the past few weeks is incredibly discouraging and I just know it will eventually be too much for either of us to handle. We have made zero progress. She expects me to cater to her every need and gets angry at me when she believes that my attempts to make her happy are inadequate. I do so much for her and she simply doesn\u2019t appreciate it and always asks for more instead of just appreciating what I\u2019m doing. I won\u2019t lie and make myself out to be a model boyfriend - I\u2019m not. I have made mistakes and have not always been truthful with her. She hasn\u2019t been 100% honest with me either. We are very flawed people who just happened to fall in love. \n\nUnless there is a miraculous turnaround, this relationship will end soon. My feelings keep getting hurt and she doesn\u2019t seem to care too much when I bring it up. She has made absolutely no effort to change her ways. I know that it would be better if we broke up, but one thing and one thing only keeps me from pulling the trigger - the thought of her with someone else. I can\u2019t stomach the idea of her loving, caring for, and having sex with another man. It just sickens me. I don\u2019t want anybody else to have her. I know I probably sound like an insane control freak, but you have to understand where I\u2019m coming from. It is a thought that makes me genuinely angry. I know it\u2019s probably inevitable, so instead of continuing to try and fix things, I want to accept the imminent. Fighting for us looks more and more like a lost cause every day and it only causes me pain and suffering. What can I do to accept that we will both eventually move on to other people?\n\nTLDR: my relationship is likely going to end soon, but the thought of my girlfriend being with someone else emotionally and physically is keeping me from pulling the trigger.

Now, let me be clear, Jake is very straight, he's interested in women and women only, I am not a woman. \nI noticed this happening a few weeks ago and the pattern has been consistent. Jake and I had plans to go to a museum, which is like our sacred coexisting spot. I mentioned it offhandedly to Chris a few days before it happened and he ended up meeting me in the train station on my way to the city and tagging along. I thought nothing of that, we often take the same train so I figured it was coincidence. But it keeps happening, on Tuesdays Jake and I have an honestly absurdly long break between classes so we meet up for a few hours to study, every single Tuesday this semester my boyfriend has felt the need to come talk to us at for at least a few minutes, which I wouldn't mind but it's really disruptive since we're there to study and keep eachother accountable but Chris wants to chat. I don't spend my entire break one on one with Jake but those twoish hours are lock in time! And he keeps coming in for that period of time and not when we're eating as a group or anything, it's frustrating!!! Chris found out Jake and I are going to a concert later this year (Los Camp in Mexico City) and he almost bought a ticket, I reminded him he really doesn't like their music and he ended up not buying it but he poured about it. I've told him a few times that these times are very important to me and he doesn't seem to get it... How do I convince him that he has nothing to worry about?\n\nTL;DR, my boyfriend keeps crashing my hangouts with one of my close friends and I don't know how to handle it",

However, it turned out that the guy actually wanted that outing to be a date, but my girlfriend told him that it wasn\u2019t and that she has a boyfriend. Despite this, he kept trying.\n\nYesterday, she told me that a week ago, she had an argument with him because he annoyed her, and she blocked him on WhatsApp. However, she only told me about this now, after a week. When I asked to see their conversation, she said that messages get deleted when she blocks someone, but then she admitted that she lied and said she deleted them herself because she didn\u2019t think they were appropriate. However, she only deleted certain messages, not all of them.\n\nAlso, during this past week, she was at a competition abroad with several colleagues. I noticed that in some messages, a guy was calling her my love, and she replied with kiss you. When I asked her about it, she said that this is how that guy talked to all the girls there. Idk, even i don't feel that such discussions are quite normal for someone who's been in a relationship for 3 years.\n\nAny thoughts?",

        "content": "Tl;dr: husband excessively vapes and this is something I\u2019ve come to realize is a dealbreaker for me, not sure what to do as I obviously don\u2019t have control over his substance use. \n\nLet me start by saying that if you\u2019re going to defend weed, it\u2019s a waste of a comment and unhelpful to my situation. I\u2019m not going to be ok with his use, my opinions about weed in general are irrelevant. \n\nSo, I\u2019ve only been married a few months, but together with my husband for 3.5 years. A few months into our relationship he shared he had a craving for weed. He said he occasionally wanted to smoke but was not a smoker. I thought hm I don\u2019t love this but okay. I said as much. He said he started smoking at 24 during a rough time and I knew then that he\u2019d been heavily smoking for over a decade. We didn\u2019t live together at the time but he began smoking especially on weekends, I was so busy with grad school at the time but it was obvious he was high from his texts, calls, when I\u2019d see him. \n\nSince then he vapes almost every day, I\u2019ll have a fight with him about this, he stops smoking for a day or two, starts again. During the times he stops smoking, he\u2019ll start drinking and he\u2019ll say \u201coh my god you don\u2019t let me do anything\u201d. LET is a strong word as he does as he pleases, if I had any control he wouldn\u2019t be vaping still. We\u2019re trying to conceive and it hasn\u2019t happened for 5 months, I asked him to stop smoking weed in case it affects his sperm, he doesn\u2019t stop. He says I\u2019m acting like he\u2019s addicted to heroin but to me, an addiction is an addiction. I feel so stuck bc I hate the fact he cant tolerate being sober I want my partner to be mindful and live without excessive substances. It\u2019s something that became crystal clear as the relationship went on and I could see absolutely nothing interests him the way weed does. This man is never giddy and happy the way he is when he\u2019s heading to the dispensary.\n\nI\u2019m at a loss. But I don\u2019t wanna divorce because that\u2019s heavy. He says he smokes out of boredom, he\u2019s not anxious or depressed. I can have empathy for the fact he wants to numb sometimes, or feel.. anything. But to do this every day all day is way too much. How is he going to stop when we have kids (hopefully?) he says he will try to stop then but I don\u2019t think so.\n\nTwo years ago ish, we broke up one week about this. As I reflected throughout that week, I decided we should stay broken up for good, I realized that\u2019s a huge boundary of mine and I\u2019d be happier without him. At the end of that week, he came back and said \u201cno I\u2019ll go to therapy you\u2019re right I smoke too much etc, all I did was smoke and sit on the couch all this week, you\u2019re right I need counseling.\u201d it was all lies he started smoking again shortly after. \n\n\nWhat do I do. There\u2019s other issues in our relationship but this is the biggest one to me.. I feel so sad because when he\u2019s expressed things he doesn\u2019t like about me I\u2019ve taken it seriously and changed. There\u2019s good parts in our relationship he\u2019s my best friend truly, but to see him high all the time turns me off so much, I feel alone in the relationship, our sex life suffers, I withdraw and resent. Any advice would be helpful, especially from anyone who was in a similar situation? ",

We used to talk a lot, something was supposed to happen but then she suddenly disappeared and I tried to hold on the talk and at present it's just us talking whenever we need something, more like information. I accepted, there was no more I can do. \n\nI met this another girl in the end of my 3rd year, same class but never talked but the exams somehow stirred up the conversation between us, \nThe conversation went smooth, we had our ups and downs at first but after a few months we started hanging out, after a few times, I think I messed it up again. I never asked her out on a date so I said you gotta pay your share in this ( the last time we went out), she thought it was a joke and then I rectified as it wasn't a joke and then she just sent the money and stopped talking.. \n\n\n\nI don't know what to say.. I just wanted to vent, I guess I just feel bad as I screw up my relation with people everytime.. and now it sucks to not be able to talk to someone with that feeling.. \n\nI just feel like I need a relationship and then I screw \nup with people I talk to. \n\nTL;DR - I don't know what exactly I'm feeling, screwed up my relation with people, I just feel bad about the time I used to hang out with my friend and we don't talk anymore, I have this weird feeling whenever I see her anywhere let it be social handle or photos.

And if I do mention it, he\u2019ll call for a day or two, then go right back to not doing it.\n\nThe same goes for conversations. I have to be the one to initiate talking, or else we barely talk at all. I understand that he's busy with his studies during the day, and I don\u2019t expect him to chat all the time. But at night, when we do talk, can\u2019t he at least put in some real effort?\n\nWhat bothers me even more is that if I don\u2019t bring up the lack of communication, it seems like he wouldn\u2019t even notice. He can stay up late using Telegram and other apps, but reaching out to me? That never crosses his mind.\n\nAnd if I get upset about it? Instead of understanding, he gets mad at me. If we ever fight, even for a serious reason, he won\u2019t text first no matter how long it takes. I could wait for weeks, and he wouldn\u2019t care. It\u2019s like I stop existing for him until I reach out.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just overthinking this, or if it\u2019s a genuine problem. Should I just accept that this is how he is? Or is it fair for me to want more effort from him? I\u2019d love to hear what you all think.\n\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend never calls or initiates conversations unless I ask him to.

        "content": "**TL;DR:** Have a work crush on a popular employee, A (32M). His friend, J (37M), doesn't like me. Rumor mill and workplace bullying starts. All alone. Don\u2019t wish to speak to A again. Unsure of what to do.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m a NEET who is usually mute at the workplace, but when I started a new job, I thought I might give it a try at least. So, unfortunately, a lot of these situations could have been handled better with social grace, which I severely lack.\n\nI started a job about a year ago, and during training, I hit it off with someone named A. I actually like A back, but he can be pretty overbearing sometimes and, I guess, loud, but it's not an issue for me. His friend (37M), let\u2019s call him J, really dislikes me and works at another department. I was really awkward one time and was pretty rude to him when meeting him. I thought I could smooth things over by talking to him again, but obviously, it didn't work. He constantly comes into my department to check up on A. I would greet them but am usually met with silence. I didn\u2019t mind at first, but eventually, I stopped trying to be nice and just avoided him and didn\u2019t try to speak to them. So, overall, already rough.\n\nJ tried speaking to me recently, but I wasn\u2019t really having it and would just grey-rock him. I ended up realizing I\u2019m wrong for this and tried to actually give him a chance this time, but my instincts were on edge. This was when my schedule changed, so things seemed to look good at least on my end for about a month.\n\nThen all of a sudden, things started to go bad quickly. J started avoiding me again, and I overheard his other coworkers shit-talking me outside of my department. They know I work alone at the time. Then they entered my department to pry, but I decided to just say something quickly to avoid this and leave for a bit. Now, every time I'm alone, they sometimes make comments about how I'm acting. Obviously, I'm avoiding them, but they make fun of how I keep my head down and no longer wish to speak to them either. It feels like I'm back at high school again with this behavior, except it involves late 30 to 40-year-olds. I can't breathe right without them judging. I honestly want to just ice out A at this point. I wish I never met him because this is such stupid drama. I want to quit. I'm one of the youngest employees here and one of the newest. I'm all alone. How do I even solve this?",

        "content": "\nWe've been living together for 1.5 years now. She started checking my phone in the last 6 months and started questioning me about some texts I've sent to my close female friends. To be honest, I didn't really care her checking my phone as her excuse is that she does it be ause of her past experiences.\n\nBut she's started questioning the tone of my texts with one of my friend. I've known this friend of mine for long and we catchup for lunch once in a while. I've told my gf that I have no feelings for her, but she claim that she knows women very well and that my friend has bad intentions. When I said it's unfair to assume things and even if it turns out true, it wouldn't matter as I don't reciprocate; she said why would I encourage this.\n\nNow, this is turning into a loop, where I feel she doesn't trust me and if this is going to be the case throughout the relationships. I usually have friends outside my relationship, both male and female and feel that's an important part of me.\n\nDo you guys think this is a relationship not worth pursuing?\n\n**TL;DR;** : This is a sample summary of the TLDR rule, just copy the text in gray box.

        "content": "I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for over two years. He\u2019s Swiss, and I\u2019m Thai. We live together now in Thailand, but recently, we started discussing the possibility of moving to Switzerland.\n\nOne thing about him is that he\u2019s very attached to his friends. Today, we had a conversation about what our daily lives would look like if we moved there, and he told me he wants to see his friends every single day.\n\nI told him that wouldn\u2019t work for me because I believe in having quality time as a couple. But he said that one hour per day together is enough since that\u2019s how all his friends live their lives. He even mentioned one of his friend\u2019s girlfriend who is currently pregnant but still goes out with their friend group every day and stays out late.\n\nI told him that if that\u2019s how things are going to be, I wouldn\u2019t be okay with it. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want him to see his friends\u2014I completely understand that social life is important. But if it gets to the point where we barely have any time together, I just can\u2019t accept that.\n\nWe\u2019ve done long-distance before, and back then, we barely talked because he spent every day gaming at his friend\u2019s house. I tried to be understanding, but if this is what life would be like when we move, I just don\u2019t see how it would work.\n\nIs this really a normal thing in Switzerland? Am I being unreasonable for wanting more quality time? How should I handle this situation?\n\nTL;DR: My Swiss boyfriend wants to see his friends every single day if we move to Switzerland. He thinks one hour of quality time per day is enough because that\u2019s how his friends live. I told him I wouldn\u2019t be okay with that, as I value more time together. We had a long-distance phase before where he prioritized gaming with friends over talking to me, so I worry this will happen again. Am I being unreasonable, or is this normal in Switzerland? How should I handle this?",

        "content": "I'm really sorry. I know this is probably going to end up on r/AmITheDevil or something because I truly am the biggest [slur] imaginable. But please, I need someone to hear me out.\n\nI (22F) have been with my partner (24M) ever since I was 16 years old. I love him so much, like ridiculous amounts of love. I proposed to him in June.\n\nA few times we casually mentioned me seeing other people as I am polyamorous, although I think in his mind he just imagined me seeing girls as I am bisexual and this would be a way of exploring my sexuality as we were together so young I never had a girlfriend. I don't think he'd be against it being a guy if he got to know him, I mean I have kissed one of our mutual guy friend \"Abe\" (29M) before and he was chill with that. He also had some boundaries like it couldn't be some random person and everything would have to be communicated in advance.\n\nMy stupid wine drunk self broke these boundaries.\n\nIt was my friend \"Barry\" (26M)'s birthday party on Thuraday. My best friend \"Lee\" (25NB) and I had a lot of wine as pre drinks in our hotel room beforehand. When I entered the bar that Barry was hosting his party my eyes caught on to this tall man with dark hair and soft eyes. He looked so much like a guy I've had a celebrity crush on my whole teenage and adult life so I just shouted out, \"You look like [celebrity]!\". We didn't really talk much for the rest of the stay at the bar as I was sat with some girls and just joking around with a drag queen at the bar too. I'm going to refer to this guy as Phil and he is 20M. \n\nAt the next bar, well things are a blur. I remember playing air hockey (or something similar) with Lee and Phil. Suddenly we're at a third bar and I've got my head against Phil's chest as he's drinking a beer. Then we kissed. Barry came up to us like, \"OP, you have a partner right?? Wait no you said you were poly\". That's not really relevant I guess but I thought I should mention it so that you know Phil was okay with that idea.\n\nMy partner is going through a fucking lot at the minute. His grandad is dying of cancer, he's trying to get a diagnosis for ME/CFS or Fibro as he's got debilitating chronic pain. Because of this he's not been able to give me as much TLC as he used to. And I'm really really craving that. I think when Phil said sweet things to me and gave me a little kiss on the forehead and told me he'd like to get to know me my heart kinda cried out like this is what I really need right now.\n\nIt's not that my partner has been dismissive of my feelings, I've been open with him about how I feel and he's been extremely honest that he's been stressed or he's in pain. It just hurts to not have that cutesy love and it's impacted my mh. Although I do not love my partner any less I mean I genuinely am in love with him! Words can't express that enough.\n\nI think in an ideal world I would like to have a FWB. But the benefits not sexual but just romantic, I don't want to pursue that if my partner isn't comfortable though.\n\nI met with Phil for coffee for half an hour or so yesterday. He gets it. He gets my partner too. He said he's happy just being my platonic friend but I think he'd also be willing to see me as more but only if my partner was OK with that. Its hard because Phil is JUST like my partner! He's a little nerd. And he loves animals especially cats. I could see the two of them being friends. That makes it suck more like why couldn't I have just drunk kissed a complete douche bag? It would still be bad but at least I wouldn't have this internal turmoil about it. \n\nI've told my partner everything. He's broken. I've broken his trust. He said things could've been different if I'd communicated and just didn't do what I did so spontaneously. I know there's only so much the wine and beer can account for and at the end of the day it's my fault.\n\nWhat do I do. Please help me I'm struggling. \n\nTL;DR: I cheated on my boyfriend. I'm poly but he's monogamous. I'm not receiving certain things I need but I will never break up with my partner because I love him to the moon and back.",

        "content": "To start, I come from a rough family and at around 15 or 16 another family took me under their wing. I became super close with my little sister in that family.  We're almost exactly 10 years apart and she was the sister I always wanted. I always wanted to be a big sister and I tried my best to be a good one. \n\nWe were attached at the hip for years, but that family as a whole started to deteriorate. The mom became an alcoholic, got a divorce because the husbands sexual tendencies, remarried an abusive alcoholic just out of prison for beating his ex wife, and continued the cycle. \n\nIt got really bad, and when I was 23 I moved states to escape. Just moving a few hours away I was still in line to deal with abuse. \n\nThe hardest thing I ever had to do was leave my sister behind. It was either leave, or I was going to end my life. \n\nShe grew up the rest of the way without me. And now she's having her first kid. \n\nAnd we barely talk. \n\nI try to message her, and she messages me, but it's once every other month. I tried being more engaging but she just never texts back. She tells me she's just really bad at messaging. But I know she talks to she messages everyone else in the family with ease. \n\nAnd I know she doesn't hate me because when she's going through something really bad she always calls because she feels she can trust me to not judge her and to love her no matter what. But then I just feel used and taken for granted, because that's the only time we ever really have a good conversation. \n\nI wish I could visit more in person but in this economy I can barely afford rent and bills. And that's with making well above minimum wage. \n\nI know the age gap is a big deal. She's basically just starting her life, meanwhile I'm in my 30's now. So I try not to take it to heart. \n\nDo you think we will ever become close again? \n\nAre we just sisters who grew apart now? \n\nIs this our relationship forever? \n\nI feel like I've done everything I can on my end, so it hurts. I don't know if I need to give up, and let go. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: \nMy little sister doesn't talk to me and blames it on poor communication, but says she loves me, and misses me. I want a close relationship with her like I used to have before I moved away from our abusive home. I try, but it doesnt work. \nWill we ever be close again or do I just need to accept that this is our relationship and just let go of ever having that bond?",

        "content": "Looking for some advice here. \n\nI've been with my partner for over 5 years and we are planning a long term future together. I know one person can never be perfect or give you everything you need but I'm questioning the lack of words of affirmation I get from him. I wish sometimes I didn't feel the need for affirmation on my looks so much but i feel unappreciated sometimes, especially around my physical appearance. I would say I'm otherwise pretty confident in myself and frequently get hit on and complimented by other men, but from my own partner it's rare.\n\n His idea of a compliment is something like \"you look nice\" or \"nice outfit\" but his compliments are very basic and they don't really feel great to me when other men really make me feel great with \"you look drop dead gorgeous\" or other much better comments. Should I just let it go? Am I too vain? \n\nHe also doesn't ever seem jealous when other men hit on me which sometimes bothers me as I think a bit of jealousy is good and shows protective care... When i asked him about this years ago he said he is confident and prefers to focus on his trust for me, but sometimes this combined with the lack of compliments makes me feel unloved. \n\nI'm not sure where this leaves me, he's never been super expressive, so it's not like it had changed it's just that over the years I've grown more into my looks making effort to work out and dress nicely and others seem notice it, but apparently not him. \n\nI am with him because I feel free to be myself with him, he makes me laugh and feel loved in other ways, we have an amazing sex life but i  don't feel very desired by him. \n\nWhen I've brought it up he says of course he's attracted to me and will try to compliment me more but it never lasts. I also don't want to have to ask my men to hype me up, it feels forced. I would love it to come naturally. \n\nTLDR: My partner of 5+ years doesn't seem to appreciate my looks through words of affirmation or compliments. I feel stuck between accepting this is just the way he is, but also questioning if I will grow more resentful over this over time... ",

She said she was just out of a toxic relationship and doesn\u2019t want to rush into commitment at the moment, but wants something fun and light and if something more happened she wants it to develop naturally over time. I said I am also looking for fun and if it leads to more, it\u2019s totally fine for me. We had a great first date. We held hands and we kissed at the end of the date. \n\nI tried to text lightly between dates, just fun banter and a bit of flirting. I noticed she\u2019s unsure about it. Yet she never rejected me, she\u2019d just pull back from the conversation and maybe reschedule our 2nd date. \n\nI never chased or guilt tripped her though and she kept postponing until we again after 10 days and went to the cinema. After the cinema, we went back to my place and had sex for 2-3 hours. It was amazing (I think). We had a lot of sexual chemistry. We tried things she wanted. I am not used to casual sex, so I was super passionate and affectionate and she sensed that. She asked why am I all over her, most guys wouldn\u2019t cuddle her or do this or that. I said because i liked her. She asked me, how many girls you brought here before me. I just moved in this apartment 2 months ago and she was genuinely the first in this one so I was honest about it. She seemed to ease in and go along with the cuddling and kissing, telling me about her fantasies, asking about mine. Then she decided to leave when she realized we spent 3 hours. She said she wasn\u2019t planning to stay that long. I offered her to stay the night, she was surprised and told me most guys would be happy she\u2019s leaving after sex. I said I am not most guys. She was considering it but then decided it\u2019s best to go because she needs to be up early. I insisted on walking her to the station and on our way, she reached out and grabbed my hand to hold it for the first time she initiates and I felt this was a genuine moment. I asked if she thinks we and stopped because of the car, she seemed to be really curious and went back to it \u201cwe what\u201d. I made a joke about disturbing the neighbors and laughed it off. We kissed goodbye and I texted to make sure she\u2019s home safely and she confirmed.\n\nShe pulled back after that day with very minimal texting to reschedule. We were supposed to meet again. She rescheduled from Wednesday to Sunday (Today) and then today she rescheduled indefinitely because she\u2019s sick until she feels better. I continued being me during that week, flirting lightly commenting on her insta post with a genuine funny compliment. She was wearing a cinderella costume at a party. I said \u201cThat explains why you showed up, enchanted me and disappeared when the clock hit midnight\u201d. I got the impression she\u2019s trying to keep an emotional distance by not engaging.\n\nJust wanted to ask did I could have done something differently? Or she\u2019s just afraid to catch feelings so she\u2019s ending things softly? Did I approach that kind of connection in a wrong way?\n\nPersonally, I thought a casual thing is still fine with a bit of connecting, flirting and emotions. I am not sure though.\n\nTl;dr:\nI was dating a girl casually after agreeing to it and things seemingly were going well according to her. I felt we had great chemistry, but I also felt I was more open to connection and emotions than she was and then she started pulling away but not firmly. I feel she\u2019s more in the \u201cunsure\u201d zone, trying to set emotional boundaries, while maintaining communication and leaving things open ended. So was wondering if I should have approached the situation differently?",

        "content": "So I started dating her more than a year ago and I love her like anything and I hope after we graduate we'll be able to move in together (doesn't seem like gay marriage is going to be legal here anytime soon). But yeah, for context that's how serious the relationship is.\n\nBut there's this repeated topic that keeps bringing up arguments and that is when I make plans and those plans don't end up happening because I forget that a different event/ task is clashing with the timings and I realize it almost last minute. It's 100% understandable that she feels upset whenever this happens of course. My house is a minimum 45 minute commute from hers (more commonly 1 hour). We go to the same university but different departments plus the place is huge so we only meet in our lunch breaks, provided we actually get time during our lunch breaks. We don't get a lot of time for dates, with all that plus managing studies so one plan falling through affects us both a lot.\n\nI've been forgetful af since childhood and I keep doing everything I can (it seems) in order to combat it. I set alarms on my phone, I journal, I try to plan. But no matter how hard I try I eventually do slip. We have a set time, 10:30 pm every night where we aim to put everything aside and talk to each other over text or call.\n\nThe way it came about was also kind of sad. I'd spent a semester in the UK (exchange program) when we came up with that timing, so for me it was 5pm. When I came back to India, I'd kind of assumed we weren't doing fixed timings anymore since we got to meet irl again and everything so I took it lightly, not realizing that she had continued to text me routinely at 10:30 every night. I missed a few nights which made her upset which then made me realize this. Even after that I forgot a few times. I then set an alarm on my phone for 10:30 which made it easier but when she found out about the alarm it also. Didn't have the effect I thought. Rather than feeling like I was putting in effort it made her feel even more like I was treating it like a burden. It really isn't. I love talking to her.\n\nThe most recent argument went like any other. I planned to meet her on a Thursday. It didn't seem like anything was in the way. On Tuesday my dog was limping and none of us had seen her fall anywhere. On Wednesday I called the clinic but realized it was closed on Wednesdays. So we'd have to go the next day. I knew this and I knew I was meeting her but somehow I didn't put two and two together that I couldn't do both on the same day. I remembered this at about midnight while I was texting her and yeah she was upset. It keeps getting worse each time I do this because it just piles up over everything else I've done wrong. She said she would tell her friends (who she had earlier turned down) to book tickets for a movie, and she backed out of the upcoming event we both wanted to attend.\n\nThe entire next day I was so sad I could barely get out of bed. The entire college day went somehow and in the evening I texted her that I didn't feel like talking (because how am I going to cheer someone up if I feel like shit) and one of the things she replied was \"if it helps I'm not mad anymore\" so I did talk a bit but then I asked whether she was sure she wasn\u2019t mad anymore, because I had a feeling. She said \u201cI feel like I prioritize you all the time then get blown off like it\u2019s nothing\u201d I got defensive in response, which I guess I shouldn\u2019t have but I\u2019d spent the entire day feeling sad and stressed about it and I thought she was unfairly painting me as unfeeling. In the end she did conclude that the worst part of everything was that in the end it wasn\u2019t my fault, I had tried, but she still ends up hurting, every time.\n\nThe thing that bothers me is that there is never a definite conclusion to all this. The next time I inevitably screw something up she\u2019s going to remember every single time I\u2019ve done it before and it will just keep piling up. She once said she maybe she wouldn\u2019t have given me as much priority if she had her old friend group (from before she moved to my city) because she\u2019s an extrovert and her current friend circle is quite inadequate. I didn\u2019t know what to feel about that, it kind of hurt, to be honest, that I was supposed to be a replacement for a lack of socializing. The thing that significantly bothers me about this time was, even though we did meet the next day (on friday) and spent good quality time together, the joy of meeting her didn\u2019t really seem to outweigh the anxiety and guilt I\u2019d felt the previous day. I worry that I\u2019ll fall out of love with her. She really is a caring and sweet girlfriend, I don\u2019t want that to happen.\n\nI\u2019m graduating in a few months and I\u2019ll move out of state to pursue my 2 year masters degree while she completes the remaining 2 years of her degree (I had 3 year bachelors she has 4). So 2 years of long distance. How will I manage?\n\nTLDR; My bad time management makes me cancel plans often, which makes my gf upset. Need to break out of the cycle somehow.",

I love him with everything and completely trust him.\n\nI've always struggled with feeling incompetent, I'm trying to work on it.\n\nThe thing is, my friend is a prodigy. Beyond my personal insecurities this is a fact. He understands thing extremely quickly and in depth, he's able to teach others about things he might have just figured out (accurately), he's a talnted cook, extremely physically agile as well, the list goes on. Everyone can see this. I love it.\n\nWhat I struggle with is that we have almost everything in common, so we end up doing and talking about the same things together and I see myself as the slower version (and since I already think of myself as incompetent it feeds into it).\n\nWe paint together, I'm good but he's on the teacher's level (implied by her). We talk about videogames, he tells me about all these strategies I know nothing about. When we play against each other in any game he always wins. We study CS together, he has more experience than me programming so I understand the disparity, but the way he problem solves vs how I can't even divide a problem or go blank is just sad. I'm also extremely bad at maths (I've accepted this) but he's really really good. There's a lot of things, both physical and mental. He's also very emotionally intelligent.\n\nThere has never been a moment where he had to consult with me. Occasionally some specific knowledge on psychology, but that's because I studied it.\n\nTL;DR: I don't believe I feel some sort of resentful jealousy towards him. I don't mind that he's goated. I'm just sad for myself. How do I heal feeling incompetent, struggling with learned hopelessness and perfectionism paralysis while at the same time loving someone extraordinary in the same fields as me?",

        "content": "TL;DR:\n\nBeen friends with a girl (F30) for almost 4 years online. She recently asked me if it\u2019s normal for good friends to check in on each other (like asking about meals), then pointed out that I never do that with her. I explained that I see it more as something couples do, not just friends. She said she never had such convos with friends either. Now I\u2019m wondering\u2014was she implying something about us, or is she just confused because someone else does this with her? Need thoughts on this.\n\n\n\n\nOk so I, M28, know this girl, F30 for almost 4 years now. We\u2019ve met online from an app called whisper. Now, we\u2019ve never met but she knows my fb and insta and vice versa. Sometimes we talk on phone. A few days ago, this is how our conversation went(you guys should know that we\u2019re from Pakistan, so girls and boys meeting up, etc are kind of still conservative here, I\u2019m translating the messages. Also she was high when she was writing these):\n\nHer:   \n\u201ctell me something, if a guy and girl are friends, conversations like: \n     Girl: parents went to hometown\n     Boy: did you have lunch?\n     Girl: yes I just finished cooking\n     Boy: eat up\n     Girl: did you eat?\n  Are these convos normal between good friends?\u201d\n\nMe: \n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be\u201d\n\nHer: \n\u201cAre you sure? Then how come you never did this convo with me?\u201d\n\nMe:\n\u201cWhat? I always do this kind of convo with you \ud83e\udee4\u201d\n\nHer:\n\u201cYou don\u2019t \ud83d\ude02 l ask you when we watch movie when I go for lunch. Even when you go for lunch you don't even ask if I had mine. You just say I\u2019ll be back after lunch\u201d\n\nMe: \n\u201cWell, When you're good friends you ask \u201cdid you have lunch? And when you're greater you ask \u201cI\u2019ll go have lunch you stay here \ud83e\udd23\u201d \n\nHer:\n\u201cOk, can\u2019t even laugh \ud83d\ude42\u201d\n\nMe:\n\u201cUmmm idk what to say........... Asking these makes me think I might be asking something that's someone who's in an upper level of relationship persons job........ that\u2019s why I don\u2019t ask.  [I meant a bfs/gfs job ]\u201d\n\nHer: \n\u201cHmm\u201d\n\nMe:\n\u201cI'm really sorry if it feels like I haven't been asking enough about your day or showing interest. I never meant to make you feel that way. Maybe I got too used to the way we usually talk, and I didn't realize it was bothering you. I really do care about you and our friendship, so let me know how I can do better. I'll make more of an effort to check in and talk about these things, and I want to make sure you feel valued in this friendship. \ud83d\ude14\u201d \n\nHer: \n\u201cExactly good friends don't even need to ask right?\nYou are an amazing friend to me, chill. I was just thinking when these types of convos occur cause I never had any convo like this with any good friends\u201d\n\nMe:\n\u201cHonestly I never had any convo like this with friends either. But l've always heard my friends who are in a relationship ask this to their partners.\u201d\n\nHer: \n\u201cI felt the same\u201d\n\n\nNow, why would she suddenly bring this up? Is she implying something OR could it be she\u2019s asking this because someone else does it with her and she\u2019s confused? I\u2019m very confused and curious about this.\n\nGive me your thoughts on this! ",

With myself living in an abusive household and my gf being in the military and having the inability to \"just move in together\". This year we've been having more and more arguments and she has been insisting that I am defensive. \n\nLast night, she said that she was worried that I didn't want to get married and that she wanted my honest opinion. I told her that I do want to get married and of course it's difficult at times because it was neither of ours first decision to marry and THEN live together but I believe it would be good. She continued to say that maybe I would regret it and that I should think about maybe pushing back months or a year for my sake. I said I can't exactly say what I will regret in the future but I believe that I'll be okay. \n\nWe continued to talk, I asked her what she wanted and eventually it made me upset to hear her say she thinks that I would be too stressed out and that I need to think about it more. She asked and I told her I was feeling hurt and she said \"I wish I could express my concerns to you without getting offended\" and tbh I don't know what I did to deserve her saying that. I didn't raise my voice, I said what I felt and that I do in-fact feel ready and I wished she believed that I was ready. Throughout our previous argument she's called me defensive and I just can't pinpoint what the hell I'm doing thats defensive especially in that moment. Does anyone else have this issue and what ways can I be seen as not defensive?\n\nTldr: my gf wishes I wasn't offended by her concerns of marriage, I feel like I have a good reason to feel sad. How can I come across/be more open? ",

I immediately said I love going to the markets and would be interested. \n\nThe next morning before we were going to the markets and art gallery, I reiterated that I would be interested in going to the markets for about 30 mins to have a browse. \n\nAt (11:26) she bought us tickets to the art gallery for 2 pm. \n\n20 mins later I said I would be at the markets at 12:30 (I sent message at 11:48). She then ignored the message till 12:20 (just before I said I would arrive), she said she was leaving the markets to go meet up with another friend (28 M)for lunch. \n\nI felt really sad and abandoned, I stated a few times that I was keen to go to the markets but she ignored it and went by herself and then left just before I arrived. \n\nI don\u2019t have a huge circle of friends and have thought of her as my best friend and have relied on her when I have been feeling down on a few occasions. \nI have thought we were best friends, friends for over 7 years, but on a few occasions I have felt like she does not like hanging out alone with me. When we have been the only two left interested to go on hikes etc. she often says she is too tired and just avoids going altogether. \n\nI am not sure if I should tell her I feel sad about this? And how I should do so? I constantly feel like she does not like my company and is only interested in hanging out with others in the friend group, I often just feel like the disregarded third wheel, and feel like I\u2019m just getting in the way..\n\nI am considering just keeping quiet and staying at home for the next few group event/get togethers as a show of sadness but it makes me feel lonely and left out. \n\n\u2014- \nTLDR; I constantly feel abandoned and avoided by someone (25F) I consider my best friend.

        "title": "Why don\u2019t I (m20) care that my gf(21) has hit me when drunk?",
        "content": "For some context, this is my first relationship, my gf and I met and are in college and have been together for just over 2 years. For most of our relationship she has had some issues with her drinking, some periods worse than others. She has some mental health problems (depression, anxiety, etc.) which apparently get exasperated by her drinking. Most of the time is fine, however once every 1-3 months or so, it\u2019s like a switch will flip where she goes from fun drunk to a nightmare. \n\nDuring these episodes she will say the usual stuff (doesn\u2019t love me, hates me, etc.) but can also get very creative and hurtful (saying that i am a rich manipulative asshole who has orchestrated our relationship purely so I can be seen in a positive light). At its worst, she can get handsy. This first happened around 6-8 months ago where during a drunk argument, she shoved me out of anger. This didn\u2019t actually hurt at all, as I am pretty strong and she is a fairly small girl, but on principle I was very upset about it and told her if it ever happened again I would break up with her.\n\nFlash forward to last night, we are at a party at her apartment, and while hanging out in her room, out of nowhere she says \u201cthere\u2019s so many things that [she] would do for [me] that [I] would never do for [her].\u201dShe then started demanding I name nice things I have done for her, just so she could reply to each one with \u201cwell I would do that for you too.\u201d It literally was out of nowhere, and a completely pointless argument, so I say I don\u2019t wanna do this tonight, i\u2019m heading home, I love you and we will talk about it tomorrow. This makes her VERY upset, and she starts yelling about how selfish I am since leaving is what\u2019s best for me, not for us, and even says \u201cwell if you leave I guess i\u2019ll just go out there and hookup with every guy here.\u201dWild. As I try to get up and leave she slaps me on the back. Again, this didn\u2019t actually hurt, but this was a genuine slap, not a jokey one. She also grabbed my wrists on the way out and tried to keep me from leaving.\n\nI eventually do leave and all night she is blowing up my phone telling me how horrible I am, until she sobers up this morning and tells me how sorry she is. Long story short, I want help understanding why I keep letting her do this. Like in my head, I know it is absolutely wrong for her to put her hands on me and if it were my son getting touched by his gf instead, I would be pissed off. But, for whatever reason, I cannot get myself to care about this enough to break up over it. I think a big part is she hasn\u2019t actually injured me at all, but that is more a statement of her inability to hurt me, rather than her lack of trying. Like if she was strong enough to break my nose or something, then I would obviously break up with her, but the fact that she is incapable of physically doing that has I guess resulted in me giving her a lot of moral leeway. In my head I recognize that those should be equally bad, but for whatever reason I can\u2019t get myself to act on that logic.\n\nIdk, writing this whole paragraph out makes it sound so stupid, which it is. Am I going crazy over nothing? Is this worth breaking up over? I\u2019m honestly getting bored of this whole song and dance since it always plays out the same. She gets drunk, some minuscule argument happens, she snaps, she berates me and insults me, sometimes strikes me, then in the morning convinces me she can do better. I feel like a dipshit.\n\nTLDR: gf gets physically and verbally problematic when drunk, but I can\u2019t get myself to care about it since she isn\u2019t capable of actually injuring me. Am i a moron?",

        "content": "I really need advice on how to handle this situation.\n\nBefore my boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) got together, I told him I was interested in dating him, but he wasn\u2019t sure. Because of that, I told him I needed space since I didn\u2019t want to develop feelings for someone who wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship. In the months we weren\u2019t talking, I ended up having a one-night stand with someone. Later, I went on one more date with that same person, and we slept together again, but it never went anywhere after that.\n\nWhen my (now) boyfriend and I reconnected and started talking again, I told him that I had slept with someone else during that time. However, I only mentioned it happening once. He later told me that even hearing that made him seriously consider not dating me because, to him, it meant I didn\u2019t like him as much as he liked me. But the truth is, that person meant nothing to me\u2014I think I was just distracting myself from how I was feeling at the time.\n\nThe other night, he asked me again, and I told him the full truth\u2014that it had actually been twice. He got really upset, called me a lying c*nt, and now he refuses to speak to me. I understand he\u2019s very hurt he told me that he\u2019s judging me and i don\u2019t have any self respect because I\u2019ll just jump on another bloke. \n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to be dishonest, but I knew that telling him made him question me in the relationship, and I really didn\u2019t want to lose him or him to be mad at me. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t bring it up again, but I know that was wrong. Now, I don\u2019t know if I should reach out, or wait.\n \nTl/dr : boyfriend won\u2019t talk to me because I wasn\u2019t fully honest about my past needing advice on what I should do",

        "content": "I (20M) was recently harassed by my ex (18F) for some old reddit posts about her. For context we dated for about 5 years then broke up after she cheated on me. The breakup happened approximately 2 years ago and it was no contact from there. Just recently she texted me and told me I needed to take down whatever I had posted about her online. I had not posted anything about her other than maybe reposting a tiktok or two that I related with at the time. I know I didn't have anything actually bad out there so I ignored her and blocked her number which I thought I had done previously and I saw the next day I had a blocked call. I received 2 missed calls from a random phone number that I didn't recognize so when they called back the third time and I was actually available and I answered it, they said \"hi, do you recognize my voice\" and it was my ex so I promptly hung up and blocked that number and I immediately had a blocked call from that number. Fast forward a day and she calls me from a new unknown number. This was probably the 7th phone call I received from now 2 separate random numbers. At this point my current girlfriend was getting pissed and answered the phone and yelled at her to stop calling and harassing me then hung up. My mom texted me later on saying that she had also been getting constant calls from my ex. After talking to a friend later on, they told me what had happened and my ex had found my (now old because of this) reddit account (which she did not know my username, she is not on reddit, and my name is nowhere on my reddit) and the posts that she was talking about were posts from 5 years ago asking for relationship advice about some problems we had been having at the time which did not mention her name at all. I have since deleted the posts but I'm still worried about her because she was willing to come after me and call me from her phone and 2 other people's and call my mom to tell me to take down posts that did not name her or me that were made 5+ years ago that did not talk bad about her. Is there anything I can or should do about all of this? I seriously considered getting a restraining order but I don't think I have enough standing to get one and it wouldn't last if I could. Is there anything I should do in this scenario?\n\nTLDR: I made some posts about my ex girlfriend some years ago and she harassed me with non stop phone calls to get me to take them down and I don't know if there's anything else I should do",

A week after we stopped talking she casually messaged me just looking for help with homework and i confronted her and asked how she can casually talk to me as if nothing happened. And long story short she told me shes already moven on, she doesnt like me anymore well more specifically she said she doesnt want to like me anymore and she js doesnt wanna b w me. But she did give one reason as to why she did what she did and its because she feels as if we dont mesh well together and she wants me to move on?..\n\nIm not sure if this is the right subreddit but is it even possible to move on that quickly after all the effort we both gave eachother? How can she casually say shes already moven on and talk to me as if nothing happened. With the few people ive spoken to, they just told me that its not possible that shes moven on that fast, its just her telling herself she needs to move on because she knows it wont work out.\nWhich is insane because the main reason it never worked out because whenever i did a small thing that made her upset, it was never anything toxic but simply a misinterpretation or miscommunication she would never tell me what i did and ghost me and just talk about how i just annoyed her.\nand the point of this post is id like to hear your opinions and face surface on what i should do with the little information ive provided. Thank you so much and i hope you understand. God bless.\n\nTL:DR broken up, week later she casually talks to me and long story short she says shes already moven on and doesnt wanna like me anymore.",

He's super quiet, super smart and takes care of me. He is extremely shy, but I like being touched so I asked him to touch me more in public and he does. So he puts in the effort, is what I'm trying to say. He also got drunk and told me that he likes me\u2014unprompted\u2014because I'm funny and have a great personality and I'm so nice.\n\nWell we just had The Talk\u2122 about where our relationship is going and I found out some harsh truths. They're all normal, just have me questioning my self-worth. First off, I was fully dedicated to this, because I am a delusional idiot who gave him my first kiss, so I was thinking long-term longterm, if you catch my drift. But apparently, he doesn't even want to try long distance after he graduates. Second, I found out his list of priorities is Academics, his Frat, and then Me! Yippee!! Lastly, it's a dumb thing: he does not text first at all, though he used to when we first started going out, and he takes HOURS to reply.\n\nWhat makes it harder is I'm an anxious attachment typa person and he's avoidant. So, even though I know I'm NOT the first girl to hope this, I'm hoping I can slowly open his eyes to his detachment-ing habits and cHaNgE hIm \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d.\n\nI guess I'm just wondering if I should stick it through or if I should give up now, even though I don't want to and really like makin out w him.

I never had a problem like this before, I have a high libido, well at least had..\n\nI'm starting to feel like I'm not supposed to say \"no\" because sex is how he feels loved and wanted. I've only said no a few times, but he noticeably got quiet and colder, and when I asked what's wrong he said nothing. Since then I always feel pressure, and I just go with it for him however I think this made me feel worse. \nOther than that he makes passive aggressive jokes about it here and there, like \"I'd give you oral if you'd initiate for once\" or when I was on top of him getting into it he said \"my gf doesn't like sex..\"  and it instantly killed my desire. \n\nLike a week ago for example he came home from work, we were cuddling talking kissing each other's cheeks, it was such a pure and intimate moment for me and it made me so happy. Then he just pointed at his boner for me to take care of but because of the pressure I really wasn't in the mood but didn't wanna say no so I just offered him we lay for a while and then I'll give him a BJ. However he got really cold and wouldn't tell me what the problem was. This mood continued for 2 days, he was really silent before he actually told me it hurt him I didn't want him, and that I never initiate. (we have sex almost every day, usually multiple times on weekends) And I WOULD initiate but I feel like I don't have space to do so, since he initiates every day. \nThis morning I was still half asleep but I was laying on his chest. He put down his phone, rolled me over and pushed his boner to my ass. I felt the instant pressure, started to get anxious and I was just sleepy I didn't respond. When he realised we won't have sex he just went back to his phone and again got really short with me before he left for work which made me feel guilty. \n\nHe usually initiates by pointing at his boner or rubbing it to my ass, sometimes like a minute of kissing and then getting naked and that's it, and I feel like he wants me to go from 0 to 100 in few minutes. \nI honestly don't know how to talk to him about it, we've already had a conversation last week but it just felt like we didn't get each other. I don't want him to feel unwanted because obviously I'm still attracted to him but this pressure just makes me lose interest in sex so much. Anyone had similar experiences? How did you guys fix it?\n\nTL;DR\nI'm feeling pressured for sex and it kills my libido ",

For a long time he would drink to excess and lie to me about when he was coming home, stop answering his phone altogether, ignore plans we had made to get drunk instead, or call me and plead for \u201cjust one more hour\u201d which would turn into him returning 3 or 4 hours late. I basically ended things a year ago because he was neglecting our relationship for alcohol and behaving in ways that were totally unacceptable and disrespectful - he stopped drinking for a while and has overall been better about it since then, not perfect but better.\nI\u2019m just confused about why he is hiding stuff from me and have no idea what to do about it. I tried to talk to him about it and tell him\nhow it makes me feel but he just kept insisting that he \u201cforgets\u201d to tell me and it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend not being honest with me about drug use and I don\u2019t know how to address it with him.",

        "content": "Tl;dr: we both chatter to each other on our interest but he has started to visually and verbally not care about my interests. I also give him good ideas for current problems that he dismisses but hears it within an hour from a man and suddenly it\u2019s a brilliant idea. When I ask why it wasn\u2019t a brilliant idea when I suggested earlier he deflected or outright said I must not have explained it well. Is this a pattern? Is it early enough can I talk him into working on it? What would happen if I match his energy?\n\n\n\n\nI 27f don\u2019t know if I\u2019m expecting too much from my boyfriend 28m.  We have been together for almost a year and a half. I\u2019m super excited to chatter about my things of interest but he deflects my chatter. We are both adhd and he says it\u2019s just his adhd not focusing. Is it unreasonable to assume I can chatter about my plans if he can?\n\nMy chatter is normally brought up by relevant situations in life. Examples are how I\u2019m planning on training my dog, he specifically asked me to keep him updated on the progress. I was excited when my dog did a task correctly and wanted to share with my boyfriend but he shut me down. \n\nI had an aquarium a year ago and was setting it up and explaining fishy stuff to him as he mentioned he wanted to learn. He eventually snapped for me to stop. \n\nI just got a new aquarium and I tried talking to him about plans on Saturday and he told me he would rather game than talk. We gamed. But he also told me that he has no interest in most of my hobbies or activities. (He finically helps me acquire my hobby stuff and other needs if I can\u2019t. He supports my hobbies just not my chatter) He explained that he tried switching the subject and I went back to my topic. (I have mental illnesss that make it harder to pick up on social cues like that)\n\nHe doesn\u2019t see the need to listen to me with my chatter but he chatters to me about tech, gym, school, work and other hobbies he has or wants to get into. I ask questions on his hobbies and try to remain enthusiastic to help keep his interests on his likes. I know of new protein powders, work out plans, types of workout equipment, fighting games, dnd, how a graphic card works and why he has two, that foreign languages are interesting to him, how to fix your own car, how low a break pad is supposed to be before replacing, and soo much more. \n\nMy chatter has also been helpful but he didn\u2019t listen to me. Examples are he got brand new tiers and one got a flat, google recommended replacement of both tiers on that end. I suggested he use the good tier for his new spare. He told me that wouldn\u2019t work as it would be in even. When the mechanic suggested that same exact idea I said in the car on the way there\u2026use the good tier as a spare. He acted like it was the first time he heard it and praised the man for the brilliant idea. I told him in the car it was my idea first and he downplayed my suggestion earlier. The more recent one was my aquarium related. I admit I bought the tank and didn\u2019t measure to see if my current stand would work for it. It won\u2019t. I suggested that we just put a flat board over my current stand and add support beams to the overhanging side so it has more stability throughout. He said that wouldn\u2019t work so I suggested removing the top of it and just making a new top. He again disagreed. Then he called his dad and told me his dad had a great idea. Put a board on the top and support beams on the overhanging side. I again told him it was my idea first. He again downplayed it. \n\nI haven\u2019t to my knowledge switched topics in expectation he stops talking about how much he wants to learn a specific school trade and how it will make our life soo much better and he would love that job in the end. We chatter the same about our interests, am I hoping for too much to not have my chatter stopped or completely destroyed by his words. \n\nMy dog takes most of my time and now my aquarium will take the rest. I already give him the bare minimum or what I\u2019ve done throughout my day as when my answer is slightly more specific than walked dog and did chores like how long the walk was and any difficulty on it, specific chores I group are dog training, playing around in the home, online shopping (normally for dog stuff) and some actual chores. \n\nI\u2019m actually wanting to tell him all the research I\u2019ve done on tank designs and fish but I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t give me the dopamine boost I require when chattering. I\u2019m planning on having a conversation with him either today when he is home or this weekend. I have two other people in my life who I can chatter to for as long as I need. They have no idea what I\u2019m talking about and sometimes aren\u2019t really listening but the fact I can explain my ideas and theories without judgement is all I want from my boyfriend too. He has some form of background noise on when he games anyway, can\u2019t my chatter be that?",

She ignores my messages, stays online on WhatsApp, and I suspect she\u2019s either playing games with me or hiding something. I\u2019m unsure whether to block her and move on or wait. Looking for advice. \n\nFull Story: I\u2019ve been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend for 1 Year. She lives in Dubai, and I live in Belgium. From the start, we had great times together when we visited each other. I truly love her, and she told me many times that I am her world, that she can't live without me, and that she wants to move to Belgium. She said she paid a lot of money to a visa agent and assured me she\u2019s working on it. Whenever I ask about it, she gets defensive, accuses me of not trusting her, or makes excuses. Recently, she started ignoring my messages, even when she\u2019s online on WhatsApp. She acts distant and only contacts me when she wants something. If I try to bring up serious topics, she either disappears or starts a fight. It\u2019s confusing because her mother told me she really loves me, but her actions don\u2019t show it. I feel like I\u2019m being played, but I don\u2019t have concrete proof. I don\u2019t want to keep waiting and getting hurt, but part of me still hopes she\u2019s serious. I\u2019ve muted her now, but I keep checking WhatsApp, and it\u2019s driving me crazy. Should I block her and move on? Or am I overthinking?",

We got together when I was 15 and I had horrible anxiety, agoraphobia, depression, and self harm tendencies. I wasn't taking care of myself and I was worthless to everyone around me. One night when we were 17 I had a horrible panic attack and hurt myself pretty bad. She wanted a month break after that and went to stay with a friend. During that time I took 5g of mushrooms every week in an attempt to understand why I was the way I was. And against all odds it actually worked. I got a job, A new car, Moved out, Picked up new hobbies and made new friends. After that she agreed to get back together with me and things were great for a couple years until I found messages on her phone that implied she'd been in a relationship with somebody else during and a bit before our \"break\". I was absolutely devastated but eventually I moved on. We were young and she was in a tough position too. Since then I've been doing everything I can to try and rebuild that trust with her and ignor the seed of doubt that's always present. Small things wouldn't add up, Stories would change to fit what I already know, But it was never enough to justify having a tough conversation over. Until last night when I suspected something was off. I drove to her mom's house where she said she was staying, Feeling like an over paranoid idiot the entire time, Until I got there and seen her car wasn't there. My heart sank, My ears rung, My face felt hot, And tears started to blur my vision. Before I knew it I'd called her about 7 times before she picked up, Irritated that I called so many times. I told her I knew she wasn't where she said she was, And she gave me a poorly thought out excuse that couldn't even be true. I told her to start looking for somewhere else to live and she just said alright and hung up. I don't know why I wanted an apology so bad. For her to beg me to stay, Or tell me she loves me. It's what I would've done I guess. Anyway, Sorry for the long read I went into work at 3:30am because I couldn't sleep and I don't even open until 7:30. I'm off at 2 and everything in me hopes she doesn't just grab her bags and leave. That when I get home she'll be there and this time she'll understand and fix things somehow. But a big part of me knows it's best if I just move on. I just can't be alone again. \n\nTL;DR: My fiance is lying to me and possibly cheating but im dumb and will probably forgive her.",

        "content": "Posting this on a burner account because my boyfriend found my other one. Using fake ages. \n\nI (24F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for about 3 and a half years. To start this off, he has a higher libido than I do and wants to have sex very regularly. Most of the time I say yes, even sometimes when I\u2019m not really in the mood. (Character flaw I know, but I justify it by telling myself it\u2019ll feel nice).\n\nThe problem is that despite saying we should do more foreplay, he never initiates it beyond asking me to suck him off. I\u2019m happy to most of the time because I know it feels nice for him, even though when we started dating it grossed me out to do. \n\nAll of the sex-related fantasies and foreplay suggestions he has involves me sucking him off in some way or form. From under a desk, in the shower, you get the picture. \n\nAlmost every time before we have sex, he\u2019ll ask me to go down on him. Every. Time. He never makes an effort to get me aroused, and has on occasion lightly complained about using lube because it\u2019d be \u201cso much easier if you were already wet\u201d. \n\nThis is not to say he had never gone down on me, because he has. In our whole relationship he probably has about five times, and he will spend a total of five minutes licking over my vagina and then stopping. His idea of getting me in the mood is to play with my nipples and despite saying \u201cgetting you off gets me off\u201d he never really does anything to get me off. \n\nI know we\u2019re not on the same page sexually, and you might be thinking why I don\u2019t just talk to him about this and the answer is I have. I\u2019ve brought this up multiple times in the past and nothing has changed. I\u2019ve asked him to go down on me many many times now, and I\u2019m so tired of basically begging him to reciprocate at this point. I asked him why he doesn\u2019t like to, and he flat out told me that he doesn\u2019t really like putting his face down there because it grosses him out. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do from here, I really don\u2019t. We live together and own pets together. I don\u2019t know if I should just bite the bullet and end things, but I don\u2019t know if I can, or if I can imagine a life without him. He is a very sweet guy and is generally a lovely boyfriend, we\u2019re just not sexually compatible and I\u2019m not sure how to work with this. \n\nWhat should I do? What would you do in this situation?\nAny advice at all would be so appreciated, if you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you (:\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend refuses to reciprocate oral but will enthusiastically suggest me going down on him. When he does, he does it so half heartedly he may as well just not bother. If the feeling was a spice, it\u2019d be flour. I\u2019ve talked to him about it multiple times, yet nothing has changed.

        "content": "TL;DR:\nI (30F) love my boyfriend (30M) deeply. He is kind, supportive, and my best friend, but I\u2019m struggling with our future due to financial instability and poor decision-making on his part. I\u2019ve always dreamed of a beautiful wedding, a big home, and lots of children, but that future feels impossible right now. I\u2019m worried that if I compromise too much, resentment will grow and damage our love. Should I stay and trust things will improve, or is this my sign to leave?\n\n\u2e3b\n\nI love my boyfriend, but I don\u2019t know if love is enough.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together for four years, and he is genuinely one of the kindest people I know. We have a deep bond, we make each other laugh until we cry, and we\u2019ve grown in our faith together. He\u2019s always supported me emotionally through tough times, and I know with certainty that he would do anything for me.\n\nBut when it comes to our future, I feel lost.\n\nThe Reality of Our Situation\n\nWhen we first got together, he seemed to have a solid plan for his career and life, but over time, I\u2019ve realised that his decision-making is holding him back. I\u2019ve been patient, believing things would improve, but now that I\u2019m 30, I feel like I don\u2019t have time to keep waiting.\n\nI\u2019ve always imagined and worked towards a certain kind of life:\n\t\u2022\tA beautiful wedding surrounded by friends and family.\n\t\u2022\tA comfortable home where I can raise my children.\n\t\u2022\tA big family, with multiple kids, giving them the best life possible.\n\nRight now, none of that feels realistic. Financially, we\u2019re in a tough spot, and his choices have only made things harder.\n\nThe Financial Struggles\n\nHe is ambitious, but his choices haven\u2019t led to success yet. He has made repeated financial mistakes that have set him back, and although I know his intentions were good, I\u2019m left feeling like I have to shoulder the burden while waiting for him to get to where he wants to be.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m also struggling in my own life\u2014dealing with career burnout and feeling exhausted from always having to push forward. I wanted a partner who could meet me where I am, so we could build together, but instead, I feel like I have to lead.\n\nHe keeps reassuring me that he\u2019s working towards financial stability, but I don\u2019t know how long I can wait. My biggest fear is that if I compromise too much now, I\u2019ll wake up in a few years feeling stuck in a life I didn\u2019t want, filled with resentment for everything I gave up.\n\nThe Fear of Resentment\n\nI know he loves me, and I love him. But I\u2019m scared that love won\u2019t be enough if I start to resent him for not being ready.\n\nI come from a culture where being single at 30 is looked down upon, which makes walking away even scarier. But I also don\u2019t want to rush into marriage, a small registry wedding, and a tiny apartment, just to find myself miserable.\n\nI don\u2019t want to start my marriage with regrets. I don\u2019t want to look back and feel like I settled for less than what I dreamed of.\n\nAt the same time, I fear that if I leave, I may never find someone who loves me this deeply again. Honestly some people wait their whole lives to find the type of love we have.\n\nWhat Do I Do?\n\nWould couples therapy help? Should I trust that things will get better, or is this my sign to leave before resentment kills the love we have?\n\nP.S. I\u2019ve always wanted a big family, and I\u2019m aware of my biological clock. I don\u2019t want to wait much longer to start having children, but I also don\u2019t want to enter marriage with doubts.",

This revelation shook me because she told me before that she never had any physical relation with this pqrticular ex and that's why she is still friends with him. She used to be friends with him in college and then dated for two months and broke up. After four months she went back to him to have casual sex. All these happened two years ago. \n\nThis ex has been since in her contact list and used to call her (video call) once every two months or so and I   found it bit strange to me at that time. I asked her why is she still in contact with him or why is he bothering you  she said he is just a frnd and we never was physical and he is calling to just talk about his ex or relationships he had or troubles etc...\n\nI feel like the ex is trying to use my gf for emotional intimacy and I told her about it. She doesn't agree with me. The recent revelation that two years ago before we met she went back to him to have casual sex shook me and I was angry for her to lie infront of me. She said she didn't reveal it because I was acting weird around the calls and thought that I would not understand that they are still frnds if she revealed about the physical part.\n\nI don't know what to do about this\n\n**TL;DR : in short what should I do if my ex told me not to worry about an ex because he used to be her friend and then they dated just for two months and had no physical relationship so keeping him around as a Friend shouldnt bother me at all, but recently reveals that after she ended her relationship with him she went back to him for casual sex.

        "title": "Did I Mess Up the Vibe of My Relationship? Feeling Distant After a Rough Night",
        "content": "So, I (21M) study in Australia and recently returned after a long break in my home country. One of the best parts about coming back was seeing my partner (21F) again. We originally met while staying in the same hostel last year, became close friends, and shared a deep spiritual connection. We\u2019re alike in so many ways\u2014even our birthdays are just a few days apart, born at the same time but AM and PM.\n\nFor most of our time knowing each other, we were just friends, but right before I left for home, our relationship transitioned into a more romantic sense. We had liked each other for a long time, but earlier on she held back because she noticed some immaturity in me, and I also didn\u2019t feel completely ready at the time. However, I worked on myself since then which allowed for things to click before I left, and when I returned, things between us felt incredible.\n\nShe works at a hotel, and I was staying there while looking for a long-term place to live. She would make me free pizzas, and the chemistry between us was electric. Every night after her shift, we\u2019d meet up, talk for hours, and of course, make out.\n\nOne night, she suggested we go to a different spot to lie down and watch the stars. I suggested a place, and she got her car ready. Here\u2019s where I think I might have messed things up\u2014I insisted on driving. I was jet-lagged, Exhausted from walking around all day inspecting places, and unfamiliar with driving in Australia. At first, she said she preferred to drive, but when I stepped away to grab something and returned to the car , she told me I should drive instead.\n\nFrom the moment we got on the road, I was all over the place\u2014turning the wrong way on a one-way street, forgetting to use my indicators, just overall reckless. When we got to the spot, we cuddled, but my energy was off\u2014I felt embarrassed about my driving and had a lot on my mind. She noticed and asked what was wrong, and I told her how I was feeling. The night still ended well, and this time, she drove us back.\n\nThe next day, though, things felt off. First, I had a disturbing dream that she died in the back of an ambulance, which shook me. Second, her energy felt different\u2014there wasn\u2019t tension, but it was nothing like the honeymoon phase we had been in just a day before. For the first time since I got back, we didn\u2019t meet after her shift.\n\nWe eventually talked about it, and I admitted that I shouldn\u2019t have driven, that my mind felt frantic and disconnected that night\u2014almost like how I used to be back when I was more so immature. She said she felt that, too, and it reminded her of how I was before. On top of that, she was also dealing with some issues at work during the same time, so I don\u2019t know if that played a role in the shift in energy. We ended the conversation on a good note, but the electricity wasn\u2019t the same.\n\nIt\u2019s now been a week since that night. I\u2019ve moved out of the hostel, and we haven\u2019t spoken at all. We both dislike texting and prefer to talk in person or call, and we\u2019re both busy with studies and work, but something just feels off. Even when I was back home, we\u2019d FaceTime for at least an hour two or three times a week.\n\nTL;DR\n\nHad an amazing reconnect with my partner after returning to Australia, but one night I insisted on driving while jet-lagged, drove poorly, and felt off. The next day, her energy shifted, and we haven\u2019t spoken in a week. Not sure if I messed up the vibe or if other factors (like her work stress) are at play.",

I honestly can\u2019t sit around for another year like this. I know what I should do, but I feel trapped, I have felt this way for years, while he is a terrible boyfriend half the time, we are so close, he is like a best friend to me, and my only friend, I don\u2019t even know how to say this to him anymore, why on earth does he not want to do anything with his gf? I have never seen a guy act like this\u2026like why am I not worthy to bring on a holiday? Or to go on a nice date with, or to literally just compliment? I feel like I\u2019m no more than a piece of shit. I really don\u2019t know what to do or how to do it, I just feel so trapped..I love him but there are so many needs of mine that are not being met and I feel as if he doesn\u2019t care, I really wish I knew why?!..\n\nI am now planning on going on holiday with my family, it will be my first time on a plane, but it has hit me harder planning this holiday, I should be doing these things with my bf and not having to depend on family or friends, I am so damn hurt \n\nTldr: \nI have been with my boyfriend 5 years, we have never done anything \u201ccouple worthy\u201d together, his brother started dating a girl and they are now going on holidays soon, when I told my bf we should be doing the same he said he is not bothered going anywhere this year.

I literally have no idea why, because she is the love of my life and I know deep down I don't feel that way. But sometimes when we are out with friends and I am having fun, something in me will switch up and all of a sudden she disgusts me. I feel evil saying this right now. But I will think everything she says is so cringe and I want to get as far away from her as possible. Never would I tell her that because the last thing I want to do is hurt her feelings. But what is so weird is that after maybe 10 minutes, I will be back to normal. I will go from laughing to wanting to break up to wanting to get married in the span of 30 minutes. It is so exhausting. I feel bad for thinking this way, and it doesn't ever seem like my girlfriend catches on when I feel like this. I am pretty good at hiding it because I know logically that I don't really hate her. It is just in that moment that I do. \n\nSomething weird about this is that it happens with every single person that I love. Even friends and family members. I could be having a normal conversation, then they mispronounce a word, and all of a sudden I think they are the worst person in the world. Sometimes the feeling gets so bad that I want to cry. \n\nOne time I was at a party with my girlfriend and I was having SUCH a fun time, then all of a sudden I was filled with such despair and anger with her (she didn't even do anything!!). I lied to her and said I needed to leave because my stomach hurt, and I immediately sobbed in my car and kept hitting myself in the head because I was so pissed. \n\nI feel SO dramatic and it is stupid haha. I really don't want to feel this way, because I know that it isn't a true representation of how I feel and I worry that it will negatively affect other people.\n\nWhy do I feel this way and what can i do to fix it?",

        "content": "I (26F) am currently preparing for my medical licensing exams so I can eventually work in the U.S. My husband (34M) and I are in a long-distance marriage of 2.5 years, he is in the USA while I am in Pakistan, and he supports me financially for now\u2014giving me a set monthly amount, along with covering some of my exam-related expenses. I\u2019m incredibly grateful for this, and I fully intend to work and contribute to our household once I start earning.\n\nHowever, what bothers me is that he has **joked multiple times** about quitting his job and letting me be the sole provider once I become a \"full-ass doctor.\" At first, I brushed it off as harmless humor, but he\u2019s said it enough times that I can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s some truth behind it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair because:\n\n1. **We have a 7-year age gap, and he\u2019s already financially stable.** I\u2019m just starting my career, and I need his support while I get there.\n2. **I have no issue contributing, but I don\u2019t want to be the only one working.** Life is expensive, and we plan on having kids in the future. It wouldn\u2019t make sense for just one of us to be the breadwinner.\n3. **He never sends my monthly pocket money on his own\u2014I always have to ask.** This makes me feel like I\u2019m begging every month, even though he agreed to support me.\n\nand one more thing that happened.\n\n  \nHe gives me a set amount of monthly pocket money ($300), which I always have to ask for\u2014he never sends it on his own. Last month, for our anniversary and Valentine\u2019s Day, he unexpectedly sent me an extra $500. I was really happy and grateful because I wasn\u2019t expecting anything, especially since he was away for Umrah at the time.\n\nHowever, this month, when I asked for my regular pocket money, he questioned where all the money went. I explained my expenses (medical costs, savings, and even lending some to my dad for his knee surgery), but the fact that I even had to justify it felt\u2026 off. In my mind, **a gift shouldn\u2019t come with follow-up questions.** It made me feel like I did something wrong, even though I didn\u2019t waste the money on anything unnecessary.\n\nI get that $800 is a lot, and he has every right to be concerned about finances. But at the same time, it\u2019s frustrating because:\n\n1. **The extra $500 was a gift**\u2014it wasn\u2019t part of my regular expenses, so I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to report back on it.\n2. **I already feel uncomfortable asking for money each month,** and this just made it worse.\n\nTL;DR I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overthinking this or if I should have a serious conversation with him about it. Is this something I should be worried about, or am I making a big deal out of nothing? ",

After talking a smooching for 3 hours I asked her if she wanted to my Gf and a big smile appeared on her face and she said yes all she wants to be is mine. I\u2019ve had 3 previous relationships and I\u2019ve never been comfortable to ask them to be in a relationship this fast not even close. I\u2019m extremely happy but at the same time I\u2019m wondering is this too fast? We are extremely similar and share a ton of common interests it was going so well I didn\u2019t see a reason to even consider another date before asking her out. After the sunset I drove her around and showed her my family homes then took her to her favourite spot to smoke and we just chilled there talking in the car for 3.5 hours before taking her home. \n\n**TL;DR**: asked this girl to be my gf within the first 3 hours of a date and she yes.

I sometimes take antihistamines to try to sleep but rx sleep pills? \n\nI seriously don\u2019t know what to do. My brain doesn\u2019t want to be near them or her when she takes them.

        "content": "Hi, I'm Alessandro, im a physics phd student in italy, I want to tell you my story because maybe it will make me feel better.\n\nI met my girlfriend in february 2022 just after covid period (i was a first year master student). I wasnt really looking for a relationship then, i really liked being alone and developing my hobbies (i have many: astronomy, physics, diy stuff, computers, videogames etc.). I never looked into girls because i never had the opportunity, I always found myself as a below average looking guy, not overweight but not super good looking.\n\nOne day my friends went out and there she was, Miriam, great girl, talked with her a bit but never thought much of. Fast forward some days I meet here again and ask for her number. Then we went on a few dates and got together on march 20th 2022.\n\nThen there was the best 2 years of my life, we are perfect together, we are both crazy, im on the more rational side and she was more on the emotional side. We grew together so well, we had first love together and travelled to 5 countries together.\n\nShe is the most amazing, sincere person I know, she never lied to me and she was always telling me the truth and (rightfully so) pretending the same from me. We had ups and downs but I always had the strength to take her back, but it never lasted more than a day or so.\n\nIn february 2023 I had to move for 3 months to barcelona for my master thesis, she visited me once and i visited back home once and we were incredibly connected throughout.\n\nFast forward october 2024 im now a second year phd student in physics, she finishes her bachelor and have to move to Rome for her master's. The beginning was a little difficult for her but we kept always in touch and when I came visit her in november it was amazing. She came back in december for the holidays and stayed until february 2025. It was perfect, nothing really.\n\nThen she had to finishe the exams and went back to Rome. For the tirst weeks she was super busy with the exams and could not talk to me much but then after the exams she was a little more opaque. Something changed thereafter and I dont know but I could feel it. We stayed in touch pretty frequently she told me \"i love you\" from time to time and it was a little weird but as usual. In the meantime I also had to move to Palma de Mallorca for work reason.\n\nI came back and then came to pick her up from the airport 3 days ago, she was weird. Then we want back to her home and she told me that in the last weeks she is not feeling chemistry between us anymore, she doesnt feel me as his boyfriend anaymore.\n\nI was shocked and I tried to talk to her the last days. She says that nothing has change that we are perfect rationally for each other but that she is just not in love anymore, she cannot do anything about it and she is leaving me for myself. I still love her a lot, maybe she can't accept that we both grew up and now love is more expressed in the tranquility and peace that is staying together. She tells me that she is not seeing anybody and that she probably wont for a long time as she still thinks that I'm the perfect guy for her in a rational way. She talked with friends and family and everybody is telling her that maybe this is not the right choice.\n\nWhat can I do now?\n\nTL;DR my girlfriend says that she doesnt love me anymore but that im rationally the perfect guy for her, she is the most sincere person in the world and I trust her with all my heart. She says that she doesn't feel the chemistry anymore after 5 months of long-distance although she only recently discovered in the last 2 weeks. She told me to move one but she also said that it's impossible for her to find somebody else that is not me.",

        "content": "TL;DR: I (25M) met a guy named Pogi (24M) on Grindr in January. Though I initially wanted something casual, we grew close, became exclusive sexually, and eventually started dating. Despite feeling secure and loved, I discovered Pogi was still active on Grindr, sending nudes and planning hookups just before I intended to ask him to be my official boyfriend. I ended things, and he's already back on Grindr. I'm heartbroken but know no contact is for the best.\n\nThis is a gay story. I (25M) met this guy (24M, named Pogi) on Grindr in January, and we have messaged every day since. I told him that I wasn't looking for a relationship because I had recently gotten out of one and just wanted casual fun. He accepted that, but the more we chatted, the more we both developed feelings for each other. We had sex numerous times in January, and it started feeling pretty intimate since we were going to dinners sometimes.\n\nEventually, we talked about being exclusive to each other as our one and only sexual partner since we were having unprotected sex. As I came over pretty often, I started getting friendly with his roommate. His roommate told me many dating stories about Pogi and how he had mistreated boys in the past. One example was when Pogi lied to\u00a0*boy1*, claiming he was sick, while he was actually making dinner to impress\u00a0*boy2*.\u00a0*Boy1*\u00a0came over to the apartment with Pogi's favorite food and caught him lying.\n\nAt that point, I should have known he wasn't a good person, but I wanted to believe he was different and had changed. Pogi made me feel very loved and secure. He made me a Spotify playlist and cooked amazing dinners for me. He introduced me to his friends and called me cute nicknames (he called me\u00a0*Pogi*\u00a0because that meant \"handsome\" in Tagalog, and I loved it). He always reminded me how excited he was to be my boyfriend and mentioned he would wait for me.\n\nIn February, I asked him to be my Valentine, and that's when we started dating. We made it clear that we were each other's only sexual and romantic partners at that point.\n\nLast week, that's when it all went wrong. We had a date planned on March 7th, and I was going to ask him to be my official boyfriend. But on March 6th, my gay friends saw that his Grindr profile was active. It hurt so much. My friend messaged him to see if it was real, and Pogi messaged back with his nudes \u2014 he even updated his profile with new ones. At that same time, Pogi messaged me, asking about my day and telling me he missed me. My heart completely shattered at that point.\n\nI didn't respond to him all night, and he kept messaging and calling me. But at the same time, he was getting ready to hook up with another guy. It just hurt so much that I couldn't sleep or eat that night. I remember driving to work the next morning, crying so much. On Friday afternoon, I ended things with Pogi and didn't respond to his questions or calls. Hours later, my friends told me he was back to being active on Grindr.\n\nMan, I wanted him to be my boyfriend so badly... I remember the nights when he said he was happy to be exclusive with me and wanted to be with me too. I miss him so much, but I know it's best if I leave things now.\n\nHow can someone switch up that quickly? If we were exclusively dating because we were having unprotected sex, why would he seek other sexual partners? Sometimes I wish he had waited one more day, and I could have asked him to be my boyfriend \u2014 and everything would have been fine.\n\nWe're on no contact right now, and I believe that's for the best. I miss my baby boy, but I'm sure he's happy out there being with other guys.",

Last year during Sept his father suffered heart attack after which he told me that we cannot continue this relationship as his father is against love marriage and he does not want to go against his father's words. But he told me that he would still try. On last friday we had a fight because he was going on an office trip for a night and I told him not to go as I was back in town and I wanted to spend some quality time with him. Ngl I was feeling super insecure and I didn't want him to go. I was already having a bad day due to work and everything piled up and then we had a huge argument because of that. He blocked me everywhere and I could not contact him at all. On sunday I went to meet him but could not contact him as I was blocked everywhere and told my sister to tell him that I was waiting for him to meet near his building. He called me and told me that he cannot continue this relationship and talked to me very rudely. He even told me that he will not marry me because of this behaviour and will marry the girl of his father's choice. I understand I messed up during our fight but then I tried to apologize.\n\nTLDR- He has not unblocked me since 3 days and I have not stopped blaming myself for that. I am crying continuously and idk what to do. I might not be perfect but I am not a bad person. I am trying to work on myself. It feels like I have lost everything.",

        "content": "We are in our 3rd month of our relationship. I don't if it's because we're still in our early stage but I am having a hard time with this jealousy of mine. Whenever someone is talking to her in which that guy has intentions and she replies, I am getting jealous because of it. She can't say that she has a partner because she is scared that it might reach to her parents and our relationship will be over. I can't say that she shouldn't talk to her admirers because it sounds toxic to me but it is ruining me mentally. In addition, there is this guy who has a crush on her and all of their friends are somewhat shipping them(?). She told me that the way the guy chats with her seems like it has no intention because that's also how he chats with others and she is still continuing the conversation because she thinks she'll be rude. I am not limiting her actions or anything. I am always communicating this jealousy of mine to her but sometimes I feel like I am being too much. I only get jealous to people who has intentions to her or rather overstepping their boundaries. What do i do to get rid of this jealousy?\n\nTL;DR I'm struggling with jealousy because my partner responds to guys who have intentions toward her. She can't admit we're together due to her parents, and it\u2019s mentally draining me.",

We have to move in together or else break up from the strain of distance and travel.\n\nMyself (F26) and my boyfriend (M32) have been together for 1.5 (coming up to 2) years. we live an hour and twenty minutes away via public transport and a 40-59 minute drive (he has a car however I don\u2019t).\n\nRecently things have been getting increasingly more difficult in our relationship. We feel disconnected from one another throughout the week as we only see each other on weekends. He also needs to spend a lot of his time on the computer making things and working on side projects, so on weekends where we do spend time together, there\u2019s often a fair bit of time he would like to spend on his computer with me near him hanging out. \n\n\nIn \u201ctypical female fashion\u201d, I enjoy talking deeply semi-frequently, or just discussing broad topics together, spending time doing something we both enjoy or find novel etc. however he likes us to spend our time watching shows, movies, scrolling, walking on the beach etc. All those things I enjoy very much, however they end up feeling mundane in excess. I\u2019m afraid I have high, unrealistic expectations of what an adult relationship looks like. He is more settled, and would happily spend most of our time on a level 3 exertion together, I however, crave more novelty and connection more often. When I mention that I crave more of this, he can pull away and become defensive. Although I try to frame it as a me and an us thing, I worry he feels I\u2019m attacking him and what he enjoys doing. \n\nThe big thing is, when we spend extended time together aka holidays or long weekends, I feel much more connected to him, happy and loved up. It\u2019s just when we\u2019re seperate that things become hard and uncertainty about the relationship enters my mind. He really wants us to move in together and believes it will fix all of our problems, however, I\u2019m nervous that if we\u2019re having these problems now, it will only get worse once we move in. Does anyone have any first hand experience or similar experiences to share? I feel as if I\u2019m stuck between moving in together a bit sooner than I\u2019d like or having this relationship end from strain of distance. ",

Some days ago I posted on r/relationship_advice as my boyfriend was pretty distant, and well, the day after this post, he asked me for some space (well, I asked if he wanted space for the 2nd time and he said somewhat yes)\n(you can see more Infos in this post, but to sum things up, we've been together for 2 years, and within these 2 years we broke up, but got back together after 4 months. I had codependency issues that I'm still working on, he has way less free time, and for like 2 weeks before he asked for space we were arguing for dumb things and well, he was acting off)\n\nHe said that he was asking himself a lot of questions, on our relationship but especially on himself, and that make him tired so he gets angry easily. And that he wasn't sure how long until he will have the answers. I think he's also kinda burned out. \nI asked him a few things, like \"rules\" for the break (I guess that's one) and he doesn't seem to want to talk to me, like at all. He prefers that I support him from afar. He said okay if I send him some cat reels but that's it.\n\nHe's an avoidant, so I guess this is related. But what can i do? Yes I give him space if he wants, but how long? I'm not really a big fan of the no contact thing either, I said that I needed some sort of connection but he didn't answer to that. But, he answered me pretty quickly (like, in less than a minute) when he was supposed to work, and afterwards he was online, then not, then online, then not etc... So idk, maybe he was checking for me. \nI guess I should let him text me first when he'll be ready, but how long do you thing it will last?\nThe weird thing is, when we were kinda arguing, he wasn't active on Instagram. Now he's online multiple times per day! \n\nIdk what to do exactly besides giving him space. Idk even know exactly if we're still together or not \ud83d\ude05\n\n- - - \n**TL;DR ;** : My boyfriend wants space but idk how to act exactly or if this means it's the end of our relationship.

        "title": "My (f30) DH (m35) is always annoyed with me after spending time with his mom",
        "content": "\nSo there\u2019s a lot of history to get through. We\u2019ve been together for 5 years, and aren\u2019t actually married, as neither of believe in marriage, but we\u2019re basically married just not legally. For starters, when we first started dating she was very accepting of me. We used to hang out and shop, but when things between us became serious, I (f39) began noticing little behaviors from his (m35) mom f(66) that honestly made me feel crazy. She used to always ask questions about our relationship and, I found out later, she\u2019d lie to me to get more information out of me. The first thing I noticed after getting serious was I was hanging out at his house with my kids (they aren\u2019t his), and it was really hot inside the house. It\u2019s important to note that the house is hers, but her 2 sons lived in it and paid rent. She\u2019d come and go as she pleased without communicating with either of them, which personally I wouldn\u2019t have been okay with had it been my mom, but I wasn\u2019t going to force him to set boundaries. So anyway, it was hot, and I asked my DH, boyfriend at the time, if he could turn the air on. Not 20 minutes later, she showed up, gave me a pointed look, and then turned the AC unit OFF. Leaving us to sweat our behinds off in the middle of summer. I thought it was weird, but never said anything. Then, I mentioned in passing I had planned on cleaning his room up some while he was away working (he travels a lot). Next thing I know, I was visiting with him and his mom had been there for a little while already. She waited until I got into the house to mention, directly to me, that she cleaned his room up for him. He wouldn\u2019t even look at me when she said that. I just said oh, okay, and kept moving. We eventually moved in together, me my 2 kids and him, and that was an ordeal as well. She showed up with her truck to help me move my stuff into storage as we were still looking for a house, and tried to get him to agree to buy a house WITH HER, while we were preparing to move in together. That was what really made me realize this woman did not like me. On more than one occasion, she pressed him to buy a house with her and when he finally told her no, she looked like she was in physical pain. Also important to note that she also tried to insist that me and my 2 kids move into her house that she comes and goes from as she wishes. I shut that down immediately. Anytime my kids are around her, she will try to exert control over situations. For example, it was my 30th birthday and my kids were badgering me for snacks without having eaten dinner, so I told them to speak with DH because he and I are on the same page with that. No junk until you\u2019ve eaten a solid dinner. She immediately shot up and told them I\u2019ll grab you some chips. When I said no she went straight to DH and of course, got her way. He had no idea of what transpired beforehand so I cut him a little slack, but she pulls stuff like that with my kids often. When we moved into our house, she tried one time to show up unannounced, despite her knowing I would not appreciate it, and he and I were still in the bed. He didn\u2019t set a boundary, and I had to. She hasn\u2019t come to our house to visit outside of events since then. We can\u2019t have dogs in our house, but she showed up with hers expecting it to be okay. I had to shut that down as well. And now I just grey-rock her anytime I have to be around her. DH and I have had plenty of talks, and he does get where I\u2019m coming from. Especially about my kids. Cause seriously, I\u2019ve got into it with my own mother about stepping on my toes as a parent, no way in hell am I letting some woman who clearly doesn\u2019t like me try to override me as a parent, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s his mom or not. He decided it was best for him to maintain his relationship with her, but was okay with distancing our family from her. So he still talks to her, but we aren\u2019t as involved. On birthdays, she takes up all of his attention and he doesn\u2019t pay any mind to what is going on. She went over my head and gave my daughter a kitchen set, which she knew I was getting, and gave it to her when I wasn\u2019t around, on the birthday. I could really go on and on, but the most recent venture, she asked if she could drop off a bike for my oldest. She proceeded to hang out with the little one in her bedroom, which I will admit isn\u2019t pristinely clean. I\u2019ll find little snacks she\u2019s stashed away and forgotten about in there and she plays crazy. I work full time and I\u2019m in school and he travels for work so no, her room isn\u2019t spotless all the time. The next thing I know, me and DH are arguing about how dirty the room is. I can\u2019t prove it, but I\u2019m almost positive she had something to say because he\u2019d been home for about a week at that point and hadn\u2019t said anything about it. So I\u2019m at a point where I just don\u2019t want her around me or my kids at all, but don\u2019t know how rational that is, or how to bring it up. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve talked about his mom, and she wasn\u2019t invited to my oldests birthday party recently. So he\u2019s kept her at a distance, but it still feels like she\u2019s trying to cause problems. He sees my perspective but his mom is a perpetual victim and he refuses to bring any of this up to her. He also shares a bank account with her that I\u2019ve expressed multiple times I\u2019m uncomfortable with and nothing has changed. How should I approach this? It\u2019s like even with the distance she still finds a way to cause problems. And I know it\u2019s more a problem with him and his refusal to have the conversation than it is with her. What do I do?\n\nI\u2019ve noticed a pattern of behavior from him where every time he\u2019s spent any kind of time around his mom or spoken to her about something, he seems annoyed with ME like it\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s mostly pertaining to household chores or finances. Like if the house isn\u2019t perfectly cleaned I should be doing more. We share a car as he has a work vehicle and my kids shoes, blankets, and jackets often find a home in the floorboard. I do clean it all out eventually but I\u2019m always on the go and don\u2019t have time to make sure everything is perfect. As I mentioned I have 2 kids, full time job, and I\u2019m in school. The fact that I\u2019m doing as well as I am is a miracle and I\u2019m proud of it. I stand my ground on these issues and make it a point to tell him if he wants these things done on his timeline then he should just do them. I don\u2019t get much argument after that. But it\u2019s every time they spend time together. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever admit she\u2019s saying anything negatively about me so I don\u2019t ask. But I\u2019m also a registered behavior analyst and a good one at that. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy, I just know it would sound that way if I ever expressed that suspicion out loud as I have no evidence other than the little arguments we get into. \n\nTL;DR: I\u2019ve gone very low contact with his mom but he still maintains a relationship with her and because of this she finds ways to weasel into our relationship. I feel resentful that we argue over stuff we don\u2019t usually argue over after he\u2019s been around her, especially because he refuses to have a convo with her about boundaries. It feels like he prioritizes her well-being over mine and lets her influence his thoughts and decisions within our relationship. ",

I don't experience same-sex flirting situations that often however I'm open to it and 2. well she's married. Long story short, in a week we texted a lot and I grew so attached to her, also by the way she said how special it was, this bond between me and her and she never experienced something like this etc.\nI can be a huge overthinker which is not always helpful but sometimes it is (f.e. in situations like this \ud83d\ude43) but she said I just needed to feel more in my body and not in my head anymore, so I did just that and that didn't end up well.\n\nBut then something really tragic happened in her life and our contact went from 100 to 1 basically and even though I understand, I was almost completely heart broken, because of the sudden switch in contact, also knowing she has someone that takes care of her etc. in my head, I wanted to be that person even though it sounds completely illogical after just one week basically \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut know I'm waking up to it all. I don't believe she's a bad person at all, however I do think I got caught up and carried away by this connection, I mean the fact that I reacted so strongly etc towards it, the fact that I was being told not to think so much, whilest it was basically me feeling uncomfortable and didn't want to do anything, that she said that she always was a thrill seeking person..\n\nIt all seems not that serious to me but I thought it was, also she posted something on social media yesterday whilest ignoring my text but I'm just rationalizing it all away with 'you know she's going to a hard time' blabla\n\nThis is so stupid\n\nWhat are you thoughts about this? Should I 'wait' for her to come out of this period of her life and then just continue with this or?\n\nTL;DR; I think I might got sucked into a situation I didn't want to be in because I'm monogamous myself and thought it was serious but now think it's not but I'm attached",

Fast-forward to now I have seen her a total of probably 2 times in 3 months and have barely been able to even hold a conversation with her because of how busy she is, even at school during breaks she studies.

        "title": "The Wake-Up Call That Changed How I Speak (M27)",
        "content": "*(M27)(F26)Relationships are fragile. One wrong word, one heated reaction, one moment of frustration unchecked can crack the foundation you\u2019ve worked so hard to build. I learned this the hard way, and I\u2019m sharing my story in the hope that you\u2019ll pause, reflect, and consider how you communicate with the people you love most: your partner, your friends, your family.*\n\nI used to think I was a decent communicator. Not the clearest, sure, but with enough charm to carry a conversation through any storm. I\u2019d talk my way out of awkward moments, smooth my way through disagreements, and always assumed my intentions, rooted in love, would shine through. But here\u2019s the harsh truth I had to face:\u00a0**it\u2019s not your intentions that matter, it\u2019s your reactions and words.**\n\nSomeone I deeply love sat me down and shattered my reality. They pointed out something I\u2019d been blind to: my reactions, fuelled by frustration and unfiltered thoughts, were pushing people away. I wasn\u2019t screaming or getting aggressive, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I was reacting in ways that made others feel unheard, dismissed, or attacked. And that was enough to put at risk the relationships I valued most.\n\nThis moment was like a slap in the face, but it was the wake-up call I needed.\n\nI\u2019d always prided myself on being self-aware, on surrounding myself with ideas about personal growth, on striving to be better. Yet somehow, I\u2019d missed this strong flaw: I wasn\u2019t a good communicator. And communication shapes every relationship in your life, from how you respond to your mom\u2019s words, to how you listen to what your friends are really saying, to how you handle a big fight with your partner.\n\n**Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned:**\u00a0you\u2019re always one step away from either starting a fight or building a bridge. The difference lies in how you choose to communicate. Do you react out of frustration, letting anger or impatience take the wheel? Or do you replace that frustration with curiosity, asking questions and listening, even when it\u2019s hard?\n\nFor me, this realisation has sparked a journey of self-improvement, one I\u2019m still on. I\u2019ve reflected on my habits and started practicing new ways of communicating. And now, I want to share some of that with you, because I don\u2019t want you to wake up one day and realize you\u2019ve lost the people you love most, all because you didn\u2019t watch your language.\n\n**Lessons I\u2019ve Learned to Communicate Better**\n\nHere are the key lessons I\u2019ve picked up along the way, practical steps you can start using today to strengthen your relationships instead of harming them.\n\n***The Power of Curiosity Instead of Anger***\n\nOne of the biggest changes I\u2019ve made is learning to replace anger with curiosity. When someone says something that frustrates me, my instinct is to snap back or shut down. But now, I try to ask myself: \u201cWhy are they saying this? What\u2019s their view?\u201d This simple mental switch keeps me calm and opens up the conversation instead of closing it down.\n\nCuriosity isn\u2019t just about staying calm, it\u2019s about asking the right, thoughtful questions. This requires placing yourself in the other person\u2019s world and thinking about what might help guide their thought process. For example, instead of saying \u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d try asking \u201cCan you help me understand why this feels so important to you?\u201d Questions like these show you\u2019re trying to see their side, and they often lead to better, more useful conversations.\n\n***The Importance of Listening, Really Listening***\n\nAnother lesson: listening is more powerful than speaking. I used to think being a good communicator meant having the right words, but it\u2019s really about showing the other person you hear them. Nodding, saying \u201cI hear you,\u201d or even repeating back what they\u2019ve said in your own words can make them feel valued, even if you don\u2019t agree.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: if you truly listen to someone else\u2019s view, you need to put your story on hold until you\u2019ve heard theirs. While they\u2019re speaking, your job isn\u2019t to prepare your own defense or gather proof in your mind about why they\u2019re wrong. Instead, focus on understanding their version of events. And when you do get a chance to speak, it\u2019s worth admitting that you\u2019re sharing your story, not the absolute truth of the story. If you can accept that the other person has a valid version of events, you can listen to understand rather than to argue.\n\n***The Need for Clarity***\n\nHere\u2019s something I wish I\u2019d realized sooner: just because you think you\u2019ve been clear in your communication doesn\u2019t mean the other person understood you. It costs nothing to check for clarity, but it can cost a lot if you don\u2019t. Misunderstandings can spiral into arguments, bitterness, or even lost relationships. So take a moment to ask: \u201cDid I explain that clearly?\u201d or \u201cDoes that make sense to you?\u201d This small step can save you a world of trouble.\n\n***Slow Down When You Feel Hurt***\n\nAnother big lesson I\u2019ve learned is the importance of slowing down when I feel hurt. When someone says or does something that stings, my first instinct is to react fast, often with frustration or anger. But I\u2019ve found that taking a moment to breathe, to count to three in my head, helps me respond thoughtfully instead of lashing out. This pause doesn\u2019t fix the hurt, but it stops me from making things worse. It\u2019s like giving yourself a buffer between feeling hurt and choosing how to act, and it can save your relationships from unnecessary damage.\n\n***Focus on What\u2019s Needed, Not on Trading Views***\n\nOne of my biggest findings is that I should focus on what\u2019s needed in a conversation rather than wasting energy on trading views. This shift has a huge effect on how you shape relationships. It\u2019s not you and me against each other, it\u2019s you and me against the problem. When I stopped seeing conversations as battles to win, I started seeing them as chances to solve problems together. This mindset makes all the difference.\n\n***Forget the \u201cYou\u201d and Focus on the \u201cI\u201d***\n\nIt\u2019s also important to forget about the \u201cyou\u201d and focus on the \u201cI.\u201d Sharing your feelings is likely to have a more positive impact than unloading opinions. To communicate your feelings, you need to pause for a second and figure out what they are. Remember: having your feelings is very different from becoming your feelings. I wasn\u2019t making this distinction, I was more likely to lash out verbally because I was feeling frustrated. But now, I\u2019ve learned to recognize my feelings and still engage in a helpful conversation. For example, instead of saying \u201cYou\u2019re so annoying,\u201d I might say \u201cI feel frustrated when this happens.\u201d This small change keeps the conversation useful instead of harmful.\n\n**A Final Thought**\n\nYou can\u2019t take your relationships for granted. Every interaction is a chance to either strengthen those bonds or weaken them. I\u2019ve lost people I love because I didn\u2019t see this sooner, and I don\u2019t want that to happen to you. So watch your language. Choose curiosity instead of anger. Listen more than you speak. And remember: communication isn\u2019t just about what you say, it\u2019s about how you make others feel.\n\n  \nTL;DR, I realized my reactions were hurting my relationships even with good intentions. A wake-up call taught me to slow down when hurt, listen with curiosity, ask questions, focus on solutions not arguments, and share feelings with \u201cI\u201d statements. Better communication saved my bonds, and these steps can help you too.\n\n",

The first two months we crashed at my husband\u2019s place with his family.\n\nWe both split the mortgage and bills and I have savings. I earn more than my husband and help out extra where I can. Over the last few months, I have set aside a few hundred to spend on the house and cut out any extra spending on myself.\n\nMy car broke down 4 months ago and for the last 8 years, I\u2019ve driven a car worth 2-3K. Ive never really spent my savings or money on a big purchase apart from the house deposit and I still had a decent bit left over. The car I have brought was 8k. Im not sure if I am being controlled but my husband was very against me spending that much on car and when I explained that it was fine as I still has savings left over, he still was against it. I tried explaining that I\u2019ve never really spent much money on myself, but this made things worse as he thought I was spending for the sake of it. My family are very supportive of my decisions. \n\nNow he has also told his family, who are now very against the purchase and are upset I have spent that much money on a car. I am really shocked, as they are telling me to try and return the car and that I could have found a cheaper alternative. Yesterday I visited my in laws and brother in law gave me a lecture before I even brought up the topic, so he has been discussing this topic behind my back.\n\nI\u2019ve never had anyone be so against my decision making without a valid reason and Im not sure why I need to justify myself to my husband and his family. I thought my marriage was fine but I feel like my husband and his family are ganging up on me. How do I address this?\n\nTldr: Husband and his family are against my purchases",

Me and him grew pretty close over the years, and eventually I began to grow feelings for him about 6~ months ago. \n\nI finally confessed and he admitted he liked me as well, so we began to pursue something more romantic. \n\nWell we were talking about boundaries and such and the topic of female friends came up. I\u2019ve been friends with him for years but I never really knew how he interacted with his other friends or their dynamic. \n\nI\u2019m okay with my partner having opposite sex friends, but honestly I do feel uncomfortable with one-on-one hangouts. I\u2019ve been cheated on by so many exes and he knows this and I just feel so uncomfortable with the idea of them hanging out on their own. Even if it\u2019s in public. \n\nI REALLY like him though and the feelings I have for him are different than what I\u2019ve felt for others due to the fact I\u2019ve known him as a friend for so long. I guess part of me also gets scared he\u2019ll end up liking them as well since we started as friends. Or just something happening. I don\u2019t know. \n\nI don\u2019t want to call quits just yet if there\u2019s something we both can do to compromise and make it less stressful, like keeping hangouts public and me meeting them just so I can get a vibe of the person? I don\u2019t know. \n\nI already mentioned how uncomfortable it was and he said he really values time with his friends and wouldn\u2019t really be comfortable switching to massive group hangouts instead. So I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this and can give input? :( Thank you\n\n\n**TLDR**; Fell for my friend of 5 years and we began talking romantically. Topic of friends came up and he says he\u2019d like to be able to still hang out with his girl friends 1 on 1, and didn\u2019t wanna switch to group-only hangouts. I\u2019m super uncomfortable and have trauma from being cheated on by exes so I have no idea what to do if I CAN even do anything aside from leaving. ",

        "content": "TL;DR: Artist partner has never contributed towards our rent, but now we're living above our means because he requires a 2 bedroom instead of 1.\n\nFor context, my partner is a visual artist and I am currently a PhD student. We live in the UK, and I moved here from the US to get an MA almost 4 years ago. He and I have been together for 3 years, living together for 2. The whole entire time we have been living together, I have been paying all of the rent, all of the bills, all of the food. He works full time on his art, and he spends on average 18 hours per day in his studio, so I have no doubt he works hard. He also comes from an extremely poor background and knows how to live dirt cheap, so he doesn't take any money that isn't his. In terms of his own income, he gets by any way he can (selling off his items, at one point he was doing some painting and decorating work but stopped because it was cutting away some of his time in the studio). I was not necessarily 'supporting him' before we moved outside of London (I would have paid the same exact amount for my lifestyle if he wasn't living with me), but now that we have moved for me to get a PhD, I'm paying the full rent for a 2 bedroom that we only need because one of those bedrooms is his home studio.\n\n  \nMy PhD stipend is not much. It is just enough to cover our rent and bills. I quit my full time job (completely unrelated to my subject of study, I was just trying to survive in London) to pursue this degree, so I don't really have a stable source outside of the stipend. Also, taking on even part time work would likely be draining for me, as the PhD is already draining enough as it is. I am going to talk to him about this, but in the past when I have raised these issues, he's just asked for me to go to my parents for money. I come from a very wealthy family, but I have been financially independent ever since finishing my master's degree, and I intend to keep it that way.\n\n  \nIs it fair to ask my family to support my cost of living though if he is perfectly capable of getting part time work to at least contribute to some of the rent? If we were to get a 1 bedroom where we live, I would be perfectly capable of handling rent and bills, but because of his studio, we need a 2 bedroom. When we first moved here, he said he could only move if we had a 2 bed, and he would split the difference for what I would have paid for a 1 bed. It's been 6 months now though, and he hasn't contributed at all.",
